<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ O.J. Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million
judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the
families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded
to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This foundation is not about Mr. Simpson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal
``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held
responsible for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his
fundamental right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in America, justice is supposed to be fair and it's
supposed to be blind,'' Simpson told reporters, ``and public
opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count. You're
supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in
the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings
would say it was legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his
income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge
judgment. For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a
paid interview to a German television station and asked the station
to pay the money to a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to chase him and file suit against those he
fraudulently conveys money to,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, a civil jury found Simpson liable for the
stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. The
appeal, filed 17 months after that verdict, could take months or
even years to resolve. In 1995, a criminal jury acquitted Simpson
of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the
2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil
trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary
rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   The former football star's attorneys said the judge should have
excluded evidence that Simpson had a history of violence against
his former wife. They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their
efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles
Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The brief criticizes the inclusion of several civil trial
witnesses, including a veterinary clinic worker who claims she saw
the couple fight over a fur coat, and a former security guard who
testified Simpson smashed a windshield and dented a Mercedes-Benz
coupe with a baseball bat in a jealous rage.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gelblum, one of the Goldmans' attorneys, predicted the
appeal wouldn't have much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same issues we litigated twice already in the trial
court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a batterer, always a batterer,'' he said. ``He was liable
for murdering Nicole and Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldmans' attorneys said they will continue to pursue
Simpson's assets. Later this year they plan to auction off his
Heisman Trophy, Gelblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Nathanial Friedman, who successfully sued
Charles Manson on behalf of the family of one of Manson's victims,
called Simpson's appeal ``an absolutely outrageous abuse of the
taxpayer-supported court system of California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His guilt is so self-evident that any reasonable person says
he would have emigrated to Brazil or Mozambique or some other place
if he had the slightest shred of decency,'' Friedman said.

DODGERS ACQUIRE BOHANON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He doesn't have a well-known nickname like the
``Big Unit'' nor is he well known. But for the time being, the
Dodgers hope Brian Bohanon can fill a void in their starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Greg McMichael's short stay with the Dodgers came
to an end Friday when he was traded back to the New York Mets for
the left-handed Bohanon. The Dodgers also reinstated right-handed
reliever Darren Hall from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was 2-4 with a 3.15 ERA in 25 games for the Mets this
season. However, the Dodgers' new and possibly temporary fifth
starter has made just four starts this season and is 1-1 with a
3.00 ERA in those games. The 29-year-old is 20-23 in parts of nine
major-league seasons with Texas, Detroit, Toronto and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said Bohanon is expected to be at
Dodger Stadium today and pitch against the Padres on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good trade for both teams,'' said Hoffman, who spoke to
Bohanon on the phone. ``We're getting a left-hander who has done
some starting.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade was the second in the last seven days for Dodgers
interim general manager Tommy Lasorda, who sent
infielder/outfielder Paul Konerko and pitcher Dennis Reyes to
Cincinnati for All-Star closer Jeff Shaw on July 4. And for the
second straight day, Lasorda strongly denied any talks with Seattle
about ace Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked with a few guys about Bohanon and they say he is the
type of guy who gets batters out,'' Lasorda said. ``I also talked
to a couple of guys who played with him and they said the guy is a
pretty good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon's spot as the Dodgers' fifth starter may not be etched
in stone. There is speculation the Dodgers are interested in
sending infielder Wilton Guerrero, who asked for a trade earlier
this season, for either Montreal left-hander Carlos Perez or
Cincinnati left-hander Mike Remlinger, both starters. Several other
teams are interested in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael and pitcher Dave Mlicki were traded to the Dodgers
from the Mets for pitchers Hideo Nomo and Brad Clontz on June 4. In
12 games with the Dodgers, McMichael was 0-1 with one save and a
4.40 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fox people are going to turn (the Dodgers) around,'' said
McMichael, who is a good friend of Bohanon's. ``This is going to be
a real good team for years to come. I'm disappointed because I saw
that things were starting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange. I should ask (the Mets) for a raise for mental
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was 0-1 with a 12.00 ERA in two relief appearances this
season before being placed on the DL on April 8 to rehabilitate a
right rotator cuff tear. Either infielder Alex Cora or third
baseman Adrian Beltre will be demoted when Bohanon arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's willing: If Lasorda's interim label never becomes
permanent, Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart could emerge as a
candidate to be general manager. The four-time 20-game winner, who
pitched for the Dodgers from 1981-83, is in his first season as San
Diego's pitching coach after serving a year as assistant to Padres
general manager Kevin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stewart said he's ready for the challenge, the
African-American hasn't forgotten that there are no minority
general managers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the game is what it is,'' Stewart said.
``I've had a lot of ups and downs and you just ride it out and
eventually something will happen. In this world, think about it.
How many things surprise you about how minorities are dealt with?''

SHAW LIKES TO PROVE THEM WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Shaw is doomed to failure. He might never
earn another save. What worked in Cincinnati won't cut it in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He hated to leave his hometown, the charmingly named Washington
Court House, Ohio, after being traded last weekend? Well, he might
as well go back, for all the good he'll do here.
</P>
<P>
   I say these things because I like Jeff Shaw _ having known him
since 5:30 p.m. Friday _ and I want to help.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing that seems to help the Dodgers' new bullpen
ace more than anything else is hearing somebody say he can't do
something.
</P>
<P>
   One spring day in 1992, Cleveland Indians manager Mike Hargrove
sent Shaw back to the minor leagues and was kind enough to tell him
exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was tired of seeing the same mistakes over and
over again, and he told me I didn't have the ability to pitch in
the big leagues,'' Shaw recalled before the Dodgers' game against
the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw set out _ he went from Cleveland to the Montreal Expos to
the Chicago White Sox and then Cincinnati Reds _ to prove Hargrove
wrong. And after leading the National League in bullpen ``holds''
(22) in 1996 and saves (42) in '97, he can declare, ``I think I've
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, perhaps embarrassed by his misjudgment, denies making
the remark that Shaw remembers so vividly. The two men talked and
buried the hatchet last month after a Reds-Indians game in which
Shaw recorded his 17th save of the season and lowered his ERA to
1.03.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes, `I don't remember saying it, but if I did, I
apologize,''' Shaw said. ``I said, `Well, that's something that's
driven me for the last (eight) years.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the inspiration, Grover.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it hasn't been that simple. Along the way, there were
others to prove wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One spring day in '96, Reds closer Jeff Brantley went on the
disabled list and manager Ray Knight passed over Shaw to give the
temporary job to young Marcus Moore. Shaw assumed he was in
Knight's doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   At Brantley's behest, Shaw asked for a meeting with the manager,
and it lasted so long he was fined in kangaroo court for missing
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   But that night, Shaw was given a chance to earn his first Reds
save and he came through with three perfect innings against the
Dodgers. Though Brantley healed and got his job back, when he was
injured again and lost for the season in May '97, Shaw became the
closer for good.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it hasn't been that simple. Even then, as a
31-year-old with 12 years in pro baseball, Shaw had to prove people
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `You've never closed before, can you handle the
pressure?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for an answer? He led the league in saves as well as
save opportunities (49) and saves percentage (85.7) last year. And
he was third in the league in saves (23) when the trade went down
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw won't intimidate anybody with his appearance. He's the size
(6-foot-2, 200 pounds) of a one-time three-sport star, and he
cracked a career-high 97 mph on the radar gun in his one-inning
All-Star Game appearance Tuesday. But his easy-going manner that
doesn't fit the ``closer'' template.
</P>
<P>
   Shake the hand the Dodgers hope will throw their next
championship-clinching strike, and he looks you square in the eye,
saying sure, he's got time for an interview, right after he takes
time for this other interview.
</P>
<P>
   His son Travis, 8, is with him at the park and fetches Dad a
soda while we talk. His wife Julie and their other child, Molli, 3,
are spending the next few weeks with him in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think closers get that label, that you've got to be a wild
man,'' Shaw said. ``I'm not that type of person. I'm actually a
nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he disliked leaving the Reds, from whom he accepted a
below-market $2.8 million for three years to stay close to home,
being traded to the Dodgers had its plusses. Shaw was a Dodgers fan
growing up in the aura of the Big Red Machine. His ``A student''
tickets were always for Dodgers games.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the current Dodgers return the affection? With less
than unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers players were quoted wondering if the front office traded
away too much potential, in infielder Paul Konerko and left-hander
Dennis Reyes, to get Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as much as ever, there are people to prove wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they liked those guys (Konerko and Reyes), and they
don't know me from Adam,'' Shaw said of his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they get to know me and realize what kind of person I am
and what kind of driving force I have inside me, everybody's going
to have their opinion. But no comments are going to bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Shaw, they'll only help him. &QL;

MARTINEZ, RED SOX FALL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For the second night in a row, Red Sox fans were
left to wonder how these Orioles possibly could be closer to last
place than first in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis, one of seven current or former All-Stars who faced
Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez Friday night, hit a two-out home run in
the eighth inning, breaking a 2-2 tie and lifting the Orioles to
their second straight 3-2 decision over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a team you want to be playing going down the
stretch,'' said Mo Vaughn, well aware that the Red Sox close the
season with four games at Fenway Park against the Orioles.
``Winning ain't going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of guys with rings out there, a lot of
'em,'' said Vaughn, whose home run leading off the seventh had tied
the score at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allowed the Orioles just five hits in eight innings,
but two were home runs. Mike Bordick homered in the third and Davis
jumped on a hanging 1-and-0 curveball and hit it over the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad I couldn't give up a double, or even a triple there,''
said Martinez, a loser for the first time in more than a month
(June 5), his record dropping to 11-3. ``Home run, I have to
swallow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Orosco, the 40-year-old lefthanded reliever, who was on
the mound in Shea Stadium when the Mets won Game 7 of the '86
Series, retired Vaughn on a tapper and struck out Troy O'Leary
without O'Leary lifting the bat off his shoulder for the first two
outs of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller, playing the percentages, brought in
closer Armando Benitez to face John Valentin, who had two of
Boston's seven hits. Valentin fouled off several pitches, then
chased a 2-and-2 slider to strike out, as a sellout crowd of 48,043
in Camden Yards roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shot to win the ballgame, put the best pitcher you have
there, and Armando came through,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who entered the All-Star break having won five of
their last six and eight of 10, have lost their first two since
resuming play.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was in the game only because the Orioles' starting DH,
Harold Baines, who had singled and scored Baltimore's second run,
came out of the game with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of pride over here,'' said Davis, who hasn't
played in the outfield since being hit in the right elbow by a
pitch from the Mets' Rick Reed June 24. ``A lot of people haven't
been giving us a lot of credit, talking about how we haven't been
emotional enough, but that's the makeup of this ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never quit, our manager is not quitting, and nobody in the
clubhouse is going to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, working with seven days' rest, having skipped
Tuesday's All-Star Game, was no worse for the layoff, throwing only
104 pitches in eight innings. But he was matched pitch for pitch by
Orioles rookie Sidney Ponson, who took a 2-1 lead into the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But just when plans were being made to declare a national
holiday in Aruba for Ponson, the third native son of the island to
play in the big leagues, Vaughn squared matters in the seventh by
driving a ball into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Vaughn's first since June 20, his 22d of the
season, and 12th home run of his career in Oriole Park at Camden
Yards. Except for Vaughn's homer, the Red Sox managed just six
singles against Ponson and three relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to start hitting,'' Vaughn said. ``We will. A couple
days away, our timing's off. We got to get our feet on the ground.
We will.''
</P>
<P>
   In 12 of his 18 starts before Friday night, Martinez had allowed
two runs or fewer, including his last four before the All-Star
break, in which he allowed one run three times and shut out the
Montreal Expos for six innings in his last outing. In those 12
starts, Martinez's earned run average was 0.90.
</P>
<P>
   But the two homers he allowed Friday night made it a yield of 18
this season, two more than all of last season. Twelve of those
homers came in a span of four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balls they hit out, they hit out,'' Martinez said. ``I
don't have any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're facing better power hitters in this league. You can't
pitch around one batter to get to another, because they're all good
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here in Baltimore. Maybe especially here in Baltimore,
despite the 40-50 record, 13 1/2 games behind the Red Sox in the
wild-card hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're out of it,'' Martinez said. ``I think if
they try, they can get back in the race. But it's amazing to see a
team like that and they're not in first or second place.''

RIPKEN HARDLY MEEK ON STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ If it makes you feel any better, Cal Ripken missed a
few days of school when he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't one of those perfect attendance guys,'' Ripken said
before playing in consecutive game No. 2,568 Friday night, a 3-2
win over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   His streak goes back to 1982 and it helped save baseball in the
dark summer of 1995. In an age of spoiled athletes who take the
money and lie down on the job, Ripken carries the work ethic of the
fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, now that the Orioles stink, the streak has become the
embodiment of everything that's wrong in Baltimore. Brooks Robinson
believes the streak is a mistake. Bob Costas says everybody can use
a day off. A Baltimore columnist wrote that the streak has become
more important than winning.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken and the Orioles have become prisoners of the streak.
There are fans and writers in Baltimore who think that Ray Miller
replaced Davey Johnson as manager because Johnson was not afraid to
end the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me,'' Ripken said before Friday night's game
against the Red Sox. ``At a low point or a frustrating point, I
wonder, `Why do I have to sit here and actually defend the desire
to go out and play?' I think it should be the people that don't
want to play that should have to defend their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the streak the reason why we're losing? Is the streak the
reason why we won last year? The answer to both is no. It kind of
makes me laugh a little bit the way it is brought up. The issue
should be performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller won't admit to any pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes for him to sit down, he'll do it himself,
or I'll do it,'' said the manager. ``If I thought he was hurt to
the point where he couldn't help us, I'd sit him down. He was
probably one day away from taking himself out last year with his
back. Probably it'll be an injury or retirement. I wish I had 24
other guys with a two-week streak. We'd be in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, 38 next month, won't answer hypotheticals about how the
streak might end, but it's hard to imagine Miller, or any manager,
putting Ripken on the bench without the star's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak, like everything else, will take care of itself,''
Ripken said. ``If something happens, it happens. It could end with
an injury. It could end in many different ways. When it presents
itself, who knows? How am I supposed to know how it will end?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Palmer says it's not a matter of giving Ripken a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't do anyone much good,'' said the Hall of Fame hurler
who teamed with Ripken to win a World Series in 1983. ``It's more a
matter of looking at your lineup on a given day, and seeing if you
might have a lefthanded-hitting third baseman who has a better
chance against a hard-throwing righty that day. But this team
doesn't really have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's backup is Jeff Reboulet. Reboulet bats right and is
hitting .278 with no homers and three RBIs. Ripken entered Friday
night's game hitting .258 with seven homers and 37 RBIs, numbers
almost identical to those of Boston third baseman, John Valentin
(.263, 11, 37) who is 31 and just signed a four-year contract.
Ripken has three errors to Valentin's 12. Ripken delivered the
game-winning, two-out, two-strike single against the Red Sox
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to play every day, you have to be worthy,'' said
Ripken. ``If at some point, you're not worthy, it ends. But so far
it hasn't. When I no longer deserve to be the every-day third
baseman, it'll end.
</P>
<P>

RANGERS EDGE ATHLETICS, 1-0, ON BASES-LOADED WALK IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Rangers pitcher Rick Helling and Oakland's Tom
Candiotti waged a brilliant scoreless pitching duel for eight
innings last night.
</P>
<P>
   But when the managers had to go to the bullpen in the ninth
inning, Rangers manager Johnny Oates was able to call on All-Star
closer John Wetteland while Athletics manager Art Howe had to
settle for Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers beat Taylor for the second consecutive day when
Kevin Elster drew a bases-loaded walk in the ninth inning to give
the Rangers a 1-0 victory at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland saved it in the ninth for Helling, who raised his
record to 12-4 and lowered his earned-run average to 4.12.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark started the Rangers' winning rally with a single to
right and went to third on Juan Gonzalez's double into the
right-field corner. Luis Alicea ran for Clark and Rusty Greer was
intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor almost got out of the inning. With the infield in, Ivan
Rodriguez forced Alicea at home with a grounder to second baseman
Rafael Bournigal. Alicea, though, prevented a double play by
dumping catcher A.J. Hinch with a hard slide.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens then flied out to short left, forcing Gonzalez to
stay at third. But Taylor walked Elster on five pitches to force in
the game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Helling held the Athletics to only four hits through seven
innings but made the mistake of walking Rickey Henderson to start
the eighth. Bip Roberts bunted him to second and Ben Grieve was
intentionally walked, putting runners at first and second for Matt
Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs worked the count full, then hit a line drive at second
baseman Mark McLemore, who made the catch and flipped to first to
double off Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti also left after eight innings, holding the Rangers to
seven hits. He struck three and did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti and Helling dominated through eight innings, although
both teams did muster a couple of rallies. The Rangers got the
leadoff hitter on in three of those seven innings but couldn't get
them home.
</P>
<P>
   They also put runners at first and third with one out in the
seventh on consecutive singles by Rodriguez and Stevens. But
Candiotti got Elster to hit a grounder at third baseman Mike
Blowers to start an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers missed again on an equally enticing opportunity.
Rusty Greer started the inning with a grounder just inside the
first-base bag for a double and went to third on Rodriguez's long
fly ball to right. Candiotti came back to strike out Stevens on a
knuckler in the dirt, then retired Elster on a fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Clark saved Helling in the fourth after Bip Roberts led off with
a walk. Roberts broke on a full-count pitch to Grieve, who smacked
a hard grounder down the first baseline. Clark made a nice
backhanded stop to take away a double and got the out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts reached second, but Helling got Matt Stairs to foul out
and, after Jason Giambi was intentionally walked, Blowers grounded
out to the end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics started another rally in the fifth when singles by
Rafael Bournigal and Rickey Henderson put runners on first and
second with two out. This time, Helling retired Roberts on a high
pop to third baseman Fernando Tatis to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Miguel Tejada squelched a sixth-inning Rangers threat
with some fancy glove work. Tom Goodwin led off with a single to
right, but then Tejada made a nice backhanded grab of Mark
McLemore's one-hop smash to get a force at second. Candiotti
followed that by getting Clark and Juan Gonzalez on fly balls to
left.

DODGERS RALLY TO BEAT PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With their most vocal cheerleader loving every
minute of it in the press box, the Dodgers inched back a little bit
closer in the National League West race.
</P>
<P>
   Two reserves added some surprising punch to help the Dodgers
overcome a one-run deficit and score five runs in the eighth inning
Friday night en route to a dramatic 6-2 victory over the
division-leading Padres in front of 53,245 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1 going into the eighth, pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero
started off the Dodgers rally with a one-out single. Rookie Adrian
Beltre, who came in at the top of the inning, followed with a
single that pushed Guerrero to third. Eric Young followed by
milking a 3-2 count of San Diego's Dan Miceli before hitting a
grounder to third baseman Ken Caminiti. As Guerrero sprinted toward
the plate, Caminiti overthrew catcher Carlos Hernandez, whose legs
went out from under him and couldn't retrieve the ball, allowing
Beltre to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic Tommy Lasorda punched his fist in the air in
excitement afterwards in the press box. And when the Dodgers
followed with the first of their next three runs, the interim
general manager exclaimed, ``Yea, yea, yea.''
</P>
<P>
   The second straight victory over the Padres trimmed the Dodgers'
deficit to 11{ games behind their divisional foe. The Dodgers
(45-44) also moved a game over .500 for the first time since May
13. Moreover, the Dodgers have won six of their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   New closer Jeff Shaw was also impressive in his first appearance
as a Dodger in the ninth inning. After getting his first batter to
ground out, and striking out the next, Shaw finished the game by
getting Tony Gwynn to popout to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Shaw's heroics, he might not be a Dodger after this
season. A source said the 32-year-old can apparently ask to be
traded after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Because the seventh-year major leaguer has five years of service
and was traded while under a multi-year deal, he can ask the
Dodgers to trade him after the season. If Shaw, who has two more
years left on his contract, makes the request, the Dodgers would
have 15 days to trade him or they would lose him to free agency.
The source said Lasorda didn't inquire about that possibility
before making a deal on July 4 that sent promising
infielder/outfielder Paul Konerko and left-hander Dennis Reyes to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that. No... no,'' said Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Lasorda promised reliever Antonio Osuna that he
would not be traded and that he would get some save opportunities.
On Friday, however, Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said that Osuna
would receive only save opportunities when Shaw needs rest. Osuna
(5-0) pitched 2/3 innings of relief Friday and earned the win.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego right-hander Kevin Brown entered the game with a 7-0
record in his last eight starts. But in the first inning, he was
tested by the Dodgers when he gave up a two-out RBI single to
fellow All-Star Gary Sheffield and allowed three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort began strongly, allowing just
one hit during the first three innings. But in the fourth, the
Padres took a 2-1 lead after an RBI single by Caminiti and a
two-out fielding error by Dodgers shortstop Juan Castro helped Greg
Vaughn score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort lasted six innings for the second straight outing and
allowed two runs and four hits while striking out five and walking
four. The right-hander hasn't won a game at Dodger Stadium since
May 16 against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lasted six innings, allowing one run on six hits and
fanning eight.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1, the Dodgers had the go-ahead run at the plate in the
seventh when Bobby Bonilla stepped up with a man on first and
second with two outs. The struggling hitter, however, struck out to
end the inning and a possible Dodgers comeback.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly in the end, Bonilla's hard luck didn't matter
for the resurging Dodgers.

TWO KILLED ON DAY TRIP FOR CHILDREN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two people died and 24 others were injured on Friday
night when an overloaded van carrying a group of Brooklyn children
from a day trip to a Pennsylvania amusement park flipped over,
scattering bodies across a highway, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were on a trip to the Knoebels Amusement Park in
Elysburg, Pa., with their day camp, sponsored by the Bedford
Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., a community development group.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the accident were taken by helicopter to hospitals
near the accident site near Scotrun, Pa., where Interstates 80 and
380 merge near popular vacation spots in the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims was a child who was taken to Lehigh Valley
Hospital in Bethel and died shortly after 6 p.m., said Kristin
Hoffman, a hospital spokesman. Seven others were admitted. The
hospital would not release their conditions until their families
had been notified.
</P>
<P>
   The second person who died was taken to the Pocono Medical
Center, said Dawn Lusardi, an administrator with the hospital; that
victim's age and identity were not available on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The group left the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Center, at
1368 Fulton Avenue, with approximately 75 people around 7 a.m.
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty children were loaded into a bus and 23 others were packed
into a blue van meant for 12 people, said Cpl. Charles Chaio, a
spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why so many people were crammed into the van.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of roller coasters, Ferris wheels and the
merry-go-round at the Knobels Amusement Park, the group climbed
back into the vehicles and set out for Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 5:30 p.m, Chaio said, when the driver of the van
fell asleep and then rear-ended a blue Saturn Sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who suffered only minor injuries, lost control of
the van at junction of Interstates 80 and 380.
</P>
<P>
   The van then collided with a cement embankment, ricocheted off
the wall, flipped onto its side and skidded back onto the road.
Three children were trapped inside. The rest were thrown across the
highway and some into the gully that divides eastbound and
westbound traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The other bus from the center and its 54 children idled in the
traffic jam that reached five miles in length as the authorities
transported the bodies and swept the metal carnage from the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic relatives of the children who were injured traveled to
Pennsylvania hospitals in buses provided by the mayor's office.
Others, who were waiting at the Brooklyn center, burst into tears
when the large bus returned.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Johnson, an aunt of Jasmine Johnson, 12, who was on the
trip and rode on the bus said that although her niece could not see
the carnage on Interstate 80, she knew what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was traumatized,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``She said, `Auntie,
I swear, I never want to go on a bus to camp again in my life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the corporation, Roderick Mitchell, had little
to say except that ``our policy is to obey all state and federal
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he did not know who was driving the van or whether
he was an employee of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the mayor's Office of Emergency Management
were interviewing the children inside the Brooklyn center Friday
night. Inside the building children were crying, others silent as
they wondered what had happened to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the injured children were being treated at the
Pocono Medical Center. Four were listed in stable condition and
were admitted. The others were being evaluated or waiting to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   Two other children were taken to Lehigh Valley Medical Center
and were still being treated in the emergency room Friday night.
They were said to be in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   At Community Medical Center in Scranton, a 23-year-old woman and
a male 17-year-old were listed in guarded condition, said Gerry
Snyder, a spokesman for the hospital.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SO FAR, HONG KONG REMAINS LARGELY INTACT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP M. BOFFEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ _ This dynamic financial center has been under
Chinese control for a year now. There are new laws and a governing
structure that lay the groundwork for future repression should the
leadership in Beijing choose to get nasty. But for now virtually
none of the fears voiced at the time of transition from British
rule have come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no crackdowns on dissidents and no tanks or army
patrols in the streets. The press is more cautious and the courts
ducked a case involving mainland interests. But there has been no
overt censorship, no meddling in the courts or the civil service,
no interference with the city's rambunctious free markets. There is
distress over a plummeting economy, a result of the Asian economic
crisis rather than the takeover by China. But from all the casual
observer can see, the average citizen has just as much freedom now
as under the British.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, businessmen, diplomats from the West and
human rights activists all voice relief that the first year of
transition has gone so smoothly. Human Rights Watch, whose office
some thought might be closed down because of its persistent
criticism of repression in mainland China, has instead found itself
invited to official government parties and showcase events.
</P>
<P>
   Just why China has kept hands off is a matter of speculation.
Some say President Jiang Zemin has been so intent on securing his
own power that he has little stomach for meddling in Hong Kong, or
that he wants to improve relations with the West and hence can't
look totalitarian, or that he hopes to persuade Taiwan to rejoin
the mainland by showing, through the experience of Hong Kong, just
how painless that transition can be. The more cynical say China has
done such a good job of rigging the governmental structure and
installing its sympathizers in power that it has no need to take
overt action. Others say China never intended to interfere with
such a valuable center of trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
   But surely one major factor in the benign turn of events is the
vigilance of Hong Kong activists and citizens in defense of their
freedoms. Voters turned out in surprising numbers for the recent
legislative elections and gave heavy support to democratically
oriented candidates. Activists continue to demonstrate at the drop
of a cause, sometimes by the thousands or even tens of thousands.
The more courageous elements of the press are quick to protest any
perceived sellout of historical freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   That will be an important trait in the years ahead, for there
have been some worrisome developments. The legislature has been
structured in such a way that democratically elected candidates
will not be able to gain dominance for at least 10 years. Laws have
been passed that make it easier for the government to crack down on
activists on national security grounds, and a pending proposal
would prohibit acts of treason, secession and subversion against
China in language so sweeping that political dissent and media
coverage of it might be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate danger is that Hong Kong, eager to avoid
confrontation, will shackle itself without any prodding from
Beijing. The criminal justice system is accused of ducking when
asked to prosecute an agency of the mainland government and a
individual with strong mainland ties. Many Chinese-language
newspapers, which once routinely referred to the Tiananmen Square
``massacre,'' have now downgraded it to an ``incident'' or
``event,'' and the journalists' association decries frequent
self-censorship on such sensitive issues as Tibet, Taiwan and
separatist movements in Xinjiang Province. But even the new
chairman of the association, who describes himself as a strong
critic of China, gives credit to Beijing for ``bending over
backward not to interfere'' in Hong Kong's affairs, ``at least on
the surface.''

EDITORIAL: THE HOUSE AND THE IMF  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   Playing politics with the International Monetary Fund may seem
good sport to House Republicans, but their games now imperil
international financial stability and the future growth of the
American economy. When the House returns to work next week, it must
approve America's long-delayed $18 billion contribution to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is the world economy's front-line defense against the
financial problems that threaten to spread from Asia's developing
countries to Japan, Latin America and now Russia, where President
Boris Yeltsin on Friday appealed to Western leaders for swift
international assistance. America's own economy risks serious
damage if the IMF's ability to respond to this spreading turbulence
is impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the IMF spending request in
full. But in the House it has been blocked by the philosophical
misgivings of some Republicans about financial bailouts and the
insistence of others on attaching anti-abortion language to any IMF
appropriation. Last month, Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested that he
would try to get some IMF money through the House this summer. One
idea under discussion involves slicing off a $3.5 billion piece of
the administration's request for quick approval while continuing to
hold the rest hostage to Republican political demands. That is not
much help, since the remaining $14.5 billion is needed for
immediate lending.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of that $14.5 billion from the United States would
quickly bring in a further $65 billion from other countries under
the IMF's standard payment arrangements. Passing up the chance to
have other nations contribute that much money to future bailouts
would be irresponsible. The monetary fund's reserves are now
perilously low when measured against current lending commitments
and will decline even further without timely House action. Gingrich
and the Republican House leadership must end the maneuvering and
round up the votes to pass the administration's full request.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTING NEW YORK'S CHILDREN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the creation of New York City's Administration
for Children's Services under the leadership of Nicholas Scoppetta,
child protection programs have improved but serious deficiencies
persist. The brutal sexual abuse of three children in Brooklyn and
the near-starvation of a 2-year-old boy in a Staten Island foster
home show recent reforms have not been swift or comprehensive
enough to protect these children who were under the city's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agency faces a legal challenge that could result in
court-ordered intervention or even receivership control of the
child welfare system. Court management of the delivery of social
services is not a happy prospect because systematic reforms are
rarely possible without the willing cooperation of political
leaders and government agencies. But the upcoming trial will be
useful if it spurs the Giuliani administration to redouble its
efforts to implement reforms it has promised.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, trial begins in federal district court in a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of more than 100,000 abused
or neglected children in New York City. The lawsuit, which was
filed in December 1995, charges the city and state with violating
state and federal law in failing to protect this vulnerable
population. Since Judge Robert Ward of the federal district court
has indicated that he will consider evidence of the system's
current performance, it behooves officials to show that conditions
are improving measurably.
</P>
<P>
   Some positive changes have been made since the notorious death
of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo in 1995, and the subsequent creation
of ACS. Hundreds more caseworkers have been hired, cutting average
caseloads from 27 to 16, and worker qualifications have been
raised. But extended training has been offered only to newly hired
caseworkers, and accountability measures are mostly nonexistent.
The monitoring system is still so lax that there is no way to track
whether caseworkers are making the home visits that are required by
law.
</P>
<P>
   The children in the Brooklyn and Staten Island cases were
supposed to be monitored by caseworkers, though now it appears some
required visits were not made and the caseworkers could not spot
evident abuse. Last September, a panel of experts appointed by Ward
to provide an evaluation of child welfare services for the lawsuit
issued a devastating account of the city agency's failures.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the city will have the opportunity to
demonstrate whether its track record is improving. The court will
decide if those reforms are sufficient for the city to avoid legal
liability. The city may yet avoid court intervention by
demonstrating that the reforms underway, coupled with a strong
financial commitment to improving children's services, are
beginning to work.

   NEW YORK _ William Mazer, who made his fortune in the paper

and lived on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mazer embraced the philanthropic traditions and commitments of
his father, Abraham Mazer, founder of the Hudson Pulp and Paper

   &UR; OPINION _ COMMENTARY &LR;  (``k'' code)
</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ COMMENTARY: TINA AND DISNEY ELOPE. By
Frank Rich. (This week, as Tina Brown made her exit from the
editor's chair, New York's media world was once again consumed with
nostalgia about The New Yorker's history and florid speculation
about its future.)
</P>
<P>
   FRIEDMAN-COLUMN (Undated) _ COMMENTARY: OVER AND OVER AGAIN. By
Thomas L. Friedman. (If someone were to make a movie about the
Mideast peace process, there could be only one appropriate title:
``Groundhog Day'' _ where the same day, the same discussions, just
get repeated over and over. But even Groundhog Day eventually came
to an end. And so will the peace process version. It closes May 4,
1999 _ the day the Oslo agreement runs out.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   IRS-TAXPAYERS (Undated) _ How the new tax law will affect the
taxpayer. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   FEC-BROWN (Washington) _ District Judge Stanley Sporkin orders
the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether the late
commerce secretary, Ron Brown, sold seats on foreign trade missions
in exchange for campaign contributions. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-LAWSUITS (Washington) _ Many of the nation's judges,
frustrated because they have no choice but to deny the damage
claims of people who have been harmed by their health plans, are
finding themselves sympathetic with efforts in Congress to revamp
the laws that protect HMOs and other insurance carriers from
lawsuits. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IMPLANTS-ASSESS _ After 16 years of litigation and more than
a dozen major scientific studies, the longstanding controversy over
the safety of breast implants reached a milestone of sorts on
Wednesday, when Dow Corning Corp. agreed to pay $3.2 billion to
settle the claims of tens of thousands of women who said they had
become ill from their implants. But the agreement did not end the
conflict over implants. An analysis. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MATH-TEACHERS (New York) _ New York schools are looking
abroad to fill teaching positions in math classes. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   NY-MISSING-MILLIONAIRE (New York) _ Her nickname was Zambi.
That's what her fellow dancers at Radio City called the petite
17-year-old from New Orleans with big dreams and bigger ambitions.
She was tough, she was flirtatious and she married well enough to
leave the arduous life of a seven-show-a-week music hall ballerina
far behind. But Irene Zambelli Silverman, the wealthy 82-year-old
widow who disappeared last Sunday from her East 65th Street mansion
and is now feared dead, never quite shook off the glitter of her
stage days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-IMF (Moscow) _ President Boris Yeltsin went over the head
of the International Monetary Fund on Friday and urged Western
leaders to support a multi-billion-dollar package of financial
assistance to defend the Russian currency. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BOMB-PLOT (London) _ In a coordinated sweep, police in
Ireland and England arrested nine people Friday and said they had
foiled a plot to bomb central London with only moments to spare. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Separatist rebels appear
to be holding their own in the ethnic war in Kosovo province,
promising a long battle for control in the region. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-MOOD (Paris) _ France is back after a long period of
querulous gloom, introspection and self-doubt. Many people give the
Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin credit for
the change. With graphic. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA (Lagos) _ The scene at the Abiola residence erupts into
a stoning when the former vice president speaks eloquently about
opening up the country to democracy but is jeered by Abiola
supporters; other developments. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-IMPACT (Undated) _ The Asian economic crisis has brought
further weakness to the world's commodities markets, causing prices
to fall faster. That has been good news for consuming countries but
very bad news for the producing nations that depend on commodities
for much of their export revenues. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   VIAGRA-COST-ASSESS (Undated) _ When Kaiser Permanente announced
it would not pay for Viagra, it acknowledged that its decision was
based on the cost of the drug _ a rare instance in which a health
plan has conceded that cost considerations affected a treatment
decision. By Michael M. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   BIZGLANCE (Undated) _ Digest of the day's financial stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &LR;  (``e'' code)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ideas Page &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAD-STUDIES (Undated) _ It seems self-evident to just about
anyone who has ever had a father: a caring, involved dad is good
for a child. But try proving it. Social science is filled with
research that documents the impact of mothers on their children.
Flip through the literature and you find studies in which every
single gesture between mothers and babies was videotaped and
analyzed. Turn to the father's side of the family ledger, however,
and two things become apparent. Little research has occurred. And
the studies that do exist fail to cast much light on why fathers
really matter. By Patricia Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   NANCY-DREW (Undated) _ After nearly seventy years, Nancy Drew is
still going out with Ned Nickerson, and Joe Hardy is still dating
his friend Chet's sister, Iola. There are certain things about the
Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series that just never change. Yet these
wildly popular teen-age detective novels _ since they began in
1927, about 200 million volumes have been sold _ have nonetheless
been seen to reflect historical changes. By Dinitia Smith.
</P>
<P>
   BEACH-STUDIES (Undated) _ His full-color business card shows him
on the white sands of Lanakai Beach in Oahu, wearing white shorts
and matching knit shirt, his shadow knifing out into the blue-green
waters. Shimmering above the water in print the color of the sand
is the simple identification ``Dr. Beach.'' But he's really Dr.
Stephen Leatherman, who is an example of the way a few media-savvy
academics manage to transform themselves from mere toilers in
arcane academic groves to mini-celebrities. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other Culture &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TENORS-WORLD-CUP (Paris) _ The Three Tenors give big Eiffel
Tower concert on eve of World Cup final. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS &LR;  (``s'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BBN-RHODEN-COLUMN (New York) _ Sports of The Times column on
Felipe Alou and how he has seen baseball change for Latin players.
By William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   SOC-WORLDCUP (Paris) _ Situationer on the French defense, which
is the key to the team's chances of beating Brazil in the World Cup
final on Sunday. By Christopher Clarey.

SHAW COULD FORCE A TRADE FROM DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During an easy ninth inning in his Dodgers debut Friday, closer
Jeff Shaw was impressive. Despite Shaw's heroics, it's not certain
he will be in Dodger blue next season.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the basic agreement between owners and
players, the 32-year-old Shaw can demand to be traded after the
season, and if the Dodgers don't honor his request, he would become
a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-year major leaguer has five years of service and was
traded while under a multi-year deal. Therefore, if Shaw, who has
two more years left on his contract, makes such a demand, the
Dodgers would have 15 days to trade him or he becomes a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   A source said Dodgers interim general manager Tommy Lasorda
didn't inquire about that possibility before making a deal on July
4 for the All-Star Shaw that sent promising infielder/outfielder
Paul Konerko and left-hander Dennis Reyes to Cincinnati. Also,
Cincinnati general manager James Bowden scoffed at Lasorda when he
called him back in anger after realizing he'd been had, a source
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the possibility of Shaw leaving after the
season, Lasorda said, ``I'm not worried about that. No... No.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the reason why Lasorda promised reliever Antonio
Osuna that he would not be traded and that he would get some save
opportunities. On Friday, however, Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman
said Osuna would receive save opportunities only when Shaw, who has
23 saves this season, needs a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' said Shaw, as he hurried
to get a cab after the game with his family. ``I don't know how my
contract reads. All I know is I'm here right now to close some
games.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Shaw signed a three-year contract extension worth $8.4
million.

DODGERS RALLY TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their most vocal cheerleader loving every minute of it in
the press box, the Dodgers inched back a little closer in the
National League West race.
</P>
<P>
   Two reserves added surprising punch to help the Dodgers overcome
a one-run deficit and score five runs in the eighth inning en route
to a dramatic 6-2 victory over the division-leading San Diego
Padres in front of 53,245 at Dodger Stadium on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1 in the eighth, pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero started off
the Dodgers rally with a one-out single. Rookie Adrian Beltre, who
came in at the top of the inning, followed with a single that
pushed Guerrero to third. Eric Young followed by milking a 3-2
count off San Diego's Dan Miceli before hitting a grounder to third
baseman Ken Caminiti. As Guerrero streaked toward the plate,
Caminiti overthrew catcher Carlos Hernandez, who landed awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre ran to the plate, Hernandez recovered and retrieved the
ball, but it was too late to prevent the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic Tommy Lasorda punched his fist in the air in
excitement afterward in the press box. And when the Dodgers
followed with the first of their next three runs in the inning, the
interim general manager exclaimed, ``Yea, yea, yea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what I hope to see,'' said Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman. ``We are the ones chasing them and we need to do that the
rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The second straight victory over the Padres trimmed the Dodgers'
deficit to 11{ games behind their divisional foe. The Dodgers
(45-44) also moved a game over .500 for the first time since May 13
and have won six of their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a good foot on the play,'' said Caminiti. ``The
ball was hit to my left and I didn't have a chance to set my feet.
It was an error. Two runs scored.... That's baseball.'
</P>
<P>
   San Diego manager Bruce Bochy said, ``It was the difference in
the game.'
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw was also impressive in his first appearance as
a Dodger in the ninth inning. After getting his first batter to
ground out and striking out the next, Shaw finished the game by
getting Tony Gwynn to pop out to center field. Reliever Antonio
Osuna (5-0) took the win after pitching just 2/3 innings in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Kevin Brown entered with a 7-0 record in his last
eight outings. But Gary Sheffield gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead with
a first-inning RBI single off Brown. Sheffield's hit moved his
hitting streak to 10 games and he has an average of .387 during the
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing with a little more fire,'' Sheffield said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort began strongly, allowing just
one hit during the first three innings. But in the fourth, the
Padres took a 2-1 lead after an RBI single by Caminiti and a
two-out fielding error by Dodgers shortstop Juan Castro helped Greg
Vaughn score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort lasted six innings for the second straight outing and
allowed two runs and four hits while striking out five and walking
four. The right-hander, however, hasn't won a game at Dodger
Stadium since May 16 against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew with Dreifort and Brown on the mound it would be a
tight game,'' Hoffman said. ``It was a good win for us and
hopefully we'll get more.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia _ All around Latin America, book stores are well
stocked with new texts about free markets and global free trade.
Such books brim with hope for the future, and they are beginning to
appear even in this backwater capital high in the Andes. But here,
they still have to share shelf space with a rather depressing
best-seller that carries a very different message.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas' ``A Sick
People,'' and it seems at times that every literate Bolivian has
read it. It indicts Bolivia's history and national character as a
blight of corruption, provincialism and racial hatred, a synthesis
of ``laziness, poverty, barbarism.'' That conclusion, and the
book's abiding popularity, highlight the challenges that the global
free-market revolution faces here.
</P>
<P>
   As that revolution is increasingly accepted around the world as
the wave of the future, Bolivia's experience also can serve as a
lesson for other countries _ Cambodia and Congo, for example _ that
are also plagued by intractable geographical disadvantages, caste
structures and unstable political histories. The lesson is the
limits of the miracles promised by global free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Toranzo Roca, a prominent Bolivian economist, sums up the
lesson this way: ``You don't eradicate centuries of structural
social inequalities with 4 percent growth rates.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is exactly what a series of Bolivian governments
has tried to do since 1985, with the help of American economic
advisers including Jeffrey Sachs, the director of Harvard
University's Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the results have been spectacular. First,
the government tackled a 24,000 percent annual inflation rate by
slashing its budget and subsidies, and instituting property and
value-added taxes. The inflation rate was reduced to single digits
virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income, which had fallen by 30 percent between 1985
and 1990, began to climb an average of between 4 and 5 percent a
year, and with economic stability came political stability. The
nearly ritualistic annual coups that Bolivia had suffered through
for more than a century were replaced by a series of clean,
peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last Bolivian government ceded a controlling share of the
government oil, railroad, electricity, telephone and airline
monopolies to foreign corporations and overhauled the country's tax
and pension systems, diversifying the economy and boosting savings
rates in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soften political opposition to the privatization, the
government put large minority holdings in the firms into a private
pension trust fund that is beginning to pay all Bolivians older
than 65 a modest annuity. Foreign investment is blossoming, and a
new pipeline will soon deliver natural gas to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of globalization are popping up in the most unlikely
places. Indian trinket stands in La Paz are beginning to accept
American Express cards. Peasant union leaders now wear cellular
telephones on their belts. A fading mural depicting a defiant Che
Guevara on the campus of the national university now pales
alongside a bright new Coca Cola advertisement. Bolivia, where most
people still drink coca tea and a high-octane maize liquor called
chicha, is even beginning to export wine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results remain mixed for the great majority of poor
Bolivians.
</P>
<P>
   The average Bolivian still earns $900 a year, less than
one-fifth what the average Argentine or Chilean earns, and few of
the poor can expect to live long enough to see the benefits of
economic growth trickle down to transform their existence into
anything like a middle class lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   While the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz are
booming with new condominiums, banks and McDonald's franchises, the
rural Indian highlands continue to fall behind. Foreign investors
can't be enticed to build factories in mountain areas where
shipping costs are prohibitive, where even a third-grade education
is unusual and where only 1 percent of the people have finished
high school. More than half of all Bolivians speak Indian dialects
as their first language and many speak no Spanish at all. Forty
percent of the children in La Paz are chronically undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the lower classes have made no progress.
While life expectancy at birth remains a miserably low 60 years,
that is a major improvement over the 42 years that an infant born
in 1960 was expected to live. Only 55 percent of the population
currently has access to potable water, but in 1975 only 34 percent
did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this amount of progress is not enough to stem the
widening of the income gap between rich and poor, and particularly
between city dwellers and rural Indians _ although it apparently
has helped lend Bolivia a semblance of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to sustained economic growth is education, and you
can't educate a country overnight,'' conceded Vice President Jorge
Fernando Quiroga Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The new government of President Hugo Banzer Suarez is planning a
rural literacy campaign, and has proposed steps to help poor people
acquire loans. But with the region's economies beginning to slow in
the wake of the Asian financial crisis, no new economic boom is
anywhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Another intractable problem is Bolivia's virtual inability to
ship by sea, given the fact that its access to the Pacific Ocean
was lost in a war with Chile over 100 years ago, and the two
countries have not forgiven each other. Bolivia and Chile still do
not have diplomatic relations, leaving Bolivia dependent on
unreliable mountain roads and expensive air traffic to export its
goods.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably not any more economic policy dials that can
be easily turned in Bolivia,'' Sachs acknowledged. ``You can do
marvelous reforms, but still have very significant problems in
achieving a rapid improvement of living standards.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing economic reform can't change is history.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's Andean remoteness protected its Indians from the
European smallpox and plague that decimated most of Latin America's
indigenous populations. So a large Indian population remained to be
exploited by the Spanish colonizers as miners and tenant farmers,
and what emerged was a highly stratified society wracked by class
strife.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia was so unruly with caste and Indian wars that its
namesake, Simon Bolivar, fled it in disgust after he wrote a
constitution inspired by the most enlightened European ideals. The
constitution survived on paper, but the society went through more
than 250 rebellions and military coups over the next 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   A longstanding joke among neighboring Argentines compared
Bolivia to a long-playing record: ``33 revolutions a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The quip now seems as dated as the phonograph itself, but many
vestiges of class conflict survive.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. government's 1997 human rights report on
Bolivia, ``some rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of
virtual slavery by employers who charge them more for room and
board than they earn.'' A system of child servitude known as
criadito survives in which Indian parents indenture their
pre-adolescent children to middle- and upper-income families to
perform household chores. Many of the children are badly abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivia has made tremendous progress,'' said Herbert Klein, a
Columbia University historian who specializes in Bolivia, ``but it
starts from an incredibly backward base compared to everyone else
in Latin America.'' And with virtually every other country in Latin
America following the same successful economic policies, there is
no reason to believe Bolivia will catch up with its neighbors any
time soon.

 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Any outsider would have mistaken Ty Seedig for a
waiter, so nimbly did he balance three full-size dinner plates in
one hand, so fleetly did he hurtle toward a table in the rear of a
restaurant at the Main Street Station hotel and casino here.
</P>
<P>
   But any local resident would have caught the longing in Seedig's
eyes and the delight on his lips and known exactly what he was: a
buffet hound, practiced at the trick of maximizing each trip down
the trough.
</P>
<P>
   On his latest foray, he had netted what looked like an entire
bed of clams, a wedge of ahi tuna, a slab of trout and, of course,
a gargantuan steak, this being T-bone night, which jacked up the
price all the way to $10.99. Normally, it was $9.99, already a tad
steep by Las Vegas standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do about six buffets a week,'' Seedig, 38, said Tuesday
night as he rotated the plates before him to get a better angle at
the T-bone, which was obstructed by several red potatoes and an ear
of corn. His trimness suggested a metabolism worthy of scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``For being fast and cheap,'' he mumbled between forkfuls, ``you
can't beat a buffet.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the motto for this desert city, the nation's
capital of gorging as well as gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Overstuffed, underpriced smorgasbords have long been a staple of
Las Vegas' tourist trade, an enticement and reward for spending
money in casinos. But a lure for heavy rollers is becoming a
lifestyle for heavy eaters as the city's resident population
swells, in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who line up at the buffets in casinos away
from ``the Strip'' live in Las Vegas, and the buffets they
patronize are growing more absurdly, insanely bountiful.
</P>
<P>
   The one at Main Street Station takes so many twists and turns
along its odyssey from iceberg lettuce to carrot cake that a person
would be wise to leave a trail of multi-colored cheese cubes to
find the way back.
</P>
<P>
   But Marvin Faleck and Anthony Ippolito had no trouble with their
bearings. Since moving to Las Vegas from New York's Long Island two
years ago, they have been on something of a buffet safari.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken them to more than a dozen buffets both off and on
the Strip, including an Oktoberfest event at the Nevada Palace that
featured vats of sauerkraut and a polka band, all for $6.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we've done the MGM buffet,'' Faleck, 40,
said Tuesday night as he munched on some of Main Street's
undeniably tasty fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oz buffet?'' Ippolito, 38, responded, nibbling pizza.
``Yes, we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luxor and Excalibur _ feh!'' Faleck said, dismissing two
buffets with one syllable. ``It's $5.99 at Excalibur; you figure,
how can you go wrong? Feh!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monte Carlo wasn't feh,'' he added, moving onto another
buffet. ``It was eh.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their friends, Danny Schaeffer, swallowed part of a
burrito and chimed in that an unfortunate episode a few months ago
left him wary of how long the food is maintained at safe
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that experience,'' he said, ``I never say a buffet is
good until I've gone home, slept through the night and gotten up in
the morning without anything going wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ardent pilgrims to the buffets are retirees,
who get coupons, discounts and other breaks that often put the
price of a limitless meal for two below $10. That includes
non-alcoholic beverages and as much pie, cake and pastry as a body
can manage.
</P>
<P>
   The buffet mavens of Las Vegas manage a lot. And they know
exactly when and where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gold Coast only charges something like $5.30 for its lunch
buffet,'' said Ted Morgenbesser, 61, who took an early retirement
from his insurance job in Manhattan last year and moved here with
his wife, Vicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it serves until 3,'' Morgenbesser said. ``So if you get
there at 2:30 and have your big meal for the day, it's basically $5
a person. The price goes up at least a dollar for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the bigger houses and lower taxes that help lure thousands
of transplants to Las Vegas every month, the buffets feed
newcomers' faith in greater bounty and possibility here. That
expectation is grounded partly in reality, and partly in myth.
</P>
<P>
   While the buffets do essentially give away much of the food each
patron consumes, losing money in the process, they easily make up
the difference in the coins that patrons cannot resist dropping in
the thicket of slot machines they must penetrate to get to the
make-your-own-taco bar.
</P>
<P>
   Ippolito and Faleck blew $17 on slots as they left Main Street
Station. But Faleck explained that the appeal of buffets
transcended mere economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are is a goof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are Chinese buffets and Japanese buffets, breakfast
buffets and lunch buffets, buffets that operate 24-hours a day and
buffets that span half the distance of a football field.
</P>
<P>
   The World Carnival Buffet at the Rio Hotel is at least that
long, and it has more than seven different ethnic sub-buffets. Even
at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, hundreds of people were zipping _ or, it must
be said, waddling _ from Italy to Mexico and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-timers scoff at such clutter, preferring to stick with
what they know and like best. For Erne D. Vining, 64, that's fish,
and he nightly heads to whichever buffet is having its weekly
seafood special.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday I go to Orleans,'' said Vining, who has lived in Las
Vegas for more than three decades. ``On Tuesday, Boulder Station.
On Wednesday, Fiesta. On Thursday, Sunset. On Friday, Fremont.
Sundays is Silverton.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of Saturday? Does he fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Vining conceded in an almost apologetic voice,
``I cook.''

<P>
   In writing, ``Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,''
Shakespeare couldn't have imagined the likes of Nicholas II,
Russia's last czar, whose remains will be interred Friday in St.
Petersburg along with those of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was considered a lightweight, a weak, unengaged but
brutal ruler who preferred family life to affairs of state, even as
the 300-year-old Romanov empire was collapsing around him.
</P>
<P>
   His burial, however, is a potent political symbol for
post-communist Russia. Taking place 80 years to the day after the
Bolsheviks executed him along with Czarina Alexandra and their son
and four daughters, it will implicity censure the communist era by
acknowledging the imperial murders that ushered it in.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivities are such that the ceremony will not be
attended by President Boris Yeltsin, who ordered the Romanov bone
fragments dug up from a forest in the Urals seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is commemorating the last Romanovs in other ways too _
notably in an exhibition of imperial artifacts that opens in
Wilmington, Del., on Aug. 1, at the start of a three-city American
tour. It includes recently disclosed letters and diaries, many
never published, covering the family's final months.
</P>
<P>
   Even as their end loomed, they show little awareness in their
diaries. ``There is no indication of their lives as political
beings,'' said Robert Steven Bianchi, a curator and planner of the
tour. ``It is the mundane affairs of a family that is very close.''
Excerpts follow, from translations in the exhibition catalog (Harry
N. Abrams, New York, in association with Booth-Clibborn Editions,
London).
</P>
<P>
   _ By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Nicholas was a reluctant czar. On his
accession after his father's death, he wrote in 1894 that it was
``the very worst thing has happened to me.'' He frequently
submitted to the wishes of Alexandra _ even more out of touch with
national life than he was. On Dec. 14, 1916, with the monarchy
teetering during World War I, she wrote to Nicholas at his
headquarters on the Western front:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Be Peter the Great, be Ivan the Terrible, be Emperor Paul _ and
smash the lot of them. Do not laugh. . . . I am desperate to see
you like this with these people who are trying to control you. Show
them the fist. Prove yourself a sovereign. You are the autocrat and
they should not dare forget it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Feb. 24, 1917, he wrote to her, ``My mind
is at rest here _ no ministers and no tiresome questions.'' But
Bolshevik-supported unrest in the capital, St. Petersburg (then
Petrograd), was worsening. En route to the city by train on March
2, Nicholas wrote in his diary:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Ruzsky (a senior general) came in the morning and read me his
long telephone conversation with Rodzianko (the president of the
Duma, or Parliament). In his words, the situation in Petrograd is
such that at present a ministry from the Duma is powerless to do
anything, because they are opposed by the social democrat party in
the guise of the workers' committee.
</P>
<P>
   My abdication is necessary. Ruzsky communicated his conversation
to headquarters and Alekseyev (the supreme commander) to all the
commanders-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   By about 2:30 answers had arrived from all. The crux of the
matter is that it is necessary to take this step, for the sake of
Russia's salvation and of maintaining calm in the army at the
front. I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The draft manifesto was sent out from headquarters. In the
evening Gutchkov and Shulgrin (senior Duma members sent to seek his
abdication) arrived from Petrograd, and after talking to them, I
handed over the signed and recopied manifesto. I left Pskov
(southwest of St. Petersburg, where he actually abdicated) at one
o'clock at night, with a heavy heart. All around is betrayal,
cowardice and deceit!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)With his abdication, power passed to Grand
Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich, his brother, who renounced the throne
the next day, ending the monarchy. On March 3, Nicholas wrote:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Misha has abdicated. His manifesto concludes
with a call for elections for a constituent assembly within six
months. God knows who advised him to sign such a vile document. In
Petrograd the disturbances have stopped _ long may it remain that
way.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On March 7, 1917, the new provisional
government ordered the arrest of Nicholas II and his wife. The
family was subsequently held in a house in Yekaterinburg, in the
Ural Mountains. Nicholas' diary entries in his final months, in the
custody of the Bolsheviks, deal with domestic concerns like
illnesses of three Romanov children (Olga, Tatiana and Alexei) and
reflect the family's humbled circumstances:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 2, 1918:
</P>
<P>
   German measles has been confirmed (in the girls), but
fortunately they both feel all right today. The day was gray, not
cold but with a strong wind. We go into the garden but there's no
work to do. Today I was bored to tears!
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Alexei also started German measles, but quite mildly. Olga and
Tatiana are feeling better; the latter even got up. It snowed all
day. The detachment guards' committee instructed me to remove my
epaulettes to avoid being insulted or attacked in the town. It's
beyond comprehension!
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   We are going to have to considerably reduce our expenditures on
household supplies and staff, as the department of appanages
(supporting the royal family) is being closed down from March 1,
added to which we are only allowed to receive 600 rubles a month
each from our personal capital. For the last few days we have been
busy calculating the minimum that will allow us to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Alexei, 13, the hemophiliac son whose
illness preoccupied his parents, also kept a diary. On March 4,
1918, he related how guards interfered with some winter fun:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Spent the whole day like yesterday. In the afternoon I played
with Kolia (his nurse) and made a wooden dagger with my knife.
Kolia too. Later we attacked each other. In the evening the
soldiers destroyed the ice mountain, so we can't slide. We were
told so by the commandant.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)His father was also angered by the guards'
action, for a different reason. He wrote in his diary the next
day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This morning we saw from the window that the little mountain has
been destroyed; it appears that the idiotic detachment committee
decided to do this in order to stop us climbing up onto it and
looking over the fence!
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On March 13, the deposed monarch
acknowledges small kindnesses:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A similar day with 12 degrees of frost. I finished ``Anna
Karenina'' and began reading Lermontov. Sawed a lot of wood with
Tatiana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days we have begun to receive butter, coffee,
cakes for tea and jams, from various kind people who have heard
that our expenditure on food has been reduced. How touching!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)But by May 14 the Bolsheviks were tightening
restrictions on the family's movements:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Today we were told by Botkin (a doctor) that we are only to be
allowed one hour's walk a day; in answer to the question, ``Why?''
the commandant's stand-in replied, ``So that it should be more like
a prison regime.'' At least they have brought us a samovar, so we
don't have to depend on the guards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On July 13, three days before the Romanovs'
execution, Nicholas' last diary entry betrays little amiss:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Alexei took his first bath since Tobolsk; his knee is getting
better, but he cannot straighten it completely. The weather is warm
and pleasant. We have absolutely no news from the outside.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)July 16, Alexandra's last diary entry:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (Niece) Irena's 23d birthday. Gray morning, later lovely
sunshine. Baby has a slight cold. All went out {-hour in the
morning. Olga and I arrange our medicines. Tatiana read spiritual
readings.
</P>
<P>
   They went out. Tatiana stayed with me and we read: The Book of
the prophet Amos and prophet Audios.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning the commandant comes to our rooms: at last after a
week brought eggs again for Baby. 8 supper. Suddenly Lenka Sednev
(the kitchen boy) was fetched to go and see his uncle and flew off
_ wonder whether it's true and we shall see the boy back again!
Played bezique (a card game) with Nicky. 10:30 to bed. 15 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Yakov Yurovsky, the guards' commander, later
wrote that he called a firing squad together at about 11 o'clock
that night. Guards awoke the family and told them that they were to
go to the cellar because of unrest in town. ``The Romanovs did not
suspect a thing,'' he wrote. In his written testimony, the
commander also wrote: ``It's no easy matter to arrange an
execution, contrary to what some people think. After all, this
wasn't the front, but a so-called peaceful environment.''(END

HUNDLEY'S RETURN COULD HELP OR HINDER PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a little past 7 Saturday night, Todd Hundley will
jog to the outfield grass of Shea Stadium, where he will play
somewhere other than behind home plate for the first time in his
major league career.
</P>
<P>
   The view, Hundley said earlier this week, will be different from
anything he has experienced in his first eight seasons with the
Mets. But the sight of Hundley, in uniform and in the lineup
regardless of where he is playing, can only be heartening to a
struggling Mets team that could fall right out of postseason
contention fairly soon unless it truly turns things around.
</P>
<P>
   As John Franco, the senior leader in the clubhouse, said of a
team that since June 1 was 13-20 before Friday night's game:
``We've been missing something. And now we have our leader back.
He's been our leader on the field when he was catching every day.
And when he was gone, nobody had the kind of presence like Todd
does. His presence here should help us immediately, even if it
might not make a couple of guys happy because of playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``guys'' would be Bernard Gilkey, Brian McRae and Butch
Huskey, the Mets' starting outfielders, none of whom has hit enough
to justify full-time employment in the lineup and all of whom may
take turns sitting to make room for Hundley. But a bigger concern
is whether Hundley's presence in the outfield will lead to
long-term happiness for both Hundley and his fellow all-star
catcher Mike Piazza, who has taken over Hundley's role behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to hypothesize about potential ways the Mets
could keep Hundley and Piazza happy together in the same lineup for
years to come, with Hundley playing in the outfield and giving
Piazza a rest behind the plate on certain days and Piazza playing
behind the plate and taking a breather now and then at first base.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of scenario is apparently being embraced by Mets'
decision-makers, the people who will ultimately have to agree on
how much to offer Piazza, a free agent at season's end, to stay in
New York. But what happens this August, or next April, if Piazza
makes a mistake or two behind the plate and the rumbling begins
that Hundley should be catching and Piazza should be playing in the
field?
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of mutterings almost seem inevitable, and it would
thus be understandable if Piazza might feel a little wary of
re-signing with the Mets, for fear of having to look over his
shoulder all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Piazza maintained Friday that ``I'm not worried at all
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just concentrate on doing the best I can,'' he said. ``I
can't be preoccupied with reading the papers or worrying about
what's said. You just have to block it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips said Friday, ``Every quote
I've read from Mike indicates that he is willing and open to
figuring out a way to make it work.'' And whereas Hundley has made
some statements about wanting to catch again next season, ``I also
feel there is a way to make it work,'' Phillips added.
</P>
<P>
   ``How that gets divided is not completely clear right now,'' he
said. ``But I think we can make it work with both guys on the team.
And I think they both think there is a way to make it work. All
those things we still need to figure out. But there is a way to
keep everyone sharp and hungry and healthy. And there is enough
playing time to go around to make it work. How and where it is
broken down, we have to figure out. But I have a general, not a
specific, sense of how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Piazza has a say in his future in any negotiations with
the Mets, the assumption has always been that he would remain the
Mets' No. 1 catcher if he stays in New York. The fact that Hundley,
who underwent reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last
September, is still a question mark physically and might be better
off for good at a less stressful position than catcher, has only
added to that belief that Piazza ranks first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just don't know if Todd will be able to catch
because of an elbow situation that bothers him when he makes snap
throws,'' manager Bobby Valentine said, referring to the discomfort
Hundley sometimes experiences when throwing from behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, however, thinks that he will be able to catch again, if
not this year. And so there are all those indications from within
the organization that there should be a diplomatic way to divide
the playing time in the future so that Hundley does not feel frozen
out from ever playing catcher again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Mets will simply hope that Hundley's crash course
in outfield play will keep him from embarrassing himself on defense
and that he will be able to hit with enough power to put a little
more life into an often quiet Mets lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he also hoped that Hundley's return to the lineup
might actually take a little pressure off Piazza, who has hit for
average with the Mets, but not for much power, and has generally
failed to drive in runs in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as just pressing,'' Phillips said of Piazza's
recent struggles. ``All the focus is on him. Todd's coming back may
actually take some focus off Mike and give him the opportunity to
take a deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley and Piazza in the middle of the Mets order. The
adventure begins.

shocking and inexplicable in a police state notorious for its tight
security, and from one end of the island to the other, people

the mountains of Central America, a Cuban-American businessman
named Antonio Jorge ``Tony'' Alvarez was certain he knew the
answer. By Ann Louise Bardach and Larry Rohter.

diplomats placed an urgent call to Switzerland. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-ISRAEL-POLICY (Washington) _ It may be one of the longest

Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   BHUTAN-MONARCHY _ Bhutan, one of two remaining absolute

   JAPAN-FINN-POL (Yugawara, Japan) _ For the last several months,

</P>
<P>
   VEGAS-BUFFET-LIFESTYLE (Las Vegas) _ Overstuffed, underpriced
smorgasbords have long been a staple of the Las Vegas tourist

as the city's resident population swells, in more ways than one. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR-2000-TEST _ For computer wizards on Wall Street, Monday

cope with the transition to the next century. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   TAXBREAK-MULTINATIONALS _ A lobbying blitz by some of the

too. By Leslie Wayne.

</P>

place goes post-nuclear. Almost a year ago, Maine Yankee, the
state's only nuclear plant and once New England's biggest
electricity producer, stopped generating power here for good, to
the joy of nuclear opponents, the regret of the townfolk who
depended on its taxes and jobs, and the pain of its hundreds of
workers. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   FISHING-DISABLED (Bemidji, Minn.) _ Fishing Has No Boundaries, a
nonprofit organization, was founded in 1986 in Hayward, Wis., and
held its first event there in 1988. The idea for the organization _
to take people with disabilities fishing _ was born after a fishing
guide, Bobby Cammack, broke his arm and discovered how difficult a
disability could be for a fisherman, said Tom Mansfield, the
national vice president of operations. By Carla Baranauckas.

late-summer fight with the National Rifle Association and its
supporters in Congress over whether to extend it. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   DEECEE-VOTER-LAWSUIT (Washington) _ Seeking statehood did not

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the national economy booming, lawmakers have
begun to focus on one of the few places in the country where times
are bad: the Northern Plains, where wheat and livestock prices have
plunged and many farmers are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an especially bad year in terms of wheat prices,''
said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, who helped rush through the Senate on Thursday a bill to
allow farmers to sell wheat to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said that the situation
on the farms in his state, South Dakota, was the direst in 15 years
and worsening. ``We've got to take action now,'' he said. ``It must
be done this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Republicans and Democrats have weighed in with
proposals to meet what both sides describe as a crisis involving an
important election-year constituency, they are addressing the
situation from entirely different angles.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Lugar favor a free-market agriculture policy
and believe the government can best help farmers by staying out of
their hair and promoting export markets for their products.
</P>
<P>
   That was the basis of the legislation approved by the Senate on
Thursday to exempt food exports from the sanctions the United
States imposed on India and Pakistan after those countries
conducted nuclear tests in May. The House Republican leadership has
promised to follow suit in time for U.S. farmers to bid on
Wednesday on a large Pakistani order for wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Daschle believe that it is more important for the
government to restore some government farm subsidies that were
developed in the New Deal and repealed by the Republican Congress
in the 1996 farm bill. Democratic lawmakers promised last week to
press for more government assistance for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to meet on the situation early this week
with Democratic senators. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
in an interview that the administration would announce its response
to the farm problem in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The matter could come to a head this week, if the Senate takes
up the agriculture appropriations bill. The outcome could affect
the congressional elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Few other issues so vividly illustrate the fundamental split
between the parties on the proper role of government in society.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, politicians from the same state but different parties
vote alike on questions that are of primarily local concern. In New
York, for instance, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, are united on such issues as
mass transit and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Montana and Washington _
states with mounting trouble on the farms and with one Republican
and one Democratic senator each _ the senators are walking the
party lines and taking opposing positions on farm policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, described the division this way:
``They have great confidence in Washington bureaucrats. We have
confidence in Iowa farmers to manage their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa's Democratic senator, Tom Harkin, has a completely
different view. ``For Republicans, the 1996 farm bill is like holy
scripture, and any change would show they were wrong,'' he said.
``I simply do not believe you can trade your way out of a farm
disaster. I think the government has got to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the farm picture is not entirely bleak. Corn farmers
in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois are anticipating a good year when
their crop comes in this fall. Cotton producers in Arkansas and
Mississippi are doing well. Rice growers in the South are
prospering.
</P>
<P>
   But so many farmers lost money in North Dakota last year that
net farm income was down 98 percent from 1996, and the situation
has deteriorated this year. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said that in
his state, auctioneers had to be called out of retirement to handle
all the farmers who were selling out.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is also severe in South Dakota, western Minnesota
and the other states along the Canadian border to the Pacific. Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that her constituents were facing ``the
worst crisis ever seen in the Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' troubles stem from several unrelated events: Farm
exports are way down, mainly because of the staggering economies in
Asia; wheat production is strong because of warm weather worldwide,
which drives down prices; many farmers in the Northern Plains have
not recovered from last year's floods; a disease called scab has
affected much of the wheat in the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices today for wheat and corn and soybeans and barley are at
a level equal to what they were when I was born, 50 years ago,''
said Daschle. Farmers, he continued, are expected ``to live on
salaries and income that was generated right after World War II,
and you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hold that the plight of farmers has been worsened by
the Republican legislation that Congress approved two years ago
called the Freedom to Farm Act. The law reduces crop subsidies in
increments until 2002, when they will no longer exist, and gives
farmers freedom to switch crops in response to market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats voted against the measure. Clinton signed it with
serious reservations, he said at the time, because he feared the
bill would not ``provide an adequate safety net for family
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Democrats want to roll back that legislation by raising the
ceiling on government-guaranteed loans to farmers and by
introducing a new emergency-relief program that would help farmers
affected by floods, drought and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Their prospects for success are not strong. Lugar said that he
and his fellow Republicans would fight hard to preserve the 1996
law. Farmers, he said, ``should rely on a market approach, not a
political fix.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich promised last month that he
would promote legislation to stimulate farm exports. He said he
would press to renew the president's fast-track authority to
negotiate trade agreements, an authority that Congress failed to
re-enact last year. He said he would also seek financing for the
International Monetary Fund and continuation of normal trade
relations with China, both of which would presumably help farm
exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are sure to turn this conflict into an election
issue in a year when they need a swing of only 11 seats to regain
control of the House. In Montana, for instance, Robert Deschamps,
the Democrat challenging the state's only congressman, Rick Hill, a
Republican in his first term, is making changes in the 1996 farm
law a major part of his platform.
</P>
<P>
   According to Congressional Quarterly, an authoritative source of
information about Congress, Republicans hold nearly two-thirds of
the 57 congressional seats representing districts in which at least
60 percent of the population lives outside metropolitan areas. A
clear majority of these districts favored Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But John Morgan, a Republican political consultant, said he did
not think his party needed to worry on this score. ``There aren't
that many seats left that turn on farm issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ross, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Iowa and a specialist in rural politics, agreed with
Morgan's assessment that farm issues would not cause many
congressional seats to change hands. ``The cities and the small
towns,'' he said, ``that's where the votes are.''

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Amid the turmoil here that has followed the
abrupt death of the opposition leader Moshood Abiola, there lurks a
simmering anger against the United States, which was so
conspicuously present at the moment of Abiola's demise Tuesday, but
generally absent as Nigeria had slipped into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was America over the past four years while my husband
was in jail?'' asked a grief-stricken Mrs. Bosede Gloria Abiola as
she mourned at Mr. Abiola's home. ``America has done nothing and I
find it very strange and suspicious that at the very moment when he
died, American officials were watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Abiola's sentiments are by no means isolated. Femi Falana,
a prominent opposition lawyer well known at the U.S. Embassy here,
has gone as far as to demand the detention of the Undersecretary of
State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, who was with
Abiola when he died of what Nigerian authorities have called
cardiac arrest. ``He is needed here as a witness,'' Mr. Falana
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, grief and frustration are at fever pitch among
Abiola's followers, and America may be no more than a convenient
target. But the extraordinary shifts here over the past month _
from repressive dictatorship to tentative opening, from hope that
Abiola would be freed to disorientation at his loss _ have
underscored the challenge now being posed by Nigerians for America
to rethink its relationship with Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge is being posed most clearly by the very people
angriest about Abiola's death; beneath the expressions of suspicion
and resentment they direct at the United States lies a sense that a
closer involvement by Washington from now on may be Nigeria's best
hope for assuring a passage to democracy. Put bluntly, there is a
void here, and it seems that if America does not move to help fill
it, an already tense situation could become more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   While Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the new military leader, is
talking of ``the imperative'' of democracy, there are no credible
political parties, scant recent tradition of democracy, no
surviving figure with the breadth of appeal of Abiola and serious
ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole transition will be treacherous and will require an
international monitoring process in which the United States could
play a leading role,'' said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria lies at the distant antipode of Bill Clinton's ``new
Africa,'' the land of promise and economic change energetically
showcased on the president's recent visit to several African
states. Indeed this country, which Clinton avoided, amounts to
towering testimony to just how deep into misery a potentially
wealthy nation can be dragged by mismanagement, corruption and
oppression.
</P>
<P>
   There is' no gas at the pumps here although Nigeria is a major
exporter of oil, earning over $10 billion a year in hard currency
from oil sales. Per capita annual income has fallen to about $250.
Power cuts are frequent; some telephone lines simply lie collapsed
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Street hawkers sell everything from bifocals to calculators in a
bid to get by. Markets sell slabs of meat beside open sewage in
central Lagos. The education system, once one of Africa's best, is
falling apart. ``Nobody wants to be a teacher,'' commented a weary
Lagos resident. ``Everyone wants to be a customs officer because of
the bribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such disintegration _ moral, social and economic _ reflects the
five years of ruinous rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died suddenly
last month of what was officially called a heart attack. The United
States imposed sanctions on Nigeria while the the general ruled,
and called periodically for Abiola's release after he was
imprisoned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with Abacha already dead, Pickering came to press
personally for Abiola's release _ but, in the words of one official
here, ``he scarcely managed to get past the formalities.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, what America did not do over the past few years
that made some Nigerians simmer with the anger they expressed when
Abiola died. While Abiola was in jail, U.S. calls for his release
were not accompanied by any insistence that Nigeria should respect
the results of the presidential election that Abiola appeared to
have won when the army annulled it in 1993. A certain U.S.
ambivalence about the opposition leader often seemed to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration avoided invoking the most potent
potential weapon of protest _ U.S. sanctions on Nigeria's oil
exports. Indeed, U.S. oil companies sharply increased their
investments here to about $7 billion during the Abacha years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Americanism is a source of concern,'' said one
official in Lagos. ``It is not that widespread, but it is more
widespread than I would like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, for many Nigerians, the most tangible contribution the
United States could now make would be to coax Abubakar to adopt a
fairly rapid timetable for a shift to democracy and then oblige him
to stick to it. The General has made clear that he wants to get
sanctions lifted _ particularly those that prevent Nigeria from
buying military spare parts. That seems to give the United States
some leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's new ruler attended military training programs in the
United States and officials said he is generally viewed as well
disposed toward Washington. For now, he appears to have convinced
U.S. officials of his good faith.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears to loom for the Clinton administration, in this
nation of 105 million people, is a critical test of the relative
weight it gives to its political and economic interests. The U.S.
investments here in oil are huge, and to be viable they depend on
stability. But the promised Nigerian shift to democracy will be an
inherently unstable process.

VOTE PLACES HABIBIE IN FIRM CONTROL OF INDONESIAN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie,
consolidated his hold over the country's politics on Saturday when
one of his close advisers won a hotly contested vote to lead the
country's dominant political party.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first electoral test for the man who was almost
nobody's choice to succeed President Suharto six weeks ago, and who
many people believed would hold office only fleetingly.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's control over the party greatly improves his ability to
set the political agenda and remain in office at least until the
end of next year, when he has scheduled a parliamentary vote for a
new president.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's candidate, Akbar Tanjung, who is his executive
secretary, defeated Edy Sudrajat, a former armed forces chief, who
according to some political analysts had the behind-the-scenes
support of Suharto. Suharto, who stepped down in May in the face of
widespread protests, is moving on several fronts to try to protect
his family's wealth and business interests, Indonesian officials
say. He has used the governing party, Golkar, as a vehicle to wield
his personal power since it was formed in 1964, and a daughter and
son still hold leading positions in the party. Akbar vowed to
change things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for Akbar among regional party delegates, at the end of
a three-day conference, was 17-10. It was the first time in three
decades that the party leadership had been decided by a vote,
rather than by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success on Saturday, Habibie has not yet won broad
backing within the political establishment and his continued tenure
is a source of discontent among many Indonesians who had hoped for
a clean break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what steps he has taken, many Indonesians just do not
think he is credible as a president. An aeronautical engineer who
served as Suharto's minister of research and technology, Habibie
was perceived by many people as a political lightweight. As
Suharto's longtime friend and hand-picked vice president, he is
seen by many as too closely associated with the 32-year rule of his
predecessor to be the standard bearer for reform.
</P>
<P>
   According to his own account, Habibie was as surprised as
anybody when Suharto resigned suddenly on May 21, leaving the
leadership of the world's fourth-most-populous country in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still in survivability mode,'' said Marzuki Darusman, a
leading human rights lawyer. ``Let's not talk about credibility
yet. We still have some way to go until we reach that point. But at
some point people will realize, `He's still here,' and that will
make him a bit more credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has been doing more than surviving. From his first day
in office he has set an energetic pace and a populist tone that are
in sharp contrast with the style and substance of Suharto. He has
amazed people with his enthusiastic public style of leadership,
visiting marketplaces, touring riot-damaged neighborhoods and
holding long news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto just listened,'' said Donald Emmerson, an expert on
Indonesia who teaches political science at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. ``You never quite knew what was going on in
his mind. Habibie just talks and talks and talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has freed some political prisoners and promised to free
more and he has opened a dialogue over the future of the disputed
territory of East Timor. He has reached out to the Chinese minority
that was victimized during rioting in May and he has made a show of
consulting with his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that he is sincere in trying to get as
much done as possible during his transition period,'' Marzuki said.
``He is in a very real way trying to pull himself away from his
original circle and reaching out to the public. So somewhere people
will just have to meet him halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie also benefits from the disarray of his many opponents,
who are reveling in the country's new political openness and are
pursuing a range of different agendas. In a country that for three
decades permitted only three political parties, more than 30 new
parties have registered in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie has without a doubt surprised his critics,'' said
Emmerson. ``The expectations that many observers had of him were
low. The expectations were that he would be a disaster, so from
that perspective he looks relatively good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Habibie's hold on office remains tenuous. He has
virtually no independent political base and he faces an economic
disaster that has only grown worse since it contributed to the fall
of his predecessor. According to private estimates, inflation this
year could approach or surpass 100 percent and unemployment could
reach 20 percent. Close to half the population of 210 million is
predicted to fall below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which grew by nearly 8 percent a year over the last
decade, could contract by 10 percent to 15 percent this year,
according to the International Monetary Fund. And in what has
become the most symbolic indicator for Indonesian well-being, the
currency, the rupiah, has fallen to about 15,000 to the dollar,
from about 8,000 when Habibie took office. The declining value of
the currency is one of the most damaging signals for Habibie's
prospects and could ultimately be more significant than his
political victory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Indonesia is that we don't have confidence
because there is a debate over the legitimacy of the government,''
said Laksamana Sukardi, a leading economist. ``We might like to
give Habibie the benefit of the doubt, but he is not getting it
from the markets. The markets are the main constituent of the
Indonesian economy, and they still say Indonesia is not the place
to invest. They are waiting for the bottom. Where is the bottom?
Are we going to be like Somalia or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's economic team and international donors are now
concentrating on emergency measures in the face of looming food
shortages. Habibie drew gasps from economists last week when he
suggested that Indonesians fast two times a week _ as he does for
health and religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's desperation, when you're telling people to fast,''
Emmerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their calls for an early transition of power, Habibie's
opponents have offered few specific proposals for a mechanism for
change. When Suharto resigned, he left his ruling structure, and
its personnel, intact. The country faces a problem in which the
incumbent leadership must legislate its own replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's plan is to draw up new electoral laws that would allow
more parties and revise the current system of representation, which
is geared to perpetuating Suharto's power. By December, he says, he
intends to convene a special legislative assembly to set a date for
elections, in May or June next year, moving up the date that is
currently set for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In January, new electoral laws would be enacted and preparations
would begin for the spring vote. That vote would choose an
electoral assembly, which would meet before the end of the year to
choose the next president. Habibie has not ruled out running for a
new term. &QL;

RUSSIA CROSSES FIRST HURDLE FOR GIANT LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The international effort to calm Russia's shaky
financial markets began to fall into place Saturday, as Russian and
World Bank officials completed negotiations on a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said they expected the loan would range
between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That sum is a small part of the more than $20 billion the
Yeltsin government is seeking from international financial
institutions and Western commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the World Bank talks is a sign that headway
is being made toward assembling the larger loan package.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord requires the Russians to take steps to
introduce more competition in Russia's gas and electrical sectors,
which have been dominated by powerful monopolies. It also lays the
groundwork for reform of Russia's railways and and encourages more
privatization of state-owned enterprises, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the urgency of Russia's financial crisis, Michael
Carter, the head of the World Bank office here, completed talks
with Sergei Vasiliev, his Russian counterpart, at 1 a.m. Saturday.
The accord was then e-mailed to Washington at 4 a.m. for formal
approval by the World Bank's management.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's economy continues to deteriorate, Western and
Russian officials have stepped up their efforts to put together a
rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   Intensive talks continued Saturday with John Odling-Smee, the
lead negotiator from the International Monetary Fund, who arrived
in Moscow Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the state of the Russian economy, the Clinton
Administration has urged that the negotiations be brought to a
close. The hope is that the IMF's negotiations will be completed
and a successful outcome announced before the financial markets
open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund initially proposed $5.8 billion in new loans but has
rethought its position in response to pressure from the U.S.
Treasury Department, Western investors and the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they hope the IMF will provide at least
$10 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's financial crisis deepened in May, Odling-Smee
indicated he did not see the need for more assistance. But
Saturday, Odling-Smee was described by one person taking part in
the talks as negotiating ``efficiently but without much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   As the talks went into the evening, Russian and IMF officials
were said to be close to settling the paramount question of how
much and how quickly to cut the federal deficit. But there were
still differences over amendments to the tax code that were
proposed by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering out an agreement with the World Bank and the IMF is
just part of the Yeltsin government's problem. It still has to win
approval of many of the measures in the coming week from the
Communist-dominated Parliament. It is also trying to negotiate $10
billion in loans from Western commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin met Saturday at his dacha with top aides to
discuss political and economic strategy. The aides at the session
included Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko; Sergei Dubinin, the
chairman of the Central Bank; Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov;
and Anatoly Chubais, the lead negotiator with the IMF and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president on the whole approved the progress of the talks
and instructed a completion of the talks in a compressed period,''
the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord set Saturday would not require the breakup
of Gazprom, the giant natural gas monopoly. Gazprom is not only an
economic behemeth but one of the last symbols of Soviet power. The
Communists denounce suggestions that Gazprom be broken up to foster
competition as a Western plot to destroy what is left of Russian
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord, however, does seek to encourage more
competition and to curb Gazprom's powers. It would change the tax
system to make it easier for other gas producers to enter the
market. It also stipulates that other producers should have access
to Gazprom's pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   To make the company's finances more open, the accounting of its
gas production operation and its pipeline operations are to be
separated.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord also aims to limit the dominance of
Russia's electrical monopoly. And to encourage more privatization
generally, it would shorten the list of so-called state-run
strategic enterprises that cannot be sold off.
</P>
<P>
   Another aim of the accord is to encourage more efficient and
competitive rail transport. Russian passenger transportation has
been subsidized by freight tariffs and this has increased the
burden on the ailing industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reforms being planned will take months, if not
years, to fully carry out and accomplishing them will be the litmus
test for the young Kiriyenko team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been given a chance,'' one Western
specialist said. ``But now it has to make a sustained effort. The
key thing is to make this work.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The potential nuclear arms race between India and
Pakistan is an uneasy and unwelcome test of how to get along in a
world where non-proliferation appears to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States and the Soviet Union confronted one
another at the beginning of the nuclear age, they faced a similar
test. With time, they stumbled into a doctrine of ``mutual assured
destruction,'' and it became their best guarantee of security. They
never used the ultimate weapon against one another. In fact, they
never fought directly in a hot war of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   So MAD _ the doctrine that two adversaries armed to the teeth
with nuclear weapons won't go to war because they know they can't
win one _ became as good a theory as the world had for how to make
a nuclear standoff stable.
</P>
<P>
   Can it work just as well between India and Pakistan as it did
between the United States and the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   Most of those in Washington who worry about such questions are,
unfortunately, gloomy. Like Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, they are working _ and hoping against hope _ to convince
the Indians and Pakistanis to stop where they are, halt testing and
refrain from turning their nuclear knowledge into weapons. That
hope was not bolstered last week when Congress, out of deference to
American farmers, voted to lift sanctions on grain sales to India
and Pakistan that had been intended to punish them for their
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, director of the Non-Proliferation Project at
the Carnegie Endowment, says that every time the Pentagon has
conducted a war game between a nuclear-armed India and Pakistan,
the result is a nuclear exchange, something that does not happen
between Iran and the United States or Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say it, but South Asia is fundamentally different
than the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Cirincione said.
``If both India and Pakistan deployed nuclear weapons, I think it
would almost certainly lead to a nuclear exchange in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say senior U.S. officials and analysts, is not
India, per se, nor even the smaller and altogether more fragile
nation of Pakistan, but their history, proximity and relatively
primitive technology. All of these factors, they say, argue against
South Asia achieving the kind of stability that allowed Russians
and Americans to survive the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   These are powerful points. But each assumption about what is
most dangerous in a nuclear race is speculative rather than
demonstrated, because the world has not yet reached a point where
the theory fails.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the only standard of success available:
the Cold War. Even during those 40 years, there were some terribly
close calls, most notably during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when senior U.S. military officials urged President John F. Kennedy
to use nuclear weapons against the Soviets. That raises the
question of what role chance played in the decisions that kept the
peace once the brink of war was reached, and whether it is just
arrogance to say, in hindsight, that it was inevitable that the
Americans and Soviets, for reasons of culture and sophistication,
would pull back.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of racism or arrogance aside, there is general
agreement on the ways in which a nuclear-armed South Asia would
find it hard to manage confrontations in the same ways the Cold War
antagonists did. But the same facts can often be looked at in a
different way _ revealing not so much that the Indian subcontinent
is a safe place, but how little can be known about just what makes
a nuclear confrontation dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major reasons why some experts on the Cold War are
so worried about South Asia:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unlike India and Pakistan, Washington and Moscow share no
common border, let alone a disputed one, and had a considerable
buffer zone between them _ oceans in the first place, and Eastern
Europe in the second. This, the experts believe, gave Washington
and Moscow fewer flashpoints and more time for diplomatic maneuver
when tensions rose than India and Pakistan have. (On the other
hand, the very proximity of India and Pakistan could argue for more
caution, given the vagaries of fallout, if nothing else.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington and Moscow never fought one another, while the
Indians and Pakistanis, in 50 years of hostility, fought in 1948,
1965 and 1971. Even more unsettling, Indian and Pakistani troops
today face one another in the fiercely disputed territory of
Kashmir, shell each other's villages and fire on one another's
positions, and soldiers die. (On the other hand, both countries
have exercised considerable restraint since India carried out its
first nuclear test in 1974, and have not let tensions produce
another war.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington and Moscow developed a triad of nuclear weapons _
deliverable by rocket, plane and submarine _ that made real the
notion of mutually assured destruction. But with so few nuclear
devices, both Indian and Pakistani military planners have to fear a
successful first strike, or destruction of their nuclear capacity
by conventional attack. (On the other hand, the Cold War had an
equally uncertain beginning, and even today, the Russians take
seriously the threat of nuclear pre-emption by conventional cruise
missiles.)
</P>
<P>
   _ It took Washington and Moscow nearly 15 years to develop a
reliable command and control system for their nuclear weapons and a
reliable nuclear doctrine to go along with it. For the first four
years of the nuclear age, the United States was alone in having the
bomb, and for the next 10, there were no intercontinental missiles,
only bombers. So the two countries had the luxury of time to do
their planning and confidence-building. They built a formal means
of contacting one another in a crisis, including constantly
monitored hot lines. (On the other hand, in 1995, after the Soviet
Union collapsed, President Boris Yeltsin pulled out Russia's
equivalent of the nuclear football, containing launch codes, when
Russian warning systems interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as a possible nuclear attack. The Russians had
lost a notification they received from the Norwegians, and experts
still wonder, uneasily, why the Russians were in such confusion.)
</P>
<P>
   Caveats aside, it is South Asia's lack of technological
sophistication that has experts and officials most concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries military people the most isn't detonation by
design, but by unauthorized use, screw-up and miscalculation, a
stray electron or misreading the screen,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies security.
``There have been in the past, for whatever reasons, major
explosions at ordnance factories in Pakistan. What if there was a
major explosion at a nuclear storage site, or a major accident at a
missile production or storage facility? What would be the pressures
then?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than discussing a sophisticated early warning system,
Krepon points out, India and Pakistan are talking of developing
nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach each other's major cities in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Washington and Moscow shouldn't just provide India and
Pakistan with the doctrine and equipment for safe deterrence,
Talbott scoffed at the idea of some ``manual'' for a South Asian
MAD. ``If they locked themselves into the mentality of MAD, they
will then be tempted into _ like us _ a considerable escalation of
the arms race,'' he said. Further tests would be followed by
weaponization and by deployment of missiles, ``and then we'd be off
to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may also be that in the new world of proliferation, even
for the best and brightest, the most successful balance of terror
may result from luck as much as doctrine. Having been lucky thus
far, there is no guarantee that the world will continue to be so
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just assemble all the risk factors and multiply it out,''
Cirincione said of South Asia. ``This is the most dangerous and
unstable military situation in the world.''

WALL ST. TO ROLL CLOCK AHEAD TO CHECK ON YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For computer wizards on Wall Street, Monday of this
week will be Dec. 29, 1999, a step into electronic time travel that
will be studied anxiously around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   After months of preparation, the United States' leading brokers,
major exchanges, clearinghouses and depository companies will begin
mock trading in the widest-ranging test yet by any industry of how
well computers will cope with the transition to the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, sponsored by the Securities Industry Association, are
designed to help brokers and other key players in the $270 billion
industry figure out whether their computer systems are ready to
handle trades that will settle on Jan. 3, 2000, the first business
day of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, the industry will reset the clocks on
the test computers and investigate what might happen to anyone
trading stocks, options or corporate and municipal bonds on Dec. 30
and 31, 1999, and Jan. 3 and 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been left to chance. The multimillion-dollar effort
is supervised by Coopers &AMP; Lybrand following trading scripts
carefully developed by the participants with the help of outside
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Leonard De Trizio, vice president at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. in
charge of the computers that support equity trading, knows that he
will be selling 800 shares of a fictional Big Board company with
the ticker symbol KDD at 9:30 Monday morning, and he knows that
Morgan Stanley will be buying it, while Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. will be
selling Home Shopping Network convertible bonds to Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The participants are looking for signs of what is widely known
as the millennium bug, the catchall name for a variety of
electronic foul-ups that are likely to occur when computers fail to
recognize that the first days of the new century come after the
last days of the old one. The problem stems from the way many
microprocessors and computer programs use only two digits to refer
to the year in dates _ 98 for 1998, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Many chips and programs do not accept a low number like 00 for
the year 2000 or 01 for 2001 as valid dates that follow the 99 for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the problem is that computers often react to
these unrecognized years in unpredictable ways. Some spew
inaccurate data. Others make faulty calculations. Some crash
immediately. Others appear to function normally but then cannot be
restarted once they have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists have talked about the millennium problem
for decades. But only recently have businesses and public officials
begun to recognize how widely dates are used in computing and to
take seriously warnings that the dawn of the new century could see
widespread disruptions in daily life, at the very least, and deadly
accidents or perhaps a global economic recession if the millennium
problem is not tamed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the securities industry is the first to conduct tests
involving connections between many computer users and is publishing
vast amounts of information about the results on its World Wide Web
site (www.sia.com), year 2000 experts say that the results of these
tests could end up having a huge effect on morale in the rapidly
growing legions of specialists working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that they are setting a standard of openness for the
entire corporate sector,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist of
Deutsche Bank Securities. Yardeni has become one of the
highest-profile year 2000 pessimists, predicting a 70 percent
chance of worldwide recession stemming from computer problems
related to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes badly, though, corporations may be more reluctant
to share information, and more people are going to come around to
my view of the risks,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Those managing the securities tests are discouraging any attempt
to draw broad conclusions from them. The managers point out, for
example, that the tests will deal with very small volumes of
fictional securities, and they describe the exercise as a mere
dress rehearsal for high-volume tests planned for next spring. Some
major computer systems have been completely excluded, including
those that manage dividends and interest, margin trading and client
account records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, only the most common types of trades and securities
will be tested this week, although separate tests have been
scheduled for government bonds and a limited test has already been
run on mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with this isn't rocket science, but there is a
mountain of details,'' said Donald Kittell, the association's
executive vice president. ``People don't realize that a trade may
go through 40 to 50 steps from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The securities companies participating in the test that starts
Sunday account for about half the trading volume in stocks, bonds,
options and other major financial instruments. Each agreed to set
up a discrete computer operation to run the tests. In the United
States alone, securities companies are expected to spend $3 billion
to $5 billion addressing year 2000 and related computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the millennium actually arrives, Wall Street's ability
to function will depend not just on the internal systems it began
to test today but on the preparedness of markets overseas, where
many players offset any bets placed domestically.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Wall Street's success at ushering in the
millennium will also depend heavily on the year 2000 readiness of
New York City's power, water and telecommunications utilities, of
the elevators leading to the trading rooms and of countless other
systems that are beyond its ability to test.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All of this underscores what many computer experts consider one
of the most troubling aspects of the year 2000 challenge. Each
phase of the millennium problem _ from identifying vulnerable
systems to figuring out remedies to testing fixes _ has proved more
complicated, time-consuming and expensive than had been expected.
The emerging consensus has been that testing has been the most
widely underestimated challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants are consistently warning that very few corporations,
government agencies or other computer-dependent enterprises will
end up having enough time and resources to do as much testing as
they should. And even the best testing programs can only check
through a fraction of the scenarios that computers will encounter
in daily operations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a setback if this doesn't go well,'' said William
Ulrich, a year 2000 consultant in Soquel, Calif., ``because these
guys are way out in front.'' &QL;

LOS ANGLES _ Rafael Salazar's get-out-of-jail-free card didn't
work.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he hit a trailer truck and spun into a center divider on
the Pomona Freeway in April 1997, the consul general at the
Republic of Guatemala's Los Angeles mission flashed his
identification for a Highway Patrol officer, expecting diplomatic
immunity would get him released.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was handcuffed, driven to the station and given a
breathalyzer. Later, he was charged with drunk driving just like
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar responded by suing just about everyone connected to the
case _ including a Municipal Court judge. He claims that Article 41
of the Vienna Agreement makes him immune from misdemeanor arrest.
He's seeking $1 million from the state, the CHP and the arresting
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar's attorney said the criminal prosecution will outrage
the world.

   ``When Barney Fife arrests a foreign diplomat in Mayberry, the
ripple effect spreads to all foreign governments,'' attorney
Stephen Shikes said. ``This case opens up a world of harassment for
consulates everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salazar was promoted by his government to be an
ambassador in another country.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar's decision to file a lawsuit might seem unusual, given
that police say his blood alcohol level was 2 1/2 times the legal
limit. Perhaps even more unbelievable: He may have some legal
ground upon which to stand.
</P>
<P>
   From parking tickets to suspicion of drunk driving, laws are set
up to protect diplomats and consulates like Salazar from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, law enforcement officials have been
challenging immunity protection with several successful
prosecutions of foreign government officials who thought they were
legally bulletproof in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been tougher for diplomats. The political winds
are shifting,'' said Southwestern University law professor Robert
Lutz. ``The police used to turn the other way in these cases. Now I
don't think it's in their interest politically.''
</P>
<P>
   If local precedent is the standard, Salazar had good reason to
think he wasn't going to get charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Los Angeles Police Department reported that a Saudi
Arabian consul general was accused of taking some jewelry after
crashing his car through the security fence at a Bel-Air Estates
home. Officers suspected that he was under the influence of
alcohol, but prosecutors declined to charge him with burglary.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
spokesman said the Saudi Arabia's consular status didn't have a
role in the decision not to file charges. But police officials
admitted that a non-diplomat involved in a similar incident
probably would have been arrested and charged for public
drunkenness and driving under the influence _ both misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   By international law, consul generals enjoy an intermediate
level of freedom from arrest _ Salazar's identification told
officers not to arrest him ``except on a warrant for felony
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, CHP and LAPD officials say they can always restrain
a diplomat who endangers the public safety.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS.)  &QL;
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We'll put them in a taxicab, call a consulate or do whatever
we have to do to stop them from hurting others,'' LAPD Lt. Wallace
Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the immediate danger is thwarted, Graves said police
are instructed to treat the diplomat differently than a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we've stopped them from doing things that are dangerous
to other people, we can't arrest them per se,'' Graves said. ``If
they want to walk off, they can walk off.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the lawsuit, Deputy District Attorney Richard De La
Sota noted Salazar was not booked at the station and was taken home
by a CHP officer because his car was wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is whether Mr. Salazar was engaged in the
performance of his consular functions while driving on the Pomona
Freeway in his own automobile with a blood alcohol level of .20 and
slamming into the rear of a tractor-trailer rig,'' De La Sota said.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from State Department legal counsel backed De La Sota's
assessment, pointing out that Salazar's ``consular immunity'' is
dependent on whether or not he is at work.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar's attorneys claim he was en route to his office when the
crash occurred and that CHP officers made an illegal arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal Court Judge Conrad Aragon turned down Salazar's motion
to dismiss the case in February and set a July 27 trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar responded with a lawsuit in federal court, asking for
dismissal of the charges and damages to be assessed. The case is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz says state prosecutors' best chance of convicting a
consulate or diplomat is to convince a lawbreaker's own government
to waive immunity.
</P>
<P>
   That happened last October in Washington, D.C., where a Republic
of Georgia embassy official pleaded guilty to involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy official, Gueorgui Makharadze, was stripped of his
diplomatic immunity after he killed a teen-age girl while driving
drunk at more than 70 miles an hour in a 25 mile-an-hour zone.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's long-running war over parking
tickets given to United Nations diplomats led to an agreement that
resulted in penalties being imposed _ even though some said it
violated the Vienna Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cut a deal in Salazar's case, the Guatemalan
government promoted him twice since the incident and he now is
ambassador to Belize, according to consulate officials. Under U.S.
law, an ambassador has even more immunity than a consul general.
</P>
<P>
   Shikes acknowledges that some U.S. citizens may not want to
believe that a diplomat can claim immunity. But he feels that
foreigners won't understand the district attorney's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a higher and more important consideration _ the
relation between the U.S. and the rest of the world,'' Shikes said.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz explains that consulates and diplomats may have to get used
to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomacy is part legal and part politics,'' Lutz said. ``The
whole system is premised on give-and-take.'' &QL;

END IS NEAR FOR WEST BANK DEAL, BUT SUCCESS STILL UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may be one of the longest ``endgames'' in recent
diplomatic history, but Israeli and American officials say they
expect a conclusion to negotiations on an Israeli pullback from the
West Bank by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   What they refuse to predict, though, is whether the conclusion
will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has spoken to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least seven times in the last week,
and some of their conversations were heated, officials said. She
spoke to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday in what her
spokesman, James Rubin, called ``intensive endgame negotiations''
for a deal the United States has been pushing for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we achieve success is very much an open question at
this time,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pressure on the Israelis, the Americans are resisting a
request from Netanyahu to send the special Middle East envoy,
Dennis Ross, back to the region. The Americans are concerned that a
Ross trip now will make it seem that a deal is nearly done, and it
is not, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Americans intend to make ``a real push'' for a deal
in the next 10 days or so, hoping to conclude one by the end of the
month, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The American plan calls for an Israeli withdrawal from a further
13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, in return for specific
and measurable Palestinian actions against terrorism and an
immediate start to negotiations on a final settlement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has regularly said that 13 percent is a threat to
Israel's security. But he is expected to agree to a face-saving
formula that will leave the last 3 percent in a more transitional
status, preserving Israeli rights to provide security. This 3
percent includes some of the more isolated Jewish settlements and
other strategic locations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Palestinians will agree to such a formula is another
question.
</P>
<P>
   But other important gaps with the Israelis still remain,
officials from both sides say. They include Netanyahu's insistence
that the Palestinians convene their main decision-making panel to
change their Covenant, removing clauses that call for the
destruction of Israel. The Palestinians argue that the changes have
already been made, as vouched for in a letter to the Americans, and
that nothing more is required.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also not satisfied with extradition procedures for
Palestinians charged with crimes by the Israelis. Currently, if a
Palestinian charged with a crime by the Israelis is also under a
Palestinian charge, there is no extradition, and the Israelis say
Arafat insures that there is always some pending charge against
anyone the Israelis want to extradite.
</P>
<P>
   There is also disagreement still on the amount of
``front-loading'' the Israelis want in return for their most
critical redeployments. In other words, such questions as when,
during the 12 weeks of the phased withdrawals, the Palestinians
must fulfill pledges to retrieve excess guns, for instance, or to
provide lists of security police in excess of the numbers allowed
under previous agreements are still to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is trying to make the American proposals workable from
the standpoint of Israeli security,'' said Dore Gold, Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   If those complications were not enough, it is not clear that the
Palestinians will agree to all the ``refinements,'' as American
diplomats call them, already worked out with the Israelis to the
original American plan.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, two Palestinian negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Nabil
Shaath, arrived in Washington on Thursday, invited by Albright. But
the Americans are also pressing Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai to go over the changes themselves with
Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are arguing that Israelis and Palestinians will
have to talk about these issues at some time. But the Israelis say
that Washington should sell these refinements to the Palestinians,
since they emerged from American ideas. ``The Israelis are saying
to us, `Why don't you go sit on the Palestinians for the next six
months the way you've been sitting on us?''' an American official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, officials say, both Albright and Netanyahu agreed to
make separate and presumably coordinated approaches to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Albright made another appeal for Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue. ``We don't think that this impasse can be resolved if
they do not talk with each other,'' she said. &QL;

 &HT;    CONTROVERSY WILL OUTLIVE BURIAL OF THE LAST CZAR
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, July 12 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On Friday, Russia will hold a royal burial unfit for a
king.
</P>
<P>
   On the 80th anniversary of the murder of the last czar, Nicholas
II, by a Bolshevik firing squad, his charred bones and those of his
family will be laid to rest in the former imperial capital of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The government had hoped it would be a day of national
reconciliation, a symbolic opportunity ``to stop the civil war
which has been smoldering in Russia since 1917,'' said the
government official in charge of the burial.
</P>
<P>
   This fractured society is still reeling from a brutal century of
imperial dictatorship, Communist revolution and rule, and the
difficult ongoing transition toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Early plans envisioned a majestic ceremony filled with Russian
pride and attracting royalty and world dignitaries such as Queen
Elizabeth II of Britain and First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, the Kremlin simply wants the burial over.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a famous funeral few wish to attend, and a
powerful example of Russia's difficult struggle to resolve its
past.
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Boris Yeltsin nor Patriarch Alexy II, head of
the Russian Orthodox Church, plan to be there. Neither will some of
the more prominent direct descendants from the Romanov family,
including 16-year-old Prince Georgy, living in Spain, a leading
aspirant to the throne, should it ever be restored.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the disarray is the powerful Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rigorous genetic testing of the remains, the church
expressed lingering doubts about the true identity of the bones
recovered from a shallow grave and publicly disclosed as the Soviet
Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Tiptoeing a fine theological line, the church has authorized
local priests to perform the burial rites, but has instructed
bishops and other church elders to shun the St. Petersburg
ceremony. The service will be intentionally ambiguous, since the
church questions whether it is entombing the genuine remains.
</P>
<P>
   The decision began a landslide of official reluctance to fully
support the royal burial.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin chose to skip the service and toned down initial plans
for an extravagant ceremony, apparently mindful of how such a showy
display would play among Russians suffering in the poor economy.
(Coal miners and other workers have been striking for weeks to
receive back wages as Russia seeks international financial aid to
avoid a economic collapse.)
</P>
<P>
   With the heads of state and the national church skipping the
ceremony, the anticipated throngs of dignitaries and royalty from
around the world are passing it up, too. Ambassador to Moscow James
Collins will represent the United States. Prince Michael of Kent
will be the unofficial representative of the British royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government is spending less than $1 million on the
three-day event, which begins with the departure of the remains
from Yekaterinburg, the city where Nicholas, his wife Alexandria
and their five children were killed.
</P>
<P>
   It will be work as usual as since the government decided not to
declare Friday a national holiday. Even live television coverage
was scaled back, with Russian networks planning only to air
excerpts of the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirova, mother of Prince Georgy, called
the planned funeral, ``yet another insult to the memory of the
royal martyrs'' and said the family considers it only a temporary
interment until the controversy of identification has been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of becoming an act of national conciliation and
repentance . . . the burial has provoked disputes and has become a
new reason for confrontation in Russian society,'' she told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communists, whose forebears shot Nicholas and his
family, had from the start opposed plans for a grand ceremony. They
recall the Romanov family's ruthless 300-year reign and now are
quietly gloating over the plagued burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been nothing but a political embarrassment for the
government,'' said Sergei Bukin, a high-ranking Communist Party
official.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the ceremony still hold hopes that the
ever-capricious Yeltsin may decide to make the trip to St.
Petersburg. Yeltsin aides defend the scaled-down burial plans
saying the government is merely following the church's lead.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of thorough research, including DNA analyses by
U.S., British and Russian experts, a Russian government commission
concluded in January that the fragmented skeletal remains were
those of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their five children
and four family servants.
</P>
<P>
   The task required all that genetic research could muster. After
the family and attendants were shot by a firing squad in 1918,
their bodies were thrown into a mine shaft, later recovered and
burned, and then thrown into a shallow grave and covered with
sulfuric acid in attempts by the revolutionaries to destroy
evidence of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   The burial site was discovered in the 1970s and the bones
exhumed in 1991. The government study concluded that the remains
corresponded to five members of one family, and four people who
were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of the two
parents. Genetic matching concluded that the mother was kin to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra, and the father was related
to several other living Romanovs who donated blood for the study.
The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is missing,
as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no doubts about the remains,'' said Viktor
Aksyuchits, the government official in charge of the arrangements.
``They are 100 percent the remains of the Romanov family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is not so convinced. But the church's
decision to withhold its endorsement of the burial has more to do
with politics than science.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian church is seeking to mend relations with Orthodox
believers living in exile since the Bolshevik revolution. The
increasingly influential growing Orthodox Church Abroad,
established in the United States, already has conferred sainthood
on Nicholas. As a result, it tenaciously has refused to accept the
remains in Russia as those of the last czar.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow patriarch also is considering canonizing the family,
but the process could last years. In the meantime, the Russian
church does not want to alienate followers who share the view of
the church in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of knotty religion, politics and
symbolism, the remains on Wednesday will be placed in nine tiny oak
caskets -- each is just 48 inches long by 20 inches wide -- and a
short requiem will be sung at a local church. The next day, they
will be flown from Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There, a cortege will whisk the caskets from the airport to the
Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul. Original plans for an honor
guard to line the 18-mile route have been reduced to guards only at
the airport, the Winter Palace and the cathedral. At the cathedral,
the caskets will lay overnight in a pyramid formation: the four
servants on the bottom, three children in the middle, and the czar
and his wife at the top.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, wreaths will be laid, a choir will sing, cannons will
thunder and a short service will pray for the souls of the entire
family, including the two children whose bodies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Trinity-St. Sergius monastery near Moscow,
Alexy II, other church leaders and members of the Romanov clan will
gather for a rival service to memorialize the family and all
victims of the Communist era.
</P>
<P>
   Grand or not, the act will be significant, insists Aksyuchits,
the government organizer: ``We are witnesses to an historical event
-- a monarch being buried in a democratic Russian state.''

<P>
   Tiptoeing a fine theological line, the church has authorized
local priests to perform the burial rites, but has instructed
bishops and other church elders to shun the St. Petersburg
ceremony. The service will be intentionally ambiguous, since the
church questions whether it is entombing the genuine remains.
</P>
<P>
   The decision began a landslide of official reluctance to fully
support the royal burial.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin chose to skip the service and toned down initial plans
for an extravagant ceremony, apparently mindful of how such a showy
display would play among Russians suffering in the poor economy.
(Coal miners and other workers have been striking for weeks to
receive back wages as Russia seeks international financial aid to
avoid a economic collapse.)
</P>
<P>
   With the heads of state and the national church skipping the
ceremony, the anticipated throngs of dignitaries and royalty from
around the world are passing it up, too. Ambassador to Moscow James
Collins will represent the United States. Prince Michael of Kent
will be the unofficial representative of the British royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government is spending less than $1 million on the
three-day event, which begins with the departure of the remains
from Yekaterinburg, the city where Nicholas, his wife Alexandria
and their five children were killed.
</P>
<P>
   It will be work as usual as since the government decided not to
declare Friday a national holiday. Even live television coverage
was scaled back, with Russian networks planning only to air
excerpts of the ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirova, mother of Prince Georgy, called
the planned funeral, ``yet another insult to the memory of the
royal martyrs'' and said the family considers it only a temporary
interment until the controversy of identification has been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of becoming an act of national conciliation and
repentance . . . the burial has provoked disputes and has become a
new reason for confrontation in Russian society,'' she told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communists, whose forebears shot Nicholas and his
family, had from the start opposed plans for a grand ceremony. They
recall the Romanov family's ruthless 300-year reign and now are
quietly gloating over the plagued burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been nothing but a political embarrassment for the
government,'' said Sergei Bukin, a high-ranking Communist Party
official.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the ceremony still hold hopes that the
ever-capricious Yeltsin may decide to make the trip to St.
Petersburg. Yeltsin aides defend the scaled-down burial plans
saying the government is merely following the church's lead.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of thorough research, including DNA analyses by
U.S., British and Russian experts, a Russian government commission
concluded in January that the fragmented skeletal remains were
those of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their five children
and four family servants.
</P>
<P>
   The task required all that genetic research could muster. After
the family and attendants were shot by a firing squad in 1918,
their bodies were thrown into a mine shaft, later recovered and
burned, and then thrown into a shallow grave and covered with
sulfuric acid in attempts by the revolutionaries to destroy
evidence of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   The burial site was discovered in the 1970s and the bones
exhumed in 1991. The government study concluded that the remains
corresponded to five members of one family, and four people who
were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of the two
parents. Genetic matching concluded that the mother was kin to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra, and the father was related
to several other living Romanovs who donated blood for the study.
The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is missing,
as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no doubts about the remains,'' said Viktor
Aksyuchits, the government official in charge of the arrangements.
``They are 100 percent the remains of the Romanov family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is not so convinced. But the church's
decision to withhold its endorsement of the burial has more to do
with politics than science.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian church is seeking to mend relations with Orthodox
believers living in exile since the Bolshevik revolution. The
increasingly influential growing Orthodox Church Abroad,
established in the United States, already has conferred sainthood
on Nicholas. As a result, it tenaciously has refused to accept the
remains in Russia as those of the last czar.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow patriarch also is considering canonizing the family,
but the process could last years. In the meantime, the Russian
church does not want to alienate followers who share the view of
the church in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of knotty religion, politics and
symbolism, the remains on Wednesday will be placed in nine tiny oak
caskets -- each is just 48 inches long by 20 inches wide -- and a
short requiem will be sung at a local church. The next day, they
will be flown from Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   There, a cortege will whisk the caskets from the airport to the
Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul. Original plans for an honor
guard to line the 18-mile route have been reduced to guards only at
the airport, the Winter Palace and the cathedral. At the cathedral,
the caskets will lay overnight in a pyramid formation: the four
servants on the bottom, three children in the middle, and the czar
and his wife at the top.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, wreaths will be laid, a choir will sing, cannons will
thunder and a short service will pray for the souls of the entire
family, including the two children whose bodies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Trinity-St. Sergius monastery near Moscow,
Alexy II, other church leaders and members of the Romanov clan will
gather for a rival service to memorialize the family and all
victims of the Communist era.
</P>
<P>
   Grand or not, the act will be significant, insists Aksyuchits,
the government organizer: ``We are witnesses to an historical event
-- a monarch being buried in a democratic Russian state.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's hardliners are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   A fact brought home recently when conservative clerics -- those
men with the long brown robes, turban-like headwear and cellular
telephones -- hustled around the parliament that they control to
efficiently orchestrate the ouster of moderate President Mohammed
Khatami's top cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   To ordinary Iranians, it was ominous but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   A year into the term of the popular but not-so-powerful
president, the political climate in this country of 60 million
people swings daily between Khatami's quest for reform and
conservative backlashes against him.
</P>
<P>
   While Khatami stocks his government with moderates, the
religious conservatives run the parliament, courts and the
military.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers are now free to take their case to the streets,
their demonstrations are sometimes broken up by semi-official mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The political and cultural clash is laid out in the pages and
offices of the lively Iranian press.
</P>
<P>
   At Shalamche magazine's storefront office, the walls are covered
in burlap, one corner is ringed with sandbags and artillery shells
are used as trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   The young, idealistic, editors do not talk to foreign
journalists, but their magazine defends Islamic values under
attack. Originally dedicated to the memory of the 1980s Iran-Iraq
war, its latest target is across town: The Jameah daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jameah is a snappy broad-sheet that started in the bloom of more
than 300 publications founded since Khatami's election. It pokes
fun at political leaders and prints long interviews with
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Its office is also staffed with young idealists, but it is in a
California-styled villa. A tongue-in-cheek staff petition posted on
the wall asks editors why the swimming pool is empty.
</P>
<P>
   But Jameah has bigger problems than an empty pool. The Iranian
courts have ordered it to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from traditionalism to modernism,'' urges the
paper's editor, Mashallah Shamsolvazeen. ``Don't let this newborn
baby, the (Khatami) election, die now.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters sometimes call themselves ``The May 23
Front,'' referring to the election last year when Khatami stunned
the world by winning 70 percent of the Iranian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Youth and women _ two groups especially hard-pressed under
Iran's strict Islamic rule _ were strong supporters. In his
cautious talk about a ``civil society,'' Khatami offered hope of
more personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The poor were attracted to his pledges to improve the Iranian
economy, largely controlled by quasi-government conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   His win inspires open, but still dangerous, questioning of
whether religious rulers should have the final say in government.
</P>
<P>
   The press is flourishing. Women are asking for more rights to
divorce and for child custody. Unmarried couples feel freer to hold
hands in public.
</P>
<P>
   But, Khatami's mandate recently suffered losses on three fronts:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last month, the parliament, run by Khatami's conservative
election opponent, impeached Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri was a key Khatami confidante whose office gave him a say
in how future elections will be organized and the power to appoint
the mayor's of Iran's cities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, run by religious authorities, has placed Tehran
Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi on trial for corruption. Seen as a
reformer and an effective administrator of the city of 10 million
people, he helped run Khatami's election.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The judiciary, also, ordered the closing of the Jameah
newspaper after complaints were filed against it by a large,
quasi-government business group and the prisons department. The
paper is still running, as it appeals the order.
</P>
<P>
   The attack against Nouri illustrated the hardliners' approach.
</P>
<P>
   They accused him of allowing too many public demonstrations and
replacing too many old administrators. They said crime and disorder
were rising and that he was encouraging supporters of Karbaschi to
challenge the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has preferred one man (Karbaschi) over a nation,'' said
parliament member Taher Taheri(cq). ``He has given permission to
too many to speak out and comment, causing great stress in the
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami supporters say the hardliners know the president is too
popular to attack directly. So they attack his advisers, hoping to
tarnish the president and the idea of reform in this
still-conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever anyone talks about freedom, soon (the hardliners)
connect the word 'freedom' to immorality,'' said student activist
Serajeddin Mirdamad (cq).
</P>
<P>
   Even in south Tehran, a working-class area where people adhere
to strict Muslim customs, they worry about their beloved president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting pressure on him . . . If he weren't limited,
he could do so many good things,'' said Abbas Zavaraian, 35, who
works in his father's ice cream store.
</P>
<P>
   He explains Khatami's popularity simply: ``A good man will be
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives are trying to preserve their power in a
society where the sources of power have always been hard to define
and are now getting even cloudier.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni, is the ultimate
director of the police, military, courts and many business groups.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Khatami, who had served in the government in the
past, to run for president at a time most thought he had no chance
of winning.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Khameni was visibly weak at a public appearance and
Tehran is flush with whispers that he has a terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's own influence is limited both by the narrow powers of
his office and Iran's history of harshness with reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, clerics in the parliament impeached President Abolhasan
Bani Sadr after he tried to centralize power and reform the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami enters while Iran's fortunes are mixed. It has largely
recovered from it's eight-year war against Iraq. It is modern and
productive despite a U.S. trade embargo against this country it
says sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But, slumping oil prices are gouging deficits into the
government's budget and increasing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that ousted the dictatorial Shah of Iran, and they are
restless for material and social freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is wary of giving his opposition any ammunition in their
claims that reform leads to chaos. He consistently urges followers
to stick to only legal, non-violent avenues for activism.
</P>
<P>
   Many have urged him to respond more forcefully, which he finally
did when the parliament fired his interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the impeachment, Khatami appointed Nouri to a
newly created position with broader authority -- a move reportedly
viewed as a direct challenge to the conservative offensive.

 &HT;    CLINTON HOPES TO BUOY YELTSIN AND IMPROVE U.S-RUSSIA RELATIONS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-US-BOX-$ADV11.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ World leaders prefer to hold summits without surprises,
well-scripted meetings before the television cameras which portray
men of action, but where usually nothing much happens.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dangerous prospects of a Russian economic collapse
and a widening war in the Balkans forced U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to wait no longer for a
chance at talks on an serene stage.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S.-Russia summit in 18 months, announced this week,
is scheduled to take place in Moscow in September amid growing
uncertainty about Russia's future and increasingly strained
relations between Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton understands that Yeltsin is in a very difficult
position domestically and the longer he waits to visit the riskier
the situation could become,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy
director of the USA and Canada Institute, a Moscow-based think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-Russian relations have been frozen over the past year,
nothing is happening, and that is a very dangerous thing,''
Kremenyuk added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted the invitation to visit Russia despite the
failure of the opposition-led Russian legislature to fulfill a
request to ratify the START II arms control treaty signed with the
United States in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's mounting economic problems and the spreading
violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the White House
concluded it could no longer wait for a summit celebrating a START
II ratification that is no where in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin needs help, and Clinton has decided to come to his side.
Aides insist the two men enjoy a close, personal rapport,
exchanging telephone calls about once a month and meeting at
international forums, like the May summit of world leaders in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two countries have grown closer since the days of
the Soviet Union and their Cold War rivalry, they are not staunch
allies, a fact clearly demonstrated by an array of foreign policy
differences.
</P>
<P>
   During his recently concluded trip to China, some critics
questioned whether Clinton was neglecting a more important
strategic relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Clinton-Yeltsin summit in March 1997 in Helsinki,
U.S.-Russia relations have soured on issues including NATO
expansion in eastern Europe, international sanctions against Iraq,
and Russian arms and technology sales to Iran and other developing
nations
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit to Moscow is chiefly being characterized by
analysts here as an urgent mission of mercy intended to bolster
Yeltsin's image as a world leader, back his efforts at economic
reform and restore confidence in Russia's sagging financial markets
among foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   An all-out economic meltdown would send consumer prices
skyrocketing, further diminishing Yeltsin's clout and ruining
chances for more democratic and market reforms in the foreseeable
future, analysts predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West doesn't need Yeltsin, but it predicts chaos were he
to be forced from office before his term ended. They don't see a
figure reliable enough to substitute for the current leader,'' said
political scientist Alexei Bogaturov.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to travel to Moscow later
this month for meetings with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to
formulate and agenda for the Clinton-Yeltsin summit.
</P>
<P>
   But just how Clinton's visit will play in Russia is difficult to
predict, given the volatile economy, simmering nationwide labor
strikes and Yeltsin's low ratings in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's early honeymoon years as a champion of Western-style
reform following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 have given way
to disillusionment as most Russians have seen their standard of
living diminished during the long, ongoing transition to democracy
and free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, controlled by
Communists and nationalists hostile to Yeltsin, is scheduled in
September to consider an unpopular, belt-tightening budget and the
long-delayed ratification of the START II agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a political moderate and the Duma's first
deputy speaker, warned that a contentious autumn is looming just as
Clinton arrives in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can safely say that unfortunately it will be a hot autumn,''
he told a news conference this week. It is already clear that
growing arrears on pensions, wages and the defense order will
exacerbate social tensions and popular discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is currently negotiating an aid package with the
International Monetary Fund to help it meet its short-term debt
obligations and strengthen the ruble. But some foreign investors
predict Russia may need $20 billion or mre to restore confidence
in the economy and prevent a devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma is scheduled to meet next Wednesday and Thurday to
consider a austerity measures prompted by the Yeltsin government
and considered necessary before the IMF approves an assistance
package.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic slide -- its markets have lost almost
two-thirds of their value in the past year -- may have prompted the
Clinton White House to abandon hopes of a START II ratification,
which the Duma has announced it will not consider before it
convenes for its fall session.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate ratified the arms control treaty in 1996. But
despite pleas from Yeltsin, the opposition-dominated Duma has
continually put off a vote on the treaty, which would cut Russian
and American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Another pressing issue is Kosovo and the Serbian crackdown on
separatist ethnic Albanian forces. The Clinton administration has
pushed for tougher economic and military sanctions to temper
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and prevent a wider conflict
in the Balkans. Russia has opposed harsh steps against the Serbs,
whom they view as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the United States and Russia have confronted one
another at the United Nations over policy toward Iraq, another
traditional Soviet-era ally where Russia has potentially lucrative
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promise to continue pushing for enlargement of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization also has alarmed Russians, many
of whom regard NATO expansion as an implicit declaration that the
U.S. continues to consider Russia a potential enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the U.S. Senate ratified a NATO agreement to admit three
former Warsaw Pact countries: Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic. Yeltsin is expected to reiterate Russia's opposition to
the expansion, and particularly proposed NATO membership for the
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once part of the
Soviet Union.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Here are the issues facing U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who are scheduled to meet in
Moscow in September:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA'S ECONOMY: The prospect of a crash is spurring Clinton to
visit Moscow. Russia needs an international bailout. Yeltsin and
his democratic reforms could be in danger should the ruble crash
and poor Russians face skyrocketing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   THE BALKANS: The U.S. warns that a broader Balkans war is
possible unless international pressure is placed on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serbian crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Russia has resisted, regarding the
Serbs as traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO EXPANSION: The security organization designed to counter
Soviet aggression during the Cold War is looking to expand to
countries once behind the Iron Curtain, a move many Russians regard
as a threat. Invitations have gone to Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS REDUCTION: In their last summit, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed
to pursue new strategic arms cuts as soon as the Duma ratified
START II, a treaty signed in January 1993. The Duma, Russia's lower
house of Parliament controlled by Communists and other Yeltsin
opponents, have withheld the political plum.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ: Russia has been a leading voice in the United Nations to
relax economic sanctions and weapons inspections imposed on Iraq
since the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The U.S. wants to keep the
pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pending proof that he
has abandoned his weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: The U.S. wants Russia to curb its exports of nuclear and
missile technology to Iran. Yeltsin has offered assurances that
Russia will halt shipments that could help Iran become a nuclear
power, but U.S. intelligence reports indicate that the transfers
continue.

   YUGAWARA, Japan _ For the last several months, sleepy commuters
in Kanagawa prefecture southwest of Tokyo have been jolted out of
their stupor by a strange sight: a dapper, blue-eyed Caucasian
bowing to them deeply and, in flawless Japanese, exhorting them to
vote for him on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a little of Mr. Smith in Marutei Tsurunen.
Born a Finn, he overcame tremendous odds and obstacles to become a
Japanese citizen in 1979 and now hopes to become a member of
Japan's Upper House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``I want to bring change to Japan,'' said Tsurunen, 58, who
is running as an independent. ``I want to open the political system
and make it work for the people who live here. And because I am
foreign and yet also Japanese, I think I can more easily push for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His political opponents say he has invigorated local politics in
Kanagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that his participation will increase voter
turnout overall, but it will encourage nonpartisan voters who
otherwise might not vote at all to get out and vote,'' said Tokuro
Kanbayashi, a representative of Keiko Chiba, a Democratic Party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrat and Democratic incumbents look likely to
secure their seats again. An analysis by the Asahi Shimbun, one of
Japan's leading newspapers, put Tsurenen's odds for winning the
third seat at 50-50, saying he was running neck-and-neck with the
Communist Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his strength is that his unique campaign is overcoming
existing party lines and that he's mobilizing people who are not
satisfied with the existing parties,'' said Shigeru Sakamoto,
campaign manager for Fumio Saito, an incumbent Upper House member
from the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tsurenen is no political novice. In 1992, he was elected to the
local assembly in Yugawara, the small, seaside resort town in
Kanagawa that is his home. He won despite a significant financial
disadvantage: Accepting only contributions from individuals, he had
only 360,000 yen at his disposal, compared to the millions of yen
spent by some of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked that the assembly met in plenary session for only two
days, he went public with details of the behind-the-scenes horse
trading between local government officials and assembly members
that had preceded the session.
</P>
<P>
   Nemawashi, as the closed-door wrangling is known, shields debate
_ and the deals made to resolve it _ from public view and is a
time-honored tradition in Japanese business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsurenen regarded it as stifling opposing points of view
that his electorate had a right to hear. So he went to the
newspapers, and now Yugawara has a plenary session that lasts at
least two weeks and the horse-trading is done publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that there was really nothing I could do to clean up
the party itself, but that I could open the planning and
decision-making process to public view,'' he said, referring to the
Liberal Democratic Party, which has had a lock on power in the
postwar period with the exception of a few years. ``There's no real
democracy in Japan, because people can't get their opinions heard
in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his assembly victory, Tsurenen aimed for a place in
the national political scene, running as an independent for an
Upper House seat in 1995. He came in fourth of 14 candidates, just
shy of winning one of Kanagawa prefecture's three seats.
</P>
<P>
   He is confident he will improve his showing in this election.
His 1995 campaign had little advance planning, no organization and
a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 400 volunteers are working on his behalf, and he
has been campaigning for more than a year, waking at dawn to trek
to another station and hand out pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 70 or 80 percent of them take it,'' he said of the
commuters he greets. ``No one really bothers us too much. I've only
been heckled a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsurenen came here as a Lutheran missionary in 1967, working at
a home for children in Kyushu, the southern island in the Japanese
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The influence of the church here is very weak,'' he said. ``I
knew I would have to get out of the church to really have an impact
on social welfare in this country, although I'm still a
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, he left the ministry after six years.
</P>
<P>
   But with no affiliation to any corporate, religious or other
organization, he could not stay in Japan. One way he could remain
was to marry a Japanese. He divorced his wife and married a young
woman, Sachiko, whom he had counseled after she attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He set himself up as a translator, opened an English-language
school in Yugawara and began pursuing Japanese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the practical thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, foreigners were not eligible for public health
insurance or pensions and could not obtain housing loans. And
Tsurunen wanted to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining citizenship took some persistence. Immigration
authorities considered him a bit of a crackpot and initially would
not give him the application forms. He and his wife endured three
intensive interviews. His neighbors were interviewed. Immigration
officials visited his house to ascertain that he was indeed living
a Japanese lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1979, he became a Japanese citizen, with the
Japanese name Marutei Tsurunen instead of the Finnish Martti
Turunen, and eligible to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel Japanese?'' he said. ``No. I'm still a Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I wanted to be as Japanese as possible,'' he
continued. ``But I quickly realized that was impossible and not at
all necessary to achieve what I wanted to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, Tsurunen would be the first Caucasian to serve in
the Japanese Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very often feel why in the world did I get into this,'' he
said. ``People are expecting so much from me, and if I win, I'll
always be in the spotlight. Everyone wants me to change politics,
and it's very hard for one foreigner to do that.'' &QL;

   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are dicey times for Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   On my trip last month, I could sense the difference from my last
visit in December.
</P>
<P>
   Then, reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing
their fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Iranians are channel-surfing between World Cup soccer games
and the trial of the popular Tehran mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Gholamhossein Karbaschi is accused of corruption, but most
Iranians think he was targeted by the religious hardliners who run
the courts because he managed Khatami's surprisingly successful
election.
</P>
<P>
   As in December, Iranians are still seeing increased freedom.
But, the Karbaschi trial is just one example that reform still has
its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues causing friction is how Iran should show
itself to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The day after watching a televised World Cup match with a group
of young Iranians, one called and asked that I not tell anyone I
was with there.
</P>
<P>
   These days, an evening with a foreign journalist can be
controversial, especially if the evening in question includes
cassettes of Western dance music.
</P>
<P>
   When hardliners in the Iranian parliament last month impeached
Khatami's top cabinet minister, Abdullah Nouri, they cited his
comments in the foreign press. There were too many outsiders, they
said, carrying news about Iran's private business.
</P>
<P>
   I got the same response when my translator tried to set up an
appointment with the head of the unofficial ``club wielders,'' the
hardline mobs that break up reformist demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they want to know about our internal affairs,'' he
asked, saying it seemed like a form of ``espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's identity is built around martyrdom and persecution. Some
are afraid that if Iran opens up, people will see that Iranians are
not all stern religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a hard secret to keep. Iranians are, in fact, fun and
sophisticated, friendly and educated. Go to this capital city's
working-class south side and interview the grocery store owner, and
he'll want to treat you to lunch. The ice cream salesman insists
that you fill up while you ask him your questions.
</P>
<P>
   The many parks and shopping districts in Tehran are some of the
most fertile ground for interviews in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   One western observer noted that hardliners are afraid Iran will
be perceived as ``the kind of country America doesn't have to worry
about.'' That would almost be contrary to Iran's national
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But, the reformers are glad to have foreign journalists around.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate government officials, led by Khatami, are making it
easier for foreigners to get visas and are encouraging American
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The average Iranian on the street wanted me to know that Iran is
changing, even as they are nervous about how far they will be
allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   They told me not to pay attention to the people who shout
``Death to America'' at Friday prayers, saying it was passe
sloganism.
</P>
<P>
   One should not take this too far. Overall, Iranians still
believe in the basic principles of the Islamic revolution. The late
Ayatollah Khomeini is still beloved.
</P>
<P>
   But one intellectual also reminded me that, ever since the
Muslims conquered the country in the 7th Century, Iranians have
adopted stern public behaviors to satisfy their religious rulers,
while leading much more relaxed, accommodating, private lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, in the carousing described by the Persian poets
Omar Khayam or Hafiz, that Iran has always had many faces.
</P>
<P>
   You could have looked at the streets of Tehran after the
national team beat the United States in World Cup soccer. The team
is a patriotic phenomenon and has become a vehicle for Iranians to
test out new freedoms without fear of reprisal from the Islamic
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that hard-line Iranian officials made it difficult
for American networks to beam out much video of the jubilant soccer
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The world would have seen happy Iranians having what any
American would consider clean fun. One clip that was censored
showed youths saying they were ready for good relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one girl in the street stretching modesty laws by
wearing make up in public. She had the Iranian flag's red, white
and green painted on her face.
</P>
<P>
   What are the conservatives supposed to do about that?
</P>

 EXILE SAYS PROMINENT U.S. LOBBYING GROUP FUNDED ANTI-CASTRO
VIOLENCE  (Eds: See also CUBA-BOMBS) 
(js) 
 By ANN LOUISE BARDACH and LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A Cuban exile who has waged a campaign of bombings and
assassination attempts aimed at toppling Fidel Castro says that his
efforts were supported financially for more than a decade by the
Cuban-American leaders of one of America's most influential
lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   The exile, Luis Posada Carriles, said he organized a wave of
bombings in Cuba last year at hotels, restaurants and discotheques,
killing an Italian tourist and alarming the Cuban government.
Posada was schooled in demolition and guerrilla warfare by the
Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of tape-recorded interviews at a walled Caribbean
compound, Posada said the hotel bombings and other operations had
been supported by leaders of the Cuban-American National
Foundation. Its founder and head, Jorge Mas Canosa, who died last
year, was embraced at the White House by presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful force in both Florida and national elections, and a
prodigious campaign donor, Mas played a decisive role in persuading
Clinton to change his mind and follow a course of sanctions and
isolation against Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tax-exempt foundation has declared that it seeks to
bring down Cuba's Communist government solely through peaceful
means, Posada said leaders of the foundation discreetly financed
his operations. Mas personally supervised the flow of money and
logistical support, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge controlled everything,'' Posada said. ``Whenever I
needed money, he said to give me $5,000, give me $10,000, give me
$15,000, and they sent it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Posada estimated, Mas sent him more than
$200,000. ``He never said, `This is from the foundation,' '' Posada
recalled. Rather, he said with a chuckle, the money arrived with
the message, ``This is for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation leaders did not respond to repeated telephone calls
and letters requesting an interview to discuss their relationship
with Posada. But in a brief statement faxed to The New York Times,
the group denied a role in his operations, saying ``any allegation,
implication, or suggestion that members of the Cuban American
National Foundation have financed any alleged `acts of violence'
against the Castro regime are totally and patently false.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada, 70, has long refused to talk to journalists; his
autobiography, published in 1994, provided only a sketchy account
of his dealings with the foundation's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But in two days of interviews, he talked openly for the first
time about those relationships and how they figured in a fight to
which he has devoted his life, a fight that has left him far from
his declared goal of toppling the hemisphere's last Communist
state.
</P>
<P>
   His motives for agreeing to the interviews are not easy to pin
down. Posada, who has survived several attempts on his life, told a
friend recently that he was afraid he would not live long enough to
tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Posada also described his role in some of
the great Cold War events in which Cuban exiles were key players.
He was trained for the Bay of Pigs at a camp in Guatemala, but did
not participate in the landing on Cuban beaches after the Kennedy
administration withheld air support from the first wave of rebels,
whose attack quickly foundered.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cuban exiles like Posada who were recruited by the CIA
for the subsequent attempts on Castro's life.
</P>
<P>
   Jailed for one of the most infamous anti-Cuban attacks, the 1976
bombing of a civilian Cubana airliner, he eventually escaped from a
Venezuelan prison to join the centerpiece of the Reagan White
House's anti-Communist crusade in the Western Hemisphere: Lt. Col.
Oliver North's clandestine effort to supply arms to Nicaraguan
contras.
</P>
<P>
   Posada denied any role in the Cubana bombing, which killed 73
people, many of them teen-age members of Cuba's national fencing
team.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed through an intermediary to meet with The New York
Times, provided that his current residence, alias and the location
of the interviews were not divulged.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what he said about his past can be verified through
recently declassified government documents, as well as interviews
with former foundation members and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he made several claims that rest solely on his word,
including an assertion that he has agents inside the Cuban military
and that U.S. law enforcement authorities maintained an attitude of
benign neglect toward him for most of his career, allowing him to
remain free and active.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said all payments from the exile leaders to him were made
in cash, and he said he did not know whether the money came from
personal, business or foundation accounts. He said that the money
was used for his living expenses and for operations and that Mas
told him he did not want to know the details of his activities.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews he was generally expansive on broad questions
of philosophy but evasive on specifics. He spoke in Spanish and
English, with difficulty, his speech distorted by the severe damage
done to the nerves of his tongue in a 1990 attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he was angered by recent newspaper accounts of his
activities and eager near the end of his life to put his version of
events on record, perhaps reinvigorating a movement he sees as
lacking energy and direction since Mas' death.

</P>
<P>
   The exiles' foundation, created in 1981, has sought to portray
itself as the responsible voice of the Cuban exile community,
dedicated to weakening the Castro regime through politics rather
than force. Thanks to that approach and millions in campaign
donations, the foundation became one of Washington's most effective
lobbying organizations and a principal architect of U.S. policy
toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Any evidence that the foundation or its leaders were dispensing
money to Republicans and Democrats while underwriting bombings
could weaken the group's claim to legitimacy. That kind of activity
could also violate the Logan Act, which makes illegal any
``conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage
property in a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada's remarks hinted that the foundation's public advocacy of
purely nonviolent opposition to Castro was a carefully crafted
fiction. Asked if he functioned as the military wing to the
foundation's political wing, much as the Irish Republican Army does
for Sinn Fein, he replied, ``It looks like that,'' and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews and in his autobiography, ``The Roads of the
Warrior,'' Posada said he had received financial support from Mas
and Feliciano Foyo, treasurer of the group, as well as Alberto
Hernandez, who succeeded Mas as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Foyo did not respond to repeated requests for
comment, and it was unclear whether they were aware of how Posada
might have used any money they provided. In his autobiography,
Posada said foundation leaders helped pay his medical and living
expenses and paid for his transportation from Venezuela to Central
America after his 1985 jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Posada said, cash was delivered from Miami by fellow
exiles, including Gaspar Jimenez, who was jailed in Mexico in the
1976 killing of a Cuban diplomat there. Jimenez is now an employee
of the medical clinic that Hernandez operates in Miami, according
to employees at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombs began exploding last year at Cuban hotels, the
government there asserted that the attacks had been organized and
paid for by exiles operating out of Miami, a claim it bolstered
with the videotape of an operative confessing to carrying out some
of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, reports in The Miami Herald and the
state-controlled Cuban press tied the operation to Posada, who said
in the interviews that U.S. authorities had made no effort to
question him about the case. He attributed that lack of action in
part to his longstanding relationship with U.S. law enforcement and
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' he said, ``the FBI and the CIA don't bother
me, and I am neutral with them. Whenever I can help them, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada gave conflicting accounts of his contacts with U.S.
authorities. Initially he spoke of enduring ties with United States
intelligence agencies and of close friendship with at least two
current FBI officials. Later he asked that those comments be
omitted from any article and said it had been years since he had
had close dealings with such officials.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. government official said the CIA has not had a
relationship with Posada ``in decades,'' and the FBI also denied
his assertions. ``The FBI does not now have nor have we ever had a
longstanding relationship with Posada,'' said John Lewis, Jr. who
as assistant director in charge of the national security division
supervises all counterintelligence and counterterrorism work for
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Declassified documents unearthed in Washington by the National
Security Archives support Posada's suggestion that the FBI and the
CIA had detailed knowledge of his operations against Cuba from the
early 1960s to the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel to the 1978 House Select
Committee on Assassinations, said he had reviewed many of the FBI's
classified files about anti-Castro Cubans from 1978 and had noted
many instances in which the bureau turned a blind eye to possible
violations of the law. As he put it, ``When I read some of those
things, and I'm an old federal prosecutor, I thought, `Why isn't
someone being indicted for this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   On one point Posada was direct and unrepentant: he still intends
to try to kill Castro, and he believes violence is the best method
for ending Communism in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the only way to create an uprising there,'' Posada said.
``Castro will never change, never. There are several ways to make a
revolution, and I have been working on some.''
</P>
<P>
   Within militant Cuban exile circles, Posada is a legendary
figure, celebrated for his tenacity and dedication to the
anti-Castro cause. He has at various times also worked for
Venezuelan, Salvadoran and Guatemalan intelligence or security
agencies because, he explained, he wanted ``to fight against the
Communists, the people who helped Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government regards him as a terrorist and a
``monstrous criminal'' responsible for numerous acts of violence
against official installations and personnel, on the island and
off, and has called on the United States to curb his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Posada proudly admitted organizing the hotel bomb attacks last
year. He described them as acts of war intended to cripple a
totalitarian regime by depriving it of foreign tourism and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to hurt anybody,'' he said. ``We just wanted to
make a big scandal so that the tourists don't come anymore. We
don't want any more foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombs were also intended, Posada said, to sow doubts abroad
about the stability of the regime, to make Cuba think he had
operatives in the military and to encourage internal opposition.
``People are not afraid anymore,'' he said. ``They talk openly in
the street. But they need something to start the fire, and that's
my goal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For several months the attacks did indeed discourage tourism.
With a rueful chuckle, Posada described the Italian tourist's death
as a freak accident, but he declared that he had a clear
conscience, saying, ``I sleep like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad that someone is dead, but we can't stop,'' he added.
``That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Havana last September, authorities arrested a 25-year-old
Salvadoran, Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, and accused him of carrying out
a half-dozen of the hotel attacks. Posada said Cruz Leon, whom he
described as a mercenary, had been working for him, but said
``maybe a dozen'' others reporting to him remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel bombings were organized from El Salvador and
Guatemala, Posada said. Explosives were obtained through his
contacts there, and subordinates in turn recruited couriers like
Cruz Leon to take the explosives into Cuba and detonate them in
carefully selected targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is compartmentalized,'' Posada said. ``I know
everybody, but they don't know me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an inside operation in Cuba,'' he added, explaining
that he was now trying to think of another way to disrupt the Cuban
economy and demonstrate to the Cuban people that Castro's security
apparatus is not all-powerful and all-knowing. ``Very soon there
will be exciting news,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he had several ongoing operations, including one
that resulted in Cuba's capture of three of his colleagues in early
June. ``Castro is keeping this a secret,'' he said. ``I don't
understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to several questions about operational details that
he clearly did not want to answer, he jokingly said, ``I take the
Fifth Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing to allow the interviews to be taped, he declined
to be photographed, saying he did not want to provide Cuban agents
with any information that would help them hunt him down. ``The
reason that I last so long is that nobody knows how I am,'' he
explained. ``Not having pictures of my pretty face has kept me
alive a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala in 1990, he was attacked and gravely wounded in
what he describes as an assassination attempt mounted by his
enemies at Cuban intelligence. He was hit with a dozen bullets, one
of which shattered his jaw and nearly severed his tongue, requiring
several rounds of reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He said that during his long recuperation in El Salvador, some
of his expenses were paid by Hernandez, the current chairman of the
Cuban-American foundation, whom he described as ``a great Cuban
patriot and a dear friend.'' Just last year, he said, a Houston
surgeon whom he also described as a friend flew to El Salvador and
performed further surgery on him.
</P>
<P>
   Posada detailed instances of support from foundation leaders
throughout his career. Mas, he said, helped organize his escape
from a Venezuelan prison in 1985, and then helped settle him in El
Salvador, where he joined the White House-directed operation that
led to the Iran-contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money that I received when I escaped from the jail,''
he said, ``it was not that much, but it was through Jorge.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada said Mas was also very much aware that he was behind the
hotel bombing campaign last year. But the two men had a
longstanding agreement, he said, never to discuss the details of
any operation that Posada was involved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never met operators, never,'' Posada said. ``You ask for
money from him, and he said, `I don't want to know anything.' ''
Any discussion was ``not specific, because he was intelligent
enough to know who knows how to do the things and who doesn't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mas, he added, ``was afraid of the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk like that on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he had last visited the United States, he answered
with a laugh and a question of his own: ``Officially or
unofficially?'' A State Department official said Posada was
reported to have visited Miami in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that he has at least four passports, all in
different names. He regards himself as a Venezuelan citizen, but he
has a Salvadoran passport bearing the name Ramon Medina Rodriguez,
the nom de guerre he assumed during the Iran-contra affair, and a
Guatemalan passport issued in the name of Juan Jose Rivas Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   He also reluctantly admitted to having a U.S. passport. But he
would not discuss how he had obtained it or disclose the name in
it, saying only that he occasionally uses it to visit the United
States ``unofficially,'' and had once used it to gain refuge in the
U.S. Embassy when he was caught in the middle of a revolution in
the West African country of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of passports,'' he said with a laugh. ``No
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If I want to go to Miami, I have different ways to
go. But I don't go. You can't control customs people. They can do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``Your friends can't help you.'' &QL;

HOW A SWISS BANK GOLD DEAL ELUDED A U.S. MEDIATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late on a Friday night two weeks ago, just before
months of bitter negotiations between Switzerland's three major
commercial banks and Holocaust survivors collapsed, one of the
Clinton administration's most senior diplomats placed an urgent
call to the president of Switzerland, Flavio Cotti.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, Stuart Eizenstat, the undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, told the Swiss president that the two sides were
narrowing their differences. But after rounds and rounds of talks
in New York and Washington, neither side was willing to move
further.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government, Eizenstat said, had the power both to
speed a settlement and to end a 50-year-long chapter of its history
that tarnished Switzerland's reputation around the globe. He urged
Cotti to reverse a long-held position and have the Swiss government
contribute to a ``global settlement'' with Jewish groups and with
Holocaust victims and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   He even suggested a figure: more than $300 million, a large sum
but only a fraction of the $2.8 billion in Nazi gold, measured in
today's values, that a Swiss historical commission recently
concluded was received on behalf of Nazi Germany by the Swiss
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Cotti refused.
</P>
<P>
   While Eizenstat declines to discuss details of the discussion,
he said ``no common understanding was reached'' in the
conversation. ``It is our impression that the cycle of accusation
and counteraccusations had substantially hardened opinion in
Switzerland,'' said Eizenstat, who has led the State Department's
efforts to settle the contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Borer, the Swiss ambassador for Holocaust issues, was
even more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood in Switzerland has changed in the past year, and
Cotti explained this,'' Borer said in a telephone interview. ``Most
Swiss don't even want to talk about a global settlement. They know
that whatever we do, no one gets credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants in the negotiations now say that
Switzerland's hard-line position _ a refusal even to consider
joining the private banks in settling the legal claims _ helped
scuttle an agreement in late June. And while a settlement is not
dead, it is clear that announcements this past spring that a
settlement was in the offing were premature.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that talks could resume in a few months,
as New York and California begin to carry out sanctions against
Swiss businesses operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Eizenstat's unusual, direct appeal to Cotti, and lower-level
talks between U.S. and Swiss diplomats, had echoes of an earlier
time. Nearly two generations ago, in 1946, the State Department
tried to get Switzerland to disgorge the huge profits it
accumulated when it served as banker to Nazi Germany, taking in
stolen gold, jewelry, art and other property.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an agreement called the Washington Accord, now
regarded as a diplomatic fiasco, in which Switzerland agreed to
turn over a small part of its holdings to repay countries invaded
by Germany and to aid refugees. But it never fulfilled major parts
of the accord, and it has resisted several efforts in the years
since to settle the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss central bank did make a contribution of more than $70
million to a humanitarian fund, but it has said that was a one-time
act of compassion _ not something that will be repeated under legal
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who has led the investigations
into the Nazi gold questions, has scheduled hearings for later this
month on the question of whether the United States should try to
reopen the Washington agreement, a step the Clinton administration
has been loath to take, saying that it would irreparably breach the
U.S. relationship with the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat has been scurrying for more than a year now to avoid
that. This spring he turned out a detailed study of how other
neutral nations dealt extensively with the Nazis during World War
II, a study that seemed intended to make the Swiss seem less of a
lone target.
</P>
<P>
   All spring, he acted as a go-between in the negotiations between
the three big private Swiss banks _ Union Bank of Switzerland,
Swiss Bank Corp. and Credit Suisse _ and the fractious group of
plaintiffs who are suing them. In early June, just before the New
York State Banking Commission was supposed to consider an
application for the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss
Bank Corp., the banks began to offer larger settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But they had a condition: Before Eizenstat could convey their
offer of several hundred million dollars, the banking commission
had to approve the merger. The commission had suggested earlier in
the year that it might hold up the U.S. approval _ critical to
operating on Wall Street _ because the banks had not been diligent
enough in tracking down Holocaust-era accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there was no legitimate regulatory objection
to the merger,'' said Roger Witten, the lead lawyer for the banks,
``and we wanted to make sure that we were free from efforts to use
that process to extort a result on another front.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat called the World Jewish Congress to say a major offer
was on the way, and sent a letter confirming that he was in
possession of ``a firm and concrete offer from the banks for
settlement of the class action litigation'' that would be conveyed
after the merger was approved. With that assurance, the Jewish
groups said they would drop their past objections to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, pushed further by Eizenstat, ultimately offered $530
million for a ``rough justice fund'' that would pay the plaintiffs
and be used to help indigent survivors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with a reasonable estimate, based on the very
limited dealings the commercial banks had with German gold,''
Witten said. They then multiplied the figure several times, he
said, explaining how the banks came to that number.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish groups, however, were looking for something closer to
$1.5 billion, and dismissed the banks' offer as insulting. (In
addition to the $530 million, the banks previously pledged to pay
any amounts mandated by an independent commission headed by Paul
Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, which is
reviewing long-dormant wartime accounts in Swiss banks.)
</P>
<P>
   Bitter charges were exchanged. Some of the plaintiffs charged
that the banks, having received the merger approval, were no longer
motivated to increase their offers significantly. The banks, in
turn, charged that the Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups, which
have fought among themselves over strategy, were trying to obtain
more money with threats of bad publicity and possible economic
sanctions against the banks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a meeting to impose sanctions _ headed by Alan Hevesi,
the New York City comptroller _ loomed in late June, prompting
Eizenstat to call Cotti. He offered a rationale: The Swiss National
Bank, which is government-owned, received more than 85 percent of
the gold deposited by Nazi Germany. Commercial banks got just a
fraction.
</P>
<P>
   But Cotti refused even to bring the issue in front of the
legislature, saying it would only further inflame public opinion.

<P>
   Over and over, through hard sell and soft-pedal, with wheedling
pledge and beggared compromise, the world has tried to make America
finally grow up, join the community of nations and love soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a parent pushing broccoli or slick car salesmen hawking
next year's models, the sport's promoters _ some earnest, some
frustrated at their marginal role in the lucrative U.S. market _
have oversold every argument and overstated every claim about what
soccer is or does or can be.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of such tactics have yielded an obvious result: As
soccer reaches its apogee in Paris on Sunday with the World Cup
final between France and Brazil, the game remains as mysterious to
vast numbers of Americans as it was when all they saw of it was
grainy photographs of Pele leaping in triumph about something or
other. Although millions of children and their parents now know
what a corner kick is, soccer as a national passion still remains
pint-sized _ a prisoner of its own hype, trapped in a nebulous
cloud of promises and myths that the sport, however great, cannot
possibly sustain in real life.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup games _ whose U.S. TV ratings are down markedly
from 1994, when the games were held in the United States at more
congenial viewing times (and the Americans went further before
elimination) _ offer the occasion to refocus some basic questions:
What the heck IS soccer anyway? And why can't a whole lot of
Americans be sold on it?
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of soccer is ``American free enterprise at its
best, and its worst,'' said Stephen Hardy, who teaches sports
studies at the University of New Hampshire and is a soccer dad.
``There's been no uniform presentation of the sport, and with so
many different approaches to selling the game, it's like clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   One professional team in Pittsburgh, for example, tried several
years ago to position soccer as a kind of athleticized Chippendales
show _ a place for women to ogle men with nice legs. Other teams
have sold soccer as a squeaky clean game of wholesome family fun,
with an old-world integrity and finesse to make supposedly low-brow
games like U.S. football appear primitive or corrupt by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that soccer is perceived as a foreign game, Major
League Soccer, a 12-team professional league founded in 1996, has
tried to mandate that the game be more American, imposing a limit
of five foreign players on any team. Other promoters hype the
game's athleticism, claiming that soccer players are the world's
fittest athletes, because _ just look at them _ don't they run all
the time out there on that big field?
</P>
<P>
   The truth about soccer is that, like most successful sports,
it's an ugly, mean, complicated game, with deceit, trickery and
occasional brutality. Also, the people around the world who most
appreciate its dark side are, by no coincidence, the ones who love
it most.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, soccer's biggest tactical blunder in America, some
sports experts say, has been to try to infiltrate the culture
through children. Millions of suburban kids out there in fussy
British-schoolboy shorts have given soccer deep associations with
moms and minivans and Saturday family obligations _ the very things
people go to sports bars to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-class Americans know soccer as a game played at nice
places, by nice kids,'' said Allen Guttmann, a professor of
American Studies at Amherst College who studies the role of sports
in culture. ``People in South America who shine mirrors in the
goalie's eyes know it's not about good sportsmanship. It's about
winning no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that soccer is not art, or that it's not
entertaining, but simply that it is often not what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the way people get ``hurt'' in soccer.
When players run into each other on the soccer field, even in the
mildest of collisions, they roll around and writhe like they're
near death. What's that all about anyway? Are they wimps?
Americans, who have been schooled to value stoicism in all things
(especially in male pursuits), mostly still don't get this. If a
quarterback gets flattened by a 350-pound lineman in American
football, he's expected to lie there quietly and die, or get up and
play, but not to make too much a fuss about it either way. It's not
good form.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in soccer _ because the game, through its rules and
culture, places a premium on overacting. If an official can be
convinced through a player's faux death throes that an opponent did
something really odious, the offending player can be ejected from
the field, giving the actor's team a huge advantage. Football, by
contrast, has institutionalized grit by allowing only a grudging
15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness. In hockey, full-scale
assaults on an opponent are barely punished at all _ the offender
gets some time in the penalty box, much like a naughty 2-year-old
is sent to sit in time out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, soccer has been deliberately sold as a ``nice''
sport, clean to its core, which, again, probably sounds a little
wimpy to the average American fan. Once again, however, the myth
about soccer is misplaced. Real soccer players, when they think
they can get away with it, gouge and foul with the worst beasts of
football or basketball, though certainly with more subtlety than,
say, hockey's goons. In just the first round of games in the World
Cup, referees issued 15 red cards, each requiring the expulsion of
a player for committing a dangerous tackle. That's a higher level
of infractions than in 1994, when as many cards were issued during
the entire World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed games and connections with gamblers have also become an
issue in many countries as well. In the game's best interests,
these flaws should perhaps be advertised to Americans as plusses:
``Soccer _ not as wholesome as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about the myth of the super-athlete? Is that really
something that serves soccer's interests? Over and over, we hear
that soccer players, what with all that running, are probably at
the pinnacle of fitness. Of course, they don't run all the time, as
anyone who has ever played the game, or even watched it, can see
right away. Players who are far from the ball mostly walk or stand
there waiting for the action to come to them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe soccer should publicize this as well. Some sports, after
all, thrive on tedium. The common sight of players standing around
doing nothing but scratching themselves and spitting certainly
doesn't seem to have hurt baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soccer's promoters seem intent on reaching for something
more, something nobler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much drama, so many side plots going on, that there
is a certain comparison to opera,'' said Alan Rothenberg, president
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, which oversees both amateur and
professional soccer. ``It's a combination of great ballet and great
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, and who knows? Maybe ballet will finally catch on with the
shot-and-beer crowd, too.

of infractions than in 1994, when as many cards were issued during
the entire World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed games and connections with gamblers have also become an
issue in many countries as well. In the game's best interests,
these flaws should perhaps be advertised to Americans as plusses:
``Soccer _ not as wholesome as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about the myth of the super-athlete? Is that really
something that serves soccer's interests? Over and over, we hear
that soccer players, what with all that running, are probably at
the pinnacle of fitness. Of course, they don't run all the time, as
anyone who has ever played the game, or even watched it, can see
right away. Players who are far from the ball mostly walk or stand
there waiting for the action to come to them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe soccer should publicize this as well. Some sports, after
all, thrive on tedium. The common sight of players standing around
doing nothing but scratching themselves and spitting certainly
doesn't seem to have hurt baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soccer's promoters seem intent on reaching for something
more, something nobler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much drama, so many side plots going on, that there
is a certain comparison to opera,'' said Alan Rothenberg, president
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, which oversees both amateur and
professional soccer. ``It's a combination of great ballet and great
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, and who knows? Maybe ballet will finally catch on with the
shot-and-beer crowd, too.

   WASHINGTON _ Seeking statehood did not work. A constitutional
amendment failed. Now officials in the District of Columbia say
they have finally found the best way to gain voting rights in
Congress for district residents.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to sue the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other approaches made false assumptions,'' said John Ferren,
the corporation counsel for the district. ``The lawsuit is based on
the argument that citizens of the district are entitled to be
represented in Congress by the Constitution. It's strictly a
constitutional argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the district, where more than 500,000 people live,
say a lawsuit is being drawn up to be filed in U.S. District Court
here in September. They say they intend to argue that the equal
protection guarantees of the Constitution, including voting rights,
apply as much to residents of the district as to residents of the
states.
</P>
<P>
   The district is represented in Congress by only a nonvoting
member of the House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who plans to introduce
legislation on Tuesday that will seek a second avenue of redress,
asking Congress to give the district full representation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the effort has nothing to do with more recent
controversial issues in the district _ like statehood, home rule or
the city's financial control board _neither Ms. Norton nor the
district lawyers expect much to come of it, especially with
Republicans controlling both chambers and the vast majority of
voters in the district registered as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they have concluded that the parallel effort of a
lawsuit, which is likely to reach the Supreme Court, would be the
best way to settle the issue for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never been tried before,'' Ms. Norton said in an
interview. ``Perhaps it's time. Enough constitutional water has
flowed under the bridge, I think, to yield the result we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of voting rights for district residents has been
debated for nearly 200 years. Early residents of the city continued
to vote for congressional representatives in Maryland and Virginia,
the states from which the district was carved. But around 1800, the
states cut them off, saying Congress had the responsibility to
represent the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much happened until 1978 when both houses of Congress,
by two-thirds majorities, sent a constitutional amendment to the
states that would have created full representation in Congress for
the district. In the seven-year period for approval, the measure
was passed by only 16 states, well short of the 38 needed to enact
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the House considered a bill that would have made the
district the 51st state, but it failed, winning only 153 votes, 151
of them cast by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This latest effort evolved from a paper written by Jamin Raskin,
a professor of constitutional law at American University, who
traced the rationale for voting representation, in part, to two
Supreme Court cases that removed constitutional distinctions
between the states and the district for the application of federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Bolling vs. Sharpe, was a 1954 companion case to the
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education, which desegregated public
schools. Bolling was a challenge to racially segregated schools in
the district.
</P>
<P>
   The second was a 1970 case, Evans vs. Cornman, in which the
court upheld the right of residents of a federal enclave in
Rockville, Md., the National Institutes of Health, to vote in state
and federal elections in Maryland, because they were subject to
state laws, paid state taxes and sent their children to
state-supported schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The federal government already treats the district like a state
in many areas, including military service, federal taxes and
federal benefits like highways money and Medicaid, Raskin pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Raskin and the district lawyers insist that a constitutional
amendment is not necessary to give the city adequate representation
in Congress, stressing that those rights are already guaranteed by
the Constitution and have been upheld by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, several influential lawmakers have agreed that the
district deserves equal representation in Congress. When the
constitutional amendment was proposed in 1978, Sen. Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina, a conservative Republican, said: ``I think it is
a fair thing to do. We are advocating one man, one vote. We are
advocating democratic processes in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another supporter was former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who said,
``The absence of voting representation for the District in Congress
is an anomaly which the Senate can no longer sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether similar sentiments now exist is uncertain. A spokesman
for Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said he
supported a constitutional amendment as the best way for the
district to gain voting representation. A spokeswoman for Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said he was ``undecided on
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Speaker Newt Gingrich said he deferred on
district matters to Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., chairman of a
district subcommittee. Davis said he favored a voting member in the
House for the district but not two senators.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has offered its support for the district but
tied voting rights to statehood, which district officials are not
seeking. &QL;

<P>
   There's a curious new genre that seems to be emerging in
American journalism: the media obituary. In the hushed, somber
tones used for that most solemn of news accounts, reporters have
been busy churning out virtual death notices for the careers of
disgraced colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the recent chronicles of Stephen Glass' New Republic
exploits, in which he concocted parts or all of 27 of the 41
articles he wrote for that magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the reports of Patricia Smith's fabricated Boston
Globe columns, in which more than a few of the people quoted were
phantasms of her imagination. Or review the coverage of April
Oliver, the producer of a CNN report that the U.S. military used
poison gas in Laos, which both the network and its collaborator on
the story, Time magazine, have now repudiated.
</P>
<P>
   Much like actual obituaries, these accounts include paragraphs
detailing, in an already distant past tense, the decedent's career.
There is often a mention of parents, perhaps an aside to upbringing
and educational background. Also included are survivors _
producers, fellow columnists, editors. In the case of Glass, who
would not talk to reporters, the reporting sounds airless,
unleavened by any self-scrutiny or a whisper of personal
psychodrama. Ms. Smith left a misty apologia last month in one last
abject Globe column.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greene, a former editor of Newsday and recipient of two
Pulitzer Prizes for his work as an investigative reporter, said he
had noticed the media-obit trend in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've also seen this in the past,'' he said from his office
at Hofstra University, where he teaches journalism. ``We wrote
about Janet Cooke in that past tense, I think rightly,'' he said,
referring to the Washington Post reporter who falsified an article
about an 8-year-old inner-city heroin addict, for which she won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1981 before the hoax was discovered. ``But we
have such an onslaught of victims right now that it seems new. It
becomes more stylized and sophisticated as we keep _ there's no
other way to say it _ piling up the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The media obit evolved because post-Watergate journalism depends
on a kind of professional schadenfreude, said Jerry Nachman, a
former editor of The New York Post. ``The sad thing about our
business,'' he said, ``is that as these journalists step out on a
ledge warily and appear to be attempting suicide, it's terrifying
to see how many of our brethren are standing below, yelling
`Jump!'''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, an obituary announcing the premature death of a
career signals an opportunity to try a more creative venture _ a
chance to write a novel that may become a movie. After the
journalist Clifford Irving was sentenced in 1972 to 17 months in
federal prison for a hoax involving his fabricated autobiography of
Howard Hughes, he wrote mysteries and a play titled ``Versus the
IRS,'' which was based on his own experience suing the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Mere weeks after Glass' doom was sealed as a reporter, editors
at Simon &AMP; Schuster and Random House bandied about the idea of
enticing him into writing a novel, according to editors at both
houses. Eventually the publishers concluded that his pattern of
deceit was a shade too morally ambiguous _ this judgment from the
people who paid $2 million for the memoirs of Dick Morris, the
former strategist for President Clinton who left the White House in
a scandal involving his relationship with a prostitute. Ms. Smith,
who is already an established poet, surfaced at the 17th annual
Taos Poetry Circus in June, where poets dueled and their verses
were judged by a cocktail waitress, a master carpenter and an
elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who return like the phoenix, their sins
forgiven and their careers resilient. Michael Daly resigned from
his job at The Daily News in 1981 after admitting that a British
soldier he quoted in an incendiary article about Northern Ireland
was a composite; his departure was noted with funerary aplomb. But
weeks later, New York magazine hired him. He has since returned to
his post as a Daily News columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast news has a similar ratio of phoenixes to ghosts. In
1993, Michael Gartner resigned as president of NBC News after
acknowledging that the team behind a ``Dateline NBC'' report had
rigged a General Motors truck to explode for a report on truck
safety. Gartner retreated to Ames, Iowa, where he edits the Daily
Tribune (circulation 10,000). Last year, he won a Pulitzer Prize
for editorial writing.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cooke now lives in Ann Arbor, Mich., where she was
studying for a fine arts degree until recently. Years after her
downfall, she received a little help from her friends. Mike Sager,
a former Washington Post reporter who dated her at the time of her
dismissal, turned the situation to their mutual advantage by
writing an article about their relationship for GQ magazine in
1996. He sold the film rights to James L. Brooks, the director of
``Wag the Dog'' and ``As Good As It Gets,'' for reportedly as much
as $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the victims themselves have resorted to the language
of death. Jack Smith, the CNN senior producer who was fired along
with Ms. Oliver, remarked to the Associated Press that ``the
bloodlust for another body was rising'' when CNN president Tom
Johnson issued a reprimand, rather than a vote of support, to the
correspondent Peter Arnett last week. (The New York Post reported
that a senior executive producer, Pamela Hill, also ``walked the
plank.'')
</P>
<P>
   But why do some journalists re-emerge and others sink forever
under the waves? When will Marv Albert surface again? And why is
Ms. Cooke never heard from?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the most basic, driving motivation,'' Sager
said. ``Are these people who are struggling and just barely
treading water? Do they make these dramatic gestures in order to
save themselves, or do they do it to get caught? Or is this a
person who actually makes a mistake, carries it through, then
realizes it and is a person of some talent and credibility? The
well-balanced writer can carry out this tack and survive.''

FIGHT LOOMS OVER EXTENDING WAITING PERIOD FOR HANDGUN BUYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law requiring a five-day waiting period to
purchase a handgun is scheduled to expire in November, and
gun-control advocates are girding for a bruising late-summer fight
with the National Rifle Association and its supporters in Congress
over whether to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   The law, part of the Brady bill that Congress approved in 1993,
requires gun buyers in many states to wait as long as five working
days before taking new handguns home, giving state and local
authorities time to conduct background checks to weed out convicted
criminals, fugitives and others not eligible to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was named for James Brady, Ronald Reagan's press
secretary, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 attempt on
Reagan's life and whose wife, Sarah, is a leading lobbyist for
extending the waiting-period law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Brady law, the waiting-period requirement is to expire
on Nov. 30, when a criminal data base allowing almost instantaneous
background checks is scheduled to go on line.
</P>
<P>
   Though the issue does not cut precisely along party lines, the
emerging debate has taken on a sharply partisan edge, and officials
in both major parties predict that it will spill into Congressional
races in several states.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, Republican Party officials and members of Congress
have begun attacking the waiting period as an intrusive,
big-government policy that has done nothing to stem violent crime.
The Republican leadership in both houses is expected to try to
block Democratic legislation that would extend the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we want to take guns from criminals, we understand there
is a Second Amendment and we're not going to strip honest citizens
of their rights,'' said Clifford May, a spokesman for the
Republican National Committee, referring to the Amendment that
granted civilians the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have countered by accusing the Republicans of being
beholden to the rifle association, and they are hoping to exploit
the issue in several hotly contested congressional districts where
gun-control is considered popular policy, including in New York's
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great issue in the 1998 elections'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is seeking his party's nomination for
Senate and is a leading advocate for extending the law. ``To let
Brady expire will expose the soft underbelly of Republicans: that
they are extreme on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   All the remaining provisions of the Brady law, including that
gun buyers pass background checks, are to remain in effect. And
starting in November, the law requires that background checks be
extended to prospective purchasers of all guns, not just pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than half of the states, including New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut, are exempt from the Brady law because they
have their own systems for licensing guns and checking the
backgrounds of purchasers. Some of those exempted states have
waiting periods that will remain in place even if the federal law
expires. New York, for instance, requires gun buyers to obtain
permits, which can take months.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, law-enforcement officials in New York and other states
with restrictive gun laws say that it is important for Congress to
impose tougher gun laws nationwide to stem the flow of weapons
across state lines. In New York, the vast majority of firearms used
in crimes are purchased from outside the state, mainly in the South
where it is easier to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   The new national data base, operated by the FBI, is supposed to
allow gun-store owners, with one call, to check a range of
government criminal, immigration and mental health records. A
separate federal law, passed before the Brady bill, prohibits
several categories of people, including felons, fugitives, the
mentally ill and illegal immigrants, from buying guns.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Brady law, most states did not require background
checks on gun buyers, making it virtually impossible for store
owners to know whether a person was eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 69,000 handgun purchases were blocked because of
background checks, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of extending the waiting-period requirement say the
federal data base will not include an array of local documents that
could be vital for determining whether a person is eligible to buy
a gun, including state mental health records, restraining orders
and domestic violence misdemeanors. They contend a waiting period
is needed to give local and state officials time to research those
additional documents.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents also say that waiting periods provide time for
emotionally distraught people to cool down before purchasing
pistols that might be used in suicides or crimes of passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can serve as a deterrent from being able to grab a gun and
act on anger or depression,'' said Mrs. Brady, chairwoman of
Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit group that lobbies for gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise to win support, the proponents say they are
preparing a bill that would cut the waiting period to three days.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents contend that the national data base will provide
sufficient information for background checks. Even with additional
time, local officials are unlikely to sift through records that are
not available on the federal system, they say. And they argue that
there is no evidence that waiting periods prevent crimes of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think Congress right now is going to be in the
mood for an expansion of unnecessary gun control,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., a leading opponent of the waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats clearly believe that whether they win or lose, the
debate over the Brady law will provide them a golden election-year
opportunity to attack Republicans. President Clinton, who considers
the Brady law a signal achievement of his tenure, is expected to
push for the bill and the Democratic National Committee is
preparing to use the issue in several closely contested races
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A prime target will be Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who is
seeking his fourth term this year. In addition to Schumer,
Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green are vying for the Democratic
nomination to challenge him and all have vowed to attack D'Amato's
record of opposing gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials say that the Brady law may also
become an issue in several swing districts where Democrats are
putting gun control at the top of their agendas in trying to oust
first- or second-term Republicans, including Reps. Anne Northrup of
Kentucky, Brian Bilbray of California and Merrill Cook of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have some reasonable control on guns,'' said
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee. ``They support the Brady bill. And they will
will interpret this fight as a plus for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Party officials said gun control has paled as a
campaign issue in recent years as the crime rate has fallen
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone down this road before and it's always been a dead
end for them,'' said Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``Regardless of the public's
position on this issue, voters don't want to elect liberal
Democrats.'' &QL;

<P>
   It was the lure of a $100,000 reward that solved the mystery of
who killed Bill Cosby's son, but as prosecutors learned during the
trial that ended last week, the solution created a problem. The
reward, offered by The National Enquirer, provided the defense with
its strongest argument: Money can be a powerful motive to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out for prosecutors in the Cosby case. A jury
convicted a 19-year-old, Mikail Markhasev, of killing Ennis Cosby,
who had stopped to change a tire in Los Angeles. Markhasev could be
sentenced to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The reward was turned over last week to Christopher So, a former
friend of Markhasev. After hearing about the reward last year, So
told the police that Markhasev had admitted to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The offering of rewards has increased in recent years, in part
because of successes like the Cosby case. But there is little
evidence that they do much to solve most crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are no studies that demonstrate a connection
between rewards and crime clearance rates. In fact, the multitude
of leads generated by the announcement of a large reward can send
detectives off on time-consuming and fruitless tangents. And
rewards can inject mercenary motives into an act that should be
seen as a civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards have become a fact of life in police work and are
necessary, said Robert Louden, the director of the criminal justice
center at John Jay College. Louden, a former New York City police
official involved in confidential informant and reward programs,
said detectives must be careful to strike a balance so they don't
waste time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes the concept of the rat or the stool pigeon,''
Louden said. ``They are a reality of life in this day and age.''
Many people call not because it is the right thing to do, he added,
but for revenge or money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Crimestoppers reward programs, run by
non-profit organizations in conjunction with local police
departments, have sprung up across the country. They offer up to
$1,000 for information that leads to the conviction of any violent
criminal. Generally, the money is not set aside for specific cases,
but can be used on any case.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS and
other federal agencies offer standing rewards for such information.
And late last year, the FBI Investigation posted a $50,000 reward
for the arrest of anyone on its top 10 fugitives list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that public interest in our top 10 program was
waning a bit, so we decided to give it a breath of fresh air and
initiate rewards,'' said Roy Tubergen, chief of the FBI's violent
crime fugitive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's Most Wanted,'' a television program that profiles
crimes in cooperation with the police, draws more than 12 million
viewers an episode, said Mike Molnar, a spokesman for the show.
Many of the crimes featured have awards attached to their
resolution. The program has been responsible for 500 arrests in the
last decade, Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   But a troubling aspect of the surge in informant calls is that
many callers are criminals themselves, said Arthur Lurigio, the
chairman of Loyola University's criminal justice department. Some
make a living by informing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond anecdotal evidence, Lurigio said, there is no proof that
offering rewards is a more efficient way to solve crimes than
old-fashioned police work.
</P>
<P>
   Often, even enormous rewards lead nowhere. The Globe, a
competitor of The National Enquirer, offered a $500,000 reward for
information leading to the conviction of the killer of JonBenet
Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty queen. The murder remains unsolved.
(The National Enquirer offered her parents $1 million to take a
lie-detector test last year. They declined.)
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 reward offered by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
not helped solve the disappearance of a couple from their loft in
November. Nor has anyone been arrested for the murder of restaurant
owner Abe Lebewohl two years ago. His family has offered a $100,000
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are hard to explain because calls are generated,
but they just haven't solved the crimes,'' said Lt. Richard
Kuberski, who heads New York's Crimestoppers program. ``Sometimes
their leads don't pan out and we have been on wild goose chases
before, but a lot of our callers know what's going on on the
street. They can get the ball rolling for us.''

THE NEW YORKER AFTER TINA BROWN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We raised a quizzical eyebrow on hearing that Tina
Brown had abruptly, insouciantly sashayed her way out the front
door of 20 W. 43rd St. after six buzzful years as the editor of the
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   This was rare news indeed. Resign? From The New Yorker? In the
past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank, their
pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Ms. Brown simply
left, rather than commit to a five-year contract. She signed on
with the film company Miramax to run a new company that will
produce a new monthly magazine, books, films and television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something's perfect, it always seems like a good time to
leave,'' she told The Washington Post, applying a nifty gloss to
her tenure at what Fortune magazine recently called ``one of the
biggest money pits in American magazine history.''
</P>
<P>
   Strolling past the New Yorker's offices, and stopping in for a
haircut on the ground floor, we pondered the meaning of it all, as
Frank, our favorite barber, applied his sensitive hands to the
complex topography of our skull. Surely, life will be a shabbier
thing without Ms. Brown, we thought. No longer will it be possible
to speculate on our favorite conundrums. Is it S.I. Newhouse, the
owner of Conde Nast, who's fed up with Ms. Brown, or is it the
other way around? Which Florio does she work with, and how does she
know which one is which? Does she truly understand the damage that
a fused participle can wreak?
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Tina-less New Yorker dampened our mood. Ms.
Brown ran the magazine as though she were giving a party in a
deconsecrated church. Readers felt a guilty thrill at the
brazenness of it all, grabbing a glass of champagne as they
circulated among the guests. Here was Norman Mailer, jabbing a fat
forefinger as he engaged in spirited debate with Queen Latifah.
There was Jeffrey Katzenberg, deciding the fate of empires, as
Richard Avedon clicked away with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   What larks! No more treatises on tectonic plates, Letters from
Washington that read like a VCR manual, langorous ruminations on
the fate of the earth, nattering Reflections or twitty Talk of the
Town observations in the first-person plural. No longer did we have
to worry with Bill McKibben in the Adirondacks. Away, dull care!
The new New Yorker was a kaleidoscopic swirl of power people,
synergists, media moguls, publicity pashas, superstars, and
megamodels. It was more fun than E! and sometimes nearly as deep.
When things got a little too giddy, there was always a report from
the latest trouble spot to provide some moral ballast, and darned
if writers like Simon Schama, Ken Auletta and Anthony Lane couldn't
be just as long-winded and boring as the great ones.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally _ well, more than occasionally _ some mauvais types
slipped past the velvet rope. We confess to a certain perplexity at
the thought of Roseanne Barr as a guest editor. That woman over in
the corner with the spiked dog collar and the cat o' nine tails?
Was she invited? And shouldn't someone have taken the drink out of
Ms. Brown's hand before she started going on about Princess Di, or
threw herself at Bill Clinton in an article that should have been
titled ``The Sexiest Man Alive''?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we thought, with an indulgent smile, Harold Ross' New
Yorker was a bit raffish in its own way, and William Shawn's New
Yorker, as decorous as a Sunday service, has spent so much time
spinning in its grave that by now it's drilled a tunnel halfway to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autres temps autres moeurs,'' we murmured, slipping an
emolument into Frank's waiting hand. With a cheery wave, we
sauntered off to catch up with the buzz about the buzz.

AUTHORITIES KNEW OF BOMBING CAMPAIGN, SAYS CUBAN EXILE
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBA-PLOT) 
(jw) 
 By ANN LOUISE BARDACH and LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ During the summer of 1997, bomb explosions
ripped through some of Havana's most fashionable hotels,
restaurants and discotheques, killing a foreign tourist and sowing
confusion and nervousness throughout Cuba. It was something
shocking and inexplicable in a police state notorious for its tight
security, and from one end of the island to the other, people
speculated about who might be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   At his office here in the mountains of Central America, a
Cuban-American businessman named Antonio Jorge ``Tony'' Alvarez was
certain he knew the answer. For nearly a year, he had watched with
growing concern as two of his partners _ working with a mysterious
gray-haired man who had a Cuban accent and multiple passports _
acquired explosives and detonators, congratulating each other on a
job well done every time a bomb went off in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Alvarez overheard the men talk of assassinating
Fidel Castro at a conference of Latin American heads of state to be
held in Margarita Island, Venezuela. Alarmed, he went to Guatemalan
security officials. When they did not respond, he wrote a letter
that eventually found its way into the hands of Venezuelan
intelligence agents and FBI officials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan authorities reacted energetically to the information,
searching for explosives on the island where the meeting was to be
held. But in the United States the letter elicited what Alvarez
described as a surprisingly indifferent response.
</P>
<P>
   An agent in the Miami office reached him by phone, Alvarez
recalled in recent interviews, and said a colleague would call soon
to arrange to speak with him. In the meantime, he urged Alvarez to
leave Guatemala immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me my life was in danger, that these were dangerous
people, and urged me to get out of Guatemala,'' said Alvarez, a
62-year-old engineer. ``But I never heard from him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the FBI met with Alvarez, agents would have heard a
remarkable tale about the anti-Castro underworld.
</P>
<P>
   They would have learned that the gray-haired man was Luis Posada
Carriles, an anti-Castro exile who has devoted his life to
overthrowing the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   They would also have heard about possible links between the
plotters in Guatemala and Cuban exiles living in Union City, N.J.,
who Alvarez said were wiring money to the plotters. That allegation
raises questions about whether American laws were broken in the
Cuban hotel bombings, in which an Italian tourist was killed and
three people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   John Lewis Jr., an FBI assistant director in charge of national
security issues, declined to comment on Alvarez's letter or whether
any agent had spoken with Alvarez. FBI officials would say only
that as a matter of policy they respond to reports of possible acts
of violence anywhere. But Alvarez says the FBI showed a studious
lack of curiosity about the bombings. And Posada, who acknowledged
in an interview that he had directed the operation, said he had no
indication that the FBI was investigating him.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Posada described the FBI agent who had phoned
Alvarez in Guatemala, Jorge Kiszinski, as ``a very good friend''
whom he had known a long time. ``He's going to retire this year,''
said Posada. ``He has helped not just me but many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis of the FBI said such a friendship between the two men was
implausible. ``Agent Kiszinski has had two contacts with him in his
entire life, the last of which was a number of years ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Posada expressed confidence that the FB..was not examining his
operations in Guatemala, because ``the first person they would want
to talk to is me, and nobody called.'' In addition, he said, no one
from the bureau has tried to interview his collaborators. ``I would
know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, in contrast, has been embittered by his experiences as
a whistle-blower and believes that Posada has long provided
information to American authorities. ``I think they are all in
cahoots, Posada and the FBI,'' he said. ``I risked my life and my
business, and they did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter alerting Guatemalan authorities to the plot,
Alvarez wrote that while he opposed the Castro government and
communism, ``I believe that terrorism is not the way to resolve the
Cuban (or any other) situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Cuban exile politics and plotting were the last
things on his mind when he first came here in 1996 with hopes of
building electric power plants in rural areas. On the advice of
friends, he hired a fellow Cuban exile who has lived here since
1970, Jose Francisco (Pepe) Alvarez, to manage a company he had set
up. To run another, he recruited Jose Burgos, a recently retired
veteran of the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers who had worked,
Alvarez and Posada said, as a bodyguard for the family of a former
Guatemalan president.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here, both Burgos and Pepe Alvarez denied any
connection to the hotel bombings, although Pepe Alvarez said he had
known Posada for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are old now, too old for that sort of thing,'' Pepe
Alvarez said. ``Hell, I'm the same age as Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Tony Alvarez said, things seemed to be running
smoothly. But he soon noticed that his partners were spending much
of their time with a strange visitor, a Cuban with a shattered jaw
and a strangled voice ``like that of a deaf-mute,'' giving their
guest free rein to make phone calls from the office to El Salvador,
Venezuela, Honduras, Spain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Alvarez said, his partners confided to him that the
visitor was the infamous Luis Posada Carriles, known to his friends
by the ironic nickname Bambi. His other noms de guerre include
Solo, in honor of the dashing spy character in the 1960's
television series ``The Man from Uncle,'' and Lupo, an acronym
meaning wolf in Italian. As events rapidly made clear, Posada's
main interest was not in making money or helping Guatemala rebuild,
but in waging his own private war on Cuba and Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   At the office one day early last year, Alvarez recalled, Posada
came by and handed out ``a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills'' to
his partners. They, in turn, ``were going to an electronics store
and buying detonators and small calculators with timers'' of the
type that could be used with bombs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was suspicious enough, Alvarez said. But his biggest
surprise came when he found explosives in an office closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a plastic bag,'' he recalled, ``they had 23 tubes of stuff
made by the Mexican military industry, supposed to be the latest in
explosive materials in the world. I saw it.'' In addition to
Posada, two Guatemalans, whom Alvarez identified as Marlon Gonzalez
and Jorge Rodriguez, began to frequent the office. Both men were
introduced to him as friends and former army buddies of Burgos.
During a recent interview, Posada said they were his bomb makers
who joined his cause because ``that was how to make the big
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact the two men here were unsuccessful. Posada
said he had learned in May that Gonzalez had been murdered. Asked
why and by whom, he replied: ``Who knows? He talked too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgos denied that he had ever met either of the two men Posada
identified as bomb makers; he acknowledged that a previous job on
military road projects had given him access to Guatemalan Army
explosives warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the first reports of an explosion in the
discotheque of Havana's most fashionable hotel, the Melia Cohiba,
were published in Miami. Those accounts were promptly denied by the
Cuban government, which relies on tourism as its principal source
of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five months, however, nearly a dozen explosions
occurred at hotels, restaurants and discotheques in Havana and the
chic beach resort of Varadero. Cuba was forced to acknowledge the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Posada said, it took ``maybe a month or two'' to
organize the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the explosives had been smuggled in, Posada laughed
and replied: ``You know what a circus is? Inside an elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cryptic remark, but perhaps a true one. A Salvadoran
arrested by Cubans and charged in several of the bombings had
worked for a private security agency in El Salvador. According to
his mother, one of his assignments was protecting a Mexican circus
that toured Central America and later traveled to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Alvarez said he had overheard talk about another possible
smuggling route. ``Posada, Pepe and Jose talked about the success
of the bombs they sent to Cuba,'' he said. ``They also talked about
a senior mechanic who works for Aviateca who travels frequently to
Cuba and who has been helping them.'' Aviateca, the Guatemalan
airline, flies to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he added, his partners offered his secretary
``an all-expenses-paid trip to Cuba in a five-star hotel, in return
for which all she had to do was deliver a package to a certain
person who would come to the hotel to meet her.'' According to
Alvarez, the secretary declined, ``because she didn't want to be
involved in anything that appeared dishonest or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in August, at the height of the bombing campaign in Cuba,
Tony Alvarez said, he intercepted the fax that Posada had sent from
El Salvador and signed Solo.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that he had written the document, a copy of
which was obtained by The New York Times from a Venezuelan
official. The fax refers to a problem Posada had at the time: the
reluctance of American news organizations to take seriously the
claims of Miami exile groups that bombs were going off in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no publicity, the job is not useful,'' the message
read. ``The American newspapers publish nothing that has not been
confirmed. I need all the data from the discotheque in order to try
to confirm it. If there is no publicity, there is no payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The message also discussed payments for bombings, saying that
money would be ``sent by Western Union from New Jersey'' to
``liquidate the account for the hotel.'' The document instructed
Pepe Alvarez to collect electronic transfers of $800 each from four
Cuban exiles there.
</P>
<P>
   One, identified in the fax as Abel Hernandez, appears to be the
owner of Mi Bandera (My Flag), a supermarket and restaurant in
Union City, a heavily Cuban-American town just across the Hudson
River from Manhattan. At the restaurant's entrance, one of Posada's
paintings faces a photograph of Hernandez arm in arm with Jorge Mas
Canosa, the late founder of the Cuban-American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez denied knowing or sending money to Posada. The other
three men named in the message also live in Union City and belong
to the Union of Former Political Prisoners, an exile group whose
members have served long terms in Castro's jails and are committed
to his overthrow by any means.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the money was actually transferred or
whether those named as sending it knew of its purpose. In the
interview, Posada asked a reporter whether the four men in Union
City ``could get in trouble for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said the fax so alarmed him that he wrote a letter about
``this horrendous matter'' and gave it Guatemalan intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez also recalls overhearing plans for an attack on Castro
when he was scheduled to visit Guatemala in December 1996 and again
at the meeting in Margarita Island in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela responded to the information with alarm: Posada had
served as chief of operations for Venezuelan intelligence for seven
years, and in 1976 had been arrested in Caracas on charges of
blowing up a Cuban airliner and killing all 73 persons on board. He
spent nearly nine years in prison there, so he had both the
knowledge and the motive needed to carry out an attack on Castro on
Venezuelan soil.
</P>
<P>
   Castro attended the meeting without incident in early November,
flying in with a protective convoy of three airplanes. But before
his arrival, more than 250 Venezuelan and Cuban agents combed the
luxury Isla Bonita Hotel, where the gathering was to be held, and
the government expelled the Cuban exiles who had flocked to the
island ahead of Castro.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a curious arrest shortly before the summit
meeting: Four men in a boat were stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard
off Puerto Rico. Almost immediately, the leader of the group, Angel
Alfonso Aleman, of Union City, blurted out that he was on a mission
to kill Castro, according to court testimony by federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law enforcement officials quickly determined that the boat
was registered to a member of the executive board of the
Cuban-American National Foundation. In addition, one of the guns
aboard was traced back to the group's president, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The trail also led to Union City.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso, who spent 18 years in Castro's prisons, is a former
president of the Union of Former Political Prisoners and a friend
of the four men listed on the fax, group members said.
</P>
<P>
   A group member said Alfonso told him that ``Pepe Alvarez is one
of the names we use to get money to Posada.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Posada acknowledged a warm friendship with
Alfonso, whom he referred to by his nom de guerre, La Cota, which
means the parrot. He said he was a ``very good and dedicated
person'' and said he first met Alfonso in Miami in 1991. Posada
denied knowing the four men whose names were on the fax he wrote,
saying only that ``somebody told me'' to expect the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he had nothing to do with the Puerto Rico plot,
which he described as amateurish. He expressed surprise that the
men had used weapons registered to a leader of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look too professional to do that,'' he said. ``I
was surprised that he talked, that he said, `I want to kill
Castro.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holding an imaginary rifle aloft, he said that if he had been
aboard the boat, he would have told U.S. officials that ``those
guns were for shooting birds.''  &QL;

<P>
   Bhutan, one of two remaining absolute monarchies in Asia, has
taken a major step toward constitutional government with the
election of a new cabinet and a decision by the king to test his
rule in periodic votes of confidence. Although the king will still
be head of government _ there is no prime minister or president _
the National Assembly now has the right to demand his abdication.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan is the last of a group of independent Buddhist kingdoms
in the Himalayas, which once included Tibet, Ladakh and Sikkim. All
the rest have been swallowed up over the last century by China and
India.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan's efforts to preserve its distinct character have led to
clashes with non-Buddhist or non-Bhutanese minorities along the
country's southern border with India, who have demanded more
democracy. Tens of thousands of southerners have left the country
for refugee camps in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Only Brunei, on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia, now
remains an absolute monarchy. Its Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, one of
the world's richest people, more or less owns the country and
brooks no democratic opposition and almost no political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan, a collection of landlocked territories ruled by warlords
until the late 19th century, has had a hereditary monarch for less
than a century. It also has a powerful but separate central
monastic assembly in the Tibetan model, which has often preferred
to keep the country isolated and its Buddhist religion in the
dominant position.
</P>
<P>
   Since he came to the throne at age 16, Bhutan's king, Jigme
Synge Wangchuck, 42, has been mulling over how to modernize and
democratize the rural, mountainous country without changing it
completely, he said in interviews. His father took the first steps
toward modernization, including opening secular schools and health
centers.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been very selective in development, rejecting
large foreign-aid projects as unsuitable for a country of fewer
than a million people, most of them living in small villages. It
has limited the number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the king surprised his subjects by dismissing an
appointed cabinet and sending a new list of nominees for most of
their jobs to the National Assembly. The delegates duly elected a
group of generally younger men, some with considerable foreign
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The country's new foreign minister, Jigmi Thinley, 48, has a
master's degree in public administration from Penn State. Since
1994, he has been the country's representative at the United
Nations in Geneva, where he also served as a roving ambassador to a
number of European countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting moment in history,'' said Bhutan's only
newspaper, Kuensel, which is published weekly in English, Nepali
and Dzongkha, a Tibetan language. But its editorial page could not
resist a pang of nostalgia for years when prosperity grew with
Bhutan's growing exports of fruit, timber and hydroelectric power,
and most people were barely concerned with government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of us,'' the newspaper said. ``the past decades may
have been the best years of our lives. They certainly have been
golden years in Bhutanese history.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States may not yet resemble France, which is
paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but suddenly American
labor unions have taken to the streets in a way not seen in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong walkout that has shut down General Motors is the
auto industry's longest strike since 1970. An unusual two-day
general strike threw Puerto Rico's economy into chaos last week as
unions battled plans to privatize the government-owned telephone
company, a move the workers fear will mean large-scale layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And 12 days ago, 40,000 construction workers crippled midtown
Manhattan by staging a sometimes violent rally against a nonunion
contractor. It was the biggest, angriest demonstration by New
York's normally docile hard hats in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing ``Solidarity Forever''
hail these developments as a signal that union militancy, squelched
in the Reagan years, is making a comeback. But other analysts
suggest that the recent three-ring labor circus is a coincidental
confluence of events that should be viewed as exceptions to the
long, steady decline of militancy.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling evidence of labor's waning belligerence is that
the number of strikes nationwide has slipped to its lowest level
since World War II. There were just 29 strikes last year involving
1,000 workers or more, about half the amount of a decade ago and
one-eighth the level two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kruger, a professor of industrial relations at Michigan
State University, said the recent turbulence did not signal an
upswing in strikes or union aggressiveness. ``Sure, we're going to
have occasional strikes, but nothing of the magnitude we had in the
past because it's very dangerous to go on strike. People see it's
easy to call a strike, but hard as hell to end a strike and to win
a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are behind the decline in unions' strikes and
stridency. Unions now represent 14 percent of the work force, down
from 35 percent in the 1950s. Fears of layoffs engendered by
repeated rounds of downsizing have made many workers scared to
stand up to management.
</P>
<P>
   And union members often fear they will lose their jobs during a
strike because management is increasingly using permanent
replacement workers, as President Ronld Reagan did after dismissing
the striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Unions are also
shunning walkouts because they have seen several big strikes fail,
like the one six years ago against Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate officials attribute labor peace largely to improved
labor relations. At many companies, there is increased
employer-employee teamwork and managers are treating workers with
more respect. With many employees receiving bonuses and
profit-sharing, more and more workers feel allied to management,
rather than opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many situations where labor relations have
matured,'' said Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Auto
Workers and now a professor of labor relations at Wayne State
University. ``Companies and unions are finding different ways to
find solutions to problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some labor experts insist that the recent militant
actions are not exceptions, but instead reflect important changes
in the labor movement and in the economy. Since John Sweeney was
elected to the AFL-CIO's presidency in 1995, he has urged the
beaten-down union movement to stand up and be willing to confront
management.
</P>
<P>
   With the lowest jobless rate in 30 years, workers are feeling
more confident about job security, and union leaders are convinced
it will be harder for management to find permanent replacement
workers during strikes. In addition, many workers are bitter that
their pay has barely kept pace with inflation while Wall Street and
executive compensation have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting an increase in strikes, Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor
relations professor at Cornell University, said union militancy was
at a turning point. ``What we're seeing is workers are fed up with
being told that there is this great American economic boom and
they're not sharing it, and their patience with Corporate America
is waning,'' she said. ``We see that at GM and we saw that last
year in the UPS strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind every strike is a unique set of circumstances, so it is
often hard to tell whether strikes are one of a kind or part of an
underlying trend. The GM strike began when the UAW grew angry that
the company had failed to make out a promised investment at a plant
in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The New York construction workers rallied, shutting down most of
Manhattan's unionized building sites, because they feared that the
growth of nonunion contractors would cost them their jobs. Even
though these actions differed in cause and means, some experts say
they were both inspired by Sweeney's more muscular tone for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a bottoming out of strike activity because
it couldn't go much lower,'' said Greg Tarpinian, president of the
Labor Research Association, a New York-based research group.
``Given the tight labor market and the unhappiness with attacks on
workers, people are finally starting to feel a little more
confident about flexing their muscles.'' &QL;

SIDES ARE SQUARING OFF ON RAISING RETIREMENT AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., N.H., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given that people are living longer, many
politicians and economists think that gradually raising the
retirement age to 70 or even higher is a fair means of reducing the
financial strain that threatens the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Given that her bones ache after decades of hard work, Beth
Hamilton of Exeter, R.I., thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 62, Ms. Hamilton works full time in a group home
for mentally and physically disabled adults, lifting, bathing,
dressing and cleaning up after them. It is difficult and dirty work
that takes its toll; earlier this year she contracted pneumonia
from one of the people she looks after.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was implemented so slowly as to not affect her, Ms.
Hamilton said, raising the retirement age would be unfair to her
younger colleagues and to future generations of people who do not
have the luxury of working behind a desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had all sorts of injuries,'' she said. ``Our backs are
hurting. We've been bitten and had hepatitis shots. The idea of
doing this until 70 is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   As they begin examining details of various plans for restoring
Social Security's long-term financial health, Clinton
administration officials, members of Congress and interest groups
say few issues will be more passionately debated _ or subject to
demagoguery _ than proposals to raise the age at which retirees can
claim full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very visceral issue for a lot of people,'' said Warren
Rudman, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is
co-chairman of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group that
favors a gradual increase. ``A lot of people can't conceive of the
notion that they will have to spend more time in their jobs than
they planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the impact of any change _ on individuals, employers
and the economy _ could be substantial, the issue has gotten
relatively little attention so far in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many people appear unaware that under changes adopted in 1983,
the age at which retirees can claim full Social Security benefits
is already scheduled to increase. From 2003 through 2008 it will
gradually rise to 66 from 65. Then, from 2021 through 2027, it will
rise gradually to 67. (The early retirement age would remain 62,
but the benefits available at that age would decline as the full
retirement age increases.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plans being considered in Washington would
accelerate the existing timetable. Others would push the retirement
age even higher. A comprehensive plan developed by a bipartisan
commission working with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a research group, recommended in May that the retirement
age be raised to 70 by 2029, and be raised as needed after that to
account for further increases in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Given that tough tradeoffs are going to have to be made to
ensure Social Security's long-term survival, increased life
expectancy alone makes raising the qualifying age for full benefits
fair game, said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who was a member of the
bipartisan commission. Life expectancy for males, which was about
60 at the time Social Security was created in 1935, is almost 73,
meaning that people are spending many more years in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg said the commission's plan offsets the increased
retirement age in other ways, including removing the cap on how
much money retirees can earn before the age of 70 without reducing
their Social Security payments. That change might lead some people
to choose early retirement at reduced benefits in the expectation
that they would keep working part time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the centerpiece of the commission's plan _
private accounts that allow workers to invest a portion of their
payroll taxes in the stock market _ will provide a pool of wealth
beyond Social Security benefits that retirees will be able to tap
starting at age 60. Advocates of such accounts say they will more
than offset any reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And since the change would not take place for decades or affect
anyone near retirement age now, those who are affected will have
plenty of time to prepare, Gregg said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The proposal ``is tied to a system that gives you many more
options so that you can have a quality lifestyle if you retire
early,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On substance,'' he said, ``this is a heck of a good approach.
On the demagoguing aspect, Social Security has always been
demagogued by people who are absolutely irresponsible and only look
to the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, as well as some Democrats in Congress, said it is
not a matter of demagoguery at all, just of understanding how
strongly working people feel about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done focus groups in which people reject resoundingly
some of the ideas that are taken for granted around here, like
raising the retirement age,'' said Gerry Shea, assistant to the
president for government affairs at the AFL-CIO. ``People don't
realize it's already going to 67, and when you tell them about
proposals to move it up to 70, their reactions range from
incredulity to `Who came up with that idea?'''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House see the issue as a potent one as they
draw distinctions between how they and the Republicans would deal
with Social Security. They are drafting a comprehensive Social
Security proposal that would not call for any further changes in
the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people the issue is complicated, involving the kind
of work they do, changing cultural assumptions about when old age
begins, the value put on youth in the workplace, and their own
goals for financial security, career accomplishment and leisure
time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie Cola, a 65-year-old retired employee-assistance worker
from New York City, said she thought raising the retirement age
might be a reasonable way to help ensure that Social Security will
be around in the future. But she wants to hear more about the
tradeoffs, and she said she wondered whether employers would be in
step with a movement toward having people work until they are 68 or
70.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are being pushed out of their jobs,'' she said.
``They have the biggest health benefits, the most vacation, the
biggest salaries. Employers want you out.''
</P>
<P>
   The group that has the most at stake in the debate _ generally
those who are 40 or under and would be most likely to feel the full
impact of any further changes _ appears most ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I know where I'll be when I'm 65 or 67?'' said Mary
Ann Mroz, a 35-year-old college administrator from Somerville,
Mass. ``I don't think it's been fully thought through.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman said that as the population ages, employers will face a
shortage of workers, and will increasingly seek to lure retirees
back into full- or part-time work. Moreover, he said, many people
realize when they reach age 65 or 67 that they are not ready yet to
stop working entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although there are signs of more retirees from white-collar
jobs looking for full- or part-time employment, a trend toward
longer working lives would reverse decades in which there has been
a pronounced trend toward early retirement. In 1965, 30.2 percent
of the men who applied for Social Security retirement benefits were
under age 65. Since 1985, the figure has been around 66 percent,
and it is considerably higher for women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton, who attended a recent conference on Social
Security as part of a contingent of union members brought in by the
AFL-CIO, said she had been working since she was 14, and had been
eager to cut back to part-time this month when she turned 62.
</P>
<P>
   But when she went to her local Social Security office, she found
that her benefit would be $550 a month if she retired now, instead
of $730 if she retires at 65. Feeling that she could not afford to
live on the reduced benefit, she decided to keep working full time,
but she is already counting the days until July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a job like Andy Rooney, I'd work until I'm 75,'' she
said. ``But right now I'm disappointed.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Judge Lorin Duckman first came to wide public
attention in 1996 it was for lowering the bail of a man charged
with beating and threatening his girlfriend and ignoring court
orders to stay away from her. The man was then released, and three
weeks later he killed his girlfriend and himself.
</P>
<P>
   But when New York state's highest court ruled last week that
Duckman could be stripped of his judgeship, that case was not part
of its decision. Instead, he was banished from the bench for a long
record of behaving imperiously and preposterously in his Brooklyn
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The killings served only to shine a spotlight on Duckman's
misbehavior, which had been widely known among lawyers who had
appeared before him but did not cause judicial authorities to take
action against him.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Duckman decided to dismiss a case without
hearing the district attorney's arguments. According to court
documents, he was especially nasty to prosecutors, telling one that
he probably got his law license on the back of an orange juice
carton and another that he would prefer she appear in his courtroom
in short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman's erratic and tyrannical behavior is hardly unique.
``Megalomania is an occupational hazard for judges,'' said Prof.
Paul Carrington of the Duke University Law School, noting that a
trial judge inevitably has a great deal of power over everyone in
the courtroom. ``Judges can get awfully full of themselves,'' he
said. ``Put it this way: everybody laughs at the judge's jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and public defenders in any city are able to point
to errant judges who are local legends, but they typically do so
only among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are intimidated by the fear of retaliation,'' said
Prof. Monroe Freedman of the Hofstra Law School. ``They usually
think they can't complain because they will eventually have to
appear before the judge and he will take it out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some jurists, like Duckman, do manage to become infamous.
Brian Duff, until recently a federal trial judge in Chicago, was
the subject of courtroom chatter for several years. He once ordered
the arrest of his personal clerk and had her held in contempt and
fined $20 after a quarrel in which he complained she had handed him
a file facing the wrong way. She was held in custody for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Duff refused to accept briefs unless they spelled out his middle
name, Barnett, and once mused aloud during a criminal trial that he
had recently been on a flight where a female attendant had
wonderful legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Council of Lawyers finally issued a report that said
Duff's ``outbursts go far beyond the range of irascibility that
judges sometimes show towards lawyers.'' The report also hinted at
why judges may feel they are above criticism: ``Some lawyers report
that the only way to avoid Duff's ire is to grovel and constantly
flatter him.''
</P>
<P>
   The few instances in which judges are removed from the bench
usually follow notorious publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Duckman, Gov. George Pataki asked the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct to remove him following the
bail-lowering incident.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most state judges, federal judges have life tenure and
can only lose their jobs after impeachment by Congress, a rare
occurrence that usually follows a criminal conviction. Duff retired
shortly after a drunken-driving arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Another egregious example of judicial arrogance in New York
occurred in 1975, when Judge William Perry of Suffolk County court
had a marshall bring into court in handcuffs a man who operated a
refreshment truck outside the courthouse because the judge thought
his coffee tasted bad. Perry was later thrown off the bench, not
for abusing his office but for lying about the incident to a
disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Richtel, a state trial judge in Boulder, Colo., said a
big part of the problem was that judges are obliged to keep a
seemly distance from lawyers and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job that's isolating and they are deprived of the
opportunity to have feedback as to their behavior,'' he said. ``You
get very little criticism from the people in front of you and you
don't hear the truth about your performance. You can get deeper and
deeper into a pattern of behavior that's wrong and not even suspect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Schwarzer, a senior federal trial judge in San
Francisco and the former director of the Federal Judicial Center in
Washington, said, ``Much of the misconduct of judges in the
courtroom is a reflection of their insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that most people viewed judges as being in total
control. ``But when you're up there having to deal with attorneys
at each other's throats arguing about tough issues, you're under an
awful lot of pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges who are unable to handle that kind of pressure, Schwarzer
said, resort to arbitrary and sometimes foolish behavior. ``There
are times when you get mad at a lawyer,'' he said. ``But consistent
heavy-handed and arbitrary behavior is as much due to insecurity
and intellectual laziness as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwarzer warned that some attacks on judges mask a wider
political agenda aimed at diminishing judicial independence, as
when a politician criticizes an unpopular ruling to win favor with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what's really occurring is really an attack on
judicial decision making,'' he said. ``It's one thing to complain
about judges who conduct themselves badly or arrogantly, but it's
something else to censure judges for what they say in the
decision-making process.''

<P>
   As the century began, optimists could easily have convinced
themselves that by the time 2000 rolled around there would be
nothing left for scientists and theologians to argue about. Each
would have long since agreed on how to divvy up the intellectual
terrain. Science would continue its inevitable march toward a grand
explanation of how the material world works, leaving to religion
the endless arguments over why the universe came to be and how
people ought to behave in it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wished could continue to believe in higher, spiritual
forces, whose existence was safely beyond the scrutiny of
experiment. But almost everyone, believer and nonbeliever alike,
would slowly come to embrace a compelling new picture of creation
woven from the interplay between reason and observation.
</P>
<P>
   With this tacit understanding in place, the age-old conflict
between religion and science _ the truths of God versus the truths
of man _ would fade away.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened that way. No Giordano Brunos are being burned
at the stake for challenging church doctrine, and there are no
Galileos under house arrest. But the skirmishes between science and
religion still flare, with neither content to stay on its side of
the frontier. In the late 20th century's intellectual free-for-all,
it's sometimes hard to tell the players apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sociobiology, repackaged with the fancy new name ``evolutionary
psychology,'' continues to outrage the faithful by trying to
explain away religious belief and moral behavior as outgrowths of
competing snippets of DNA. Cosmologists and physicists sound like
theologians as they proclaim that the purpose of their quest is, as
Stephen Hawking put it, to ``know the mind of God.''
</P>
<P>
   When the physicist George Smoot announced, several years ago,
the discovery of faint wrinkles in the cosmic background radiation
_ long-sought data needed to explain the unfolding of the cosmos _
he said it was like ``looking at God.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk is often more metaphorical than reverential,
but Einstein wasn't kidding when he started the trend with his
oft-quoted musings about a God who is ``subtle but not malicious''
and who does not play with quantum dice. Then as now, these kinds
of pronouncements reveal the depth of the ambitions behind the
cosmological endeavor: final answers to the ultimate mysteries. The
implication is that religion should step aside and leave it all to
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two ways to play this game. Religious believers
seem more eager than ever to step over the line, trying to
interpret scientific data to support the revealed truths of their
own theology. The creationists are old hands at this, with their
arguments that radioactive dating, properly massaged, actually
supports an Earth just thousands of years old and a universe
created in seven days. Nearly 150 years after the publication of
Darwin's ``On the Origin of Species,'' biologists and geologists
are still defending their craft before state legislators who want
schools to teach that evolution is ``just a theory'' _ something
that could also be said for the hypothesis that the Earth orbits
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   This marshaling of scientific data in the name of religion
reached strange new heights four years ago with a popular book
called ``The Physics of Immortality'' (Doubleday), in which
cosmologist Frank Tipler drew on quantum physics, computer science,
sociobiology and game theory to try to prove mathematically the
existence of an eternal afterlife. The entertaining result made
both scientists and theologians cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Less audacious books trying to find connections between science
and religion have appeared sporadically throughout the century. But
the recent surge has been remarkable, with titles like ``The
Science of God: The Convergence of Scientific and Biblical
Wisdom,'' by Gerald L. Schroeder (The Free Press, 1997), and
``Skeptics and True Believers: The Exhilarating Connection Between
Science and Religion,'' by Chet Raymo (Walker, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   With the border between science and religion threatening to
erode, there is even talk of trying to reconcile them, as though
they were just two different denominations at the same ecumenical
gathering. If Lutherans and Catholics can unsplit a few hairs and
agree on some points of belief, as happened last month, then why
not scientists and theologians?
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled John Templeton Foundation has embarked on a plan
to establish science-and-religion programs at universities
throughout the world. Last month, it underwrote a multimillion
dollar conference at Berkeley called ``Science and the Spiritual
Quest,'' seeking to find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a change from the days when a bold new theory
could land a scientist before an ecclesiastical tribunal. Even the
most devout know that science is here to stay. Any religion that
outrightly rejects science's most powerful theories _ like
evolution and the big bang _ will find itself relegated to
society's fringes. For the churches, part of the motivation for
``dialogue,'' as they like to call it, is purely strategic:
religion needs to secure a niche for itself in an increasingly
scientific world.
</P>
<P>
   And some theologians may feel that science, for all its
confident airs, has fallen into an uncharacteristically vulnerable
position, with more of its practitioners willing to admit that
their picture of the universe is far from complete, and probably
never will be. In counterpoint to the heady declarations about
physicists finding God is a quieter chorus of scientists agonizing
over how little of the infinite cosmos puny human brains may ever
really understand.
</P>
<P>
   The philanthropic Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has even launched a
program to plumb the limits of science _ ``unknowability,'' as the
effort is sometimes called. If some scientists are admitting that
they can't find all the answers, then maybe it is time to talk.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lingering in the background of some of this soul-searching is
postmodern philosophy, with its message that all belief systems,
scientific and religious, are just human constructions. This kind
of thinking has recently been making inroads in some theological
schools and seminaries, as it has in university English
departments. Through this lens, science is just one more religion;
the Periodic Table of the Elements and the Apostle's Creed are just
two more texts to deconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious leaders reject postmodern relativism as a
dangerous threat to moral certainty, and scientists find it as
obnoxious as biblical creationism and the repackaged medieval
sorcery hawked by the New Age prophets of Sedona and Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, very few scientists, even those with strong
religious beliefs, have jumped on the reconciliation bandwagon. In
the labs and the lecture halls they still diligently uphold the
strict quarantine between the tentative truths derived through
hypothesis and experiment and the unshakable convictions that
spring from faith. What business do scientists have in trying to
shore up religion's received wisdom? And is any church going to
abandon a doctrine because it doesn't stand up to experiment? Push
science and religion too close enough together and they repel as
surely as oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   Why then do they keep making forays into each other's
hinterlands? And why do some people feel the need not just to cross
over the border but to tear it down?
</P>
<P>
   Some of these yearnings surely spring from the human compulsion
to build all-embracing explanations. It's hard to abandon the hope
for a system that accounts for everything, from why there is
something instead of nothing to how snowflakes form. If one is true
to this belief, then science must ultimately subsume religion or
vice versa _ at least in one's own mind. The truce, dividing up the
spoils, would be just temporary and tactical, a holding action in
the march to tell the ultimate story.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to finding final answers, seekers _ religious
and scientific _ know deep down that there are weaknesses in both
their approaches. The teachings of any religion ultimately come
from ancient revelations by people who said they were prophets and
heard the voice of God. These truths can be embraced as absolute
and timeless, but they are necessarily based on a leap of faith _
the very source of religion's strength. What if the prophets turn
out to be wrong? Or nonexistent?
</P>
<P>
   As with religion, science's weakness is also its strength: its
knowledge is, by definition, forever tentative, subject to constant
revision. No matter how compelling a theory seems, there is always
the possibility of a new finding that will shake and even overturn
what seemed like solid ground. The burden of faith is lighter and
the path to understanding surer, but the journey can never end.
</P>
<P>
   Given the trade-offs of both approaches, it's no wonder that
each side is sometimes a little envious of the other. It's all part
of the curse of never really knowing anything for sure.

   YUGAWARA, Japan _ For the last several months, sleepy commuters
in Kanagawa prefecture southwest of Tokyo have been jolted out of
their stupor by a strange sight: a dapper, blue-eyed Caucasian
bowing to them deeply and, in flawless Japanese, exhorting them to
vote for him on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a little of Mr. Smith in Marutei Tsurunen.
Born a Finn, he overcame tremendous odds and obstacles to become a
Japanese citizen in 1979 and now hopes to become a member of
Japan's Upper House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``I want to bring change to Japan,'' said Tsurunen, 58, who
is running as an independent. ``I want to open the political system
and make it work for the people who live here. And because I am
foreign and yet also Japanese, I think I can more easily push for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His political opponents say he has invigorated local politics in
Kanagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that his participation will increase voter
turnout overall, but it will encourage nonpartisan voters who
otherwise might not vote at all to get out and vote,'' said Tokuro
Kanbayashi, a representative of Keiko Chiba, a Democratic Party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrat and Democratic incumbents look likely to
secure their seats again. An analysis by the Asahi Shimbun, one of
Japan's leading newspapers, put Tsurunen's odds for winning the
third seat at 50-50, saying he was running neck-and-neck with the
Communist Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his strength is that his unique campaign is overcoming
existing party lines and that he's mobilizing people who are not
satisfied with the existing parties,'' said Shigeru Sakamoto,
campaign manager for Fumio Saito, an incumbent Upper House member
from the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tsurunen is no political novice. In 1992, he was elected to the
local assembly in Yugawara, the small, seaside resort town in
Kanagawa that is his home. He won despite a significant financial
disadvantage: Accepting only contributions from individuals, he had
only 360,000 yen at his disposal, compared to the millions of yen
spent by some of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked that the assembly met in plenary session for only two
days, he went public with details of the behind-the-scenes horse
trading between local government officials and assembly members
that had preceded the session.
</P>
<P>
   Nemawashi, as the closed-door wrangling is known, shields debate
_ and the deals made to resolve it _ from public view and is a
time-honored tradition in Japanese business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsurunen regarded it as stifling opposing points of view
that his electorate had a right to hear. So he went to the
newspapers, and now Yugawara has a plenary session that lasts at
least two weeks and the horse-trading is done publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that there was really nothing I could do to clean up
the party itself, but that I could open the planning and
decision-making process to public view,'' he said, referring to the
Liberal Democratic Party, which has had a lock on power in the
postwar period with the exception of a few years. ``There's no real
democracy in Japan, because people can't get their opinions heard
in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his assembly victory, Tsurunen aimed for a place in
the national political scene, running as an independent for an
Upper House seat in 1995. He came in fourth of 14 candidates, just
shy of winning one of Kanagawa prefecture's three seats.
</P>
<P>
   He is confident he will improve his showing in this election.
His 1995 campaign had little advance planning, no organization and
a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 400 volunteers are working on his behalf, and he
has been campaigning for more than a year, waking at dawn to trek
to another station and hand out pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 70 or 80 percent of them take it,'' he said of the
commuters he greets. ``No one really bothers us too much. I've only
been heckled a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsurunen came here as a Lutheran missionary in 1967, working at
a home for children in Kyushu, the southern island in the Japanese
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The influence of the church here is very weak,'' he said. ``I
knew I would have to get out of the church to really have an impact
on social welfare in this country, although I'm still a
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, he left the ministry after six years.
</P>
<P>
   But with no affiliation to any corporate, religious or other
organization, he could not stay in Japan. One way he could remain
was to marry a Japanese. He divorced his wife and married a young
woman, Sachiko, whom he had counseled after she attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He set himself up as a translator, opened an English-language
school in Yugawara and began pursuing Japanese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the practical thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, foreigners were not eligible for public health
insurance or pensions and could not obtain housing loans. And
Tsurunen wanted to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining citizenship took some persistence. Immigration
authorities considered him a bit of a crackpot and initially would
not give him the application forms. He and his wife endured three
intensive interviews. His neighbors were interviewed. Immigration
officials visited his house to ascertain that he was indeed living
a Japanese lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1979, he became a Japanese citizen, with the
Japanese name Marutei Tsurunen instead of the Finnish Martti
Turunen, and eligible to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel Japanese?'' he said. ``No. I'm still a Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I wanted to be as Japanese as possible,'' he
continued. ``But I quickly realized that was impossible and not at
all necessary to achieve what I wanted to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, Tsurunen would be the first Caucasian to serve in
the Japanese Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very often feel why in the world did I get into this,'' he
said. ``People are expecting so much from me, and if I win, I'll
always be in the spotlight. Everyone wants me to change politics,
and it's very hard for one foreigner to do that.'' &QL;

   ORANGE BEACH, Ala. _ Accustomed to weathering the occasional
hurricane that barrels out of the Gulf of Mexico, this bustling
resort is now bracing for a potential catastrophe of a different
sort.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, saying the Gulf's signature red snapper is as
overfished as it is delicious, are threatening to close down
recreational angling for snapper as early as Sept. 1. It is a
decision that could have a devastating economic impact on this
community that bills itself as ``the red snapper capital of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would put me out of business,'' said Neal Grube, a
veteran charter captain who earns $750 a day and more from sports
anglers on his 38-foot boat, the Catch-it.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one. About 100 charter boats run out of the
marinas dotting the waterways of this fishing center on the eastern
end of the 32-mile island reaching from the Florida border to
Mobile Bay, informally called Pleasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   World-class fishing and sugar-white sand have helped Orange
Beach and the adjacent Gulf Shores blossom into a full-fledged
tourist destination. But fishing drives the economy and tourism
officials are busy estimating the potential losses in an effort to
persuade officials of the National Marine Fisheries Service to keep
the season open even if the agency determines that too many red
snapper are being killed in the nets of commercial shrimpers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 study put the direct financial impact of charter fishing
on the local economy at $35 million annually with an additional $10
million to $15 million attributed to the ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing is a mainstay of the economy,'' said Herbert Malone
Jr., president of the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors
Bureau. ``It not only fuels the fishing industry, the boats,
marinas and suppliers, but the same people who come and go fishing
shop in the retail stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi Walker, president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association
and wife of a local charter captain, could not agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a single business on this island not touched by
the charter and recreational fishing,'' Mrs. Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was the lure of snapper fishing that drew visitors
to the area in the first place, with anglers in pursuit of the
brilliant rose-hued fish arriving with their families in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter boat fishing really built this area,'' Mrs. Walker
said. ``Men would come down here to fish and their wives would
relax on the beach and that is still going on.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated two million people visit the resort island
annually, many of them returning year after year. Many of these
vacationers take a day or two out of their beach-going to cruise
aboard a charter 20 miles or more into the Gulf in pursuit of
snapper, which is now at the center of the conservation dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Once abundant, the snapper supported a thriving commercial
fishing industry as far back as 100 years. But in the 1980s, the
take of red snappers reached historical lows and worried federal
fishery managers began searching for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service imposed quotas on both
commercial and recreational fishing. This spring, after a decade of
deliberations and $10 million in research, the service went after
what it believed to be a major cause of the declining snapper
stock: the trawls of commercial shrimpers that ensnare and kill
inch-long snappers.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate what it estimates is the loss of 35 million
juvenile snappers a year in shrimp nets, the fisheries service in
May began requiring shrimpers plying most Gulf waters to sew into
their nets a special device that is supposed to let trapped fin
fish escape. The agency is now monitoring use of the new gear. If
agency officials determine it is not sufficiently effective, they
could cut back or shut down recreational snapper fishing.
Commercial snapper fishing _ already suspended _ would not be
allowed to resume this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is seriously overfished and I think you have to put
the emphasis on the word seriously,'' said Andrew Kemmerer,
southeast region director for the National Marine Fisheries
Service.
</P>
<P>
   But the charter boat captains say their experience suggests
otherwise. They say passengers on their boats easily catch their
daily four-fish limit of snappers.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen and some biologists credit an ambitious effort to
build artificial reefs off the coast _ dropping everything from
surplus military tanks to old bridge spans into the Gulf _ with
helping the snapper rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Kemmerer and conservation advocates concede the snapper stock
appears to be recovering. But they say continued limits are
necessary to give the new fish the chance to reach their prime
reproductive years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal decision to link the fortunes of the shrimpers and
the snapper fishermen has the two factions sniping at each other.
The shrimpers, who already pull devices to save endangered sea
turtles, do not like the new gear and have filed a lawsuit in Texas
in an effort to get the regulation lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The snapper fishermen fault the shrimpers for the predicament,
saying the more powerful shrimp industry employed its ample
political clout to delay needed restrictions on fish ensnared by
accident while the snapper fishermen regularly absorbed limits on
their catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four snapper a person to me is fair,'' said Ben Fairey, who
captains the Necessity. ``But when you are talking about a closed
season in the middle of our tourist season, that is economic
disaster for us.''

   A Long-Running Battle Over Breast Implants  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers representing the tens of thousands
of women who claimed injury from silicone breast implants agreed to
a $3.2 billion settlement, bringing to a close one of the nastiest
disputes in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement has enticements for both sides. The
170,000 women who filed claims against Dow Corning could recover
damages as early as next year. Dow Corning, forced into bankruptcy
by injury lawsuits in 1995, can now emerge from Chapter 11 without
admitting any liability over its silicone wares.

   Misconduct at the Top  &QL;

   As deputy inspector general of the Army, Maj. Gen. David Hale
oversaw investigations of sexual misconduct by Army brass. Problem
was, Hale was facing some of the same allegations himself. Yet he
was still allowed to retire in February, with the investigations
unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon report last week found that he had engaged in a
pattern of ``inappropriate behavior'' or adulterous affairs with
the wives of four officers under his command in an earlier
assignment. The report fueled charges of an Army double standard,
in which senior officers accused of misconduct are allowed to
retire quietly while enlisted personnel or juniors officers are
prosecuted and jailed. Hale denied the misconduct charges.

</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court rejected the Clinton administration's
claim that Secret Service agents should not have to testify about
what they knew of the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. The Secret Service has argued that if its agents were
compelled to testify about the private life of the president, they
would be pushed away and unable to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky's former colleague, Linda Tripp, made
two more appearances before a federal grand jury in Washington,
just as another investigation was beginning. A Maryland prosecutor
announced that he had convened a local grand jury to examine
whether Ms. Tripp broke a law when she secretly recorded her
telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.

   HMOs Pull Out of Medicaid And Medicare in Some States  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employers give health maintenance organizations the credit for
stopping inflation in the cost of their workers' health benefits,
and Congress and the Clinton administration want them to do the
same for their big benefit programs _ Medicaid, for the poor, and
Medicare, for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But blaming inadequate reimbursements for their services,
leading HMOs have been pulling out of at least 12 states. Aetna
U.S. Healthcare has dropped Medicaid programs in Connecticut and
New York, leaving only New Jersey with one. Medicare beneficiaries
are losing programs in 10 California counties and 22 in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The move is more a trickle than a flood, with most of the
managed care organizations still operating their programs. But
President Clinton called the trend ``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned elderly have no choice but to return to more
costly fee-for-service medicine, and the poor to ``Medicaid mills''
that provide inferior care.

   Maybe it's because it just bought Rolls-Royce, but Volkswagen is
suddenly feeling a bit more expansive _ more like meeting its moral
obligations. It had once insisted that in employing 15,000 mainly
Jewish slave laborers during World War II, it was, to use that
chilling excuse, ``just following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, in an about-face, the company will set up a fund to
compensate those workers, many of whom now live in Israel. As
usual, though, justice delayed will often be justice denied: Many
of the workers are dead.

   Bully Pulpit
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the government would no longer do
business with any health insurance company that flouts a 1996 law
intended to guarantee access to coverage for people who change or
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you violate the letter or the spirit of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law, we will, if necessary, terminate your
contract to provide health insurance to federal employees,''
Clinton said. ``If you say no to people with pre-existing
conditions, the federal government will say no to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers insisted there was no evidence of abuse. The Health
Insurance Association of America called the president's
announcement an election-year stunt _ ``a frivolous misuse of his
bully pulpit.''

   A Gain for the Palestinians At the United Nations

   A large majority of United Nations members, concerned about the
lack of progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians,
voted with a group of Arab and developing countries to expand the
Palestinians' rights in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has
administrative functions over real territory, the General Assembly
granted its delegation a special (though nonvoting) observer
status, with the right to take part in debates as well as United
Nations conferences. Washington opposed the move.
</P>

   Some U.S. diplomats sense that the lopsided vote for the
resolution reflects the plummeting position of the deadbeat United

   The thieves who stole two Van Goghs and a Cezanne from a Rome
museum in May were real pros, one investigator said, ``but they
didn't know too much about art.'' In their grand plans to sell them
for millions, they forgot that no one would touch such famous
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   And they also ignored this: While Italy has Renaissance art on
every street, these were its only Van Goghs. An irate Italy
assigned more than 100 law-enforcement officers to the case,
recovering all three paintings in predawn raids.

   More Money, Please  &QL;

<P>
   With Russia's economy hanging in the balance, the International
Monetary Fund has offered to give a helping hand to the government
of President Boris Yeltsin. But last week Russian officials and
Western investors were asking whether the fund was providing too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's initial suggestion was to provide $5.6 billion in new
financing, a small part of the $20 billion or more the Kremlin is
looking for. As the dance between the fund and the Russians went
on, the Kremlin was trying to prod the fund to double its
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin was not simply waiting for the fund to get the
message. On Friday, Yeltsin decided to go over the head of the fund
and telephone world leaders.

   The Clinton administration rolled out a new type savings bond
that it billed as inflation insurance for small investors _ or just
folks searching for the right birthday/wedding/new baby gift.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds' returns will rise and fall with consumer prices,
eliminating the risk that inflation will wipe out the value of a
30-year security.
</P>
<P>
   The new securities, which have all the tax benefits of
traditional savings bonds, are to be sold in eight denominations
from $50 to $10,000. Most of them, bearing the likenesses of such
people as Helen Keller ($50) and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
($100), go on sale this September.

   A Bouquet for Pepe Le Pew &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given both the shape and the scientific name of the
Amorphophallus titanum, the Viagra jokes were inevitable. And so
Carolyn White, the security guard who stood sentinel last week
beside the world's largest flowering plant, was amused but not
particularly surprised when visitors wondered aloud whether the
potting soil had been fertilized with a monster dose of the
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, in the horticultural event of the decade at the
Atlanta Botanical Garden, the 6-foot-2-inch tall plant began to
bloom. It was only the seventh time that the rare and unpredictable
plant from the Sumatran rain forest had flowered in cultivation in
the United States. During the next four days, until the bloom
wilted and shed, thousands of visitors jammed the normally tranquil
botanical garden like gawkers at a carnival freak show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting sucker, that's for sure,'' said an
admiring Carl Beck, a 72-year-old retiree. ``It's a wonder what
nature can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amorphophallus, which is also known as the Titan arum, is
not only a sight to see but also to smell. In order to attract
pollen-carrying insects on the first day of its brief bloom cycle,
the plant gives off a stench that is often compared to that of
rotting flesh.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the Amorphophallus seedling four years ago from
a botanical garden in Sarasota, Ron Gagliardo, curator of tropical
plants for the Atlanta garden, began nurturing it with bone meal
and chicken manure. It sprouted leaves but never showed signs of
blooming until June 12, when a bud first emerged from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Gagliardo, 33, was justifiably proud when the vast, vaselike
spathe, which is the color of dried blood, began to unfurl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first walked in the room and looked at it I was just in
awe,'' he said. ``It made my heart stop.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 12, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVIA-REVIEW (La Paz, Bolovia) _ All around Latin America,
book stores are well stocked with new texts about free markets and
global free trade. Such books brim with hope for the future, and
they are beginning to appear even in this backwater capital high in
the Andes. But here, they still have to share shelf space with a
rather depressing best-seller that carries a very different
message. The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas'
``A Sick People,'' and it seems at times that every literate
Bolivian has read it. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   CZAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ In writing, ``Uneasy lies the head that
wears a crown,'' Shakespeare couldn't have imagined the likes of
Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, whose remains will be interred on
Friday in St. Petersburg, Russia, along with those of his family.
Nicholas was considered a lightweight, a weak, unengaged but brutal
ruler who preferred family life to affairs of state, even as the
300-year-old Romanov empire was collapsing around him. His burial,
however, is a potent political symbol for post-Communist Russia. By
Judith Dobrzynski.

<P>
   NUCLEAR-DETERRENCE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The potential nuclear
arms race between India and Pakistan is an uneasy and unwelcome
test of how to get along in a world where non-proliferation appears
to have failed. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ As soccer reaches its apogee in
Paris with the World Cup final between France and Brazil, the game
remains as mysterious to vast numbers of Americans as it was when
all they saw of it was grainy photographs of Pele leaping in
triumph about something or other. By Kirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ There's a curious new genre that
seems to be emerging in American journalism: the media obituary. In
the hushed, somber tones used for that most solemn of news
accounts, reporters have been busy churning out virtual death
notices for the careers of disgraced colleagues. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME-REWARDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The offering of rewards has
increased in recent years, in part because of successes like the
Ennis Cosby case. But there is little evidence that they do much to
solve most crimes. By Kit R. Roane.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-YORKER-REVIEW (New York) _ Resign? From The New Yorker? In
the past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank,
their pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Tina Brown
simply left. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   ABUSIVE-JUDGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Megalomania is an
occupational hazard for judges,'' said Professor Paul Carrington of
the Duke University Law School. He added that a trial judge
inevitably has a great deal of power over everyone in the
courtroom. ``Judges can get awfully full of themselves,'' he said.
``Put it this way: everybody laughs at the judge's jokes.'' By Neil
A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-RELIGION-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the century began,
optimists could easily have convinced themselves that by the time
2000 rolled around there would be nothing left for scientists and
theologians to argue about. Each would have long since agreed on
how to divvy up the intellectual terrain. Science would continue
its inevitable march toward a grand explanation of how the material
world works, leaving to religion the endless arguments over why the
universe came to be and how people ought to behave in it. It hasn't
happened that way. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The United States may not yet resemble
France, which is paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but
suddenly American labor unions have taken to the streets in a way
not seen in decades. Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing
``Solidarity Forever'' are hailing recent developments as signaling
that union militancy, squelched in the Reagan years, is making a
comeback. But other analysts suggest that this month's three-ring
labor circus is a coincidental confluence of events that should be
viewed as exceptions to the long, steady decline of militancy. By
Steven Greenhouse.

   LA PAZ, Bolivia _ All around Latin America, book stores are well
stocked with new texts about free markets and global free trade.
Such books brim with hope for the future, and they are beginning to
appear even in this backwater capital high in the Andes. But here,
they still have to share shelf space with a rather depressing
best-seller that carries a very different message.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas' ``A Sick
People,'' and it seems at times that every literate Bolivian has
read it. It indicts Bolivia's history and national character as a
blight of corruption, provincialism and racial hatred, a synthesis
of ``laziness, poverty, barbarism.'' That conclusion, and the
book's abiding popularity, highlight the challenges that the global
free-market revolution faces here.
</P>
<P>
   As that revolution is increasingly accepted around the world as
the wave of the future, Bolivia's experience also can serve as a
lesson for other countries _ Cambodia and Congo, for example _ that
are also plagued by intractable geographical disadvantages, caste
structures and unstable political histories. The lesson is the
limits of the miracles promised by global free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Toranzo Roca, a prominent Bolivian economist, sums up the
lesson this way: ``You don't eradicate centuries of structural
social inequalities with 4 percent growth rates.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is exactly what a series of Bolivian governments
has tried to do since 1985, with the help of American economic
advisers including Jeffrey Sachs, the director of Harvard
University's Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the results have been spectacular. First,
the government tackled a 24,000 percent annual inflation rate by
slashing its budget and subsidies, and instituting property and
value-added taxes. The inflation rate was reduced to single digits
virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income, which had fallen by 30 percent between 1985
and 1990, began to climb an average of between 4 and 5 percent a
year, and with economic stability came political stability. The
nearly ritualistic annual coups that Bolivia had suffered through
for more than a century were replaced by a series of clean,
peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last Bolivian government ceded a controlling share of the
government oil, railroad, electricity, telephone and airline
monopolies to foreign corporations and overhauled the country's tax
and pension systems, diversifying the economy and boosting savings
rates in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soften political opposition to the privatization, the
government put large minority holdings in the firms into a private
pension trust fund that is beginning to pay all Bolivians older
than 65 a modest annuity. Foreign investment is blossoming, and a
new pipeline will soon deliver natural gas to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of globalization are popping up in the most unlikely
places. Indian trinket stands in La Paz are beginning to accept
American Express cards. Peasant union leaders now wear cellular
telephones on their belts. A fading mural depicting a defiant Che
Guevara on the campus of the national university now pales
alongside a bright new Coca Cola advertisement. Bolivia, where most
people still drink coca tea and a high-octane maize liquor called
chicha, is even beginning to export wine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results remain mixed for the great majority of poor
Bolivians.
</P>
<P>
   The average Bolivian still earns $900 a year, less than
one-fifth what the average Argentine or Chilean earns, and few of
the poor can expect to live long enough to see the benefits of
economic growth trickle down to transform their existence into
anything like a middle class lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   While the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz are
booming with new condominiums, banks and McDonald's franchises, the
rural Indian highlands continue to fall behind. Foreign investors
can't be enticed to build factories in mountain areas where
shipping costs are prohibitive, where even a third-grade education
is unusual and where only 1 percent of the people have finished
high school. More than half of all Bolivians speak Indian dialects
as their first language and many speak no Spanish at all. Forty
percent of the children in La Paz are chronically undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the lower classes have made no progress.
While life expectancy at birth remains a miserably low 60 years,
that is a major improvement over the 42 years that an infant born
in 1960 was expected to live. Only 55 percent of the population
currently has access to potable water, but in 1975 only 34 percent
did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this amount of progress is not enough to stem the
widening of the income gap between rich and poor, and particularly
between city dwellers and rural Indians _ although it apparently
has helped lend Bolivia a semblance of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to sustained economic growth is education, and you
can't educate a country overnight,'' conceded Vice President Jorge
Fernando Quiroga Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The new government of President Hugo Banzer Suarez is planning a
rural literacy campaign, and has proposed steps to help poor people
acquire loans. But with the region's economies beginning to slow in
the wake of the Asian financial crisis, no new economic boom is
anywhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Another intractable problem is Bolivia's virtual inability to
ship by sea, given the fact that its access to the Pacific Ocean
was lost in a war with Chile over 100 years ago, and the two
countries have not forgiven each other. Bolivia and Chile still do
not have diplomatic relations, leaving Bolivia dependent on
unreliable mountain roads and expensive air traffic to export its
goods.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably not any more economic policy dials that can
be easily turned in Bolivia,'' Sachs acknowledged. ``You can do
marvelous reforms, but still have very significant problems in
achieving a rapid improvement of living standards.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing economic reform can't change is history.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's Andean remoteness protected its Indians from the
European smallpox and plague that decimated most of Latin America's
indigenous populations. So a large Indian population remained to be
exploited by the Spanish colonizers as miners and tenant farmers,
and what emerged was a highly stratified society wracked by class
strife.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia was so unruly with caste and Indian wars that its
namesake, Simon Bolivar, fled it in disgust after he wrote a
constitution inspired by the most enlightened European ideals. The
constitution survived on paper, but the society went through more
than 250 rebellions and military coups over the next 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   A longstanding joke among neighboring Argentines compared
Bolivia to a long-playing record: ``33 revolutions a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The quip now seems as dated as the phonograph itself, but many
vestiges of class conflict survive.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. government's 1997 human rights report on
Bolivia, ``some rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of
virtual slavery by employers who charge them more for room and
board than they earn.'' A system of child servitude known as
criadito survives in which Indian parents indenture their
pre-adolescent children to middle- and upper-income families to
perform household chores. Many of the children are badly abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivia has made tremendous progress,'' said Herbert Klein, a
Columbia University historian who specializes in Bolivia, ``but it
starts from an incredibly backward base compared to everyone else
in Latin America.'' And with virtually every other country in Latin
America following the same successful economic policies, there is
no reason to believe Bolivia will catch up with its neighbors any
time soon.

COMMENTARY: THE WRONG MAN AT RIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fingerprints didn't match.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I wrote about a city employee and part-time musician
who was arrested a month ago for carrying an open can of beer in
public. This is one of those so-called quality-of-life offenses
that are enforced more vigorously in some neighborhoods than in
others.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Johnson was picked up in the Coney Island section of
Brooklyn on June 13, a routine check by police turned up a fugitive
warrant from South Carolina. It said that Johnson, a 41-year-old
father of two, was wanted on a drug charge. His nightmare was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted he was innocent. He didn't have a criminal
record. He'd never been to South Carolina, he said, except on a bus
that was passing through. His relatives and his friends, the
musicians with whom he played, his pastor and his fellow
congregants at church all said that Henry Johnson was a
hard-working man who was devoted to his kids and his music.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators in the office of Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles Hynes felt otherwise. The warrant had a correct former
address for Johnson as well as his date of birth and Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   As late as last Tuesday an assistant district attorney was
telling me, ``This looks like the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the problem. Henry Johnson was taken off
the street on June 13 and as the middle of July was approaching his
fingerprints still hadn't been compared with those of the fugitive.
Why? Because nobody in the district attorney's office bothered to
ask for a copy of the fingerprints from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The prints could have been faxed up in an instant, but they
weren't requested until last week when I called the district
attorney's office and said I was doing a column about the case. And
where was Johnson until last Monday? In jail on Rikers Island,
where he was subjected to all the degradation that a stay in that
sordid venue entails.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for Hynes admitted that a foul-up had
occurred. The prints should have been matched immediately, he said.
Filing error. The man should never have been dumped on Rikers. The
prints, he said, would be compared forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   But the bumbling continued. South Carolina faxed the fugitive's
fingerprints to Brooklyn, but Johnson's prints, taken when he was
booked on the beer charge, could not be found. As he had finally
been let out on bail, the district attorney's office had to ask him
to come in and be fingerprinted again.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the prints finally were compared. Johnson, who had
spent the better part of a month in jail, was not the fugitive. The
case against him was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them it was not me,'' he said. ``All they had
to do was fax that fellow's fingerprints and match them up with
mine and they would have seen it wasn't me. Instead they treated me
like a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his stay at Rikers was horrible. ``I'd never been
in jail before and I had a hard time,'' he said. ``You have to be
careful what you say and do. They will cut you up for a piece of
bread. They will fight you over the telephone. One day the guards
raided the place, turned over everything, made us strip in front of
them. I've never been through anything like that in my life.
Whenever I had a visitor, when I came back I had to take off my
clothes and stoop down and let somebody search me.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, when you're supposed to be sleeping, the inmates
would be doing whatever it is they wanted to do. I just tried to
lay there and sleep, just to keep myself from getting into any
confrontation with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could really have a nervous breakdown in there. I'm not in
very good shape right now. It kind of messed up my head a wee
taste, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, district attorney Hynes, who is running for
the Democratic nomination for governor, said: ``We were wrong,
absolutely wrong with this case. It's embarrassing. I'm the last
person in the world who wants the wrong person in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the head of his trial division is putting in place ``an
extradition review process'' to guard against similar foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no one knows who the real fugitive is, or what kind
of identification he used to convince authorities that he was Henry
Johnson.

COMMENTARY: TINA! 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that we have absorbed the thunderous news that
Tina Brown is leaving The New Yorker to become a Miramax Multimedia
Princess, we are all trying to figure out what, exactly, she will
be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kaplan, editor of The New York Observer, christened Ms.
Brown ``the guinea pig of synergy.'' Everyone has been babbling
about her new ``multimedia company,'' tossing around high-concept
words like ``synergy'' and ``content.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the new venture will be a monthly publication
that Ms. Brown described as ``a sizzling, 21st-century magazine ...
sophisticated and upscale.'' It will feature stories _ or
``content,'' as Ms. Brown says _ that can be turned into movies, TV
shows and books for Miramax and its parent company, Disney.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds cozy and millennial. But questions linger: Does
synergy exist? Isn't it just a sizzling synonym for monopoly? And
what in heaven's name is content? Isn't it just a pretentious word
for substance, which was, anyway, a pretentious word for ideas? Can
content be synergized the way milk is homogenized? Isn't
synergizing your content just setting up an assembly line to funnel
more plots into the Disney pipeline?
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of synergy, perhaps Ms. Brown will call the new
magazine TINA! Although it is touted as a nonfiction literary
magazine, the Miramax sponsorship will insure that money-hungry
writers shape their journalism into movie pitches, the kind you
find in publications like Spec Script Marketplace and Spec
Screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to picture the table of contents for TINA! _ stories
drawn from today's headlines, pitched as tomorrow's movies:
</P>
<P>
   CONSORT. The Camilla Parker Bowles story. A supernatural
thriller by Lillian Ross and Joe Eszterhas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella'' meets ``Ghost.'' Wicked stepmother-in-waiting
tries to win over sons of a beloved British princess, tragically
killed in her prime. But the princess returns as a beautiful ghost
to save her boys from the clutches of the prince-stealing,
fox-hunting, vodka-and-tonic-guzzling vixen who ruined her
marriage. Character-driven story. Fantasy collides with reality.
Three hankies. Star vehicle for Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen
Mirren.
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERN. Beguiling White House intern falls into the clutches
of an older man and older woman. An erotic thriller by Michael
Isikoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clueless'' meets ``Reservoir Dogs.'' Set in the nation's
capital, this story has it all _ sex, betrayal, intrigue. Perfect
vehicle for aging male star and nubile ingenue. Juicy supporting
roles for crazed prosecutor, girlfriend-from-hell and lawyer who
loses his marbles in mad obsession with Barbara Walters. Cameos for
Larry King and Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   THE THIRD WAY. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair break the old mold
and forge their own hip style of generational politics. A New Age
buddy story by Joe Klein and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma and Louise'' meets ``Scooby Doo.'' A true story of
ambition and friendship between two impossibly young and handsome
yuppies standing astride the cusp of a new millennium. Intelligent
character-based drama, with copious dialogue, set against backdrop
of exotic European locales. Two solid male leads, potential for
Oscar and Nobel Peace Prize. Besides, Emma Thompson can pull a
Patty Duke twin thing by playing Hillary and Cherie.
</P>
<P>
   THE GUINEA PIG OF SYNERGY. A black comedy by Dick Morris and
Harry Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Fair Lady'' meets ``My Cousin Vinny.'' Stylish, cynical,
contemporary story about greed, rivalry, synergy, ambition, social
climbing, broken dreams and starting over.
</P>
<P>
   Two thuggish brothers in Hollywood decide to steal brainy,
gorgeous, burned-out, Oxford-educated, tough-as-nails editrix from
two thuggish brothers in New York. Determined to buy themselves
some Culture, the cutthroat entertainment moguls throw millions at
the editrix to turn her into a glorified Hollywood D-girl,
developing product and otherwise scrounging around for tony
material to turn into tacky movies.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Kane in Chanel. Tightly wound plot with suspenseful
twists and explosive climaxes. Will our heroine ever realize
synergy is dumb? Will she follow her agenda instead of her heart
and only figure out when it is too late, as did Time and CNN, that
synergy is a recipe for disaster or mediocrity?
</P>
<P>
   Star vehicle for Kristin Scott Thomas! Potential merchandising
tie-in for female action figure that is a cross between Mary
Poppins and Rambo. Surprise ending. Designed for sequels. &QL;

   TSAR-BURIAL _ MOSCOW _ On Friday, Russia will hold a royal
burial unfit for a king. On the 80th anniversary of the murder of
the last tsar, Nicholas II, by a Bolshevik firing squad, his
charred bones and those of his family will be laid to rest in the
former imperial capital of St. Petersburg. The Yeltsin government
had hoped it would be a day of national reconciliation, a chance,
said the government official in charge of the burial, to stop the
civil war which has been smoldering in Russia since 1917.'' Now, it
seems, the Kremlin simply wants the ceremony low-key and quick.

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one

 &HT;    Home builder has never seen such a long stretch of ups
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Karl Zengel has been a home builder in this area
since the 1950s and he has seen a lot of ups and downs in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   He's never seen anything like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is good. Really it's so good that it scares you a
little bit,'' said Zengel, whose family-run business has a niche of
the present building boom.
</P>
<P>
   With generally low mortgage interest rates, around 7 percent or
lower, the United States is seeing record levels of new homes being
built. The number of new building permits is up 9 percent overall,
according to David Bohardt, executive director of the Home Builders
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic projections are predicting even further growth. For
example, Claritas, a scientific marketing research firm in
Virginia, has conducted an in-depth study of Dayton and the Miami
Valley. Its results indicate that the number of houses valued in
excess of $500,000 will nearly double in five years, from 592 units
in 1997 to 1,001 in the year 2002. Houses in the $250,000 to
$499,000 range will see a similar leap, from 4,721 to 8,448.
</P>
<P>
   Claritas uses a variety of statistical methods, census data,
polling and credit reports and has proven to be quite accurate in
anticipating buying patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new construction is suburban, but the city of Dayton
has seen more new house permits as well. However, the city has more
than 10,000 vacant or boarded-up houses.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his three brothers, John, George and Adam,
Zengel built his first house in 1957 and since has constructed 800
homes, apartments and condos. He has been through many economic
cycles: inflation, double-digit interest rates, the oil crisis of
the early '70s that cut off natural gas hookups. During the early
'80s he cut his workers back to three days a week to keep them
working.
</P>
<P>
   However, the economy started improving by the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since about 1986 we have had good times,'' Zengel said.
``That's 12 years. In my experience we've never had a stretch like
that. We are really sailing on uncharted waters now, so I don't
know what is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The good stretch is reflected in the kind of houses Zengel
builds, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that the average family house is now 29 percent
larger than houses built two decades ago, averaging 2,400 square
feet. The housing market has changed dramatically, too. The average
price for a new home has climbed from $115,000 to $127,000 in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s we were building basic shelter for families,''
Zengel said. ``When I started, you could drive down most streets
and see two, three, four, five kids in every yard. Now one of the
biggest areas is the move-up market, people whose average age is 50
or 60 who either have no kids or whose kids have left home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zengel said that while most of the houses he built in the 1950s
and '60s were well-constructed in the basics such as frame, heating
and electrical, they didn't have the luxury details that are almost
a requirement now _ things like cathedral ceilings over the family
room, large master bedrooms and baths with whirlpools, skylights
and elaborate decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people move up in the market, they have developed tastes
and demand for a lot of nice things,'' he said. ``There are a lot
more dollars out there now, but the market has also broadened quite
a bit. Profit margins are slimmer, which puts the burden on the
builder to find a way to survive with less.''
</P>
<P>
   Zengel said his company sells what it can build, not build as
many as it can sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We schedule to build only a certain amount and play it pretty
close to the vest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in construction, Zengel sometimes finds it difficult
to find skilled workers, noting that his younger brother, who is
68, can still be seen out driving a bulldozer. His two sons and
five nephews are also part of the business.

 &HT;    Booming '90s creating generation of optimists
 &HT;    (Embargoed until Sunday, July 12.)
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is not the Roaring Twenties, or the Fabulous
Fifties or even the Go-Go Sixties. The '90s have yet to get a name,
but for many of us _ perhaps even most of us _ it is a time of
unbridled optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The no-name '90s are not so much marked by downsizing, corporate
takeovers and plant shutdowns _ although there has been plenty of
that _ but by rampant consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Try an experiment. Look around your house and make a mental note
of all the stuff _ CDs, computers, cell phones, microwaves, video
games. We have exercise bikes that tell us how far we've gone,
calculate our calories and monitor our hearts. We have televisions
that bring movies and sports on demand through coaxial cable wired
directly to our homes, or through satellite dishes mounted on our
roofs. And we watch in perfect, air-conditioned comfort without
having to get out of our chairs to change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, consider this: Your parents, who wanted a better life for
you, never dreamed of any of this.
</P>
<P>
   This decade may end up outdoing all of the previous boom times
the country has seen. It's not that everybody is getting rich. In
the '90s a large and growing population was labeled with an
oxymoron: working poor. Wages and benefits are actually declining
for a fifth of the country's workers. There's a growing disparity
between rich and poor, with the latter nearly shut out of many of
the benefits and advantages prosperity offers.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called economic recovery has gone on so long even
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says there's
been nothing like it in 50 years. Low inflation. Low unemployment.
Low interest rates. A stock market that mirrors a climber on Mount
Everest, going up, coming down then finding ways to go higher
still.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News conducted a poll in five southeast Ohio
counties in an area of the country known not so affectionately as
the Rust Belt. Fifty-eight percent of the residents rated the local
economy as good or excellent, while just 10 percent said it was
below average or poor. But here's the real kicker: 72 percent said
they were optimistic over the next five years, an indication that
folks here believe the best days are ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And why not. Inflation, ranging between 1.5 and 2.5 percent in
this area, mirrors the rest of the nation. Mortgage interest rates,
around 7 percent or lower, have caused home sales to soar, an
increase of 9 percent overall and 45 percent in some areas.
Builders report an upsurge in people in their 60s and 70s moving up
to more luxurious homes.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Castro of Springboro, Ohio, is one of those who has
parlayed the '90s economy into ultra-success. An immigrant who was
born in Bogota, Colombia, Castro left the restaurant business to
enter real estate 10 years ago. Last year, he sold 80 properties
worth a total of $10 million. This year he expects to do even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to go into the business at the time I did,''
Castro said. ``I have experienced 10 years of growth. The economy
is good, but it is what you make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They are still small in numbers, but the '90s economy has
produced an entirely new social class: the 401(k) millionaire.
These are not people who inherited their fortune or got rich
through executive salaries. They invested wisely. And those
investments are booming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the first year the Internal Revenue Service began
collecting such data, 883 taxpayers reported $1 million or more in
Adjusted Gross Income. By 1994, the number had reached 69,935. Two
years later, as the stock market continued its miraculous soar, the
number was estimated at 111,728 _ a million-a-year club the size of
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity is not just measured in dollars and cents. While
comparisons to the booming '50s come to mind, today's society is in
many ways a more diverse and fair one than existed during the Cold
War and before the civil rights movement. Women and minorities
locked out of the job market in the '50s find fewer doors closed.
Quality of life is improving.
</P>
<P>
   But the '90s have also spawned an entire movement geared toward
simplification, as hectic lifestyles and crushing work schedules
take a toll on personal lives. All of which raises a question:
We're better off, but are we happier?
</P>
<P>
   The rising demand for health and social services also reveals a
mean undertow beneath the nation's wave of prosperity: the gap in
wages between skilled and unskilled workers continues to grow, and
so does the gap in their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's prosperity, it ain't trickling down my way,'' said
Chuck Linville, a 29-year-old Waynesville, Ohio, resident who
builds wooden playsets for a local business. Linville says his
family's living expenses have gone up in the last year, but not his
wages.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your father's prosperity, economists say. While real
wages doubled for American workers between the end of World War II
and 1973, gains since then have been smaller and less evenly
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the top tenth of employees earned an average of $24.80
an hour, or nearly four times the $6.28 an hour for workers in the
bottom tenth. By 1996, high-pay workers were averaging $25.74 an
hour, or nearly five times the $5.46 an hour of those at the
bottom. The figures are all in 1997 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the broad upward mobility trend we used to see in
the '40s, '50s and '60s, when everyone's wages were going up and
there was structural mobility across all classes of people,'' said
Steven Dandaneau, an assistant professor of sociology at the
University of Dayton and a member of the Dayton Poverty Reduction
Task Force. ``It's almost an exception to the rule today when
people at the bottom are upwardly mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Education still holds the key to higher earnings. Between 1980
and 1996, the earning power of workers with only a high school
diploma dropped by 6 percent, while those with college degrees saw
their salaries grow by 12 percent. But with skilled labor in demand
everywhere, trade schools and community colleges in many cases
offer a more direct path to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosperity has been the '90s calling card, not every
city has benefited. Many have watched as much of the private
investments and booming housing market takes place outside their
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as Seattle, Chattanooga and Portland have been at
the forefront of a concept with a clunky catch phrase:
sustainability.The idea is that communities that build on their
strengths and shore up their weaknesses are most likely to ride the
prosperity wave the longest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton formed the Council on Sustainable Development
in 1993 with the idea that communities have to look for ways to get
better, not just bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Like grandfather's advice, the founding principle of the council
is: ``Each generation is entitled to interest on the national
capital, but the principal should be handed down unimpaired to
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustainability could describe the economy as well, with
contributors such as Linda Baldwin of Kettering, Ohio, who has a
confidence that borders on boundless. Baldwin runs a financial
consultant business with her husband and sees no end in sight to
the growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to go on another 10 years,'' she said. ``Read the
book 'The Great Boom Ahead.' The baby boomers are all coming of
age. And they will be inheriting in the next eight to 10 years.
They will either save or pay off debt. Either one's good for the
economy.''

 &HT;    Bond returns to Atlanta for NAACP convention
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been nearly 12 years since Julian Bond left
Atlanta after losing a congressional race so many thought he should
have won. His departure to Washington, D.C., came after two decades
of visible, and sometimes controversial, public service as a state
senator, civil rights leader and Vietnam War protestor.
</P>
<P>
   This week he returns to his home in the nationally prominent
office as chairman of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, which is holding its annual convention here this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bond makes frequent trips to Atlanta to visit his
mother, five children and grandchildren, those visits are quiet and
family-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a kind of homecoming,'' Bond said of his six-day stay.
``I will see people I haven't seen for many years. ... There are
just many, many associations I have with a wide variety of people
there. I'm looking forward to seeing people from my time with the
(Atlanta) NAACP, the legislature, my movement friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, an NAACP member since his youth, discussed his plans for
the country's oldest civil rights organization and how it plans to
continue facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds Myrlie Evers-Williams, wife of slain civil rights
martyr Medgar Evers, who restored the organization's financial
stability during her tenure. Bond led the group that called for the
ouster Evers-Williams' predecessor, who was accused of padding his
expense account during the six years he served as NAACP chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your convention theme this year is ``Preparing Tomorrow's
Leaders Today. What is your plan for grooming the next generation
of NAACP leaders?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have, since our inception, had a vigorous and active youth
membership. We now have about 350 high school, college and youth
chapters, about 75,000 youth members. Seven of the members of my
board of directors are youth. Young people exercise leadership
roles throughout the NAACP and always have. So we are helping
prepare them by offering them leadership opportunities today. You
scratch a grey-haired, 60-year-old NAACP member and you're going to
find somebody who joined the NAACP when he or she was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do feel that there is still an activist spirit among young
African-Americans that you can build upon or must you create one?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that spirit is there, but I think it's a mistake to
compare today's youth generally, white or black, to '60s youth. If
you compare today's youth, black and white, with '60s youth, they
are going to be found wanting. But if you compare them with '50s or
'70s youth, I think you will find they are performing at the same
level or above. Now, it strikes me that the major difference
between modern day young people _ and here I'm speaking of black
and white and '60s young people _ is that today's young people seem
to me less eager to challenge authority. If you are collecting
blood for the Red Cross, they will be there. If you are building
houses for Habitat for Humanity, they will be there. If you are
collecting food or blankets or clothing for the homeless, they will
be there. But they don't often enough ask, `Why are these people
homeless? Why aren't there homes for people at the bottom of the
income scale? Why does private charity have to substitute for
public policy?' ... And we hope their NAACP experience leads them
to challenge authority.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We often hear about the NAACP in a reactive context after an
injustice has been committed or after a tragedy or that the
organization is battling or overcoming financial difficulty. Is
that the result of how the media cover the organization or has the
NAACP actually become reactive in its pursuits?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a combination of those two factors and something more.
First, we are going to react. No one predicted that James Byrd
would be dragged until his body parts fell off. But we had to react
to that. Nobody predicted there would be this spate of church
burnings throughout the South a few years ago. But we had to react
to that. We were in a reactive mode. We had to be. But
unfortunately, the basis of journalism is that something is wrong.
And that colors the kind of coverage that we get. We also know
reporters who cover this convention are going to run out in the
street outside the World Congress Center and find some teenage kid
who is bouncing a basketball and say, `What do you think about the
NAACP?' and the kid will say, ``NAACP? What's that?' And the story
will be written, `Black youth alienated from NAACP.' Then another
reporter will go to one of these receptions that one of these
corporations is throwing for us and they will talk about the shrimp
and the pork cutlets. And then they will run over to Techwood Homes
and they will say, `Did you know that the NAACP is up there eating
broiled shrimp?' And the poor person in Techwood Homes will say,
`Oh my God! That NAACP is awful! And that will be the story.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you plans for the NAACP as chairman? Is it new
thrusts or is it strengthening what's in place?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's strengthening what's in place. I like to say, 'We don't
need to do many new things. We need to do the old things better.'
What are the things that have brought us this far? They are
mobilization, organization, litigation, coalition. We need to do
the basics better.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said that the NAACP needs to continue the direct
action it engaged in three decades ago. Why is it you think
picketing and boycotting are still effective tools to advance
African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   A. They are always effective tools, not just for
African-Americans. They are effective tools for any group,
including many groups I despise. These are ordinary, American
pressure tactics that many, many groups have used in the past, many
will use in the future, and there's no reason for us to abandon
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is the NAACP faring financially and how do you plan to
keep in economically strong and independent - the emphasis being on
independent when a large number of your contributions come from
large, white-controlled corporations? How can you tackle problems
within those companies when they offer you support?
</P>
<P>
   A. The bulk of our money, I think it's 60 percent, comes from
our membership. But we don't apologize for taking money from
corporations. We think we're doing America's work. And we want all
Americans to support us, so we have no apologies for taking money
from people who want to help us do America's work. There have been
occasions when we have returned money. Some years ago when we were
in awful financial straits, the dictatorship of Nigeria gave us
$100,000. And we returned it because we thought it was dirty money,
and it was money we did not want even though we needed it. I cannot
remember an occasion in which a donor said, 'I'm going to give you
some money if you do this' or `I'm not going to give you any more
money unless you do this.' If someone said that to me, I would say,
`Fine. Keep your money. We don't need it.'
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the plan to get affluent African-Americans, more of
them, to become significant contributors?
</P>
<P>
   A. We're going to reach out to them as we have done in the past.
We're very pleased for example that Kobe Bryant (young Lakers
basketball player) is helping us in our stay-in-school program. And
he is an example we want to hold up to others like him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How have the challenges threatening African-American's
advancement changed, now that racism isn't as blatant with ``white
only'' signs? And how does the NAACP meet that challenge of helping
people overcome those obstacles when they aren't as obvious?
</P>
<P>
   A. The major difference between yesterday and today is that
there is a body of law which, on its face, restricts racial
discrimination. It doesn't always work, but the law is there. So we
are not going to see any signs anymore. As a consequence, it's
sometimes harder to fight discrimination because it isn't as always
as evident. If I get turned down for an apartment, is that because
I'm black or is it because the apartment is rented? It's more
difficult for me to know now. It's important for me to find out.
Because if it's because I'm black, I have a remedy. If it's because
it's already rented, I have to go find another apartment. There
have been very successful tests involving identically qualified
white and black testers in apartment rentals with the black people
being turned away and the white people coming along an hour later
and being given the apartment. There are ample ways to test, it's
just not as easy to see on the surface now as was true 30 or 40
years ago.

thunderstorms will contain hail and damaging winds, but the
greatest threat from the storms will be flooding from locally
torrential downpours.
</P>
<P>
   Another area prone to severe weather will be over the northern
Plains, where a line of potent thunderstorms will erupt ahead of an
approaching cold front. Winds changing direction and increasing
speed with altitude will induce a few of the storms to rotate.
These rotating storms, known as supercells, are capable of spawning
tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine and low humidity will grace much of the
Northeast and Great Lakes as high pressure from Canada drifts over
the region. After a cool start, temperatures will rise into the
lower 80s by afternoon. Farther south, intervals of clouds and
sunshine will cover the Southeast with spotty afternoon
thunderstorms forming in the sultry air. Meanwhile, broiling
sunshine will continue to bake Texas as temperatures soar past 100
degrees in many locations. In the West, sunny and seasonably hot
weather will affect interior California with patchy morning clouds
and cooler air expected along the coast. Elsewhere, limited
sunshine and cool conditions will embrace the Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Stormy Northwest
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of trees were knocked down in eastern Washington state
on Friday evening by powerful winds generated from potent
thunderstorms. Hail and flooding rain along with a few small
tornadoes accompanied this bout of severe weather across the
interior Northwest. While the coastal Northwest sees most of its
thunderstorms in the winter, inland areas notice many storms in the
summer when surface temperatures reach into the 90s. A surge of
chilly air from the Pacific was partly blocked by the Cascades,
allowing the colder air to move in over the hot ground and
triggering the strong storms.  &QL;

AS NUCLEAR PLANTS CLOSE, COMMUNITIES FACE NEW ERA
</HEADLINE>

   WISCASSET, Maine _ Things change when a place goes post-nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year ago, Maine Yankee, the state's only nuclear plant
and once New England's biggest electricity producer, stopped
generating power here for good, to the joy of nuclear opponents,
the regret of the townfolk who depended on its taxes and jobs, and
the pain of its hundreds of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old plant had long been one of the most divisive
issues in Maine and had survived three referendum votes on closing
it over the years. But ultimately, it was stopped not by politics
but by economics: Plagued by safety concerns and with electricity
deregulation coming on, it could no longer operate competitively,
its owners decided.
</P>
<P>
   That ending was also the beginning of a new phase, one that is
becoming ever more common in host towns around the country as aging
nuclear plants shut down and the nuclear industry withers.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions dissipate, these towns find, but new problems arise,
from economic woes to worry over nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Maine Yankee brought heartfelt relief to those
residents who had worried that the warning sirens would break the
coastal calm here with a nuclear alert.
</P>
<P>
   But the towns that are home to the country's remaining 107
nuclear plants might do well to note what Wiscasset and more than
20 other places where plants have been closed are finding out: all
is not resolved with the flick of a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the adjustment is economic. In Wiscasset, the
uncomfortable pinch of belt-tightening comes across even through
Maine stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is jumping out of windows,'' said Robert Blagden,
Wiscasset's first selectman, the closest thing the town has to a
mayor. ``It's not like a stock-market crash.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maine Yankee used to pay something like 96 percent of the
taxes for Wiscasset, a town of 3,500 on Route 1 that bills itself
as ``The Prettiest Little Village in Maine'' and may not be too far
off, with its fine old sea captains' houses and seaweed-podded old
pilings.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Blagden said, the plant will go from paying Wiscasset
nearly $13 million to about $6 million, and townspeople's taxes
will rise to make up much of the gap. Assessors are making their
ominous rounds these days, and property taxes are expected to
double if not triple.
</P>
<P>
   So great was the town's dependence on Maine Yankee's jobs,
purchases and taxes that Raymond Shadis, the plant's nemesis and
spokesman for the anti-nuclear ``Friends of the Coast-Opposing
Nuclear Pollution,'' bitingly calls Wiscasset a ``cargo cult,''
willing to worship the nuclear plant in exchange for its bounty.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty was plentiful. Wiscasset schools spent a luxurious
$12,000 per pupil, the town has a new multimillion-dollar community
center, it had free ambulance service and its roads have been
thoroughly rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like living in fairyland,'' said John Chester, a local
freelance writer who serves on a community panel advising Maine
Yankee on its shutdown. ``Everything you wanted, you got.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The most direct losses have fallen to the plant
employees themselves. Maine Yankee had 480 full-timers when it
closed. Their numbers have been reduced to 166 employees who are
maintaining the plant and preparing it for decommissioning, said
Maureen Brown, the plant's spokeswoman. About 100 of those who left
retired, she said over lunch at ``Fission Chips,'' the plant's
little restaurant. In general, she said, about 60 percent of those
who found new jobs have moved away.
</P>
<P>
   In what used to be Maine Yankee's information center _ and was
rapidly converted into its career center last August _ paper
balloons tacked to the wall list the names of former workers who
have had to go on to new lives, and most of them carry destinations
linked with other plants far away: Point Beach in Wisconsin,
Millstone in Connecticut, Vermont Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The plant held 78 job fairs and hundreds of counseling sessions,
Ms. Brown said, and in general is determined to make its
decommissioning a model for other plants, both technically and in
human terms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still workers like Jim Weast, a 27-year veteran of
the plant, an engineer, licensing expert and its former assistant
operations manager, who says he has found, ``No one wants to hire a
50-year-old.'' He has had a chance to work at the Millstone plant
in Connecticut, which was recently permitted to reopen after safety
concerns shut it for two years, but ``that would be out of the
frying pan into the fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear power is dead, has been dead for a long time, and the
public doesn't realize it,'' Weast said, sounding more sad than
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   For Wiscasset and the surrounding area, the economic losses
include not only jobs but the money that employees would have spent
locally, along with the occasional influx of hundreds of
contractors when the plant was preparing to restart, and its
purchases of incidentals like office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge ripple effect,'' said state Sen. Marge
Kilkelly, who heads the community panel on the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Though life styles must change, she said, that ripple will fade
eventually, and Wiscasset's nuclear era will pass quietly into
history just as its shipping heyday and railroad heyday passed:
``So be it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest Maine Yankee concern now is a problem that will
not pass so easily: the high-level radioactive waste that the plant
produced. It does not seem as if the federal government is going to
find a repository for it any time soon. At this point, plant
officials say, the government has promised to begin picking up
Maine Yankee's high-level waste a decade or two into the 21st
century, but many do not count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, despite the federal obligation to dispose of the
1,432 spent-fuel assemblies weighing more than 1,500 tons, it stays
here, where it is Maine Yankee's, and Wiscasset's, problem. Maine
Yankee is suing the government over the waste, but many here expect
the plant to become one of more than 100 unexpected waste dumps
around the country, wherever plants are.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hudson Jr., a member of the community panel and president
of the Chewonki Foundation, a major environmental education center
that with 150 workers may soon employ more people than nearby Maine
Yankee, predicts the waste will be here long, long after 2050. If
that is the case, he said, it is up to the plant and Wiscasset to
figure out how to store it safely for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drum I keep beating is, how are we going to come up with a
system of managing something for a minimum of 500 human
generations?'' Hudson asked. ``The pyramids are only 150 human
generations old, and we've got to make something to last at least
500.''
</P>
<P>
   Waste storage, however, is only one of the issues to arise in
the complex process of decommissioning. Shadis, a sculptor who is
probably Maine's best-known and most unrelenting opponent to
nuclear power, has raised handfuls of other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the possibility that ``hot'' waste had been
trucked to the town dump (none has been found) to questions about
whether the plant's eventual demolition would involve blowing up
concrete structures that could contain radioactivity ``and you
wouldn't know until you had a cloud of concrete dust sailing across
the river.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Shadis said, some of the fire has gone out of the fight,
and Maine Yankee has become more open than ever before, even
allowing him to read its file of ``Radiological Incident Reports''
of spills over the years. His side has lost ardor, as well, he
said: when the plant was closed and he sent out invitations to a
celebration, out of a mailing list of 7,000, only 200 or 250
responded.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, he said, as he pressed a point at a community
panel meeting, a top Maine Yankee official told him to let go,
adding, ``Ray, you've won.''

OLDER, CALMER CONNORS INDUCTED INTO TENNIS HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ He swaggered around the court as if he owned it,
and in a sense he did. He had more charisma than any contemporary,
and the crowds, especially at the U.S. Open, made him one of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   He was argumentative, sometimes for the fun of it rather than
for a real cause. That Prince Valiant haircut made him look
innocent, and he loved to chatter between points with spectators,
but he reamed out umpires like an early-day John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   But Jimmy Connors loved playing the game and passed along that
passion to adoring crowds. Today, his sport paid a formal thank-you
as James Scott Connors, now 45, was inducted into the International
Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In ceremonies at the pristine Newport Casino here, where the
first U.S. championship was played in 1881 and where 13 grass
courts are used for professional and amateur tournaments and even
by the public ($35 a person for 90 minutes), two people became the
169th and 170th members of the Hall of Fame. One was Connors. The
other was Herman David, the chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis
Club at Wimbledon (1959-74) and a pioneer of open tennis. David
died in 1974 at age 68.
</P>
<P>
   Connors flew here Saturday morning from Kansas City, where he
played Friday night in a World Team Tennis match. He was
accompanied by his wife, Patti; his son, Brett; his daughter,
Aubree, and his mother, Gloria. Gloria and her mother (Connors
called her Two-Mom) groomed the youngster from Belleville, Ill.,
into a fierce champion.
</P>
<P>
   Before he stopped playing against hot shots half his age,
Connors won 109 tournaments (Pete Sampras has won 55 and says
Connors' 109 is out of reach). Between 1974 and 1983, Connors won
eight Grand Slams: five U.S. Opens, two Wimbledons, one Australian.
</P>
<P>
   For five years (1974-78), he was ranked first in the world
computer ratings. (Only Sampras has matched that.) Connors spent 16
years (1973-88) in the top 10, more than anyone else. In 401
singles tournaments, he played 1,622 matches and won 1,337. His
career winning percentage of 82.4 is the best ever, the nearest
rivals being Bjorn Borg (81.4), Ivan Lendl (80.5), McEnroe (78.8)
and Sampras (78.7).
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as they are, the numbers do not reflect the energy
that Connors brought to the court.
</P>
<P>
   He would take the ball on the rise and powder it, harder in the
fifth set than in the first. He preferred playing on the baseline,
and woe to the overanxious net rusher who would quickly find
two-handed backhands whizzing by him. And woe to the big server who
would relax momentarily after a 120-mile-an-hour bomb and find
Connors' marvelous return of service rocketing past him.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was Connors more appreciated than at the U.S. Open. He
reached the semifinals 14 times, the final seven times. He started
playing in the Open when the tournament was held at the staid West
Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. In finals there, he
beat Ken Rosewall on grass in 1974 and Borg on clay in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   When the Open moved to Flushing Meadows, New York, more tickets
became available to the public, and Connors became the main
attraction. New Yorkers liked his independence and endless
challenges to authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers pushed me to my best,'' Connors has said. ``I left
my blood on that court, and people knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bud Collins, the tennis writer and broadcaster, put it, ``He
had an undying passion for tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the crowds were reluctant to let him go, he was
reluctant to abandon the highest level while he could still win. In
1991, he was ranked so low that he needed a wild-card entry to play
in the U.S. Open. He played so well that he reached the semifinals.
Finally, the frenzy ended and the 39-year-old returned to acting
his age.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as the Hall of Fame added to his fame, the once-young
rebel acted his age again. ``I'm very honored to go in with the
greats,'' he said. &QL;

ASSISTANT COACHES TEACH STUBBORN NCAA A COSTLY LESSON
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARCIA CHAMBERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vote at the National Collegiate Athletic Association's
convention in 1991 was overwhelming. In order to cut costs, the
NCAA had proposed severely limiting the salaries paid to certain
assistant basketball coaches. There was certainly no great debate.
And despite the presence of roughly 2,500 college administrators,
many of them lawyers, no one at the convention questioned its basic
legality.
</P>
<P>
   That moment seven years ago in the Opryland Hotel in Nashville,
Tenn., has come to haunt the NCAA, for it set in motion a series of
events that resulted in a roughly $80 million legal defeat, the
costliest such setback in the organization's history.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the decision to limit the salaries of certain
coaches, and the lawsuit by the coaches it provoked, reveals a
strikingly dubious series of decisions on the part of the country's
leading amateur sports organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Dennis Cross, a lead lawyer for the assistant coaches,
said of the verdict and its consequences, ``is a self-inflicted
wound. I am still amazed that the NCAA, through arrogance and
stubbornness, let it get this far.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA adopted the rule in 1991 _ the organization
believed it had the educational authority to regulate virtually all
aspects of intercollegiate athletics _ it never checked whether it
violated antitrust law. The NCAA and its lawyers later infuriated
the federal judge overseeing the subsequent lawsuit by discouraging
schools from turning over relevant financial information, an action
the judge termed ``malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the NCAA, despite numerous adverse rulings, never
seriously engaged in settlement talks until the eve of trial.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, which is appealing the federal jury's
multimillion-dollar damages verdict of last May, says it lacks
insurance to cover the damages and has only $10 million in reserve
to begin to pay the 1,900 assistant coaches in men's basketball,
baseball and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   To its critics, the NCAA's mishandling of the coaches' case
reflected some of the wider, longstanding flaws of the organization
_ institutional arrogance, questionable structuring of its legal
representation, anachronistic views of the college sports industry
_ and goes a long way toward explaining why it has suffered a
variety of defeats and come under additional assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the NCAA, after losing at every judicial level,
agreed to pay Jerry Tarkanian, the former basketball coach at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, $2.5 million to settle his suit
charging the organization with having unfairly interfered with his
pursuit of employment. The NCAA settled only after three mock
juries had found for Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the NCAA also signed an agreement with the U.S. Justice
Department to amend its rules for athletic eligibility after they
were found to violate the Americans With Disabilities Act. And
there is, too, an unresolved lawsuit in Philadelphia that charges
the NCAA with discriminating against minorities in its use of
standardized test scores in determining athletic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because of the increasingly commercial nature of
intercollegiate athletics it makes it more and more difficult for
us to make some of the arguments that have historically been
successful,'' said Jim Delany, commissioner of the Big 10
Conference, alluding to the NCAA's prior ability to contend that
the amateur status of college athletes enabled it to regulate
sports with little limitation.
</P>
<P>
   If the multimillion-dollar defeat suffered by the NCAA last
spring highlighted some of the organization's shortcomings, there
had already had been some signs the NCAA was realizing it had to
change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the NCAA has undergone a far-reaching
restructuring in governance, creating an executive committee of 20
members, primarily college and university presidents, to establish
budgets and set fundamental policies and strategies. Such a system
replaces the more unwieldy one that afforded all member schools a
vote on policy matters, and strengthens the authority of the most
powerful sports schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in a world of college sports beset with deep conflict
between education and commercialism _ the recently signed
eight-year television contract for college basketball's
championship tournament netted $1.7 billion _ the NCAA appears to
have its hands full as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a full-scale look at every rule,'' said NCAA
president Cedric Dempsey. ``We are willing to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the organization's first changes was to hire its own
in-house lawyer to manage its legal affairs, a practical move many
thought was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting our house in order,'' said Elsa Kircher Cole,
the NCAA's new general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the case brought by the assistant coaches shows how
costly it was for the NCAA not to have its house in order.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur Ideal vs. Big Business
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, formed in 1906, is technically a nonprofit, voluntary
organization, and its members are the colleges and universities who
agree to be governed by the NCAA for intercollegiate competitions.
Its constitution says its central aims are ``to maintain
intercollegiate athletics as an integral part of the education
program,'' and ``retain a clear line of demarcation between
intercollegiate athletics and professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the NCAA generates millions of dollars each year as
income and a significant portion of that money is distributed back
to the schools. An $80 million defeat represents more than 50
percent of the 1996-97 payout of $145 million to Division 1
schools. Thus, over the years, the NCAA's original purpose _
amateur competition _ and its recent huge commercialism have
competed awkwardly with each other.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the idea of balancing fair amateur college
sports competition and the reality of school sports as big business
was at the root of the decision to limit the salaries of certain
assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The restricted earnings coaches' case began in 1989, when the
NCAA created a Cost Reduction Committee. Although the NCAA found
itself with vastly increased revenues, many schools were expanding
their programs and recruiting high quality head and assistant
coaches. Costs for some schools were therefor problematic, and in
an effort to curtail overall expenses, the NCAA proposed allowing
schools to limit the salary for a third men's or women's basketball
coach to $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rule later was applied to assistant coaches in other sports,
as well, except Division I-A football.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to have what amounted to entry-level coaches _ had
they simply been called internships some of the legal problems
might not have come up, Dempsey believes _ and the rule was passed
overwhelmingly at the NCAA convention in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing was that at the time when that was passed in
1991, we were in a full town hall kind of meeting _ some 2,500
people and many were lawyers,'' Dempsey said of the rule. ``And no
one ever raised a question that this was a potential violation of
antitrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said no NCAA administrators ever checked either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found no indication that there was either legal advice
sought or given,'' Cole said. She said lawyers regularly retained
by the NCAA ``did not automatically review everything that went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant coaches who would later join the suit, some of
whom had been earning up to $70,000 annually, tried to get the rule
reversed but failed. A year later, the NCAA, acting to close a
loophole that had allowed some wealthy schools to pad the salaries
of the assistant coaches with lucrative summer work, ruled that the
coaches could earn no more than $4,000 per summer.
</P>
<P>
   Move to Dismiss The Case Backfires  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1992, a group of the restricted earnings assistant
coaches consulted lawyers. They wrote to Dempsey's predecessor,
Dick Schultz, in March, saying they were ready to file an antitrust
action, but would not if the rule were rescinded. Schultz responded
by noting that the NCAA ``has never been unduly swayed by the
threat of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1993, the basketball coaches filed an antitrust
lawsuit against the NCAA. Jack Kitchin of Kansas City, Mo., the
NCAA's longtime outside counsel, responded by filing a motion for
summary judgment to dismiss the case, seeking a quick, binding
ruling based on the law alone, without any factual inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The move backfired when, on May 24, 1995, U.S. District Court
Judge Kathryn Vratil, sitting in Kansas City, Kan., rejected the
NCAA's bid to dismiss the case. In fact, she went further and in
ruling for the coaches, concluded that the restricted coaches' rule
was in fact a restraint of trade that had artificially and
illegally affected the marketplace for the coaches. The assistant
coaches had won a major legal victory. With no factual issues in
dispute, the only thing left was to decide the extent of the NCAA's
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, the current general counsel, concedes now that the NCAA's
outside lawyers working on the case were allowed to make far too
many independent decisions, a problem she said resulted from the
fact that the NCAA was a ``fairly amorphous client.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kitchin nor William Barnard, the lawyer who handled a
subsequent appeal in the case, responded to requests for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 ruling, the NCAA immediately sent a memo to all
of its athletic directors. It said that the part of the rule
dealing with limited salaries would be lifted, but that all other
parts of the rule, including, for example, limiting the coaches to
five years of service at a school, would remain in effect. The memo
said that if the judge's order was overturned, the committee might
well recommend that the membership again adopt the salary
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the NCAA, after losing the summary judgment motion,
never moved to settle. Instead, it appealed the case to the 10th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attorneys kept saying they would prevail,'' Dempsey said.
``We had Kitchin come in on several occasions and talk to our
boards about where we were. He felt all along that we had good
percentages of being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen persuaded the NCAA to hire a law firm with antitrust
expertise, Sommer &AMP; Barnard of Indianapolis, for its appeal.
Barnard thus became the NCAA's new lead counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's legal reasoning in the case thus far was that the
organization had the right to limit the number of coaches its
member institutions could employ as a way of keeping a level
playing field for all schools, regardless of wealth. Both Kitchin
and Barnard relied heavily on a 1977 case, ``Hennessey vs. NCAA,''
which upheld an NCAA bylaw adopted in 1976 to limit the number of
Division I football and basketball coaches in order to preserve
amateurism.
</P>
<P>
   But the force of the 1977 case had long been open to question.
In 1984, for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling
against the NCAA involving the televising of college football
games, held that the NCAA was not exempt from antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The case then moved into its most contentious stage.

   More Coaches Join Suit; Countless Delays Begin
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Vratil issued a permanent injunction barring the NCAA
from using the coaches' rule under any other name, and the judge
certified the case as a class action. Soon a total of 1,900
basketball, baseball and other coaches affected in some way by the
rule joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cross said he ran into countless delays in getting salary
and other financial information from the NCAA, and he later learned
that Dempsey, the NCAA chief executive, had sent a letter to more
than 300 presidents of Division I universities and colleges. The
February 1996 letter, which was drafted by Barnard, the lawyer,
sought financial information to aid the plaintiffs in the
calculation of damages against the NCAA
</P>
<P>
   But the letter noted that schools could avoid providing that
information and challenge the coaches' lawyers to subpoena them
individually. The impact of the letter on the plaintiffs and the
judge was immediate. Cross quickly moved for public sanctions
against the NCAA lawyers, saying they had deliberately flouted the
discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, after indicating that she had considered
disqualifying the NCAA's lawyers, eventually held that Dempsey's
memo was ``palpably and authoritatively intended to discourage
responses.''
</P>
<P>
   She termed the NCAA's behavior ``contemptuous, malicious and
calculated to severely delay and frustrate the discovery process.''
She then ordered the organization to pay the costs for the coaches'
lawyers to travel to all the schools and depose all of their
officials. She also publicly sanctioned its lawyers, Kitchin and
Barnard and their associates, although part of the sanction was
thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, lawyers at individual schools, coming to understand
the depth of their legal problems, expressed concern that the
NCAA's lawyers were out of control. ``He appeared not to take the
lawsuit as seriously as was warranted,'' Pamela Bernard, general
counsel for the University of Florida, said of Barnard.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for some schools soon urged their presidents and others
in positions of influence to pressure the NCAA to hire an in-house
lawyer to take charge of the organization's legal affairs. Seven
months later, in the spring of 1997, Cole became the NCAA's first
in-house counsel, although she did not replace the lawyers working
on the coaches' case at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, as the damage portion of the case neared,
Vratil pressed everyone to settle. Barnard was unmoved. ``With all
due respect your honor, I mean, I can be ordered and will
participate in anything I am ordered to do, but I can't be ordered
to settle a case,'' he said. He said he was still waiting for a
decision on the organization's appeal of the judge's initial ruling
that the coaches' rule violated antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Appeals Court upheld Vratil. Now, Cole removed
Barnard and replaced him with Alan Salpeter and Gregory Curtner.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation Comes Late, But to No Avail  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late March, on the eve of jury selection, the NCAA for the
first time agreed to mediation. Former Federal Judge Arlin Adams
was named mediator. Both sides were far apart at the outset and at
the end. The last actual offer made was $8 million from the NCAA
and $48 million from the plaintiffs. Just before the trial, Adams
told the plaintiffs he could get the NCAA up to $18 million and the
plaintiffs told him they would agree to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the last we heard,'' Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   The damage trial lasted one month. The jury, finding that
schools had kept some part of the earnings limitations in force
even after the judge in 1995 found it in violation of the law,
totaled the damages at $22.3 million _ not so much more than the
NCAA's last settlement offer of $18 million. But because the NCAA
did not settle, went to trial and got an adverse judgment, the
$22.3 million was tripled to $67 million in accordance with
antitrust law. With legal costs, interest and other fees, the
NCAA's bill stands to be roughly $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrongest part of the court's thinking is that the
conspiracy continued even after we lifted the rule in 1995,'' said
Dempsey, whose lawyers have appealed the damage award citing the
judge's bias against the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Other school officials are more critical of the way the case was
handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, oversight of the management process is, I think,
legitimately open for question,'' said Andrew Geiger, athletic
director at Ohio State University. ``This is fair game. There is no
guarding against bad decisions or a well-meaning effort which turns
out to be untenable. Then you get out. Get out of the deal before
you get hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   The full fallout of the legal hammering remains unclear. NCAA
officials have informed the 306 Division I universities and
colleges, including the major collegiate sports powers, that they
would assume the greatest part of the legal bill if the case is not
overturned on appeal. But despite the NCAA's assertion that the
verdict could have serious consequences for individual athletic
programs and sports around the country, they may have a way of
softening the impact.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA could borrow some portion of the $80 million and spread
out the payments. It could take funds from their own revenues that
would usually go to schools. Or they can do a combination of the
two. Depending on how many schools absorb the liability, individual
institutions, primarily in Division I, could be facing costs of
anywhere from $72,000 to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   However the financial ramifications play out, Dempsey, the NCAA
president, said he regarded the coaches' case as a watershed
experience for the organization, forcing it to find another way of
doing business. Others agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the silver lining in the whole thing,'' said Delany,
the Big 10 commissioner, ``is that it refocuses our attention on
regulating in areas that are defensible and getting out of areas
that are less defensible.'' &QL;

LOBBYING BLITZ PRESERVES LUCRATIVE CORPORATE TAX BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Texas)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lobbying blitz by some of the biggest names in corporate
America has succeeded in maintaining a lucrative tax break for
multinational corporations _ one that allows them to avoid U.S.
taxes and reduce their foreign tax bill, too.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of their lobbying success is contained in the fine
print of a House-Senate conference report on the bill to overhaul
the IRS, which Congress approved on Thursday and President Clinton
is expected to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the Treasury Department began soon after it
tried in January to stop the fast-growing tax-avoidance maneuver
involving ``hybrid structures,'' entities permitted by a loophole
created two years ago when the Clinton administration implemented
measures to simplify taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The loophole, which the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates
will cost $800 million in federal revenue over five years and up to
$1.8 billion over 10 years, allows American multinational companies
to use foreign tax havens to reduce their U.S. and foreign taxes on
profits from overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department's effort to rein in use of the loophole
set off an intense lobbying campaign by some of the nation's
biggest accounting firms, which had been aggressively marketing
hybrid structures, and by a host of corporate giants, including
Philip Morris, General Motors, Microsoft, Merrill Lynch, Xerox,
Exxon, Hallmark Cards and the bottling arm of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   First, the lobbyists got all Republican and nine Democratic
members of congressional tax-writing committees to send angry
letters to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin complaining that he was
stepping on Congress' turf and asking him to back down. Initially,
Rubin refused.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning up the heat, Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, inserted an amendment
into the IRS bill putting a six-month moratorium on the Treasury
Department's enforcement of a regulation closing the loophole and
shifting to Congress future control of policy on hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, after several months of negotiations up
and down Pennsylvania Avenue, Roth agreed to drop his amendment in
return for an agreement by the Treasury Department to allow
multinational companies that already use the loophole to continue
to do so _ permanently. The Treasury Department also agreed to
allow some limited new hybrid structures to be set up for the next
six years and promised not to revisit this issue for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure signaled that Congress can't stand up to
industry,'' said Michael McIntyre, a tax law professor at Wayne
State University in Detroit who has written extensively about this
tax loophole. ``This is one of the biggest tax giveaways. It's
outrageous, and as tax policy, it is indefensible. This is so far
beyond the pale of what is considered legitimate tax avoidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Business succeeded through a winning combination of
arm-twisting, letter-writing and hiring some of the best
tax-lobbying talent in Washington, including many who helped create
the tax law. Eleven business coalitions were formed to lobby the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The loophole allows American companies to set up offshore
``hybrid'' tax arrangements that, through complicated swaps, let
companies escape U.S. taxes on overseas profits and turn those
profits into deductions to reduce their foreign tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which is legal, permits a multinational
corporation to set up a holding company in a tax haven like the
Cayman Islands or Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   By swapping profits from an overseas operation, say a big
American company's Brazilian subsidiary, for a loan from the
company's Cayman operation, the following happens: The American
company's Brazilian operation, and its profits, disappear for U.S.
tax purposes, and the company now has a huge, and deductible, loan
payment in Brazil to cut its foreign taxes. These continuous swaps
take place entirely outside the company's U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
   Major accounting firms have been actively marketing hybrid
structures over the last few years to businesses eager to cut their
tax bill. Accounting firms that lobbied to keep the arrangement
were Ernst &AMP; Young, Deloitte &AMP; Touche and Price Waterhouse. Kenneth
Kies headed the Price Waterhouse effort. Until late last year, he
was the chief of staff on the Joint Committee on Taxation, and he
is a close confidant of the committee's two chairmen, Roth and Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everyone in the business community cares about
this,'' said Daniel Berman, a Washington lobbyist representing a
coalition of American companies. Berman left the Treasury
Department, where he was a top international tax lawyer, in
September and is well known among congressional tax writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All multinational companies care about this, and nearly
everyone is a multinational these days,'' Berman said. ``I spent a
lot of time explaining to people about this in person and in
writing, and I sent a lot of faxes all over the place. Of course,
we spent some time drafting potential solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials would not comment. But the department's
effort to close the loophole with a regulation known as Notice
98-11 was intended to stop American companies from shifting more
and more of their operations overseas to take advantage of the
loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a short, concentrated blitz,'' said Jennifer Shecter,
a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington
nonprofit organization. ``Within moments of Treasury issuing that
notice, corporate mobilization took place. Various companies hired
the guys who used to write the rules to call up their friends in
Congress. They hired the best of the best and they got a
significant government agency to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole issue may be revisited again in 2000, when the
Treasury Department will try to close the loophole again, it has
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending hybrid structures was averted temporarily,'' said
Berman, the corporate lobbyist. ``Treasury is still proposing to
finalize its regulations by the year 2000, and I expect there will
be a lot of congressional dialogue before that happens to stop it
from happening.''

<P>
   BEMIDJI, Minn. _ On the shore of Lake Bemidji, little more than
a long cast from the 18-foot-tall statue of Paul Bunyan, the mythic
logger claimed by several northern Minnesota towns, a line of 15
pontoon boats sat beached in the sand one recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 50 yards away, the commander of this unusual flotilla,
Jimmy George of Bemidji, issued instructions to the people who
stood ready to carry out the mission: taking 75 people with
disabilities fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In this town of about 11,000, where for many people fishing is
an activity only slightly less essential than breathing, George and
a small navy of volunteers for Fishing Has No Boundaries were
helping people who are rarely able to board a boat spend a weekend
in search of the elusive northern and walleye, and the
not-quite-so-elusive perch.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing Has No Boundaries, a nonprofit organization, was founded
in 1986 in Hayward, Wis., and held its first event there in 1988.
The idea for the organization _ to take people with disabilities
fishing _ was born after a fishing guide, Bobby Cammack, broke his
arm and discovered how difficult a disability could be for a
fisherman, said Tom Mansfield, the national vice president of
operations. Events are now held in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Bemidji, which bills itself as
the first city on the Mississippi River, first played host to an
event in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The type of disability a fisherman has _ physical or mental _
makes no difference, George said. Everyone is welcome, including
people who use wheelchairs or crutches, those who are mentally
retarded and the elderly whose infirmities have developed over
time. If necessary, special gear is provided, he said, noting that
one year a boy with no arms or legs was able to catch a fish with
an electric rod and reel operated by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was of little consequence to the people who had come
to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to catch fish,'' said Carl Halvarson, 88, who has
impaired vision. Halvarson's fishing buddy, 81-year-old Hugh Veit,
described his disabilities, ``just for starters,'' as a bad back
and a bad leg.
</P>
<P>
   George, who has been chairman of the Bemidji event since its
inception, continued with his instructions to the volunteer guides.
``If the weather gets bad, we'll know that ahead of time and we'll
call you in,'' he said. He explained that emergency medical workers
would be standing by on the shore and in boats.
</P>
<P>
   Any boat that found a hot fishing spot on Lake Bemidji, or the
Mississippi River (which runs through the lake), or upriver on Lake
Irving or Carr Lake, or downriver on Stump Lake was encouraged to
radio in and let others know.
</P>
<P>
   As each boat was boarded, a picture was taken and volunteers
shoved the pontoons out. Two boats had momentary engine trouble,
but volunteers, some with shoes still on, waded into the cold water
and pushed the boats back to shore for some quick adjustments. By
10 a.m. all the boats were on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Connie and Bill Kelm, who raise cattle just outside Bemidji,
were host to two mentally disabled women who brought their own
fishing equipment and beamed as the boat headed to a spot that had
been lucky for them before: Stump Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The women, Gail Platt and Suzie Takle, both 30, have fished
since childhood and decided to participate in the Bemidji event
instead of the Special Olympics in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kelm asked: ``Gail, is your rod ready to fish? What kind of
bait do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Takle nudged her friend and said, ``She's willing to put
bait on it for you,'' incredulous at her host's willingness to
handle slimy worms and minnows.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kelm quickly added, ``I don't do leeches.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a night crawler was just the thing to bring
Ms. Platt the first strike, a perch. ``Is he a keeper?'' Ms. Takle
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Platt answered by nonchalantly flipping the fish back into
the water.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the morning's catch was salad bar, as the group
called it, or weeds.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, instead of going back to shore with the rest of the
boats for a lunch of sloppy joes, the Kelms' party ate sandwiches
and fished on. With little to show from Stump Lake, they motored
over to Lake Bemidji. By 5 p.m. they were catching perch one after
the other off night crawlers and leeches, which Kelm had no problem
putting on the hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Faces painted red by the sun, the crew headed back to shore with
several nice-size perch and memories of dozens returned to the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers measured, weighed and cleaned the fish. The catch of
the day was a 24-inch walleye, caught by Julie Scherrer, 39. The
fish story of the day belonged to Derek McArthur, 22, who was
bitten on the finger by a northern as he helped Dennis Bachand, 40,
net the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Over a dinner of walleye, fry bread and wild rice, George told
the group, ``Well, hope for better weather tomorrow and better
fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   But one first-timer who was completely satisfied with the few
perch he pulled in was Don Matthews, George's half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the best time,'' said Matthews, who was paralyzed in a
car accident two and a half years ago and had not been in a boat
since. ``If I'm on the water, I love it.''  &QL;

IMF DOUBLES EXTENT OF LOAN IT OFFERS RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES throughout with World Bank deal completed, details on IMF
loan. No pickup).

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The international effort to calm Russia's shaky
financial markets began to fall into place Saturday, as negotiators
sought to complete talks on more than $12 billion in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund has informed Russian officials
that it is now prepared to lend about $11 billion, Russian
officials said. About half the sum would be provided up front and
the rest would be disbursed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials initially discussed $5.6 billion in new loans. But
the fund increased its financing package under pressure from the
U.S. Treasury Department and Western investors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and IMF officials said they hoped to complete their
talks before the financial markets open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In parallel talks, the World Bank and Russian officials hammered
out an agreement Saturday on a new loan that will range between $1
billion and $1.5 billion, Russian and Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord requires the Russians to take steps to
introduce more competition in Russia's gas and electrical sectors,
which have been dominated by powerful monopolies. It also lays the
groundwork for reform of Russia's railways and and encourages more
privatization of state-owned enterprises, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the urgency of Russia's financial crisis, Michael
Carter, the head of the World Bank office here, completed talks
with Sergei Vasiliev, his Russian counterpart, at 1 a.m. Saturday.
The accord was then e-mailed to Washington at 4 a.m. for formal
approval by the World Bank's management.
</P>
<P>
   The intensive round-the-clock negotiations have taken place
against a background of deep concern over Russia's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety over rising interest rates, the backlog of unpaid wages
and shrinking Central Bank reserves has become so great that it has
begun to rattle the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin has gone so far as to issue public
warnings against coup attempts, asserting that he commands enough
loyalty from the military to put down any ``extremist'' challenges
to his power.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the deteriorating Russian economy, the Clinton
administration has prodded the IMF to increase the size of its
loan, to keep its demand on Russians realistic and to bring the
negotiations to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's main fear is that a devaluation of the ruble would
unleash a fresh round of inflation, undercut Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and his team of reformers and destabilize Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But to negotiate agreements with international financial
institutions is just part of the problem the Kremlin has been
facing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsin government must still win approval of its
deficit-cutting and tax-reform measures from the
Communist-dominated Parliament. It is also trying to negotiate $10
billion in loans from Western commercial banks, in hopes of
bringing the total financial package to more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin met Saturday at his dacha with top aides to discuss
political and economic strategy. The aides at the session included
Kiriyenko; Sergei Dubinin, the chairman of the Central Bank;
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov; and Anatoly Chubais, the lead
negotiator with the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president on the whole approved the progress of the talks
and instructed a completion of the talks in a compressed period,''
the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus Saturday was on the talks with the IMF. The lead
IMF negotiator, John Odling-Smee, arrived in Moscow on Friday
evening, and appears to have been locked in intensive negotiations
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and IMF officials are near to settling a paramount
question of how much and how quickly to cut the federal deficit.
They have been trying to resolve differences over amendments that
the fund insists be attached to the tax code that the Yeltsin
government has submitted to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's financial crisis began to deepen in May,
Odling-Smee was openly skeptical of the need for more assistance.
And he was described by one person in the talks as negotiating
``efficiently but without much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord concluded Saturday seeks to advance market
reforms in several respects. But it would not require the breakup
of Gazprom, the giant natural gas monopoly and one of the last
symbols of Soviet power. Suggestions that Gazprom be broken up to
foster competition have been denounced by the Communists as a
Western plot to destroy what remains of Russian industry.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank accord would, however, change the tax system to
make it easier for other gas producers to enter the market. It also
stipulates that other producers should have access to Gazprom's
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   To make the company's finances more transparent, financial
accounting of Gazprom's gas production operation are to be
separated from the accounting for its pipeline operations. The
World Bank accord also aims to open Russia's electrical sector to
private investment.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage more privatization generally, the accord would
reduce the number of so-called strategic state enterprises that
cannot be sold off.
</P>
<P>
   Another aim of the accord is to encourage more efficient and
competitive rail transport. Freight traffic has subsidized
passenger transportation, and this burden has pinched the
industrial sector, which is already ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these reforms will take months, if not years, to fully
carry out. Achieving them will be the litmus test for the young
Kiriyenko team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been given a chance,'' one Western
specialist said. ``But now it has to make a sustained effort. The
key thing is to make this work.'' &QL;

VOTE PLACES HABIBIE IN FIRM CONTROL OF INDONESIAN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Subs to alter 4th graf and add new 6th graf on Suharto
children being dropped from party leadership. No other changes.)  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie,
consolidated his hold over the country's politics on Saturday when
one of his close advisers won a hotly contested vote to lead the
country's dominant political party.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first electoral test for the man who was almost
nobody's choice to succeed President Suharto six weeks ago, and who
many people believed would hold office only fleetingly.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's control over the party greatly improves his ability to
set the political agenda and remain in office at least until the
end of next year, when he has scheduled a parliamentary vote for a
new president.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's candidate, Akbar Tanjung, who is his executive
secretary, defeated Edy Sudrajat, a former armed forces chief, who
according to some political analysts had the behind-the-scenes
support of Suharto. Suharto, who stepped down in May in the face of
widespread protests, is moving on several fronts to try to protect
his family's wealth and business interests, Indonesian officials
say. He has used the governing party, Golkar, as a vehicle to wield
his personal power since it was formed in 1964. Akbar vowed to
change things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise to improve and reform Golkar and rid it of nepotism,
corruption and collusion,'' Akbar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate sign of change on Saturday, a son and daughter
of Suharto lost their posts in the party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for Akbar among regional party delegates, at the end of
a three-day conference, was 17-10. It was the first time in three
decades that the party leadership had been decided by a vote,
rather than by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success on Saturday, Habibie has not yet won broad
backing within the political establishment and his continued tenure
is a source of discontent among many Indonesians who had hoped for
a clean break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what steps he has taken, many Indonesians just do not
think he is credible as a president. An aeronautical engineer who
served as Suharto's minister of research and technology, Habibie
was perceived by many people as a political lightweight. As
Suharto's longtime friend and hand-picked vice president, he is
seen by many as too closely associated with the 32-year rule of his
predecessor to be the standard bearer for reform.
</P>
<P>
   According to his own account, Habibie was as surprised as
anybody when Suharto resigned suddenly on May 21, leaving the
leadership of the world's fourth-most-populous country in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still in survivability mode,'' said Marzuki Darusman, a
leading human rights lawyer. ``Let's not talk about credibility
yet. We still have some way to go until we reach that point. But at
some point people will realize, `He's still here,' and that will
make him a bit more credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has been doing more than surviving. From his first day
in office he has set an energetic pace and a populist tone that are
in sharp contrast with the style and substance of Suharto. He has
amazed people with his enthusiastic public style of leadership,
visiting marketplaces, touring riot-damaged neighborhoods and
holding long news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto just listened,'' said Donald Emmerson, an expert on
Indonesia who teaches political science at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. ``You never quite knew what was going on in
his mind. Habibie just talks and talks and talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has freed some political prisoners and promised to free
more and he has opened a dialogue over the future of the disputed
territory of East Timor. He has reached out to the Chinese minority
that was victimized during rioting in May and he has made a show of
consulting with his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that he is sincere in trying to get as
much done as possible during his transition period,'' Marzuki said.
``He is in a very real way trying to pull himself away from his
original circle and reaching out to the public. So somewhere people
will just have to meet him halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie also benefits from the disarray of his many opponents,
who are reveling in the country's new political openness and are
pursuing a range of different agendas. In a country that for three
decades permitted only three political parties, more than 30 new
parties have registered in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie has without a doubt surprised his critics,'' said
Emmerson. ``The expectations that many observers had of him were
low. The expectations were that he would be a disaster, so from
that perspective he looks relatively good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Habibie's hold on office remains tenuous. He has
virtually no independent political base and he faces an economic
disaster that has only grown worse since it contributed to the fall
of his predecessor. According to private estimates, inflation this
year could approach or surpass 100 percent and unemployment could
reach 20 percent. Close to half the population of 210 million is
predicted to fall below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which grew by nearly 8 percent a year over the last
decade, could contract by 10 percent to 15 percent this year,
according to the International Monetary Fund. And in what has
become the most symbolic indicator for Indonesian well-being, the
currency, the rupiah, has fallen to about 15,000 to the dollar,
from about 8,000 when Habibie took office. The declining value of
the currency is one of the most damaging signals for Habibie's
prospects and could ultimately be more significant than his
political victory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Indonesia is that we don't have confidence
because there is a debate over the legitimacy of the government,''
said Laksamana Sukardi, a leading economist. ``We might like to
give Habibie the benefit of the doubt, but he is not getting it
from the markets. The markets are the main constituent of the
Indonesian economy, and they still say Indonesia is not the place
to invest. They are waiting for the bottom. Where is the bottom?
Are we going to be like Somalia or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's economic team and international donors are now
concentrating on emergency measures in the face of looming food
shortages. Habibie drew gasps from economists last week when he
suggested that Indonesians fast two times a week _ as he does for
health and religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's desperation, when you're telling people to fast,''
Emmerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their calls for an early transition of power, Habibie's
opponents have offered few specific proposals for a mechanism for
change. When Suharto resigned, he left his ruling structure, and
its personnel, intact. The country faces a problem in which the
incumbent leadership must legislate its own replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's plan is to draw up new electoral laws that would allow
more parties and revise the current system of representation, which
is geared to perpetuating Suharto's power. By December, he says, he
intends to convene a special legislative assembly to set a date for
elections, in May or June next year, moving up the date that is
currently set for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In January, new electoral laws would be enacted and preparations
would begin for the spring vote. That vote would choose an
electoral assembly, which would meet before the end of the year to
choose the next president. Habibie has not ruled out running for a
new term. &QL;

NEW, RELAXED PARCELLS IS STILL RARING TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Jets coach Bill Parcells' cardiologist was on the
sideline watching practice during the recent minicamp for rookies.
But Parcells, a man who has undergone several heart procedures, was
not discussing his various surgeries with Dr. Michael
Kesselbrenner. Instead, the 56-year-old Parcells was captivated by
Kesselbrenner's 12-year-old son, Joey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's hitting .625 in the Fair Lawn Little League,''
Parcells said with admiration. ``When I was playing in Hasbrouck
Heights, I only hit .611.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite football time yet, but Parcells seems as if he is
in the sweet spring of his coaching career. Asked whether he felt
pressure to do even better than last season, when he helped
engineer one of the great football turnarounds _ the Jets rebounded
to 9-7 following a franchise-worst 1-15 _ he replied simply: ``I do
feel challenged. I don't feel pressure. I think the word is
anticipating, not pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parcells that players see these days is someone who doesn't
work late into the night, as he did in his New York Giants days. He
tries to get to bed by 10 p.m. Once upon a time, that's when his
meetings with the coaches began. ``I won't watch films late at
night anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And every morning he is on the treadmill. Sometimes he's there
at 7 a.m., sometimes before noon. But always there is 1950s music
blaring _ Dion and the Belmonts, or Little Anthony and the
Imperials.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has learned to relax. He is spending these last days
before training camp at his ocean-view mansion in Sea Girt, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   When camp begins, it will be tough, as usual. That has not
changed. He concedes it is probably more physical and demanding
than most other coaches'.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives him so hard, now? Why is he itching to fight the
fight, when three years ago he told New England Patriots owner
Robert Kraft that he was so concerned about his health that he
wanted to cut a year off his contract?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell my guys, and I've always heard it,'' he said in
an attempt at an answer, `` `When the other team comes out of the
huddle and you don't want to hit them again, give up the game.'''
</P>
<P>
   He has tempered that aggression, though, with the realization
that he must take care of himself. So he has left Mike Tannenbaum,
his contract-signer, back in the Jets' complex at Hofstra
University, to work on the draft picks. He told his coaches to take
off. Bill Belichick, his alter ego, is headed for a villa near
Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells says he has so many more things in place this year
compared with last, when he charged in on his white horse and had
to bend an entire franchise to his will.
</P>
<P>
   The Parcells the rookies saw every day last week was the
springtime Parcells, though. Thus, Scott Frost, the subject of the
great experiment (can a quarterback for co-national champion
Nebraska be turned into a strong safety?), heard only a mild rebuke
when he was injured early in minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Frost turned his ankle. As he was getting it taped, Parcells
chided him: ``Frost, that's what I get for drafting a quarterback
and trying to make him a safety. He gets himself hurt the third day
of practice. Without pads on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week, the meaning will be the same for
Frost, but the words may come in a summer fury.

TWO TRIALS BRUSH UP AGAINST EACH OTHER IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day last week, about 20 Orthodox Jews, about half
of them ultra-Orthodox Hasidim, stood in a hallway in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn and, with ritualistic nods and sways and a
collective hum as they murmured their prayer, conducted an
afternoon service. Later, some of them drifted into a nearby
courtroom and stared at the two men on trial there, one of whom
stared back at them.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar and Lafi Khalil, are
Palestinian immigrants charged with conspiring to explode a
powerful pipe bomb in the subway in what prosecutors call a planned
act of international terrorism. The prosecution contends that the
men were motivated by a hatred of Israel and opposition to the
Middle East peace process. A witness has testified that Abu Maizar
told him he wanted to ``burn'' Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orthodox and Hasidic visitors to the courtroom had not
come to the downtown Brooklyn courthouse to watch the Palestinians'
trial. Rather, they were whiling away time as they waited for a
verdict in a trial in a nearby courtroom, where the defendants were
two Orthodox Jews: State Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn and
Rabbi Elimelech Naiman, who is Hasidic.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind is charged with receiving illegal payoffs from a
government-financed social services group in his Borough Park
district, and Naiman, a former official of the group _ the Council
of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park _ is accused of making many
of those payments.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have insisted that they did nothing illegal. On Friday,
after failing to reach a verdict in five days of deliberations, the
jury recessed for the weekend and is scheduled to resume its work
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it ironic?'' Hikind said of the proximity of the two
trials, after he and the relatives, friends and associates on hand
to show support for him and Naiman had finished their
court-corridor prayers _ their ``mincha, the afternoon service,''
as Hikind explained.
</P>
<P>
   The irony he found lay in the fact that, as a vocal supporter of
Israel and of Jewish interests generally, Hikind was among the
public officials who in the early 1990s had been targeted for
assassination by other immigrants from the Middle East _ a group
convicted three years ago of plotting bombings and other terrorist
acts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While Hikind, whose trial began nearly two months ago, has not
ventured into the nearby courtroom to catch some of the bomb-plot
trial, which started a week and a half ago, some of his supporters
have.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they might have looked into that courtroom no
matter what case was taking place there, given that they had so
much time on their hands last week as they waited with Hikind and
Naiman for the verdict in their case. But some said the fact that
the trial was of the two Palestinians drew their interest.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it seemed that the Orthodox Jewish visitors and at
least one of the Palestinian defendants, Abu Maizar, would agree
that the visitors' presence _ especially that of the Hasidim, with
their long black coats, beards and yarmulkes _ had made Abu Maizar
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sitting there in court, and who's sitting there and
looking, a bunch of Hasidim,'' Simcha Felder, one of the
non-Hasidic Jews visiting the bomb-plot trial, said as he recalled
his observation of Abu Maizar. ``He must have figured that hell has
started already.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar, a bearded man who wears a Muslim skullcap, has gazed
back at the Jewish visitors. One of his lawyers, Michael Padden,
agreed that his 24-year-old client had been unsettled by the Jewish
drop-ins, even though he was aware they had come to the building
for another case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made him a little uncomfortable at times,'' the lawyer
said. ``He's sensitive to the fact that they're not looking at him
with the kindest sort of gazes.'' But, the lawyer added, ``I tell
him not to let that bother him, to just focus on the case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abu Maizar and Khalil, 23, were arrested last July when the
police raided an apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and found what
they described as a pipe bomb ``fully rigged and ready to be
detonated,'' along with a rambling note that threatened attacks
against Jewish and American interests if various demands were not
met. The demands included the release of imprisoned Islamic
militants including Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was convicted of
masterminding the World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Abu Maizar have suggested that he did not intend to
set off the bomb but rather planned to use it as a prop in some
hazy plot to defraud a government anti-terrorism program of reward
money. Khalil's lawyer has not yet addressed the jury, but Khalil
insisted after his arrest that he had not known about the bomb's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The note _ it was typed on lined yellow paper and rife with
grammatical and spelling and punctuation errors _ not only warned
that Islamic militants were ``ready to hit everywhere'' with
suicide bombs, but also claimed responsibility for the crash of
Trans World Airlines Flight 800 in July 1996, in which 230 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Abu Maizar and Khalil are guilty of plotting a subway
calamity will be decided by the jury at their trial, but the note's
claim of responsibility for the Flight 800 catastrophe will not
require a trial, an FBI spokesman indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The claim was one of the ``thousands of leads'' the bureau
pursued in its investigation of the TWA crash, the spokesman,
Joseph Valiquette, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable with our announcement last November that we
have found no evidence that a criminal act was responsible for the
plane going down,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ It was not exactly the biker image that Hunter S.
Thompson described in ``Hell's Angels'': gangs of burly guys
flashing earrings, armpits and chain whips, barreling through
traffic ``like a burst of dirty thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   The dozen riders who roared through the West Village one night
last week included a surgeon whose leather jacket has a special
pocket for his hospital beeper; an engineer from Pennsylvania with
two small children, and a former New Jersey police officer turned
computer analyst wearing a ``Ride Nude'' T-shirt. Vicki Rossetti,
36, who works for an insurance company, was along and not on the
back of her boyfriend's bike _ she commands her own black
Harley-Davidson Sportster.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving through taxis, Jeffrey Hicken, an advertising art
director, turned to the rider on the back of his Harley and yelled:
``To tell you the truth, I don't even know who a lot of these guys
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hooligans, a loose collection of middle-class motorcycle
fanatics, had picked up a crowd. And it was not the first time
since the weather turned warm. It happens nearly every time they
roam these days around Manhattan, a city in the middle of a renewed
romance with biker culture.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Manes, a Web site developer who sometimes rides with the
group, calls it ``the summer of the motorcycle in New York,'' and
there is ample evidence to support the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: More than a hundred bikers from around New York
descended on the Guggenheim Museum one night last month for the
opening of ``The Art of the Motorcycle,'' an exhibit of motorcycle
design from the 1860s to the present. The museum's well-heeled
neighbors complained that the patrons were racing their motors.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods, garage space reserved for motorcycles is
full, because more people are buying motorcycles and because the
city has begun to crack down on an increasing number of motorcycles
illegally parked between cars and on traffic islands.
</P>
<P>
   Classes for the city's best-known motorcycle safety course are
booked through the summer, and the school's director, Gasper Trama,
who has trained the likes of Liam Neeson, Matthew Broderick and
Alan Alda, said the demand is the highest he has seen in several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's motorcycle-friendly bars _ Hogs and Heifers in the
meatpacking district, the Ear Inn in Soho, Red Rock West in
Chelsea, American Trash on the Upper East Side and Barcode in the
East Village _ are all seeing larger crowds of bikers.
</P>
<P>
   And, in perhaps the quintessential confirmation of a New York
City trend, people are angry. Those who live within earshot of the
biker bars have begun to complain about the noise, particularly the
screams emitted by motorcycles with illegally altered mufflers
called drag pipes, which are loud enough to trigger car alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Chelsea residents along 10th Avenue signed a
petition to the police complaining about the noise. Arthur
Strickler, the district manager of the community board that
represents Soho and the West Village, said the board is considering
asking the City Council to ban motorcycles from the neighborhood
altogether, though it admits such a ban would probably never work.
Short of that, the board is pushing for fines even steeper and
stricter than those enacted by the City Council last year for
excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
   Strickler calls drag pipes, which he concedes are used only by a
loud minority of bikers, ``one of these macho, sicko ways of
saying, `Here I am, look at me!'''
</P>
<P>
   But why, so many years after ``Easy Rider,'' does motorcycling
suddenly seem to be cool again in the city?
</P>
<P>
   Veteran riders, for whom it has never been uncool, say interest
has actually been building in New York for the past four or five
years, driven by some of the same factors that have pushed
motorcycle sales up 43 percent around the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The hellbent-for-leather image of biking has softened, and the
pastime is now attracting a new segment of older, more affluent
riders eager to motorcycle through the midlife crisis or see the
country. The healthy economy also means more money is available to
consumers for such expensive toys. (Brand-new motorcycles can cost
anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000.)
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, riders say, the popularity has also grown as
parking and maintaining a car in the city becomes more expensive
and traffic becomes more nightmarish. Motorcyclists cannot only
squeeze _ sometimes illegally _ right through midtown gridlock, but
they can roll into the country on weekends while escaping cars are
still crammed in the tunnels. And they can do it at 46 miles to the
gallon or better.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BEATER _ A second motorcycle that owners of expensive cycles use
for commuting and errands.
</P>
<P>
   BILLET BARGES _ Expensive, customized motorcycles covered with
shiny parts machined from a solid block, or billet, of aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   BURNOUT _ A show-off maneuver in which a rider holds the front
brake while racing the throttle, causing the back wheel to spin and
billow smoke.
</P>
<P>
   PILLION _ A Britishism that means the seat or saddle for the
second passenger on a motorcycle. Often used in the United States
to refer generally to a woman who rides behind a man on a
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   RUB _ Rich urban biker, a derisive term coined by
Harley-Davidson enthusiasts to refer to executives, lawyers and
other professionals who buy expensive motorcycles as status
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   SQUID _ First used in the Navy to refer to new sailors, the term
also refers to rookie riders who drive recklessly or buy
motorcycles they cannot handle.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT PIPES, DRAG PIPES _ Mufflers with noise-curbing
bafflers removed. The pipes, illegal in New York state, create a
deafening roar.

   Manhattan's motorcycle-friendly bars _ Hogs and Heifers in the
meatpacking district, the Ear Inn in Soho, Red Rock West in
Chelsea, American Trash on the Upper East Side and Barcode in the
East Village _ are all seeing larger crowds of bikers.
</P>
<P>
   And, in perhaps the quintessential confirmation of a New York
City trend, people are angry. Those who live within earshot of the
biker bars have begun to complain about the noise, particularly the
screams emitted by motorcycles with illegally altered mufflers
called drag pipes, which are loud enough to trigger car alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Chelsea residents along 10th Avenue signed a
petition to the police complaining about the noise. Arthur
Strickler, the district manager of the community board that
represents Soho and the West Village, said the board is considering
asking the City Council to ban motorcycles from the neighborhood
altogether, though it admits such a ban would probably never work.
Short of that, the board is pushing for fines even steeper and
stricter than those enacted by the City Council last year for
excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
   Strickler calls drag pipes, which he concedes are used only by a
loud minority of bikers, ``one of these macho, sicko ways of
saying, `Here I am, look at me!'''
</P>
<P>
   But why, so many years after ``Easy Rider,'' does motorcycling
suddenly seem to be cool again in the city?
</P>
<P>
   Veteran riders, for whom it has never been uncool, say interest
has actually been building in New York for the past four or five
years, driven by some of the same factors that have pushed
motorcycle sales up 43 percent around the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The hellbent-for-leather image of biking has softened, and the
pastime is now attracting a new segment of older, more affluent
riders eager to motorcycle through the midlife crisis or see the
country. The healthy economy also means more money is available to
consumers for such expensive toys. (Brand-new motorcycles can cost
anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000.)
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, riders say, the popularity has also grown as
parking and maintaining a car in the city becomes more expensive
and traffic becomes more nightmarish. Motorcyclists cannot only
squeeze _ sometimes illegally _ right through midtown gridlock, but
they can roll into the country on weekends while escaping cars are
still crammed in the tunnels. And they can do it at 46 miles to the
gallon or better.

COMMENTARY: A WITNESS TO HISTORY AT TRENTON'S FIVE POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ There is a place in Trenton called Five Points,
where Broad, Warren, Brunswick, Pennington and Princeton avenues
intersect at the top of a hill that slopes gently down to the
Delaware River a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington put his field artillery there after crossing
the Delaware in 1776, and in the Battle of Trenton on Christmas
Day, the Continental Army had its first big victory. In 1891, John
Duncan, the architect of Grant's Tomb, began work on a 150-foot
tower, topped with a heroic statue of Washington, to commemorate
the event. Two years later, President Grover Cleveland sent his
secretary of the Navy to the dedication of the new Trenton Battle
Monument, and the governors of eight of the original 13 states also
came.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a week ago, Alfred Braxton, better known as
Trigger Braxton from his fondly remembered days as a hellion,
closed the heavy oak and brass doors of the Trenton Battle Monument
for the last time and, at the age of 81, walked away into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton was born eight blocks from Five Points, on Kossuth
Street, and for the last 25 of the monument's 105 years, he spent
his working days, Wednesday through Sunday, in a little alcove
inside those doors. He would ferry visitors up to the tiny
observation platform under Washington's vaguely gesturing arm,
sometimes smacking the old Otis elevator works back to life with a
broomstick when they got balky. ``You can put down anything you
want,'' he told a visitor, ``but I always put down `elevator
engineer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Washington saw a lot of history, and so in his way did Trigger
Braxton. Like so many veterans of this part of Trenton, Braxton
says the best views are toward the past, although he admits that
may be changing. ``Well, this used to be a nice place,'' he said
the other day as he sorted through some leftover items in his old
office _ a pair of sunglasses that looked like his daughter's, a
handful of battle-monument brochures he thought he'd keep for old
times' sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a movie house, the Rialto, on Pennington, and
restaurants and a furniture store _ there was a lot going on until
Martin Luther King died,'' he said. The riots that followed the
King assassination in 1968 burned through Five Points and left it
with little but a reputation as one of the toughest neighborhoods
in town. The Reading Railroad line that used to follow the Delaware
and Raritan Canal in front of the monument shut down, its tracks
were torn up, and its old depot a block from the monument became a
center for retirees, where Braxton has lunch and shoots an
occasional game of pool.
</P>
<P>
   The plate-glass factory closed, too, along with the E.L. Curran
bottling plant, celebrated among Trenton kids for paying a nickel
for returns instead of the usual 2 cents. The families that could
move out did, and the storefronts that lined the street near the
monument are now boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   Someone returned the sword blade that had been broken from the
hands of one of the bronze soldiers guarding the monument's
entrance, but it was never welded back, and without it the soldier
looks odd, like a boxer in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton came to the monument a few years after the riots, and he
watched as the patriotic observations slowly faded away. ``They
used to have Christmas celebrations of the old battle, and we would
have cannons and Hessians all over,'' he said. ``Then the people
would come in, and I took them up to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, when things were slow, Braxton liked to ride to the
top of the monument alone, to follow Washington's gaze down to the
State House and the Delaware beyond it. That was always his
favorite view, he said. To Washington's back, Braxton could see the
new suburbs growing outward, away from Trenton, following the
direction that the general, emboldened by new victories, took
toward Princeton, New Brunswick and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the annual celebrations stopped, the visitors
became fewer and fewer, and the big monument waited for some of the
change going on around Trenton to come its way. Eventually, it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitman lady came by one day and told me they were going
to fix this place up,'' Braxton said, and just as Gov. Christie
Whitman announced, the fixing has begun.
</P>
<P>
   The land along Broad Street, across from the monument's little
park, has been cleared for 38 new three-bedroom town houses, called
Monument Crossing, with prices starting at $60,000. A block down
Broad, the exterior of the state medical school's new Addiction
Science Center is almost complete, and space is being plotted for a
new culinary school, an expanded health-care center and added
parkland nearby.
</P>
<P>
   These days, after lunch at the senior center, Trigger Braxton
walks back across Monument Park and up Broad Street to his
apartment. He stops and looks up at the great general atop the
great granite pillar, and at the work that is beginning, slowly, to
remake the ragged face of Five Points.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he wishes he were still on the job _ after
all, the state has no plans to replace him.

<P>
   The mother of modern sport _ that's a self-description _ is
still in the kitchen, stirring the pot, ladling out heaping
portions of vision, hard sell and encouragement, urging us to play
fair, shake our booties, treat everyone equally, find balance,
accept responsibility, eat, eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my issue, caregiving,'' said Billie Jean King last
week. ``I have to work on that, taking care of other people before
I take care of myself. Even when I go to fight for something, it's
because other people are suffering. But I'm getting better at it
now. Would you like something to drink? Water, soda? Are you
comfortable sitting there?''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King's most consistently interesting vision, World
Team Tennis, began its 18th season last week, still a mostly unsung
stepchild of tennis, much less world sport. Its combination of
elite athletes having fun and families playing recreationally has
yet to catch on. Only the Mother would keep loving and feeding it.
King will be 55 years old this year, which is also the 25th
anniversary of her match with Bobby Riggs, the most spectacular
public event of the modern women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't about tennis, it was about social change,'' said
King, who still talks as though rushing to net. ``It was more than
a symbolic event, it was a common ground. When you change hearts
and minds, you get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``People find ways to get around legislation, look at Title IX,
but I meet with women now, with male CEO's, people who make
decisions, people who were kids in 1973, whose perception of men
and women were changed forever when they saw that match.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King will have a prime spot in the pantheon of
sports heroes that every news media outlet seems to be erecting for
the century's end, but she will rarely be placed No. 1, which I
think she deserves. As she observes, with her usual amodest
clarity: ``People don't feel safe with people who stretch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attack on amateurism in tennis helped doom that secular
religion in all sports; no longer could entrepreneurs control a
sport without risk. Athletes and their agents became limited
partners in all games. As the Joan of Ace, beating Riggs in that
silly yet significant match at the Astrodome on Sept. 20, 1973, she
became the living example of gender equity.
</P>
<P>
   In World Team Tennis, founded with her former husband, Larry
King, she found an expression for all her ideas about making the
game accessible, from encouraging fans to cheer, putting names and
numbers on players' backs, allowing on-court coaching and playing
lets on serves, to setting up a national network of bowling-style
leagues for every level and age-group of recreational tennis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, WTT's seven-team, 49-match schedule is sponsored by
Du Pont, at least one reason for King's enthusiasm for clothing
made with Lycra and CoolMax (``Not true, I really like that stuff,
it feels good.'') Her own athleticism these days is limited to
rehab and treadmills; she underwent surgery in April for a detached
muscle in her shoulder, and will eventually need heart surgery to
correct arrythmia. She is on beta blockers now.
</P>
<P>
   King has always been a pinwheel of ideas, often first-draft,
usually cobbled together on the run from conversations, TV shows
and the self-help books she consumes like vitamin pills. Last week,
she talked about coaching as ``an unbelievable woman's thing, we
are taught to be such nurturers''; the tendency of male agents to
ask for less than their female clients are worth on the market, and
why ``seeing white'' during fear can be a prelude to defeat or
disaster (``the absence of color means you're paralyzed, you better
start slow breathing right away.'')
</P>
<P>
   King says she wants to ``get beyond tennis'' which has never
treated her, as has the larger society, as prophet and pioneer. One
plan in progress is a foundation, probably bearing her name, that
would concentrate on health and youth issues, including an attempt
to stem the rise in suicides among gay and lesbian teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Her great power now, she says, is that ``I get to all those
people who can make things happen with a stroke of their pen.''
Many of them, of course, want to talk about Bobby Riggs and about
tennis before they sign checks or legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever write another book,'' she said, ``I know what the
first line will be: `Tennis is the best thing that ever happened to
me and the worst.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The best because I got to travel, because I really love to hit
the ball, it's an aesthetic thing, and because it gave me the
chance to make social change, to be the mother of modern sports.
The worst because the sport discounted me, its lack of embrace of
new ideas that could rejuvenate it, and because there are all those
people in tennis who still just don't get it.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: SWITZERLAND'S UNPAID DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out for Switzerland and its banks to compensate
elderly Holocaust survivors for the sickening profits Swiss
institutions made from financing the Nazi war machine and holding
on to funds deposited by Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts by Switzerland's leading commercial banks and Jewish
organizations to negotiate a fair settlement have broken down,
largely because the Swiss government refuses to contribute
adequately to a compensation package. The breakdown has led New
York City and other American municipal and state governments to
threaten a series of escalating financial penalties on the banks,
beginning Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed penalties, which include denying Swiss banks the
chance to bid for municipal and state deposits and underwriting
fees, are misconceived. They would mainly punish the commercial
banks, when in recent months the main obstacle to a settlement has
been the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
   Further, by injecting local governments into a foreign-policy
issue, the sanctions will make it harder for Washington to persuade
the Swiss government to pay its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss financial institutions helped Nazi Germany convert the
gold it stole from individuals and conquered countries into foreign
exchange for buying war supplies. Most of these gold transactions
were done by Switzerland's central bank, but the commercial banks
were also involved.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss commercial banks also shamelessly betrayed the trust of
Europe's doomed Jews, keeping for themselves the money left behind
by depositors who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the banks made no serious effort to find family
members or other survivors. Only recently, and in response to
outside pressure, have the banks even discussed reasonable
compensation. The Swiss government lags badly behind.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, a commission led by former Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker has been reconstructing the records of
prewar Swiss bank accounts to determine how much money, in current
dollars with interest, is owed to Holocaust victims and their
families. An authoritative estimate is expected by the end of this
year and the Swiss banks have committed themselves to pay in full.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Swiss banks, the Swiss government and other Swiss
institutions have paid $200 million into a special compensation
fund for aging and destitute Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute concerns a so-called rough justice fund to
compensate Holocaust survivors for Switzerland's financial
transactions with the Nazis, like gold conversions and loans to
factories employing slave labor. The two main Swiss banks in
America, UBS and Credit Suisse, have offered to make combined
payments of an additional $530 million to settle these claims. The
Swiss government refuses to make any further contributions.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi leads the group of local
financial officers who are now planning to impose sanctions. They
have no easy ways of pressuring the Swiss government directly and
hope that by putting pressure on the commercial banks, they can
somehow produce a more generous settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the better way to do that would be through continued
negotiations, backed up by diplomatic pressure from Washington and
the threat of legal action in American courts.

ON BASEBALL: METS NEED HUNDLEY'S GRIT AND MAYBE A LITTLE LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one has questioned the New York Mets' heart yet.
Not even the Montreal manager, Felipe Alou, whose Expos had won the
first two games of a three-game series at Shea Stadium before the
two teams met in Saturday night's finale.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-honest Alou did question the heart of the
dead-in-the-water Baltimore Orioles after his Expos swept the
Orioles at the end of June in an interleague match between the
game's highest and lowest payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Mets, not the Orioles, who are proving fruitless
against the Montreal Expos, one of the youngest, most inexperienced
teams in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one should question the Mets' heart. Especially when
Todd Hundley, the player who epitomized the Mets' grit of a year
ago, was expected to return to the lineup Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the applause for Hundley's return dies, however, what
happens when the reality of the Mets' fade reemerges? What happens
when assurances that Hundley's obvious heart still exists is
overwhelmed by questions of whether enough overall talent and luck
still do exist on this team?
</P>
<P>
   There has been such a dearth of the former and such questioning
of the latter that the combined assault on the Mets' sensibilities
has dulled the enthusiasm that should have greeted Hundley's
return. The losses haven't helped. The Mets lost an inept 11-inning
game Thursday, then an 8-6 heartbreaker on a ninth-inning Expos'
rally Friday, defeats that pushed the once-promising Mets 13{ games
behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen is leakier than a sieve. Even John Franco, once the
only reliable reliever, has been saddled with the last three Mets
defeats, almost unheard of for closers this side of the woeful
Seattle bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Franco lost the two games to the Expos while awaiting appeal of
a three-game suspension drawn because of a bumping incident with
umpire Angel Hernandez during a controversial loss in Atlanta last
Sunday. The way Franco has stumbled into the second half, the
left-hander not only must question his timing, but his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Franco is only a small doubt on a team devoid of reliable
setup men, a competent leadoff hitter and underachieving yet
expensive and therefore untradeable hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Mets reacquired Franco's old setup man, Greg
McMichael, who had gone to L.A. in the deal for starter Hideo Nomo
on June 5. However, that will be but a Band-Aid to all that ails a
team now in a 2-9 free fall.
</P>
<P>
   And now, instead of looking at Hundley as a welcome addition,
the Mets are looking at him as a life preserver, a big burden for a
surgically repaired player fighting off the rust. Hundley has been
out since Sept. 26, 1997, because of surgery to his medial
collateral ligament, a major reconstruction that once seemed
guaranteed to deprive the Mets' most potent hitter of the entire
1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley should be applauded for such stubborn insistence on
returning. And not only because he fought injury. He also survived
the team's awkward handling of the acquisition of a second All-Star
catcher in Mike Piazza as well as organization-fed innuendoes about
alleged drinking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Mets need Hundley to do what no offensive hitter,
including the increasingly enigmatic Piazza has been able to do _
wear both heart and hits on his sleeve, pick up the team and carry
it out of its current disastrous path.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets need the player who set a home-run record for catchers
with 41 in 1996 to not only bond with Piazza, who hit 40 homers a
year ago. They need Hundley to re-energize Piazza, the player
originally thought to be an energizer unto himself.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, the longtime Dodger and short-term Marlin, appeared to
need no help, just supporting players, when he first arrived in a
trade May 22. With Piazza in the lineup, the Mets won nine straight
as stagnant hitters like Carlos Baerga and Bernard Gilkey
rediscovered long-lost strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, almost every hitter this side of Baerga soon returned to
his trance and the Mets suffered through moribund play that
consumed June and now threatens to spoil July as well. Amazingly,
Piazza rather than continue to lift the downtrodden too often has
mirrored the struggles of the lost and downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the catcher who was supposed to complement Bernard
Gilkey, to conspire with John Olerud to destroy pitching, has yet
to drive in a run in any game in which Gilkey and Olerud have runs
batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Now come Piazza and Hundley, the new tandem and the new hope, as
the Mets desperately cling to wild-card dreams, not to mention a
tenuous hold on second place in the National League East (the
rebuilding Philadelphia Phillies pulled within a half-game of the
Mets after defeating Pittsburgh Friday). And Hundley is the human
rabbit's foot of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has been on the periphery of the Mets' picture for weeks
now.
</P>
<P>
   Because his return has guaranteed an almost welcome angst
because the Mets would welcome anything that would rekindle the
competitive nature and juices of outfielders Butch Huskey, Gilkey
and Brian McRae.
</P>
<P>
   All three entered the second half seemingly bent on being less
conspicuous as disappointments, with Gilkey intriguingly
contributing as a leadoff hitter, something most every other
auditioning Met has failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gilkey contributed four hits and two runs batted
in during the first two games against Montreal and the Mets still
lost underscores that the luck and talent are still too often
coming in a trickle, not nearly good enough because the Mets need a
flood.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets can now only hope that Hundley is the first wave of a
flood of good fortune they so desperately need. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   Since sweeping into Washington in 1995, the
Contract-With-America Republicans have tried every legislative
trick in the book to undermine the nation's environmental laws.
Heroic efforts by moderate House Republicans and timely
presidential vetoes have held them off.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP contractors are a patient bunch, and after lying
around in the weeds for a while, they have now loaded up two big
appropriation bills with nearly 20 anti-environmental riders. None
of these riders challenge any basic law, but collectively they
threaten the nation's struggle to clean its air and water, restore
important fisheries and protect its public lands. The moderates
must try to sanitize these bills. If that fails, Clinton should
veto them if they reach his desk in anything like their present
form.
</P>
<P>
   The rider that most offends the White House was attached by the
House Appropriations Committee to a bill providing funding for the
Environmental Protection Agency. It would bar the agency from
spending any money to carry out the global warming agreement
negotiated in Japan last year until the Senate approves the treaty.
Read literally, this provision could prevent the administration
from encouraging industry to take purely voluntary steps to reduce
carbon dioxide before the treaty becomes binding. This is truly
retrograde thinking, not least because it would discourage
energy-saving measures that would make sense even if global warming
did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other riders fall into the category of regional
mischief-making, an area in which Alaska's congressional delegation
is the undisputed champion. Sens. Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski
and Rep. Don Young have burdened the Interior Department spending
bill with provisions that would increase logging in the Tongass
National Forest, prevent the National Park Service from phasing out
commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park and authorize new
road construction through the Chugach National Forest and the
Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The Izembek road has assumed talismanic significance to both
sides. Environmentalists say it would be the first road built
through a designated wilderness area in 34 years, and thus a
terrible precedent. The Alaska delegation says the road is needed
to transport isolated villagers to modern hospitals. There may be
room for argument here, but Stevens, the feared chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, seemed in no mood for deliberation
when he warned his colleagues that he would not easily forget a
vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other Westerners have inserted provisions that would delay
modest but useful efforts to improve the health of the national
forests and minimize harmful grazing and mining practices on
federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst rider of all comes from Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., who always seems to be in the vicinity of bad ideas. It
would require specific congressional approval for any changes in
the operation of any dam, public or private, in the Columbia River
watershed _ effectively overriding all other environmental
protections and dealing a huge blow to efforts to restore salmon
runs in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's audacity would never survive a separate vote, so he
hopes to sneak it through as part of a larger spending bill. If
Gorton succeeds, President Clinton must intervene. The Gorton rider
alone is worth a veto.

ANALYSIS: GM STRIKE DRIVEN BY LOCAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ A 37-day strike against two General Motors auto
parts factories here has proved hard to settle as the company and
the United Automobile Workers union continue to raise the stakes,
making it harder and harder to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes are about very local issues: work rules, equipment
investments and job security at the two factories here and at
several other GM factories where workers have also been talking
about striking.
</P>
<P>
   But GM has presented the showdown to Wall Street as a struggle
over productivity and competitiveness. The union has cast the
strikes to its members as a showdown over GM's plans to expand
operations in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia to take advantage
of lower labor costs there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when questioned, top negotiators for both sides acknowledge
that a settlement is still likely to focus on local issues rather
than on GM's growing expansion abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, said at a news conference here on Friday evening that
the company was seeking a settlement of issues at the two factories
here and at several other factories where workers have also been
talking about striking.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
a few minutes later that there was no sign that GM was
reconsidering its factory-building plans overseas, nor are these
part of the talks here.
</P>
<P>
   Local union officials say that the UAW is not even objecting in
negotiations to GM's moving production overseas of a few of the
parts made here, but rather demanding that GM replace those parts
with other work rather than continuing to allow the work force here
to erode through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street auto analysts in particular, who are widely quoted
as experts on the strikes, have tended to see the showdown in broad
terms: whether GM will be able to reduce its manpower nationwide.
But the negotiations here and at several other factories only
involve amendments to local union agreements, participants from
both sides agree, and not to the UAW's national agreement with GM,
which will not expire until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements at any local union set no legal or negotiating
precedents at other factories. GM has gone through a dozen local
strikes at other factories over the last five years over similar
issues of local work rules and factory investments without making
any broad changes either in its relationship with the UAW or in its
overall costs of building cars or light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is concerned with issues that aren't issues in
this strike,'' Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes here still might hold a few wrinkles not seen in
other local strikes against GM. The automaker has been talking
about reopening a few assembly plants with outside parts, for
example, and Shoemaker said Saturday that GM might be able to
reopen a few plants just with parts it has been able to scrounge by
checking warehouses over the last few weeks. But any such move
would likely send only a trickle of vehicles to dealers starved of
popular models.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for the strike's outcome have become inflated
partly by the walkout's broad effects on factories elsewhere and
partly by the unusually strong language here. The UAW and GM both
studied carefully last year's Teamsters strike against the United
Parcel Service and concluded that swaying public opinion was
important. But in trying to woo reporters and the public, both
sides have sometimes overstated the strike's issues and raised new
issues that have complicated a settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When GM publicly threatened three weeks ago to close some
American factories permanently if the UAW did not become more
cooperative, Shoemaker mentioned that workers at parts factories in
Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, also might go on strike later this
year, and that workers at a car and engine assembly plant here also
had grievances. Now GM is demanding that these disputes also be
resolved before any deal is concluded here.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that strikes were ever really likely at the
other factories. The UAW's national leadership maintains strict
control over its local unions, which can stage strikes only with
the leadership's approval. Workers at the car and engine factory
voted last autumn in favor of a strike, while workers in
Indianapolis are scheduled to vote on Sunday, but UAW leaders
privately tend to view such votes as a chance for workers to vent
their frustration at the company, rather than any reason actually
to authorize a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Through many years of an often tortured relationship, and
through more than a dozen other local strikes over the last five
years, GM and the UAW have conducted their strike negotiations in
great secrecy until now, leaving the public and even the UAW's
members in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The only partial exception to the secrecy in labor talks came
during a 17-day strike at two GM brake factories in Dayton in 1996,
when GM executives briefly said the strike was about the company's
long-term competitiveness, while UAW leaders stayed mum.
</P>
<P>
   That strike also was heralded as a historic showdown between the
UAW and GM, and like the current strikes, it closed 26 of GM's 29
assembly plants. But the dispute itself involved GM's commitment to
buy certain anti-lock brake systems from a nonunion supplier in
South Carolina instead of assembling them in Dayton, and the
union's demand that GM invest in equipment to build other parts in
Dayton so as to replace the several hundred jobs being lost. In a
compromise typical of such struggles, GM ended up promising some
investments that would replace half of the lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the union and GM soon fell to squabbling again over whether
GM had followed through on its promises. So just 27 months after a
showdown in Dayton that was supposed to transform labor relations
in the auto industry, all-night talks are again being held in
Dayton now to resolve the latest squabbles before a deal is sealed
here. &QL;

A BULL RUN STIRS FANS AND CRITICS IN NEVADA

<P>
   MESQUITE, Nev. _ To believe the Internet site set up to promote
it, the spectacle scheduled to unfold here is nothing short of
epochal. ``Never in the history of America,'' the site reads, ``has
an event occurred of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   That just might be overreaching. This would not: In a state
renowned for unconventional entertainment, what was to happen on
Saturday on the outskirts of this tiny town, about an hour's drive
from Las Vegas, qualifies as particularly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 people have paid $50 each for the dubious
privilege of lining up on a quarter-mile stretch of dusty ranch
land, beneath a punishing desert sun, to be chased by 1,000-pound
bulls. Hundreds more have flooded Mesquite's handful of large
hotels to be on hand to watch them.
</P>
<P>
   And Nevada officials and animal welfare advocates have vowed to
keep close tabs on what they said was the first attempt by anyone
in the United States to replicate _ well, sort of _ the running of
the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The man who dared to do so is Phil Immordino, a rodeo promoter
from Phoenix, who described Running of the Bulls America as a
chance for thrill-seekers to savor the ultimate rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get anywhere near a bull,'' Immordino said, ``and the
adrenaline starts flowing, the heart starts thumping. You're going
to be excited. You're going to have a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, unless you wind up with a horn through your
midriff or some other fatal injury. Such a fate has befallen more
than a dozen people in Pamplona in this century, and at least five
people, including an American, were in the event this year. The
prospect of similar bloodshed here has aroused the concern of many
city and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about liability,'' said Alice Fessenden, one of
five members of the Mesquite City Council. Ms. Fessenden voted
against holding the event, but was joined by only one colleague;
the three others, she said, argued that the event would put
Mesquite on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fessenden said the city, a remote oasis of 10,000 residents
in a patch of desert about 70 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was
already there. ``Our high school golf team just won state's,'' she
said. ``Our little Miss Mesquite has been named Miss Nevada. We
really don't need this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Miller also questioned the wisdom of the event and said
in a telephone interview that he supported the state Transportation
Department's decision last month to deny Immordino the use of the
main street, Mesquite Boulevard, through the center of town for the
Running of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The event was moved to a private ranch three miles east of town,
along the Arizona-Nevada border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an event based on sensationalism that has a serious risk
of injuries,'' Miller said. ``It's ill advised.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest outcry came from animal welfare advocates,
who said they distrusted Immordino's assurances that the 24 bulls,
all of which usually participate in rodeo events, would not be
pinched, poked, prodded or provoked in any other cruel way to rage
down the quarter-mile track.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under some pressure to make it an exciting event,'' Wayne
Pacelle, senior vice president of the Humane Society of the United
States, said. ``If the animals are just standing around while he's
yelling and clapping his hands, it becomes a petting zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Immordino said that several men on horses behind the bulls, and
the promise of alfalfa at the end of the track, would get the
animals moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The people, Immordino said, would be required to be at least 21,
sober and in decent physical shape. Unlike in Pamplona, Immordino
said, there are escape routes for scared runners. Even so,
participants were asked to sign liability waivers. Emergency
medical workers will be available.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said the potential danger of the event was what
made it thrilling, and that it would be an experience they could
always crow about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to tell the grandkids, if I live,'' Tim Pindel,
28, a construction worker from Las Vegas, said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sullivan, 39, a waiter in Las Vegas, who was checking out
the bulls in their pen near the starting line and taking snapshots
of them, said he was here ``just for the thrill of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the people in Spain talk about the thumping of your
heart as you hear the hooves behind you,'' he said. ``I want to
feel that thumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned for his safety, he added, ``I'll just
pull out some old basketball moves, fake left, go right.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HELPING THEM GET THROUGH THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be hard to find anyone in New York more
marginalized in more ways than Ali Forney. He was homeless, black,
gay, 22, and a crack addict who made money and found shelter
through prostitution, often wearing a dress, heels and a wig. In
December he was shot in the head, the third young transgender
prostitute murdered in Harlem in 14 months. All the cases are
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not know him might miss the human being under all
those labels. But at his memorial, held at a Times Square church,
70 friends and relatives gathered to remember a complex man. Six
months before his death, he closed the annual talent show at
SafeSpace, a center for homeless youth, with a gospel song and a
prayer, preaching that ``God loves everybody for who they are.'' He
was proudly HIV negative, no mean feat for someone in his line of
work, and spent many nights working with social service
organizations in the gay bars and piers of the West Village and
Times Square, dispensing condoms and talking about safe sex and
places young people could get meals, showers, drug treatment,
medical care and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Many people and institutions failed Ali Forney in his short
life, not least Forney himself. But among them was the city of New
York. The city's quality-of-life initiative and the development of
Times Square have inadvertently pushed homeless youths out of their
traditional haunts. They now populate a lonelier, and hence more
dangerous, diaspora in areas such as Harlem, and are much harder
for the nightly patrols of outreach workers to find and help.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many homeless teen-agers and young adults there
are in New York City, but state and city studies a few years ago
said between 12,000 and 20,000. People who work with them say their
ranks are swelling due to cuts in services and the coming of age of
children from families ravaged by the mid-1980s crack epidemic. The
youth population in general is also growing.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of homeless youths are from New York, and are
black or Hispanic. Many ran away from foster care. Forty percent
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, a term for people who
feel they belong to the opposite sex. This group is
disproportionately homeless because their families sometimes kick
them out, and they are often unwelcome and even assaulted in their
schools and foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most homeless young people use drugs, but researchers warn
against concluding that drug abuse leads to homelessness. Michael
Clatts, a medical anthropologist commissioned by the Giuliani
administration to study New York's homeless teen-agers last year,
says it is the other way around _ most began using drugs only after
reaching the street. They also turn to dealing, and car theft, and
many become prostitutes to make money and have a place to sleep.
They get AIDS _ teen-agers now acquire HIV at a faster rate than
any other group. And few young people who spend nights on the
street or in abandoned buildings have the stability to kick drugs
or find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Although shelter is their most basic need, they do not fit in
any city shelter program. They are scared of the giant, dangerous
shelters that house adults and need smaller group homes with help
for people who may be adults chronologically but not emotionally.
But youth programs will not house anyone over 18. The city has only
about 400 beds designed for older youths, 80 percent of them in
Covenant House.
</P>
<P>
   New York has shown little interest in solutions. From 1995 to
1997, the Department of Youth and Community Development failed to
spend nearly $1 million it had budgeted for housing for homeless
youths, which resulted in a loss of an additional $1.5 million in
matching funds from the state. The department says it will leave
$450,000 unspent in 1998, because shelters are unpopular with
neighborhoods. But at least one, the West Village, has volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that the city has not been trying very
hard. The tone of Clatts' report displeased the administration and
it has vanished. He is barred from discussing his findings, even
with the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of homeless youth has also fallen between the cracks
at the City Council. But the new head of the Youth Committee,
Kenneth Fisher, last month held the first hearing on homeless
teen-agers that anyone can remember. That has prodded the city into
beginning talks on a shelter and some of the bureaucratic hurdles
that keep youths on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It will require a sustained commitment from the city to a group
of people invisible until they get sick, arrested or murdered.

POLICE GET TIPS IN WEALTHY WIDOW'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twelve hours after publicizing a reward for
information about the mysterious disappearance of Irene Silverman
from her Upper East Side Manhattan home, police said they had
received up to a dozen tips from residents in New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police
Department, refused to discuss the details of the information
provided, saying only that detectives were ``following up on
numerous leads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting good information, but it's going to be a
while,'' she said. ``We are sorting things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman, a wealthy 82-year-old widow who rented out
expensive apartments in her East 65th Street mansion, disappeared
last Sunday morning after an argument with one of her tenants,
Kenneth Kimes, said an investigator who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, 23, and his mother, Sante Kimes, 63, are being held on a
federal charge of writing a bad check in Utah. At the time of their
arrest last Sunday, officials said, the Kimeses were carrying
several pieces of Mrs. Silverman's identification. And a search of
their green Lincoln Town Car revealed a loaded 9-mm handgun, a box
of .22-caliber ammunition, 10 wigs and $30,000, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the trunk of the car, police also found fraudulent business
documents, including a power of attorney form similar to a document
that investigators say Kimes tried to make Mrs. Silverman sign on
the Wednesday before her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the Kimeses are suspects in the March slaying
of an Los Angeles businessman and the 1996 disappearance of a bank
auditor in the Bahamas, both of whom had connections to the pair.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, David Kazdin, who once owned a house with the
Kimeses, was found in a trash bin near the beach in Venice, Calif.,
shortly after Sante and Kenneth Kimes obtained a fraudulent
$280,000 loan on his home and transferred it to an off-shore bank
in the Bahamas, said investigators in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian authorities say they want to question the Kimeses about
the disappearance of a Middle Eastern banker, Syed Bilal Ahmed, who
had befriended the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   The police are also assembling a list of business associates
from the trunk of the car but have yet to find evidence of anyone
else who has been bilked or is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a news conference Saturday that
the far-flung accusations against the Kimeses had made the inquiry
logistically complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously a very intense investigation _ it involves
four jurisdictions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the Bahamas have been investigating the Kimeses since
1996, when Ahmed disappeared. According to Superintendent Douglas
Hanna, the banker worked for Cayman Island Gulf Union Bank, which
is now closed, and was sent to the Bahamas to audit one of its
branches where the Kimeses had an account.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced to the Kimeses by a bank employee and was seen
with the couple two days before being reported missing, said
Superintendent Hanna. He added that it appeared the Kimeses were
offering to rent him a home in the area, though investigators have
yet to assertion whether they actually owned the property he was to
occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in the Bahamas said that it also appeared the
Kimeses were trying to form a corporation there, though they did
not know if the banker was involved in this deal. They said that
two former bank employees also figured as possible suspects in the
banker's disappearance.

FITTING FINAL FOR CENTURY'S LAST WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With all due respect to the protocol-conscious people
across the English Channel who essentially invented soccer,
Sunday's final between France and Brazil is an appropriate finish
to the last World Cup of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the nation that launched the globe's most popular
sporting event against the nation that has been the most successful
in it. It will be South America against Europe; Ronaldo and the
world's most technically sound attacking players against Marcel
Desailly and the world's most tactically sound defense.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Brazil's Cafu against Bixente Lizarazu on one wing;
Brazil's Roberto Carlos against Lilian Thuram on the other. It will
be every man against his own nerves and his own limitations, and
when the last whistle of an exhausting, emotional month is blown
Sunday sometime between 10:45 p.m. and midnight, there will either
be a familiar champion and dancing in the streets of Rio de Janeiro
or a first-time champion and the biggest party the Champs-Elysees
has seen since Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a child and you play soccer, you always dream
about being in a World Cup final,'' Thuram said. ``I remember
playing games with my friends: France against Brazil, but I was
always on the Brazilian team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is often that way on the playgrounds of the world. Brazil is
a symbol, a soccer state of mind. But this time, France will have
the home-team advantage, if there is one.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time that a host nation and a defending
champion will meet in a World Cup final. One reason France is host
to this event at all is because a Brazilian, FIFA's outgoing
president, Joao Havelange, put his weight behind its bid. Havelange
will be rooting against the French on Sunday as he sits near French
President Jacques Chirac. This is not the first time their nations
have met with much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 in Stockholm, the Brazilians defeated the French, 5-2,
in the World Cup semifinals. Pele, then 17, scored three of the
Brazilian goals, but the match might have been less lopsided if the
French captain, Robert Jonquet, had not injured his knee in the
35th minute. This was in the stiff-lipped era before substitutions
were authorized, so Jonquet limped and soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   The French would get a measure of revenge in the 1986
quarterfinals in Guadalajara, Mexico. After 90 minutes of
regulation and 30 minutes of overtime, the score was tied, 1-1, but
the French prevailed on penalty kicks, 4-3. The team was widely
considered the finest in French history, but for all their flair
and experience, the French would prove unable to solve the riddle
posed by a fresher West German side in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, French soccer has a new high-water mark, and
Coach Aime Jacquet's team has reached this level for some of the
same reasons Brazil ended its 24-year championship drought at the
last World Cup. The French, like the Brazilians, have put new
emphasis on defensive rigor at the expense of attacking brilliance.
The French players, like the Brazilians, have fled their
underfinanced, underexposed domestic league and signed big
contracts with clubs in the leagues in Italy, Spain, Germany and
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing teams we changed mentality,'' said the French
midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who plays for Arsenal in England.
``Before, everybody knew that the French had some great qualities
and wonderful players, but we never quite had the mental strength
that this sort of competition demands. By going abroad and playing
for the best clubs and under great pressure, I think we have
learned what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth consecutive final in which a European team
will face a South American team. In the first three meetings, the
team playing closest to home has always prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   To keep that streak alive, the French know they will have to
keep Ronaldo from having time to turn with the ball. They know they
must mark the Brazilians tightly to keep them from making
fast-twitch transitions from defense to attack: either up the wings
with outside fullbacks Cafu and Roberto Carlos or up the middle
with Rivaldo. They also must avoid leaving too much space between
their lines: space that their more potentially dangerous opponents
are well-equipped to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Brazilian team has been in some awkward situations in
this cup, but they have players with so much talent that they can
resolve problems all by themselves,'' said Didier Deschamps, French
midfielder and captain.
</P>
<P>
   What the French can potentially exploit is Brazil's central
defense, which proved vulnerable to well-timed crosses against the
Dutch in the semifinals, and a certain lack of consistency. Can it
be a coincidence that in four of its six matches, Brazil has taken
a lead and then allowed its opponent to equalize? Another question
is whether France and its Brazilian-style playmaker Zinedine Zidane
can turn these relative weaknesses into goals. Zidane has yet to
score, and since the second round began, all three French goals
have been scored by defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Brazilian Coach Mario Zagallo has had little
trouble laughing in the face of precedent this week. ``We have won
all of our World Cups outside the country,'' Zagallo said. ``I
respect very much the French team, but I am not afraid of it. We
are too used to big finals and big matches to approach them with
apprehension. If any players should have goose bumps before the
kickoff, it should be the French, not the Brazilians.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only World Cup final Brazil has lost was at home in 1950,
when a crowd of 200,000 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro
had to watch Uruguay's team celebrate. Zagallo, then in the midst
of his military service, was one of the mourners in Maracana that
July.
</P>
<P>
   But since moving from the stands to the field, he has become a
talisman for his nation. He was a fine player on the team that won
in 1958 and 1962, the coach in 1970 and an assistant coach in
1994. &QL;

BURIAL IN HIS OWN NAME AFTER REST IN TOMB OF UNKNOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo.) (js) 
By SHARMAN STEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Unknown no longer, Lt. Michael Blassie was laid to
rest on Saturday in Missouri soil, buried at a veterans' cemetery
near his childhood home, over the hill from the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since his Air Force jet crashed in South
Vietnam in 1972, Blassie rests beneath a headstone bearing his
name, at the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery south of St.
Louis. His body had been interred for 14 years at the Tomb of the
Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The full military funeral was held under gray skies and attended
by hundreds of veterans, friends, relatives and well-wishers,
including Secretary of Defense William Cohen. A formation of four
F-15 jets flew overhead, and one of the four broke away in the
traditional ``missing man'' salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was strong, he was fearless, and he loved what he was
doing,'' said Patricia Blassie, one of the flier's four siblings,
all of whom spoke at the graveside service. ``He was the heart, the
soul and the spirit that is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Blassie was 24 years old and a highly decorated Air Force pilot
when his A-37 attack jet was shot down on May 11, 1972, outside the
South Vietnamese village of An Loc, near the Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was so intense in the area that the site could not
be searched immediately. When remains were found in October 1972
the bones were tentatively identified as those of Blassie, based on
an identification card and other effects. But by 1980, that
classification was changed to ``unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day, 1984, the remains were buried at the Tomb of
the Unknowns alongside unknown servicemen from World War I, World
War II and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by CBS News prompted the Defense Department to
review the case. Blassie's remains were disinterred and a sample of
mitochondrial DNA was removed from the pelvis and matched to a
sample provided by the flier's mother, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were brought to St. Louis on Friday, and relatives
and friends gathered at Scott Air Force Base, near his hometown of
Florissant, a suburb north of St. Louis. A memorial service was
held on Friday night at a Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has meant so much to us,'' George Blassie, Blassie's
brother, said during Friday's service. ``We believe Michael would
have been proud of how we pulled together to bring him home.''
</P>
<P>
   The grave site is in the oldest part of the 172-year-old
cemetery, and is surrounded by the graves of veterans of World War
I and World War II, including several containing remains of more
than one person. Ms. Blassie, who is a captain in the Air Force
Reserve, explained the family's quest to identify her brother's
remains and to bury him close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept searching my soul and asking myself what was so
important about just six bones,'' she said. ``But the answer came
from my heart. It's important because it's my brother.''

RICHARD BULL, 67, CHOREOGRAPHER WITH LONG ACADEMIC CAREER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Niles Bull, a dancer, choreographer and
educator, died July 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said Gill Wright Miller, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   A genial man who stood by his aesthetic convictions with a wit
that was at times cantankerous, Bull was known as a pioneer in the
development of structured improvisation in dance. He used jazz
improvisation techniques in his choreography and incorporated
material like texts into his dances.
</P>
<P>
   Bull presented concerts and festivals of dance improvisation
regularly in his Warren Street Performance Loft in Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Detroit, Bull began his career as a jazz pianist, moving
to New York City in 1948 to work with Lenny Tristano. He supported
himself by accompanying dance classes at the Juilliard School,
where he was exposed to modern dance and began studying with Alwin
Nikolais. He performed in the mid-1950s with the Munt-Brooks Dance
Company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Bull began a long academic career as co-coordinator of
undergraduate dance students at New York University; then he became
chairman of dance at the State University of New York at Brockport,
where he was a teacher and mentor to Lois Welk and Bill T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bull's loft theater opened in 1978, and he directed the graduate
studies program in dance at Wesleyan University from 1983 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bull's wife, Cynthia Jean Cohen Bull, professionally known as
Cynthia Novack, died in 1996. He is survived by a daughter, Katie
Bull Pritchett, and a sister, Joanna, both of Manhattan, and a
brother, Dan, of Montclair, N.J.  &QL;

CURTIS BERGER, 72, EXPERT ON REAL-ESTATE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Ore., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Professor Curtis Jay Berger, who trained generations
of aspiring lawyers in the fine points of real estate and property
law, died July 6 at his home on Manhattan's West Side. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to Columbia Law School, where he
was the Lawrence A. Wien professor of real estate law.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was on the Columbia law faculty for 36 years. A
specialist in urban affairs, he also spent a year as chairman of
urban planning in the School of Architecture in 1969 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``Land Ownership and Use'' (1968), which
went into its fourth edition last year, and other books on property
law. With Peter J. Wiedenbeck, he wrote ``Partnership Taxation,
Cases and Materials'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   He frequently contributed to professional journals and served as
a director of many professional organizations. He was a member of
the West Side Waterfront Panel in 1990 and a director of the Hudson
River Park Conservancy from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was a past president of the Association of American Law
Schools and at his death was a trustee of the Foundation for
Research and Education of the National Association for Law
Placement. He also was a board member and, from 1981 to 1986,
president of the Bridge, a nonprofit agency in New York looking
after the severely ill and homeless and people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rochester, Berger earned his undergraduate degree
from the University of Rochester in 1948 and his law degree from
Yale Law School three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was in private practice in Rochester until 1958, when he
became an instructor at Yale. After two years at the University of
Southern California, he joined the Columbia faculty in 1962 to
teach the law on real-estate transactions, partnerships and real
property.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Vivian Adler Berger, the
Nash professor of law at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are four children from a previous marriage that
ended in divorce: Ellen Lewis, of Jerusalem; Cathy Berger, of
Hoboken, N.J.; Wendy Berger, of Portland, Ore., and John, of
Hoboken; two sisters, Gloria Drehmel and Glenna Cook, both of San
Mateo, Calif.; a brother, Philip, of Coral Gables, Fla., and 11
grandchildren.

COLUMN: KEEPING TEEN-AGERS AWAY FROM THE FAST LANE
</HEADLINE>

 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is nothing so extravagant to report about J.M.
Gold's first two weeks as a professional baseball player, except
for the telephone bill. ``He calls every day, sometimes twice, if
we're lucky,'' said his father, Larry, which doesn't account for
the calls the homesick teen-ager makes to his girlfriend, Lisa
Miller, among others back home in Toms River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the 18-year-old first-round draft pick, his room in
the home of the nice Wehr family out in Ogden, Utah, includes a
private line. ``I just got off the phone with him,'' Larry Gold
said the other day. ``But don't get me started; I'll start
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   East and West, there are emotional whirlpools two weeks after
the prodigy boarded his first flight, bound for a rookie league
outpost in the Wasatch Valley. Jon-Michael Gold, or J.M., a
right-handed strikeout artist out of Toms River North High School,
was committed to St. John's University until the Milwaukee Brewers
made him the 13th pick of the amateur draft last month, followed by
an offer and opportunity he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who drives a tractor-trailer for a supermarket chain
and hoped all three of his boys would go to college, hugged his
middle child when he said he wanted to turn pro, perfectly
understanding the part about the fantasy-come-true. No one in the
family, the community or even in the newspapers was going to
challenge the wisdom of J.M. Gold's decision either, the way people
do, with both knees jerking, when it is the young basketball player
from the inner city who somehow looks beyond the wisdom of a
bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   When the sports columnist called, Larry Gold was watching an old
high school tape of his son, wistfully telling his wife, Diana,
that the house seemed so quiet now that the agents have stopped
calling and the scouts have gone. There is anxiety about his son's
being away, about his pro debut sometime next month, but at least
there is no mystery. There is only the time-honored logic of young
dreamers crammed into buses, touring minor league America,
beginning what they hope will be the climb to the top. There is
only the issue of practicality, no cliche-strewn sermons on
morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me fly fishing one day,'' J.M. Gold said on the
telephone, with a Jersey-sounding chortle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't much fun, but it got my mind off baseball for a while,
and missing home.'' Oh, and one other thing, dear diary: Alvin
Morrow _ he's an outfielder from St. Louis _ has become a friend,
someone to pass the 10-hour bus rides to Butte and Billings, Mont.,
with.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guaranteed storybook progression _ professionally or
socially _ but failure in most cases will not be attributable to a
warped assimilation process that places teen-aged innocents in hot
cars, fast lanes and, ultimately, in the path of the hardened and
covetous adults. If a sports cycle is changing and the country is
turning back to a reverence of baseball while taking a more
apprehensive look at the part of pro basketball that doesn't
include Michael Jordan, it is at least partly because baseball's
foundation was built to last. Basketball's is on the verge of
falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   This was never more obvious than at one of those dreadful high
school meat markets last week at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
One day, you had Dick Vitale imploring the kids to stay in school.
Another day, the shoe company sponsor was trotting out the likes of
Tracy McGrady and Jermaine O'Neal as jewelry-bedecked role models,
even if their last dazzling moves were from high school right to
the end of a National Basketball Association bench.
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing aspect of basketball's labor talks is that
they are never about what the sport most needs _ significant
investment in an instructional minor league venture. That would
mean less money for David Stern and Patrick Ewing but would help
get the sport back on a sane developmental track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kid who is drafted in the first round of any sport is
going to be offered a lot of money,'' Larry Gold said. ``But how do
you take a kid who is 18, give him $5 million and just throw him
out there when he hasn't had any chance to mature?''
</P>
<P>
   His son eats meals with his host family, which also loans him a
car to get to his morning physical therapy appointments to
strengthen his shoulder. He is due back for workouts at the ball
park by 3 p.m. Game time for the Ogden Raptors is 7:11 (the team's
leading sponsor is the convenience store chain). The games end
around 10, leaving J.M. Gold time for a snack in the Wehrs'
kitchen, a cooling-off shower and a couple of late-night calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get him tonight, after the game in his room,'' Larry
Gold told the sports columnist the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Into the morning New Jersey hours, however, and well past
midnight in Utah, J.M. Gold's telephone line was busy. At least it
is cheaper to call at night. &QL;

BIDDING FOR STATE-SPONSORED CREDIT CARD RAISES QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In late 1995, Gov. George Pataki's administration,
looking for innovative ways to promote and profit from the state's
image, decided to sponsor an ``I Love New York'' credit card. The
idea was to sell the rights to the slogan to a bank, which would
emblazon it on a standard Visa card or Mastercard along with
pictures of scenic New York.
</P>
<P>
   The contract went to MBNA Corp. of Delaware, a large credit-card
issuer that in the last four years has been one of the biggest
political contributors to the New York Republican State Committee
and to Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps no surprise that MBNA received the contract, since
it was the only bidder. While the administration went through a
formal process to solicit bids, an examination of the way it was
handled shows that officials did not aggressively pursue other
credit-card issuers, raising questions about whether they got the
best deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Economic Development said it solicited bids
from only nine banks. Two of them are so small that they do not
issue credit cards. Those two, as well as three others, said they
had no record of having received a bid request. While the
department said that it had hoped to give the contract to a bank
based in New York, it did not solicit bids from several obvious
candidates, like Chase Manhattan and Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   MBNA received the three-year contract on March 15, 1996. The
following month, just as the credit card program began, it donated
$50,000 to the Republican State Committee, according to disclosure
records.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, MBNA has distributed 109,000 of the ``I Love
New York'' credit cards, officials said, making it a successful
line for the company's so-called affinity-card business.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically produce affinity cards in partnership with a
range of groups, from alumni associations to sports teams to
government agencies. The number of ``I Love New York'' cards ranks
it as a medium-size affinity issue, marketing experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration, MBNA and the Republican State
Committee said there was no link between political contributions
and the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Economic Development defended the method that
it used to find a card issuer, saying that it was fair and
impartial. The department's commissioner, Charles Gargano, used to
be Pataki's chief fund-raiser, but he said he stopped raising money
for the governor and the state party after Pataki took office in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the department, Caroline Quartararo, noted
that the state had collected $388,000 in fees from MBNA. The
company pays the state $1 for each new card, $1.50 for each card
that is renewed and 25 cents for each charge.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it sent applications to eight banks in New
York and to MBNA. Among them was Olympian Bank of Brooklyn, which
has only two branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall ever seeing such an application,'' said Joseph
Baldasare, senior vice president of Olympian Bank. ``We don't offer
credit cards ourselves. We are a very small, little bank in Bay
Ridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not request bids from a number of
out-of-state banks that, like MBNA, issue affinity cards.
</P>
<P>
   Several big banks in the state and elsewhere said they did not
know whether they would have bid on the contract had they been
notified about it, and some pointed out that affinity cards were
not their focus.
</P>
<P>
   But they all said they would have considered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of programs that we look at, and there are
probably very, very few that we would reject out of hand,'' said
George McCane, a senior vice president for corporate affairs at
First USA, which is based in Delaware and is the biggest rival of
MBNA in the affinity market.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain how it chose the banks that received the
applications, Ms. Quartararo said at first that the eight banks in
New York were all the banks that were chartered in the state. She
said MBNA was asked for a bid because it was a major issuer of
affinity cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the business to stay in New York if possible,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When told in a subsequent conversation that more than 150 banks
are chartered in the state, Ms. Quartararo said she had been
mistaken, explaining that the department had sent out applications
to the largest banks chartered in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It was then pointed out to her that some of the banks that
received the applications are very small or have their headquarters
in New York but are not chartered in the state. ``What can I tell
you?'' she responded. ``There is this bureaucrat who works in our
finance office who just did it like that. It sounds ridiculous, but
that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the department had announced the bidding in a
newsletter published by the state that lists available state
contracts. Any bank that had seen the listing and asked for an
application could have bid, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $50,000 contribution, the Republican State
Committee has received two others from MBNA: one for $20,000 on
Oct. 22, 1996, and another for $100,000 on March 5, 1997. MBNA and
its executives have also given more than $300,000 to political
committees controlled by D'Amato. The senator is chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, giving him great influence over any
banking legislation that MBNA supports.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the card contract, Terry O'Brien,
a spokesman for the Republican State Committee, said in statement,
``The State Committee does not involve itself in governmental or
policy decisions, nor will it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Spartin, an MBNA vice chairman, said there was
``absolutely no connection'' between the contract and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we were selected is not that unusual,'' he said.
``We have 5,000 organizations that endorse us.'' But he
acknowledged that the ``affinity market is very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Quartararo said the search for an issuer was done
properly, some credit card consultants disagreed. Michael Auriemma,
president of Auriemma Consulting Group in Westbury, said it was
likely that other issuers would have sought the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they did it right, they would have gotten a lot more than
one response,'' Auriemma said. ``In order to guarantee that you get
the best deals, you want to talk to different players.''
</P>
<P>
   Other credit-card issuers said they would not discuss the fees
they paid for affinity cards, or comment on those in the ``I Love
New York'' deal.
</P>
<P>
   But when South Orange, N.J., began sponsoring an affinity card a
few years ago, it received $5 for each new card in the first year
of the deal from Valley National Bank, said the village president,
William Calabrese. After the first year, South Orange's fee has
been 1 percent of sales on the card.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Giuliani administration considered sponsoring a New
York City affinity credit card, though it eventually decided not to
because it was concerned that people might think that the city was
the actual issuer of the card or was responsible for debt on it.
</P>
<P>
   But before the plan was canceled, several issuers had said they
would consider bidding for the card, said John Dyson, a senior
adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a healthy interest in it,'' Dyson said.

DRUG SCANDAL OVERSHADOWS TOUR DE FRANCE PROLOGUE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Whatever was troubling Chris Boardman
obviously cleared up overnight as he opened the 85th Tour de France
here Saturday with an easy victory in the short prologue through
the Irish capital. But it won't be as easy for the world's premier
cycling race to overcome news of a drug scandal involving one of
the top-rated teams, Festina of France.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boardman has also won the Tour's prologues in 1994 and
1997, he hadn't liked his chances in Dublin. ``I'm surprised,'' he
said moments before he donned the yellow jersey of the leader of
the three-week bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   For the previous two days, he had been complaining about his
lack of form, his ``depression'' and unspecified personal problems
that he said were interfering with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my best,'' the British leader of the Gan team from
France explained simply. ``And I was lucky with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   What a foreigner considered an intermittent sprinkle but what
the Irish regard as an integral part of the air, like oxygen, ended
early in the afternoon, a couple of hours before Boardman set off
in the 189-man field. The roads were mainly dry for his run of 6
minutes 12.36 seconds over the 5.6-kilometer (3.5-mile) course.
</P>
<P>
   That was four seconds better than Abraham Olano, a Spaniard with
the Banesto team who is regarded as much more of an overall
favorite in the Tour than Boardman. Olano is far stronger in the
many mountains that fill the race's course before it ends Aug. 2 in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Third, five seconds back, was Laurent Jalabert, the leader of
the ONCE team from Spain, the French national champion and the
world champion in the time trial, or individual race against the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, also five seconds behind in a splendid performance, was
Bobby Julich, an American with Cofidis from France. Julich, a
native of Glenwood Springs, Colo., and a resident of Philadelphia,
is a strong rider in long time trials, not usually prologues.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a fine climber who finished 17th over all in the last
Tour, his first, and said before his start Saturday that his sights
were set higher. ``Last year I didn't know what to expect and this
year I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials certainly did not expect the drug scandal that
broke Friday night. It was a major embarrassment, and Festina did
little to deflect attention Saturday by turning in the best team
performance, with three riders in the top 10. One of Festina's
unexpectedly strong performances came from unheralded Christophe
Moreau, who led for much of the race and finished fifth in 6:17.32.
He was competing while petitioning his positive test for steroid
use at a race in June.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the scandal were few: A masseur for the Festina
team, Willy Voet, was arrested late Wednesday night at the
French-Belgian border when his car was found to be carrying a large
quantity of such banned drugs as steroids and EPO, a chemical that
increases red blood corpuscles and thus provides more oxygen for
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Roussel, the directeur sportif, or coach, of the Festina
team insisted at a news conference this morning that the masseur
was not part of his crew at the Tour. ``Let the French police do
their work and find out what's going on,'' he said. ``We know
nothing about this. End of statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the race, was equally terse.
``It is a doping case,'' he said, ``but it's not directly connected
to a rider and not directly connected to this race. It happened
hundreds of kilometers from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing for calm, Leblanc said there was no question of
disqualifying the Festina riders or making any judgment until more
facts are known. That is unlikely to happen before the race reaches
France on Tuesday and Tour officials can confer with the police
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France administers drug checks on up to five riders,
including the leader and the day's winner, after each stage. The
Tour has not had an announced failure in this decade and has not
had a doping scandal since 1988, when Pedro Delgado, the eventual
winner, was charged but then cleared on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   Spot checks for high levels of red blood cells, and an
implication of the use of EPO, have been carried out before some
races for the last two years. Nearly a dozen riders were found
guilty and suspended for two weeks each last year and a half dozen
have been similarly penalized this season.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Festina team includes Richard Virenque, second over
all last year in the Tour and the king of the mountains the last
four years; Laurent Brochard, the reigning world road race
champion, and Alex Zulle, second over all in the 1995 Tour. &QL;

WHEN ITS RECORD IS 63-20, A TEAM CAN STAND PAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Yankees officials met for two long days
last week in the club's Tampa headquarters, reviewing every player
on their major league team, according to George Steinbrenner, the
principal owner. They also reviewed every minor leaguer who could
find his way into the majors by the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   But what they didn't spend a lot of time discussing,
Steinbrenner said, are players on other teams who could end up in
pinstripes by season's end. With a 63-20 record, the best in the
majors in 96 years, upgrades aren't paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look for ways to improve,'' said Steinbrenner,
``but when a team is this focused and performing this well, there
aren't a lot of changes to be made. We've just got to keep it
going; we haven't won anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Yankees will monitor the possible movement of several
players _ most notably Randy Johnson of the Seattle Mariners.
Executives around baseball believe Seattle will trade the
left-hander before the July 31 deadline, despite the fact that
general manager Woody Woodward is reportedly under orders not even
to field offers. Because Johnson is capable of pitching shutouts
and dominating in the postseason, some in the Yankees organization
are concerned he could swing the balance in a short series.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the Mariners traded Johnson to Cleveland _ the
team the Yankees may play in the first round of the playoffs _ the
Indians would be in a position to start Johnson in Games 1 and 5,
Bartolo Colon in Game 2, Jaret Wright in Game 3 and Charles Nagy in
Game 4. Cleveland would have the type of pitching to beat any team
in a short series, including the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   According to one American League executive, Seattle has interest
in several of the Yankees young players. Having decided that Russ
Davis isn't good enough defensively, the Mariners would like to
have Mike Lowell, the Yankees' third baseman at Class AAA Columbus;
Ramiro Mendoza could immediately be plugged into the Seattle
rotation, and Ryan Bradley is a dominant-type pitcher currently
throwing for the Yankees' Class A affiliate in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, is also checking
the market for late-inning relievers, pitchers who could serve in
set-up roles for Mariano Rivera. Cashman had discussions with
Cincinnati about Jeff Shaw before the right-hander was traded to
Los Angeles last week. But with their bullpen in relatively good
shape, it's unlikely the Yankees would give up a few top prospects
and overpay for anybody. A 63-20 record provides comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the Yankees have not lost since the third game of
their series at Shea Stadium; they are undefeated in the month of
July, with a 7-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's Excellence Continues
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd hadn't pitched in 17 days, because of the
effectiveness of the Yankees' starting pitching. ``It's tough to
get any work around here,'' he joked last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd got an opportunity Friday, replacing Irabu in the
sixth inning with runners at first and third and one out. Lloyd
retired the next two batters without permitting any runs to score;
he has allowed only two of 25 runners he has inherited to score,
and opposing batters are now 1-for-25 (.040) against him with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Irabu Saves His Spot
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, showered and dressed in street clothes, waited for
his teammates at the clubhouse door in the moments after the
Yankees beat Tampa Bay, 8-4, Friday night. When Joe Girardi, his
catcher, walked into view, Irabu wore the broad grin of a man
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi saw him. ``Thataboy,'' Girardi said enthusiastically,
patting Irabu on the chest. ``Thataboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu saved his spot in the rotation Friday with an adequate
performance of five and one-third innings that was enough to break
his month-long losing streak. ``Better,'' said Joe Torre, the
Yankees manager. ``He's not all the way back, but his velocity was
more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Torre did not rule out the possibility that Ramiro
Mendoza would replace Irabu in the rotation. After all, Irabu had
allowed eight home runs in 11 2/3 innings in his last three starts
before facing Tampa Bay Friday, and beyond that, he seemed unsure.
Torre seems convinced Irabu is healthy, but was concerned about the
diminished velocity of his fastball, and his growing reliance on
his secondary pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had a good fastball at times Friday night, though his
split-fingered fastball was entirely ineffective and he sometimes
had no command of his curveball; Irabu threw one that didn't stop
breaking, Girardi joked, until it bounced against the backstop, a
wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up seven hits, four walks and struck out five, needing
102 pitches. Inconsistent as he was, Irabu made the pitches he
needed to win. Rather than feeling the pressure of losing his spot
in the rotation, Irabu explained through his interpreter, George
Rose, ``I felt more pressure to keep the ball down and throw
strikes. That's the pressure I felt, as a major league pitcher.''

<P>
   Missie Hersey pushed through a half-dozen marathon swimmers
gathered at the Battery Park pier Saturday morning and called out
for a new friend she had met the night before, over heaping plates
of pasta, as they loaded up on high-energy carbohydrates before the
big race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's my best friend Duncan?'' said Ms. Hersey, a
50-year-old owner of a picture frame shop from Richmond, Va. She
then turned and hugged Duncan Adamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tight,'' Ms. Hersey said. ``But when we're in the water,
forget it, I'm out of here.`
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersey was one of 27 swimmers who slipped into the chilly
Hudson River Saturday for the city's 17th annual Manhattan Island
Marathon. The grueling, 28.5-mile course _ 2.3 miles longer than
the New York City Marathon _ circled the city counterclockwise, to
follow the currents, starting from Battery Park.
</P>
<P>
   For up to 10 hours, the swimmers kicked and drifted past New
York landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the U.N.
headquarters. They were swept along by the currents in the East
River, past Roosevelt Island, into the Harlem River and underneath
the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to experience New York City _ this is part of being
here,'' said Benn Kramer, a 41-year-old trailer park manager from
Hornby Island, British Columbia, near Vancouver, who was about to
swim in his 13th marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Each swimmer paid about $1,000 to enter and rent a boat for a
support crew. They underwent physical exams, including optional
hepatitis and tetanus shots, and proved their swimming fitness by
staying in 68-degree or colder water for at least four hours. The
winner received a silver bowl from Tiffany and Co., and others took
home plaques and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the swimmers, the rewards were less tangible _ a
challenge met, a promise kept, a dream fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping to finish,'' said Gerald Vance, 55, a school
bus driver from Westmont, N.J. ``It's an honor to be on level with
some of the great swimmers in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the 9 a.m. race, dozens of well-wishers crowded
the pier and clapped and cheered for the swimmers. A few passers-by
shook their heads in disbelief. Lila Ambar paused on her daily bike
ride to ask Ms. Hersey, ``Can you swim in that cold water?'' When
Ms. Hersey nodded, she said, ``I admire you, you have gumption.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few moments later, Ms. Ambar muttered, ``It's malarkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need their heads examined _ every one of them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersey grimaced at the remark. ``People who ask those
questions, they're never going to get it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hersey, the oldest woman to swim Saturday, had returned for
her second marathon around Manhattan; in her first, seven years
ago, she placed 20th in 8 hours, 11 minutes and 16 seconds. ``This
year, I figure I'll be first in my age group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she plunged into long-distance swimming on her 40th
birthday, when she swam 400 laps in a pool. She has entered 10
marathons since then. ``It's addictive,'' she said. ``You can't do
something this much, to this degree, unless you're ambitious and
compulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of the marathon was what attracted Adamson, 28, an
account executive for a software company in Wilton, Conn. Before
last year's marathon, the farthest he had swum was two miles.
``You're on a high for two months afterward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's race, Adamson kept track of nearby swimmers even
though he did not expect to win. ``You create little races within
the race,'' he said. ``You have to create your own place. You can't
just swim for eight hours because it's fun.''

   Meryem Tangoren, a 26-year-old industrial designer from the
Upper East Side, found another reason to swim. She raised $1,740 in
pledges from friends and family that she plans to donate to a city
swimming program and a charity for multiple sclerosis. Last year,
she ran alongside a deaf and mute man in the New York City Marathon
to help guide him through the course. Each year, she picks a
different event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important to do things for other people,''
she said. ``For some reason, I have an addiction for endurance
sports, and this combines both things.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m. the swimmers pulled on rubber gloves and slathered
Vaseline and lanolin on their bodies for added warmth in the
70-degree water and protection against skin chafing. ``Did I miss
any spots?'' asked Kramer, as he turned around for the third time.
Another swimmer smeared a glob on his back.
</P>
<P>
   A few swimmers recited their best race times down to the minute
and second. Others drifted away to prepare themselves mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so nervous,'' Ms. Hersey said. ``That's the worst part,
the waiting. When I did this before, everybody seemed bigger than
life. Now they're just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who was stretching his arms and legs, looked over the
other swimmers. ``That's the one thing about this,'' he said.
``Age, size, sex don't matter. Water is the great equalizer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., the swimmers pulled on their bright orange and pink
swim caps and lined up on the gangway. Ms. Hersey impulsively
hugged her new best friend, Duncan, and then laughed as they both
shook their Vaseline-greased arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye. Maybe, I'll see you next year _ maybe,'' she called
out. Then Ms. Hersey walked down the gangway and disappeared into
the Hudson River.

KENNELLY TALKS OPENLY ABOUT HER CAMPAIGN'S PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. _ Rep. Barbara Kennelly, the Democratic candidate
for governor of Connecticut, has startled supporters and opponents
alike by breaking a cardinal rule for surviving poor poll showings.
Instead of dismissing them, she has acknowledged bluntly that they
spell trouble, and she has agonized publicly about how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long summer,'' she told a group of
supporters during a recent road trip. ``Has it been rough? It's
been rough and tough.'' Later, when a caller to a statewide radio
program told her it was time to get moving on her campaign, she
asked: ``What would you suggest I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, 62, is challenging the one-term incumbent, John
Rowland, 41, a Republican who is the nation's youngest governor.
The governor's race will officially begin Monday, when Rowland
leads a caravan across the state on a four-stop tour to formally
announce his candidacy. On July 18, Mrs. Kennelly is to be
nominated at the Democratic State Convention. But Mrs. Kennelly is
already quick to acknowledge problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, financial reports revealed that Rowland had already
broken the state record for fund-raising for a gubernatorial
campaign, collecting $4.3 million, or more than twice as much as
Mrs. Kennelly had. During the last three months, normally a time to
hoard cash for television commercials in the fall, Mrs. Kennelly's
campaign just broke even.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, started
her race in a dead heat with Rowland. But recent polls showed
Rowland with a huge lead in a state where Democrats substantially
outnumber Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Connecticut poll taken from June 23-July 1
showed Rowland leading Mrs. Kennelly 55 percent to 27 percent. A
Quinnipiac College poll taken from June 16-22 put Rowland at 56
percent and Mrs. Kennelly at 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Munching calamari during a break in 14 hours of campaigning on
Tuesday, Mrs. Kennelly said that polls are more significant to
candidates than most let on. ``Everything runs off the polls,'' she
said. ``They drive media coverage, and they drive fund raising. The
cliche is that the election isn't held until November. But that
isn't modern politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Johnson, associate dean of the Graduate School of
Political Management at George Washington University in Washington,
said it was very unusual for a major candidate to offer such a
pessimistic public face. ``Voters don't want to hear a candidate
whine,'' he said. Johnson, who is completing a book about modern
campaign practices, said recent history is replete with examples of
candidates who have turned around 20- and 40-point deficits in the
polls. ``Voters like a leader who's tough and breaks through the
barriers,'' he said. ``You're not going to catch fire if you make
it sound like it's over.''
</P>

<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, a lifelong Hartford resident, is no political
novice. Her father, John M. Bailey, was the national Democratic
chairman under President Kennedy. Her late husband, James Kennelly,
was speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives. Her
brother, John Bailey, is the chief state's attorney. She was
elected to the Hartford City Council in 1975 and as the Connecticut
secretary of the state in 1978. She won a seat in Congress in 1982.
She continues to hold her seat in Congress, where she was so happy
working behind the scenes that she did not have a press secretary
for the first 13 of her 16 years on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Kennelly announced that Joseph Courtney, a
former state representative, had agreed to run as her choice for
lieutenant governor, after a string of better-known Democrats had
taken themselves out of the running. The announcement should have
generated political excitement. Instead, Mrs. Kennelly faced a
grilling when she stopped on Tuesday night here in Fairfield County
for the monthly meeting of Wilton's Democratic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Redman Becker, an architect and developer in Wilton, began
the question-and-answer session by saying, ``What I'm eager to hear
is what magic strategy you have to shake things up.'' Mrs. Kennelly
replied that she and Courtney ``love substance; we love policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult with the press to get attention in that
direction,'' she said. ``We're trying very, very hard. I wish I
could buy $1 million on New York City television right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. Kennelly said her candor was deliberate.
``I am not a politician's candidate,'' she said. ``What your
political pundits would say is my problem is I don't spin. What you
see is what you get. What you hear is what it's about. I'm probably
brutally honest, with myself and with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry P. Michael, the executive director of the Washington
Center for Politics and Journalism, a nonpartisan group, said Mrs.
Kennelly's candor could be effective. ``You can be unslick,'' he
said. ``Voters relate to that _ that's a good message. But you have
to communicate that as a strategic message.''

<P>
   On the surface, the New York centennial celebration seems hardly
plausible to a lapsed Midwesterner, who well remembers the
centennial of his small hometown almost five decades ago. (Many of
the men grew beards as a wildly exotic reminder of the lifestyle of
a century before.) New York, surely, was much older.
</P>
<P>
   And as Kurt Masur pointed out from the stage at the Centennial
Concert in Central Park on Friday evening, the New York
Philharmonic is 154, seemingly far older than the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   What was being celebrated, of course, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
explained from the same stage, was not the founding of the city,
which dates to the 17th century, but the formation of greater New
York, the consolidation of the five boroughs. In any case, it was
reason enough for a big concert and fireworks _ or so 25,000
revelers, the Parks Department estimates, seemed to think _ on a
cool and lovely evening on the beautifully restored Great Lawn of
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   There were actually three hourlong concerts _ by Skitch
Henderson and the New York Pops, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln
Center Jazz Orchestra, and Masur and the Philharmonic _ in a
program made long and disjunct by the half-hour intermissions
needed for elaborate stage resettings. The Philharmonic received
one of the loudest ovations of the night simply for tuning up _ an
indication that the last segment was finally at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the picnicking audience was largely attentive to the
music, especially, it seemed, during the Philharmonic segment,
which was devoted to music by Bernstein and Gershwin. And the
Philharmonic responded in kind, performing Bernstein's ``Candide''
Overture conductorless (its favorite party trick) and other works
under Masur's baton with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the music was, not surprisingly, all upbeat, few
consistent themes were to be found. The Pops, presenting Ernesto
Lecuona's ``Andalucia'' in a melting-pot potpourri, established a
Hispanic thread of sorts. That was carried through by the Jazz
Orchestra in Chico O'Farrill's ``Afro-Cuban Suite'' and the
Philharmonic in Bernstein's ``West Side Story'' Dances, though what
the O'Farrill composition brought to mind as much as anything was
Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' not represented here. In general,
the Jazz Orchestra's set was compelling, with Marsalis contributing
strongly on trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   The Pops paid its own tribute to Bernstein with music from ``On
the Town,'' and Bernstein's collaborators in that project, Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, were on hand to belt a few lines of its
big hit, ``New York, New York.'' Marsalis made a connection with
the Philharmonic, to be carried into the next concert season, when
he joined the orchestra and its excellent principal trumpeter,
Philip Smith, in jazzed-up versions of two Gershwin songs,
``Someone to Watch Over Me'' and ``Fascinatin' Rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard from a central location, all the music was reasonably well
served by the sound system of the Carlos Moseley Pavilion except
for some quiet passages from the Pops. In general, the Pops segment
was the least satisfying, partly because of insipid arrangements,
especially of tunes by George M. Cohan. But the orchestra's beery
rendition of ``Ach, du lieber Augustin'' carried one listener right
back to that old centennial in the Midwest.

FATAL CRASH OF DAY CAMP VAN UNDER INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa, NY) (js) 
By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN with MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The van that crashed Friday evening on a Pennsylvania
highway, killing two Brooklyn girls on their way home from a day
camp outing, was overcrowded, and few, if any, of its occupants
were wearing seat belts when the driver fell asleep and crashed,
camp counselors who were in the van and state troopers
investigating the accident said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, on Interstate 80 in Jackson Township, Pa., about
80 miles northwest of New York City, killed two 5-year-old girls
who had been crowded with 18 other children and four adults into a
van designed to carry only 15 people, the Pennsylvania State Police
said. Most of the occupants were asleep, and many were thrown from
the van when it crashed at about 5:25 p.m., witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp. in
Brooklyn, which operates the day camp that the children attended,
declined to identify the driver of the van but described him as a
23-year-old employee on the corporation's security and
transportation staff. The driver, who was not injured, had returned
home to Brooklyn, and, distressed by the accident, was placed under
heavy sedation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the van's passengers remained hospitalized in
Pennsylvania on Saturday, including a 5-year-old girl who was
breathing with the help of a respirator, said Donald Sutton, a
spokesman for the Restoration Corp. Hospital officials would not
disclose the condition of the other five who remained under care.
The remaining passengers were treated and released from
Pennsylvania hospitals and returned to Brooklyn Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One camp counselor, Patricia Parrish, 22, said that the adult
supervisors had given little consideration to the number of
children in the van and that it had not appeared to be overcrowded.
The van had contained the youngest campers on the trip, most
between the ages of 5 and 8, she said, while older campers had
ridden on a larger school bus that was not involved in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were small children _ they all fit,'' Ms. Parrish said in
an interview at Community Medical Center in Scranton, Pa., where
she was waiting to have surgery on her left hand, which was broken
in two places. ``Now I think there should have been less kids,''
she said, holding her daughter, Shaquasha Chambers, on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton declined to comment on the reports that the van had been
overcrowded and that the children had not worn seat belts, saying
he first wished to read a complete accident report by the
Pennsylvania State Police. He said the driver of the van had a long
affiliation with the Restoration Corp. and had attended the same
camp as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``As best we can see, he is an experienced driver,'' Sutton
said. ``He is under sedation. He is obviously very, very distressed
about what has happened.'' The driver, he said, had not been
charged ``with any infraction in Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   A state police dispatcher in Pennsylvania said the accident
remained under investigation and further information would not be
released until the investigation is completed. Officials would not
release the names of the dead girls pending further notification of
family members.

62 HOMERS? MAYBE. A .400 AVERAGE? FORGET IT. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer: ``That is a good question. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The question: Why in this offensive season are players
threatening to break the records for home runs and runs batted in
but no one is threatening to hit .400?
</P>
<P>
   That elusive batting average, which has withstood challenges
since 1941, appears to be safe for the 57th straight season. Mark
McGwire, the leading threat to the home run record, was the person
professing ignorance as to why, but no one else came up with a
sure-fire answer.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor offered the best observation, but it was not an
answer to the question. ``The bar is where Tony is,'' the Colorado
manager said, meaning Tony Gwynn, the National League's perennial
batting champion. ``Tony's my barometer. Where he is, that's where
everybody else has to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Gwynn is not challenging .400, no one is, and
Gwynn is not. He reached the All-Star Game break at .329, the
fourth-lowest average at the break in his 15 full seasons in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The highest average at last week's break was .353, and it
belonged to the Yankees' Bernie Williams, who has not played since
June 10. That is the lowest break-leading average since 1992, when
John Kruk's .346 was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, John Olerud was hitting .395 and Andres
Galarraga .391; the year after that, Gwynn and Frank Thomas reached
the All-Star Game each at .383. Last year, Gwynn was hitting .394,
Larry Walker .398. So what has happened this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew,'' Gwynn said. ``I think what you're seeing is
maybe that pitching is a little bit better than they're getting
credit for. The pitchers are doing a pretty good job on the
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy for the San Diego slasher to say that, but pitchers
have not stopped McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa from
hitting home runs, or Juan Gonzalez from driving in runs. Why have
they stopped Gwynn from hitting 70 points higher?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't been consistent,'' he said, shunning injuries
as a reason. ``If I was consistent with my approach, I think I
could be hitting 20 points higher than I am. But still, that's not
going to allow you to hit .400. I've been there before and still
fell short. It just hasn't happened this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, en route to his fourth successive NL batting title
and his eighth overall, Gwynn reached .402 on July 14, six days
after the All-Star Game, but slowly slipped backward and finished
at .372, a figure eclipsed in his career only by his .394 average
in the strike-shortened 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly felt this is my best crack at it,'' Gwynn recalled.
``Even when I was hitting .380, I thought if I could stay around
.380 and get hot the last month, I still could do it. It didn't
happen, but it convinced me you can't have any ruts. You got to be
solid the whole six months.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 38-year-old Gwynn to finish at .400 this season, he
would have to hit .488 after the break. So much for that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it at the beginning,'' said Gwynn, whose career
average after the break is .336, compared with .343 before.
``You've got to come out of the chute firing and be consistent,
because if you're not, when you get to where we are now, you're not
going to make up 60 points in two months with all these at-bats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gwynn said he believes he remains capable of challenging the
.400 barrier and mentioned Walker as another candidate based on his
performance last season. The Rockies' star hit .400 through the
first three months of the season and did not slip below it for good
until July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what has happened this season _ he was hitting .331 at the
break _ Walker said, ``I woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fluke,'' he said of his final .366 average. ``I'm not
a .360 hitter, a .370 hitter or a .380 hitter by any means. I'm not
over .300 for my career. You have years where you say that was his
year. That's how it worked out for me last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been playing with an elbow that is not completely
healed following surgery. If it were sound, might he have
threatened .400? ``I guess it would be a possibility,'' he said.
``With a bum elbow, I'm hitting .330 now, so with a good elbow,
whether my average would stay there or go higher or lower, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others who were asked about the disappearance of the .400
threat suggested that players have become more infatuated than ever
with home runs. ``Big home run hitters are being paid a lot of
money,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said, ``and I think a lot
of people are concentrating on homers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles said the number of new pitchers
could be a factor. ``I see a guy for the first time, and it takes
me two at-bats to get adjusted to him,'' he said. ``I might hit one
home run that day or two home runs. But you're not going to have
four hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, the Hall of Famer, said there was no connection
between home runs and runs batted in on one hand and a high batting
average on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four hundred is a very special number,'' he said, ``and it
takes an awfully consistent hitter to even approach .400 even for
the first half of the season. No one this season has been that
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, who does not have to pitch to Gwynn because they
play for the same team, is thankful that the .400 mark, at least,
appears safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many records can you expect to fall at any one time?'' he
said. ``Our plates are full enough without having that to worry
about, too.''

ABIOLA AUTOPSY IN NIGERIA INDICATES HEART ATTACK 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ American and other Western doctors who
completed an autopsy on the body of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the
Nigerian opposition leader who died in detention Tuesday, said
Saturday that they had found no evidence of poisoning and had
concluded that his death was caused by heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary findings, anxiously awaited by an angry and
troubled nation, showed that ``there was severe longstanding
disease of the heart of a type and severity that can cause
unexpected death,'' said James G. Young, the chief coroner of the
province of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The results, confirming the official account of Abiola's death
given by the Nigerian military government, seemed unlikely to
assuage the many Nigerians who have reacted with fury to the
unexpected death of the opposition leader on the eve of his
promised release by the recently installed military ruler, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who headed a five-man team including two American doctors
and an American technician, said after a detailed examination of
the body, including the abdomen, chest and brain, and conversations
with witnesses present at the time of death, ``We believe that
poisoning is extremely unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that for the sake of complete certainty
toxicological examinations of samples taken from the corpse would
be performed at the Center of Forensic Science in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue samples will also undergo microscopic examination in
London and a final report will be issued in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's irrelevant,'' Kola Abiola, the opposition
leader's son, said of the autopsy report. ``You don't have to
poison a man, you don't have to spike his tea, to kill him. My
father was locked up for four years without proper medical
treatment, and that is what leads to death. We know who is
responsible for locking him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kola Abiola presided at the tumultuous burial of Abiola in the
front yard of his large house in Lagos on Saturday. Women sobbed
and men wailed as the body, swaddled in white cloth, was laid to
rest in the red earth just eight hours after the completion of the
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Military police, carrying automatic weapons, were heavily
deployed outside Abiola's house, but no violent incidents were
reported. After several days of rioting, Lagos appeared calmer.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola incarnated Nigeria's long-frustrated hopes for democracy,
a rare state of political affairs since Africa's most populous
nation gained independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   As he appeared poised to emerge victorious in a 1993
presidential election, the poll was annulled by the country's
military ruler and, a year later Abiola was thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   His death, just as it seemed he would be freed, has left many
Nigerians with a sense of deep frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who arrived here Friday, said: ``There was longstanding
disease of the heart of a type and severity that can cause
unexpected death. The disease was of two types.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was severe narrowing of the main coronary arteries by
fatty plaques. In addition, there was very significant enlargement
of the heart due to longstanding hypertension.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: VAUGHN UNFAZED BY YANKEE REJECTION; EL DUQUE VS.

<P>
   The Yankees traded for Greg Vaughn a year ago, then killed the
deal because they said a physical the outfielder took for them
revealed a tear in his right rotator cuff. This season, that
shoulder has contributed to 30 home runs and 74 runs batted in for
San Diego, both more than any healthy Yankee has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn shrugged when asked about the Yankees' rejection of him
and his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a picture of it, did some tests,'' he said. ``I've
had four surgeries on my right one. It's not going to look like my
left one. It was a situation where they were making an investment
and they felt they wouldn't get the money back on their
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who at the time was in the first year of a three-year,
$15 million contract, said he thought nothing of the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything else that happened to me last year, that was
just something else,'' he said. ``I went home, took a few days off,
came back, worked hard and tried to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he have liked to play for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from California, growing up there, the Giants and the
A's were my favorite teams,'' he said. ``The Yankees are right
there with the A's as my American League favorites. I'd have loved
to play in New York, but it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the guy upstairs'' _ he didn't mean George
Steinbrenner _ ``has a reason for everything, and everything has a
tendency to work out. It's just a situation where you might not
understand why it happened, but it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A Nickname to Remember
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay and Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees
will not oppose each other in their teams' series in St.
Petersburg, Fla., this weekend. The rookie pitchers, however, have
encountered each other before _ in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they have playoffs, it was between him and El
Duque,'' said Luis Isaac, a Cleveland coach, acting as interpreter
for Arrojo at the All-Star Game. ``One time he got him, another
time El Duque got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, however, seemed to lack something. Why, he was asked,
doesn't he have a snazzy nickname like El Duque? But he did have a
name, Arrojo responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called him Typhoon,'' Isaac said after listening to
Arrojo recall an element of his baseball life in Cuba. ``Nobody
knows that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo took a 10-5 record into the game against the Yankees
Saturday night. He has pitched impressively enough to earn back his
Cuban name. Coming in September, maybe, the next time the teams
play: El Duque vs. Typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Name to Remember
</P>
<P>
   First came Felipe Alou, then brother Matty, then their brother
Jesus. Next was Moises, Felipe's son, now a Houston outfielder.
Still, the Alou well has not run dry. The Kansas City Royals
recently signed another son of the Montreal manager, outfielder
Felipe Jr., their 42nd-round pick in last month's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: Luis Alou. ``Remember that name,'' Moises said of ``my
little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis, a third baseman, is a 16-year-old high school sophomore, 6
feet 2 inches and 200 pounds. ``Twenty scouts are after him,''
Moises said. ``General managers call my dad. My dad wants him to
graduate from high school, and then he's going to see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, remember that name.

KANSAS RED WHEAT HARVEST EXPECTED TO BE ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ This year's Kansas hard red winter wheat harvest is
expected to be the second-largest ever, thanks to favorable weather
late in the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department on Friday estimated the Kansas crop
at 494.9 million bushels, compared with last year's record 506
million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   The current projection was based on July 1 conditions and is up
sharply from the June 1 estimate of 393.9 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the top producer of hard red winter wheat, which is
used for making bread and similar products, such as hamburger buns.
Texas and Oklahoma also are big producers. Hard red winter wheat is
planted in the fall and harvested in the summer and is a leading
U.S. export.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Hand, an agricultural statistician for the Kansas
Department of Agriculture, said early projections for this year's
crop were conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are naturally pessimistic anyway, but even our surveys
were coming out low,'' Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, farmers planted fewer acres to the crop this year
at 10.7 million, compared with last year's 11.4 million. Farmers
actually harvested 11 million acres of wheat a year ago and are
expected to have harvested 10.1 million acres this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hand said this year's early projections for the crop also were
affected by cold weather in March that included blizzard
conditions. In May, tens of thousands of acres were damaged by
heavy winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   But the crop fared well as the harvest approached, helped by hot
and dry weather that allowed wheat to ripen earlier than normal and
the harvest to start early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned around and here we are,'' Hand said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, wheat farmers are expected to harvest 1.9 billion
bushels of all classes of winter wheat this year, up from the
previous estimate of 1.71 billion bushels, but down slightly from
last year's 1.94 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
   Production of all classes of U.S. wheat this year is estimated
at 2.52 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, early projections for the U.S. corn crop this year
call for 9.6 billion bushels to be harvested. The soybean crop was
projected at 2.8 billion bushels.

KANSANS FAVOR GRAVES FOR RE-ELECTION, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ Gov. Bill Graves has a commanding lead over his
Republican primary challenger, former GOP state Chairman David
Miller, a statewide poll of likely voters shows.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted for /{The Kansas City Star/} and released
Friday, also indicated that in the general election, the governor
would have no trouble defeating the likely Democratic candidate,
state Rep. Tom Sawyer of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Based on responses from 638 likely Republican primary voters,
the poll showed Graves winning 66 percent of the GOP vote, compared
to 22 percent for Miller, an insurance agent from Eudora. The
remaining 12 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results from all voters, Republican and Democrat, showed
Graves would defeat Sawyer, the House Democratic leader, 67 percent
to 16 percent in the general election, with 17 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bill Graves is a strong favorite to win his
Republican primary race and appears to be in great position to win
re-election in Kansas,'' the polling firm said in its analysis of
the data.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 804 registered Kansas voters from all parts of the
state was conducted by telephone from July 6 through July 8. For
questions relating to the Aug. 4 Republican primary election, 638
likely Republican primary voters were sampled.
</P>
<P>
   Mason-Dixon Political//Media Research of Columbia, Md.,
conducted the poll for /{The Kansas City Star/}. It carries a 3.5
percent margin of error for the sample of all Kansans; the margin
of error was 4 percent for the Republican sample. The margins were
different because the samples were different.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, all of whom recognized Graves' name, 71
percent said they had a favorable opinion of Graves, a high rating
for any candidate. Only 12 percent said their opinion was
unfavorable and 17 percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, only 18 percent had a favorable opinion of
Miller and 9 percent had an unfavorable opinion. Of those polled,
32 percent didn't recognize his name at all, and of those who did,
41 percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like further evidence that voters in this primary
prefer a tax cutter to a tax increaser,'' said Mike Matson, a
spokesman for the Graves campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Graves' first term, taxes were cut in each of the four years.
He has also promised to eliminate property taxes on cars and small
trucks. Miller plans to outline his proposal for cutting taxes next
week.
</P>
<P>
   At the Miller headquarters, spokesman Eldon Girdner predicted
that Miller will gather momentum as the campaign progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has bold ideas that are the traditional Republican
plan,'' he said. ``I think they will see that Bill Graves supports
the traditional Democratic plan on many issues that are important
to Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said name recognition is always a problem for challengers,
but he predicted voters will tune in to the campaign as election
day approaches and begin comparing the records of the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about taxes, and we believe firmly in a
plan that true Republicans support,'' Girdner said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters said taxes and government spending is the top issue
among all voters. Nearly a fourth of them said that issue would be
most important when they went to the polls. Education ranked second
with 20 percent, followed by the economy and jobs at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moral decay and moral issues placed fourth among the issues at
13 percent. Abortion, at 4 percent, was eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Miller's campaign focuses on moral decay of society and
his promises to focus on its repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Graves has a strong record of service to the people
of Kansas on each of these issues and I think that's reflected in
this poll,'' Matson said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in June, /{The Wichita Eagle/} published a poll it
conducted that also showed Graves far outdistancing Miller. In that
survey, Graves had 66.4 percent to Miller's 15.2 percent, with the
remainder undecided or refusing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mason-Dixon poll showed that Graves was known by 99 percent
of all Kansas voters, and 66 percent of them regarded him
favorably. Only 15 percent had an unfavorable opinion, and 18
percent knew his name but had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, 11 percent had a favorable opinion of Miller
and 5 percent viewed him unfavorably. Half of the voters didn't
recognize his name. Of those who recognized it, 34 percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since his election as governor four years ago, Graves'
favorable name recognition has increased 20 points, from 46 percent
to 66 percent,'' pollsters said in their analysis of the data.
</P>
<P>
   While likely voters were being polled, Graves' TV ads were being
broadcast in most parts of the state. Miller's television ads
didn't start until Tuesday, the second day of the polling, and were
broadcast only in selected western Kansas markets.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also asked Kansans how they would vote on a
Sawyer-Miller matchup in November. Such a race would be a tossup,
with Sawyer ahead of Miller, 35 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ali, a Mason-Dixon pollster, said one could conclude that
Miller is ``too extreme'' in the minds of voters because they
appear to prefer Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was this huge conservative tide, not only would
Miller be competitive with Graves, but he ought to be trouncing
Sawyer,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the governor's race, the poll also tested some of the
other statewide races and found:
</P>
<P>
   Republican U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback would win re-election over
Democratic state Sen. Paul Feleciano, 56 percent to 26 percent,
with 18 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Attorney General Carla Stovall, also seeking
re-election, would defeat Democrat Dan Lykins, 62 percent to 12
percent, with 26 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for state treasurer, Republican House Speaker Tim
Shallenburger had a 10-point lead over the Democrat, Shawnee County
Treasurer Rita Cline, 36 percent to 26 percent, with 38 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Insurance Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius would have
little trouble defeating either of the Republican candidates. In
the matchup with Republican Dan Martinez, she had 48 percent to his
26 percent, with 26 percent undecided. Against Bryan Riley, she
also had 48 percent. He had 25 percent and 27 percent were
undecided.

KANSAS COURT UPHOLDS SPEEDWAY LEGAL PROVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER and STEVE NICELY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The Kansas Supreme Court on Friday wiped away the
biggest legal challenge to an automotive speedway in western
Wyandotte County, effectively clearing the way for construction of
Kansas International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Voting unanimously in Topeka, Kan., the high court upheld the
constitutionality of all legal provisions covering track
development.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in a ``friendly'' challenge that Wyandotte
County District Attorney Nick Tomasic had filed in an effort to
resolve the issues quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court's ruling gives us the momentum we need to
proceed and complete the project,'' Mayor Carol Marinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic's lawsuit encompassed all the legal points at issue in
other lawsuits filed by property owners resisting the forced sale
of their homes. Tomasic said Friday's ruling rendered those issues
moot.
</P>
<P>
   One key issue is whether the Unified Government of Wyandotte
County and Kansas City, Kan., can use condemnation powers to obtain
private property to be used by a private company. Another is
whether the Kansas Legislature's decision to reimburse displaced
homeowners at the rate of 125 percent of fair market value, instead
of 100 percent, is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, powers of eminent domain can be used, and the
25 percent premium is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Borich, a lawyer representing the owners of about 30 parcels
who oppose the development plan, said he planned to meet with his
clients to discuss asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Grant Lynch, president of Kansas International
Speedway Corp., the developer, said the ruling ``should remove any
doubt about the project moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have 78 contracts with property owners,'' Lynch said.
``Many of the property owners have been extremely patient while
their lives have been put on hold waiting for this decision. The
ruling resolves the pending legal issues, and now we can move
forward with closing on those contracts as well as take other
acquisition options in order to stay on track for racing in
Wyandotte County in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 families live in the 1,200-acre tract northwest of
Interstates 70 and 435.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the 1.5-mile oval speedway, designed for
NASCAR races, is to have 75,000 seats and cost $208 million. The
second phase, to be built when the market warrants, would double
the seating capacity and cost an additional $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase includes, among other things, $71.7 million in
Tax Increment Financing revenue bonds; $23.2 million in STAR bonds
that would be paid off by sales taxes from the project; $58.8
million in ``cash equity commitment'' from the developer; and $33
million in state highway funds.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hays, Unified Government administrator, said he expected
financing to be in place by early August. Closing on land
acquisition contracts already executed will begin immediately
thereafter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the city-county Unified Board of Commissioners is
expected to consider an ordinance authorizing the use of
condemnation, where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Offer letters will be sent to property owners who have not yet
entered contracts on their property, Hays said. Condemnation
proceedings will be filed to acquire property that cannot be
obtained any other way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at least one resident who has been fighting the plan,
Virginia Miller, seemed resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just ready to get on with the rest of my life,'' she said.
``I can't do anything else except turn it loose and go.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Howard Miller, have lived in a home near
110th Street and Interstate 70 for 52 years. They have not agreed
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal also will continue for Eric Vaught's extended family,
who live in three homes on 80 acres homesteaded by his ancestors
about a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the city and the state both want (the speedway)
and no matter what it takes, they're going to make it go through,''
Vaught said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaughts have not reached an agreement to sell their
property.
</P>
<P>
   Although disappointed with most of Kansas court's rulings,
Borich said he was pleased that the court upheld the 25 percent
premium, which he supported on behalf of all property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing; it really helps everyone who hasn't
settled,'' Borich said.
</P>
<P>
   Borich said that getting the U.S. Supreme Court to accept the
case was ``a long shot, unless there is an issue of national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But a government taking private property and transferring it
to another private owner for a racetrack to promote tourism is
something that might be of interest to the court,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the track could proceed, even if the U.S. Supreme
Court accepted the case, Borich said.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's 41-page opinion, written by Justice Bob Abbott, the
court upheld the constitutionality of the Tax Increment Financing
plan approved for the track, as well as the agreement between the
developer and the Unified Government.
</P>
<P>
   The court held, among other things, that including a motor
speedway in the definition of a ``major tourism area'' was
appropriate. That designation is a prerequisite for issuing TIF
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The court also held that it was legal to repay the bonds over 30
years, instead of the customary 20 years. The Kansas Legislature
approved that change, along with the 125 percent reimbursement,
earlier this year.

HISTORY TELLS US HIGH CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ISN'T NECESSARILY GOOD
NEWS

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You can't imagine how frightening it was to
learn that consumer confidence hit a 29-year high last month. Whew!
Talk about a terrifying development.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? Historically high consumer confidence is bad news?
If this puzzles you, it's time for a history lesson. Just because
the animal spirits of consumers are at their most salubrious since
1969, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Not for the stock
market. Not for the bond market. And not for the economy. At least
it shouldn't seem so if you're old enough to remember what the
economic future held for Americans about this time 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   June 1969, you see, was a time when it seemed things just
couldn't get any better. And, sure enough, they didn't. In fact,
although most Americans were as happy as pigs in slop, the country
was about to enter the most dismal decade of the postwar period.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s had been a gangbusters time for the stock market, and
in 1969 the Dow Jones industrial average topped out at 969 on May
14. Just as the magic 1,000 plateau seemed attainable, though,
things turned nasty. The stock market plunged, and by year's end
the Dow was at 800. On May 26, 1970, the blue-chip indicator
bottomed out at 631, which represented a 35 percent loss in a
little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The market began to recover, but it was slow going. The Dow
didn't regain its May 1969 level until late 1972. It subsequently
did breach 1,000 and hit 1,052 in January 1973, but it would be
nearly 10 years before it got that high again.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were marked by stock market wallows, hyperinflation,
political crises, stratospheric interest rates, economic blahs,
energy shortages and frequent fits of national malaise.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1982, signs of recovery had emerged, and the Dow
Jones industrial average closed the year at 1,047. This was only 8
percent higher than the 1969 peak. Inflation, meanwhile, had sent
the Consumer Price Index soaring 165 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of the differences between 1969-1982 and
1983-1997, here are some numbers beyond what happened to the Dow
Jones industrial average: Gross domestic product rose about $2
trillion, to $3 trillion, between 1969 and 1982. Since 1983,
however, it has expanded $5 trillion, to about $8 trillion.
Meantime, job growth from 1969 to 1982 was only about half the rate
of the 1983-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Given the euphoria that marked the '60s, anybody daring enough
to predict in '69 that a 13-year period of stagnation and woe was
just ahead would have had his prognosticator's license revoked.
Nevertheless, that's what happened. You can look it up, as Casey
Stengel liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean history is about to repeat itself? Nobody knows,
but this walk down memory lane isn't meant to imply that 1998 is
1969. Rather, the purpose of reviewing economic history is to
remind anyone interested that nothing is dead-solid perfect, even
though it has tended to seem so for just about the entire decade of
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Being cautious isn't fashionable these days, which explains why
the surge in consumer confidence is perceived as good news. It
tends to validate the view that happy consumers mean more happy
times ahead. As the dreadful years from mid-1969 to late 1982
remind us, however, it doesn't always happen that way.

CHASING SANBORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Sanborn still plays alto saxophone his
way. Considering what he has to deal with, that's no small
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's just about impossible to tune into ``smooth jazz'' radio
without hearing some guy wailing away in shameless debt to Sanborn,
whose sound on the horn is arguably the most influential since
Charlie Parker drew his own slew of imitators a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the stupefying smooth groove and
Sanborn's hefty blend of R&AMP;B, funk and blues should be obvious when
he performs July 18 at the Kansas City Blues &AMP; Jazz Festival _ if
only in the invigorating and innovative variety of his sound.
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn, who grew up in St. Louis, credits blues- and
R&AMP;B-influenced jazz saxophonists with sparking his interest in
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the music that got me excited,'' he said the other
day from New York. ``I always related to the more overtly
blues-based players, people like Jackie McLean and Hank Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   The blues, however, turned out to be just the beginning. Where
most of his imitators rely on formula, Sanborn, 52, is a musical
searcher. He has worked not only with a wide range of rock and pop
artists _ in the 1970s and '80s, he was the alto saxophonist of
choice for session work _ but with jazz musicians from the
straight-ahead to the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   All in the interest of keeping his own music fresh and
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever rule anything out,'' he said. ``I'm not really,
in the strictest sense, a jazz player. But I try to do things that
are challenging for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy came through most memorably on ``Another Hand,''
a 1991 album with an acoustic emphasis that featured such jazz
luminaries as bassist Charlie Haden, guitarist Bill Frisell and
pianist Mulgrew Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn said he relished the context _ largely straight-ahead
jazz _ which he compared to a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing is, you have a certain set of ground rules.
But you're adapting to an ever-changing situation, and you're
reacting to the other people around you. You use your reflexes and
your knowledge to, in a way, transcend yourself and the game and
the music. And I think that when you do that, that experience is
indescribable.''
</P>
<P>
   In musical terms, ``Another Hand'' was radically different than
Sanborn's electrified pop-jazz albums _ such as his most recent
album, ``Songs From the Night Before'' (1996). But those
bread-and-butter projects are, in their own way, just as ambitious,
combining smart production values with inspired playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fusion albums are superior fusion records,'' said Carl
Woideck, a saxophonist and author of Charlie Parker: His Music and
Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they're what fusion should be: A mix of modern
technology, beautiful melodies and good hooks, with really
interesting chord progressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the raspy, urgent sound of Sanborn himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can play alto saxophone without having to
deal with David Sanborn,'' said Marcus Miller, a bassist who has
produced and performed on several Sanborn albums. ``Even if you
don't want to go that way, it's something that you have to avoid.
He's definitely a presence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long and illustrious road for Sanborn, who
accompanied blues stars Albert King and Little Walter while still
only a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   After studying music at Northwestern University and at the
University of Iowa, he landed his first professional job, playing
and recording with the Chicago-based Paul Butterfield Blues Band
from 1967 to 1971. In 1973 he began a long association with the
late jazz arranger Gil Evans, performing on the albums ``Svengali''
and ``Priestess.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Sanborn has demonstrated not only
exemplary musical taste, working as sideman to both Stevie Wonder
and David Bowie, but an interest in pushing the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I operate more out of an R&AMP;B rhythmic base, I also
try to incorporate elements of jazz and of other music as well,''
he said. ``Jazz musicians are being influenced by many kinds of
music outside the idiom of jazz, and there's so much music going on
that people are just not being exposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sanborn's view, commercial radio is at least partly to blame
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a lot of the music that falls in the cracks,''
he said. ``And I think that ultimately has a very negative
influence on the audience, and on music in general. It certainly
doesn't reflect the way most musicians think.''
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of this unheard music, Sanborn occasionally lends his
support to projects outside the commercial mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1990, he was host of ``Night Music,'' a syndicated
TV series on which musicians from different genres performed
together. More recently, he performed on ``Diminutive Mysteries,''
a 1993 album by avant-garde saxophonist Tim Berne. The album
focused on compositions by the late saxophonist Julius Hemphill,
whom Sanborn had met years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemphill and I played together a lot in St. Louis,'' Sanborn
said. ``He was very instrumental in the forming of my opinions
about music, and I'd always been a big fan of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn brought a vivid imagination and formidable skill to the
project, Berne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to me that it wasn't just a case of, `Hey,
let's use this famous saxophone player.' He really knew his music,
and was genuinely interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The abstract, difficult compositions on ``Diminutive Mysteries''
offer convincing evidence of Sanborn's willingness to try out new
things. But he may not be getting adequate respect for playing the
music he's best-known for, Berne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really believes in what he's playing, and I think that's
what makes the difference. That's what makes him convincing, or
Hank Crawford, or Grover Washington. It's not just, `OK, I'm going
to sell some records, I'll play like this.' That's really how they
hear it. That's their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Sanborn has enjoyed considerable success by playing music
his way. His only qualm is that people who have heard him only on
smooth-jazz radio may not have the right idea about his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, the smooth-jazz format will find one small slice
of what it is that I do, and play that,'' he said. ``So when people
come to hear me play, they may be surprised or disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may want to hear what they heard on the radio, and not
the other stuff. Or maybe there are people who would like to hear
the other stuff but are not aware that I'm playing the other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times it's frustrating. But whose life isn't?''

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE OF THE RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From all family accounts, Jeremy Scott was barely past baby
steps when he put his foot down on the subject of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to have a part in the decision about his training
pants,'' says his mother, Sandra Scott, of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   He was such a label-conscious toddler that only Carter's brand
would do. At 8, he chose a red satin jacket off the Kmart racks in
Kansas City and wore it until it was in shreds, his sister Barbara
Scott recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And in his junior year at Hickman Mills High School, he made the
clothes he and his date wore to the prom.
</P>
<P>
   Now 24, he is no less obsessed. Settled into an atelier in the
center of Paris, Scott is designing avant-garde clothing.
</P>
<P>
   He is dressing the Icelandic singer Bjork and attracting fashion
notables such as Anna Wintour, the American Vogue editor, to his
runway shows. He has the social support of Parisian fashion maven
Isabella Blow, previously associated with English designer
Alexander McQueen. He was twice named young designer of the year by
a French fashion organization.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important, he is getting a startling amount of
press. In the last year he has been in such publications as The New
Yorker magazine, The International Herald Tribune newspaper, Vogue,
the British magazine Frank and The Atlanta Journal and
Constitution. People magazine is reported to be planning a piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had so many calls from the international press
about one person. Never,'' says Nicole Fischelis, the New
York-based fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue stores. The
retailer bought pieces from Scott's spring '98 collection, a
whimsical monochromatic white group based on a T-shirt theme.
</P>
<P>
   He has attracted attention in part because he is pushing all the
traditional boundaries of form and design and also because he is
energized and determined. He is unconventional in an arena that
values the offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clothes have never been done before,'' he says in a
telephone interview from Paris. ``I'm doing new volumes. New
silhouettes.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Americans and the English are boosting the
re-emergence of Paris as a creative force, Scott may be in the
right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Nurturing family
</P>
<P>
   His talent, he says, was nurtured by his early family life in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was a woman of the farm,'' he says. ``She made
things. She was always sewing and painting. That's part of where my
thrift-shop bent comes from. It was a natural thing to change
things into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother says he is much like his grandmother and his father,
a civil engineer, in many ways. He has their tenacity and fortitude
to focus on a project and follow through to completion.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Midwest, far from the major cosmopolitan
cities, Scott had only his imagination to fill his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision was so extreme,'' he recalls. ``I was living through
magazines, thinking of Paris and New York, thinking of women
walking on the streets far more done than they really are ...
taking things and modifying them.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he made up his mind to go to Paris. He started going to
night school at Rockhurst High and the University of
Missouri-Kansas City to study French and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished high school, to the dismay of his mother, he
announced he was going to New York to study at the Pratt School of
Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to encourage him to do something with the languages,''
says his mother, who teaches children with learning disabilities.
``I think you tend to want your kids to do something you're safe
and familiar with. I didn't think it was very practical, but I was
not able to dissuade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after he finished Pratt, he decided on a date,
Sept. 18, and bought an airline ticket. Once in Paris, he set about
looking for an apartment and a place to have a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year later he opened his first collection at the
Bastille. Made mostly from paper and embellished with beading, the
clothing was inspired by plastic surgery, car accidents and a
French artist doing performance art with her own body, or what
Scott calls ``kind of a tragic glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the idea of it being very fragile ...'' he says. ``I
was taken with the instant, that moment and that you could rip it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to do an all-black show, followed by the much
acclaimed white group. ``It was the idea of coming out of the
darkness. It was clean and modern,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Saks' Fischelis remembers the T-shirt show last fall as ``kind
of magical. It had very good energy. I was impressed with the
whimsy and the charm.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, dressed in her own black dress, was in the audience
that day, and for the first time she realized the magnitude of her
son's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk every week, often. I just talked to him a few minutes
ago,'' she says. ``But when I was seated at the show, met people
who were there, saw the camera crews, saw the security to keep
people from mobbing him, I thought, `Oh, my gosh. I had no idea.' I
kept thinking I should give up my seat so some of the people
standing could be seated.''
</P>
<P>
   In March his fall show primarily involved gold leathers, lame
and furs. He toyed with asymmetry, raising one shoulder high above
the other and adding abundant padding. He was inspired, he says, by
Russia's rebirth ``in elegance and glamour'' and by a French doll.
</P>
<P>
   This time the reviews were mixed, some very negative. But Scott
is somewhat reconciled to the inevitable criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' he says. ``It's a process of time ... It's going to
take some people some time (to understand).''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls how, in the 1940s, Christian Dior changed the fashion
silhouette. Scott is comforted by the praise of Vogue's Wintour and
the support of Bjork.
</P>
<P>
   He believes adamantly that people are in need of something new
and that ``established fashion is no longer valued.'' The end of
the century, he says, is triggering the creative forces of the
avant-garde. ``Paris is buzzing with the millennium. Everyone is
excited by it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now he is convinced he is on target. Sales have doubled,
moving beyond Parisian boutiques to stores in Hong Kong, Japan and
an East Village boutique called Horn in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And the future remains promising. Late last year he flew to
Milan to meet with Donatella Versace about the possibility of a job
with the house of Versace. He has been mentioned in connection with
job openings at other houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a talent,'' says Saks' Fischelis. ``They have to be
watched, looked at. We have to show them we're interested. That is
our role. He is so individualistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Scott's greatest joy, he says, is ``pleasing my mom in
the front row.''

   Not your uncle's tattoo
</P>
<P>
   The lacy delicate body marking has been seen on celebrities
including Demi Moore, Madonna, Naomi Campbell, Liv Tyler and Drew
Barrymore. Never mind that mehndi art (or henna painting) has been
part of rituals in India, Africa and the Middle East for thousands
of years. It's been a fashion trend across the United States the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise to find how-to books such as Mehndi: The
Art of Henna Body Painting (Three Rivers Press, $11) by Carine
Fabius. A native of Haiti, Fabius is a co-owner with her husband of
a Los Angeles art gallery and mehndi studio. She received so many
requests for information, she writes, she was driven to produce the
book that offers a history of the art and facts such as: In India,
widows are forbidden from wearing henna because they are never
supposed to have fun again.
</P>
<P>
   Henna, which grows on bush or shrub with bright green leaves, is
seen in some cultures as a lucky charm, with the power to protect
and ward off evil spirits. Fabius says it's magical. The high
interest now comes at a time when tattooing and body piercing among
the cutting edgers are getting, well, old. And in the fashion
arena, austere minimalism is being nudged aside by more elaborate,
decorative embellishment.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius provides a recipe for the paste using powdered and sifted
henna, black tea and eucalyptus oil. Once the design is applied and
dried, the paste should be left on 12 to 20 hours during which time
you apply powdered sugar and lemon and stay warm in the sun (easy
enough about now) or by drinking hot tea. She also adds
illustrations to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The book is available at major book stores, or by calling (800)
793-BOOK (2665) or through the Web site, www.randomhouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Frame-up
</P>
<P>
   On the magazine watch: GQ says the dark-top, clear-bottom
eyeglass frames in Chuck Close's giant-sized nerdlike portrait,
``Keith,'' have become the guy frames to have.
</P>
<P>
   The acrylic-on-canvas painting was on display recently at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, and now Calvin Klein, Tommy
Hilfiger, Yves Saint Laurent and Ray-Ban are marketing the frames.
Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Seventeen magazine says Sarah McLachlan is launching
her own catalog. You can buy T-shirts, a hemp backpack, the
singer's jewelry designs and sunglasses as well as CDs. To order a
catalog, call (800) 764-3472.
</P>
<P>
   Say bye to same-old ... Are clothing consumers bored with the
classics and craving something new. If you need proof that old
stuff may be a tad ho-hum these days, consider that Keds, the
all-time most basic shoe, is updating with bright colors, platforms
and even cloglike sandals.

   A series on prosperity in America has begun to move from Cox
News Service. The Dayton Daily News is publishing the five-part
series on prosperity and how it is changing the way we live,
starting in the paper of Sunday, July 12. A budget follows. For
more information, call CoxNet at 404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1:
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-MAIN _ Not since the '50s have things been this good
this long. Not only are most people living better, a DDN poll shows
a majority believe the best is yet to come. With things going so
well, cities throughout the country are looking for ways to sustain
the good times. Seattle is one of the leaders in the sustainability
movement, which seeks to identify the strengths and weaknesses in a
community and target problem areas for future growth. (Dempsey,
Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-PROFILE _ Profile of Mike Wood, who quit his job as a
vp to spend more time with his family. Wood still works the same
number of hours, but not necessarily on the job. He's on the verge
of earning a PhD. And he has upped his quality time with his
family. More and more U.S. workers are choosing the same route.
(Dempsey, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-HOUSING _ The changing American family has changed
the look of houses. More garage space, master baths with
whirlpools, cathedral ceilings over plush family rooms. But with
talented students attracted more to technology than working with
their hands, there are fewer skilled craftsmen available to build
houses. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   Day 2:
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-POLL _ Most of us are better off, but few of us are
frivolously spending our money, vacationing in the Riviera or even
flying off to Vegas in the middle of the night. Results of DDN
poll. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-PROFILE _ Three years ago Glenn McGee was young,
uneducated and homeless. In June he graduated from Sinclair
Community College and is headed for a job at a machine shop. McGee
has taken advantage of the demand for skilled labor in this
economy. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-JOBS _ Dayton's economy was one of the strongest in
the nation in the 50s and 60s, and it was largely an economy built
on blue-coller work. Today, jobs that can pay as much as $50,000 a
year after a two year apprenticeship are going begging. (Dempsey,
Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   Day 3:

LEARNING ACADEMIC AND SURVIVAL SKILLS FOR COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, N.J. _ When Adam Padron was 16, high school bored him. ``I
wasn't paying attention,'' he said last week. ``I lost interest.''
And so he dropped out of Bloomfield High School his freshman year.
But, he said, ``I always wanted to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam worked for a year and a half, got his general equivalency
diploma, and then applied to Felician College, a small Roman
Catholic college here in Bergen County. But because he had dropped
out of high school just as his classmates were about to begin
algebra, Adam scored poorly on math entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the college accepted him. Admissions officials did
suggest, though, that he take part in a new four-week program
called Jump Start, designed to help incoming freshmen catch up to
their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, as other high school graduates are enjoying their
last vacation before college, many borderline students like Adam
are enrolled in classes or programs that help students sharpen the
academic skills they should have gotten in high school, and learn
survival skills for college.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges are motivated, at least in part, by the need to
address declining admissions. The investment to provide remedial
programs, said Susan Chalfin, director of admissions at Felician,
is worthwhile because the students are less likely to drop out
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 78 percent of America's colleges offered such remedial
classes, up from 73 percent in 1988. The programs come in a variety
of forms. Some colleges offer the programs only in the summer, and
others run them throughout the year, with a variety of requirements
for how often students should check in with supervisors. Ivy League
universities offer tutoring programs for weaker students who need
help.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac College in Connecticut has been running the Academic
Assistance Program for 28 years for the kind of students who are,
in the words of Helen Beril, the program director, ``salvageable,
or maybe they're late bloomers.'' Quinnipiac accepts marginal
students with the proviso that they must take part in the program,
Ms. Beril said.
</P>
<P>
   At Felician, the Jump Start Program provides more than just
intensive math and English instruction. It is also something of a
boot camp for college survival. In addition to brushing up on the
basics, students learn about taking notes, listening effectively,
stress management, study skills and even money management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our students are first-generation college students,
and they don't have the kind of support at home as some of our
other students,'' said Jane O'Brien, the co-director of Jump Start.
</P>
<P>
   The program, similar to ones at many other colleges and
universities, is intended to help students who might require
remedial courses later, an issue that has been the subject of
considerable debate among educators recently. At the City
University of New York, in spite of strong protests from faculty
and students, trustees recently voted to phase out remedial courses
from their four-year colleges and set higher entrance standards.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at City University, many college officials say,
focused the debate too narrowly on the very broad issue of how to
teach students who are ill prepared for higher education. Educators
throughout the region and the country say that predicting a
student's ability to succeed in college goes beyond merely looking
at results of entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   At programs like Felician's Jump Start, officials say they are
providing students with a wider approach to college life by
teaching them skills that students who went to better high schools
may have learned from their teachers, or from parents who
themselves went to college, or from mentors or advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's our business to educate those students,'' Ms. Chalfin
said. ``That is what we're about. We have to have a way for those
students to come in. We have a moral obligation to provide courses
for those students.''
</P>
<P>
   During the four-week session, the 20 students in Felician's
program will be taught computer technology, reading and writing
skills, oral communication and algebra. But they will also learn
how to understand a course description in a syllabus, how to manage
their time and money, how to balance school work and out-of-school
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac program runs throughout the school year and
students must check in with advisers periodically to let them know
their progress in school.
</P>
<P>
   When students enter the program, the director said, some resent
having to sit through the classes. ``The first month they sit there
relatively negatively, until their first round of tests,'' she
said. When they see how much help they actually need, they start
taking the program more seriously, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of these services say that students who are not
prepared for college should not be there and that colleges should
not be offering remedial help.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you call it remedial if many of these students have
never been presented with the information the first time?'' said
Caron Mellblom, an associate professor in graduate education at
California State University at Dominguez Hills, near Los Angeles,
who argues that students from poorer high schools may not have been
exposed to a college culture.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the Felician program are commuting the first two
weeks, and will live on campus dorms the last two weeks. The
program is free to students, but, Ms. Chalfin said, it costs the
college about $2,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first week at Jump Start, several of the
students said, they were glad to be in the program. Chris Guterl,
18, who graduated from Lyndhurst High School in New Jersey, said he
found the computer classes helpful. ``I had my girlfriend type up
my term papers in high school,'' he said. ``I'm definitely afraid
of computers. But I'm starting to feel more comfortable now.''

FRENCH CREW AIMING AT TRANS-ATLANTIC RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ A team of 11 French ocean racers _ a Top Gun
entourage of long-distance sailors if there ever was one _ joined a
core group of big boat sailors here last week. Their mission: to
prepare for an unprecedented assault this September on the
trans-Atlantic record from New York to England.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Loick Peyron, one of France's leading ocean racers, the
group practiced off Newport for eight days on Mari-Cha III. As if
to goad them, the monohull trans-Atlantic record was broken during
their preparations last Tuesday by another French team under
Christophe Auguin. That time of 9 days 22 hours is considered
unofficial since it was not properly ratified by the World Sailing
Speed Record Council, but as far as Mari-Cha III is concerned, it
is the time to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For the 38-year-old Peyron and crew, getting an upper hand on
Mari-Cha III, the new 147-foot ketch they were muscling offshore
here, has been no easy task. With two grinders on each of four
winch pedestals, trimming the huge sails left the most fit among
them exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really impressive,'' Peyron said of the challenge of
sailing Mari-Cha III. ``It's a crazy machine with big winches, and
big blocks. But it still takes human power to keep it under
control, and we will see if that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge sailboat by any standard, but that makes Mari-Cha
III the Frenchmen's weapon of choice. Perhaps more than any other
sailboat since 1905, when the yacht Atlantic sailed from New York
to England in a record 14 days, the huge new boat seems up to the
task. One of the largest sailboats in the world built entirely of
carbon fiber, Mari-Cha III has the body of a glider in the guise of
a Boeing 777.
</P>
<P>
   So, most onlookers are apt to think of Mari-Cha III as one of
the lavish super-yachts that flock to Newport the way thoroughbreds
are drawn to Saratoga. Indeed, its towering, 150-foot white mast of
painted carbon fiber dominates the harbor skyline. Beyond that, the
giant monohull has high topsides, teak decks and plenty of velvety
wood trim. But its beauty is its deception. ``The teak is very,
very thin on deck,'' said Jef D'Etiveaud, the boat's captain. Wood
trim permeates the boat, but composite materials such as carbon
fiber, which are far lighter, form the core of this ocean
speedster.
</P>
<P>
   Its lavish woodwork also extends below deck, including a main
saloon with mahogany raised-paneled walls and intricate cabinetry.
Marble sink tops make the heads look like bathrooms at the Ritz.
But it's all part of the masquerade. Most of Mari-Cha's elaborate
interior is made to be lifted out for racing.
</P>
<P>
   The shelves, cabinets and wall panels release with the turn of a
screwdriver. Even the washer and dryer get put into a storage
container ashore. From stem to stern, the hand craftsmanship masks
a lean machine under skin-thin veneer. Even the marble sink tops
are only the thickness of linoleum.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The huge yacht was commissioned by Robert Miller, a business
tycoon from England who owns a worldwide network of duty-free
shops. Designed by Philippe Briand of France, the $15 million yacht
comes with a water ballast system that moves 7.5 tons of water in
14 minutes from one side of the hull to the other as the boat
tacks. It is the equivalent of having more crew members than the
boat could fit sitting along the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also an elaborate cruising boat. ``That's where the
challenge was,'' D'Etiveaud said. ``To make a light racing boat is
easy. But to make a light cruising boat is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the priority is to beat the trans-Atlantic record. In
setting the nine-day mark, Auguin crossed the imaginary finish off
Lizard Point in England aboard his 60-foot sloop, Geodis. The
previous record, set last year by the 80-foot monohull, Nicorette,
was 11 days 13 hours. ``Ah, that's good news for us,'' D'Etiveaud
said, on hearing of the faster time, ``because it's not very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The French crew will prepare the boat in New York on Sept. 18.
With three days' work, the yacht will be stripped down to its bare
bone _ a carbon fiber shell with 24 crew members and a single
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   About 300 sailboats are expected to be at the starting line off
Chicago Saturday for the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Yacht
Club's Mackinac Race. The 333-mile overnight competition along Lake
Michigan ends off Mackinac Island, Mich. The record _ 25 hours 50
minutes _ was set in 1987 by Pied Piper, a Santa Cruz 70 that
finished second for line honors last year to Cynosure, also a Santa
Cruz 70.

REAL ESTATE: PITFALLS IN LUXURY DECONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a law passed in 1993 and amended last year,
rent-stabilized tenants who pay $2,000 or more a month for their
apartments and whose annual household incomes were more than
$175,000 in each of the two preceding years are not entitled to the
protection of rent stabilization.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of strict interpretation of the luxury decontrol
law by the New York state Division of Housing and Community Renewal
_ and some recent court decisions confirming that interpretation _
even tenants whose incomes are below $175,0000 can suddenly find
themselves subject to luxury decontrol and its high free-market
rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this is one of the most serious issues facing
tenants in the city of New York that I have seen in 30 years of
practicing law,'' said Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan real estate
layer.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said that since luxury decontrol was signed into law in
1993, an increasing number of clients he has been asked to
represent have had their rent-stabilized apartments deregulated
despite the fact that their incomes were well below the maximum set
by the law. And by reducing the limit from $250,000 to $175,000
last year, he said, the state Legislature placed even more tenants
at risk of losing their regulated status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling everybody I know that if their rent is more
than $2,000 a month they should put a lawyer on retainer and send
him every piece of mail they get from their landlord or DHCR,''
Brett said. ``And I tell them the advice stands no matter how much
money they make.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, results from the complexity of the luxury
decontrol law and the inevitable confusion created by the various
forms and certifications that criss-cross back and forth among
landlords, tenants and the DHCR.
</P>
<P>
   The process starts, Brett said, with the income-certification
form that landlords send to tenants by May 1 of each year in an
effort to determine whether any apartments renting for $2,000 a
month or more may be eligible for luxury decontrol.
</P>
<P>
   The form, Brett said, requires tenants to declare whether their
total household income in each of the two preceding years exceeded
the $175,000 limit. In most cases, he said, tenants complete the
form and return it to the landlord within the 30-day time period as
required by law. Some tenants, he said, even attach income tax
returns to the certification as proof of their income.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that though the form is sent by the
landlord to the tenant and then back to the landlord, it bears the
official letterhead of the Division of Housing and Community
Renewal _ a factor that could lead a reasonable tenant to believe
that the form, and the information it contains, will ultimately end
up in the files of DHCR. As a result, Brett said, tenants who
believe they are safe from decontrol and return the form on time
generally forget about luxury decontrol _ at least until the next
year's income certification arrives in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   By law, however, landlords can dispute a tenant's
income-certification by filing with DHCR an Owner's Petition for
Deregulation. When the division receives the landlord's petition,
it sends another income-verification form to the tenant along with
a request for supporting tax returns. The form also advises the
tenant that failure to return the certification within 60 days of
receipt will result in automatic deregulation of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when things get tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of tenants ignore the second form,'' Brett said. The
reason, he explained, is because the income verification form
requests essentially the same information as the previous form that
had been returned to the landlord. Thus some tenants believe that
since they filed the initial form they do not have to bother filing
a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to file the second form within 60 days, however, is
considered a default on the part of the tenant and nearly always
results in an order of deregulation being issued by the division.
In some cases it may take several months for DHCR to issue an order
of deregulation. In others, the orders may not reach the tenant
until sometime in the following year _ overlapping new income
certifications being filed for that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets so confusing it can drive you crazy,'' Brett said,
adding that what is most disturbing is that once a tenant has
failed to file a required form on time, there is virtually no way
for the tenant to rectify the error and avoid an order of
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is miss one deadline, and you're out of
luck,'' he said, explaining that the DHCR has consistently
interpreted the default provision of the statute in the strictest
terms possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent ruling that was highly critical of the division's
strict interpretation of the procedural requirements of the luxury
decontrol law, state Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob
wrote that the DHCR policy places a ``heavy burden'' on tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to keep a hawk's eye on the mail for year after year
into the indefinite future can cost any tenant the valuable
protection of the Rent Stabilization Laws, without regard to what
their income may be,'' Ms. Gangel-Jacob wrote. ``The continuing
vigilance that is required to obtain and act on the form is
daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no responses to telephone messages left at the
litigation section of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal
seeking comment on the agency's policy. But Jeffrey Turkel, a
Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that as harsh as
the division's position may seem, it appears to be simply applying
the law as it is written.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that a lot of tenants don't return their
petition within the 60-day time period,'' Turkel said. ``But what
you have here is a statute that says that if a tenant doesn't
respond within 60 days, the agency must issue an order of
deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some state Supreme Court justices like Ms.
Gangel-Jacob have found in favor of tenants when it is clear that
the tenants' incomes are below the statutory maximum, Turkel said,
those cases that have been appealed have resulted in decisions
upholding the DHCR's strict interpretation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, landlord-tenant lawyers say that at present the
only way tenants can protect themselves from an inadvertent loss of
their regulated status is to exercise the ``continuing vigilance''
referred to by Ms. Gangel-Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that means that tenants have to read and understand
every single document they receive,'' said William Gribben, a
Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants. ``You have to become an
expert on how the whole process works. You have to clear a space on
your desk, get a nice clean legal pad and make a note of every
docket number on every form and the dates when the forms were
received and returned.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, every form should be copied and every form
that is mailed should be sent certified mail, return receipt
requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be incredibly diligent,'' said Gribben, ``because
if you make one mistake, it can all go down the drain.''

SPRINT IS BUILDING MIDWEST'S LARGEST OFFICE COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ While other telecommunications companies
compete to pull off the biggest mergers and acquisitions, Sprint
Corp. can claim bragging rights of its own for the world
headquarters campus it is building on 200 acres in this booming,
affluent suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   With 3.1 million square feet of space _ at an estimated cost of
$700 million over four years of work _ the campus is the largest
corporate office construction project in terms of square footage
ever undertaken in the Midwest, according to executives of Sprint
and the construction firm, and the largest currently under way
anywhere in the United States. A possible later phase, not yet
approved by Sprint's board, would bring the total to 3.9 million
square feet with space for 14,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The campus will provide what Sprint and its employees say will
be the ideal working environment for the new century, and it is
highly reminiscent of a model that has been around for a long time:
the leafy college campus with low-rise, red-brick buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The work that began last July and is scheduled for completion in
late 2001 will create 18 four- and five-story buildings, one of
them a training center called the University of Excellence; a
175-foot clock tower; covered walkways; an outdoor amphitheater for
3,000 people; parking garages for 12,500 cars; athletic fields, and
hiking and biking trails that connect to public trails outside the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Some other amenities will take this project beyond the
traditional collegiate model: a full fitness center, a child-care
center, private rooms for nursing mothers next to the women's
restrooms, ``war'' rooms, ``solitude nooks'' and online menus from
the three food courts. Sixty percent of the site will be green
space, for which there is a $10 million landscaping budget. The
campus will have 5,000 trees and will require more than 6 million
bricks.
</P>
<P>
   That is not bad for a corporation descended from a little
country telephone exchange that started business a century ago in
Abilene, Kan. Today, Sprint has 51,000 employees worldwide and had
revenues last year of $14.87 billion. It is the largest private
employer in metropolitan Kansas City, with about 10,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Though best known as the nation's third-largest long-distance
carrier, Sprint also provides local service to 7.4 million
customers in 19 states, the heritage of its small-town past, and it
is a leader in wireless personal communications systems. It is
proud of its all-digital, fiber-optic network and is a major
carrier of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Manker, Sprint's vice president for real estate, said that
many features of the design and facilities for the corporate campus
emerged from employee focus groups and surveys and the more than
300 meetings she and others on the project team held with
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three surveys, we had them list things they wanted,'' she
said, ``in terms of amenities, parking and technology. We had focus
groups on retail, food and wellness facilities. We got great
questions and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   A video camera mounted on a pole overlooking the construction
site allows Daniel Euston, project manager for the J.E. Dunn
Construction Co., the general contractor, to observe the site from
his office in the temporary building housing the project management
team. He can zoom in on any worker or any place. Every hour, a
picture is taken from the video and posted on the company intranet,
allowing thousands of employees to check construction progress
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   A 5,000-square-foot mock-up of interior office space has been
built in a warehouse a few miles from the site. Serving as a
laboratory for office design, it allows the planners to try out
ceiling tiles, lighting, movable furniture and other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for someone in the
construction business,'' said Euston, adding that the real size of
the project could be better understood by taking into account that
construction costs in this part of the country run 30 to 50 percent
below those in the metropolitan areas of the Northeast and
California, with cheaper land prices making an even greater
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manker said this showplace campus will not only bring
together employees now in about 60 buildings scattered over many
miles of the bistate Kansas City area but ``will have a physical
presence that represents Sprint to our investors and partners.''
She predicted that it would aid in recruitment of employees, both
locally and nationally. ``Recruiting is very difficult today,'' she
said. ``It's a buyer's market. With only 2 percent unemployment in
this area, we are pleased to see that there's been a lot of
attention from potential employees interested in coming to Kansas
City to work at the new headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Before plans were drawn, the project team _ about 25 people
representing Sprint, Dunn, Hillier Group, which is the principal
architect, and other architects, engineers and consultants _ looked
for ideas by visiting 15 corporate headquarters around the country,
including those of Microsoft, Monsanto, Ameritech and Sears,
Roebuck. Much of the inspiration for the Sprint campus appears to
have come from the collegiate-styled Microsoft headquarters, which
is slightly larger than what the finished Sprint headquarters will
be but was built piecemeal over many more years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manker said that a high-rise headquarters was ruled out
``because communication doesn't happen as well when offices are
vertical instead of horizontal.'' She also said the elevators will
not be of the high-speed variety because the planners want to
encourage employees to use the stairs, which is seen as another way
to ease communication.
</P>
<P>
   As it occupies the new campus, Sprint will vacate 2.5 million
square feet of leased space in several steps beginning August 1999
and continuing into 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Many people involved in real estate in Kansas City and the
suburbs fear that those vacancies will have an adverse effect on
local real estate prices. Ms. Manker argued, however, that any
damage will be temporary because the space is widely dispersed,
most of it in areas with strong and growing demand for class A
office space.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of the vacated space, however, Sprint's move
is expected to give a huge boost to the already nonstop commercial
and real estate development in the area surrounding the campus for
several miles. Euston said at least five hotels are scheduled for
construction or in the planning stages near the campus. Residential
real estate agents said that many homes in nearby subdivisions,
where most of the houses are 3,000 square feet and up, are being
sold to Sprint employees. The upscale Town Center Plaza shopping
area, with 73 shops, restaurants and theaters in 750,000 square
feet, opened last year across the street from the eastern boundary
of the Sprint site.
</P>
<P>
   Euston said that 300 to 400 construction workers are now on the
site, where three office buildings and four parking garages are
under construction. By fall, he said, at least 12 buildings will be
under construction, as the work force reaches 1,000. It will remain
at that level for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the serious shortage of skilled construction workers in
Kansas City and many areas of the country, he said it would require
constant juggling to coordinate Sprint's lease expirations in
existing buildings with the availability of craftsmen to complete
new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even cement, he said, is in short supply nationwide, with
contractors in some areas able to pour cement only four days a
week. Sprint has dealt with that problem by setting up its own
cement plant at the site.
</P>
<P>
   These headaches may help explain why Ms. Manker, even after
talking about how exhilarating it was to work on such an ambitious
project, said the wall chart that plots the progress of the
undertaking had sometimes been referred to as the ``wall of pain.''

REAL ESTATE: LOOKING FOR RETAIL GOLD IN THE OUTER BOROUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Ratner made a big splash when he moved the
7.2-million-pound Empire Theater 170 feet on 42nd Street to serve
as an anchor for the entertainment and retail complex he is now
building.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras recorded the event as balloons resembling the comedians
Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who met at the theater while it was
called the Eltinge, appeared to tug the building westward.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner has other high profile Manhattan developments in the
works as well. He is seeking approval to build a hotel on 41st
Street over the complex and is about to break ground on a 460-room
Embassy Suites hotel in Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   While such projects have brought the former commisioner of the
city's Department of Consumer Affairs public attention, he has been
quietly working at another, perhaps more significant, task _
developing modern retail and entertainment centers in the populous,
but underserved, boroughs of the city outside of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner, whose company, Forest City Ratner, developed the
11-building, 6-million-square-foot Metrotech office building
complex in downtown Brooklyn, said he had become interested in
retail development when it became clear that the overbuilding of
the late '80s and early '90s would preclude more office development
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of our business was office buildings, but over the
last three to four years we have shifted to urban retail,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not think the office market would rebound,'' said
Sandeep Mathrani, a senior vice president of Forest City Ratner and
its director of retail development, ``and we wanted to continue
development in the boroughs.'' He said the company had conducted a
study of stores and neighborhoods and concluded that there was a
large market for modern stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study found that there is a spending deficit in the
boroughs of $10 billion a year,'' Mathrani said. ``Three billion of
that involves automobiles, so we set that aside. Of the remaining
$7 billion, $3 billion leaves the city for the suburbs and $4
billion is not spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers specializing in retail development agree that many parts
of the city could support large, modern stores whose selections are
more varied and whose prices are typically lower than the small
stores that operate in many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brooklyn and Queens are clearly understored,'' said Faith
Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, a
retail specialist. ``Nobody thought the boroughs were chic and they
were not developed for national retail. But now Ratner has done
Atlantic Center and it shows the demand is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The development is a three-story, L-shaped structure at Atlantic
and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn that opened in the fall of 1996.
Tenants of the 393,000-square-foot center include Pathmark, Caldor,
Sports Authority, Old Navy, Office Max and Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Ratner was the first developer to recognize the strength
of the middle class in the city,'' said Benjamin Fox, a partner in
New Spectrum Realty Services, another retail specialist. ``For
retailers the outer boroughs offer tremendous staying power and
stability because there are families with combined incomes of
$50,000 to $60,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ratner's own research shows that there are about 130,000
people living within a one-mile radius of the Atlantic Center and
that the average household income is almost $53,000 a year.
Lengthening the radius to two miles encompasses 437,000 people, but
the average household income drops to about $44,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said the Atlantic Center site had been selected for a
replacement for Ebbets Field before the Dodgers defected to the
West Coast. ``The land was cleared by Robert Moses, but it just sat
there for 40 years,'' he said. He said city officials concluded
that office projects would not happen and offered the site for
retail development.
</P>
<P>
   The results at Atlantic Center have been favorable enough that
the company has recently opened a second center diagonally across
the street. Called the Shops at Atlantic Center, its tenants are PC
Richard &AMP; Son and Sneaker Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Forest City Ratner, a partnership between publicly owned Forest
City Enterprises and Ratner's company, now has projects under way
in all five boroughs and in North Bergen, N.J. It has 1.1 million
square feet of retail space in operation, 800,000 square feet in
development and 725,000 square feet in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Atlantic Center, some of the projects currently
in operation include a 175,000-square-foot Home Depot at Gun Hill
Road and Ely Avenue in the Bronx; Maspeth Center at Grand Avenue
and 74th Street in Queens, a 100,000-square-foot neighborhood
shopping center anchored by an Edward's Supermarket; the Shops at
Northern Boulevard on Northern Boulevard and 48th Street in Queens,
a 214,000-square-foot center with Edward's Supermarket, Marshall's
and Old Navy as major tenants, and the Shops at Richmond Avenue at
Richmond Avenue and the entrance to the Staten Island Mall, a
76,000-square-foot center with Circuit City and Staples as major
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   And if the boroughs outside of Manhattan were considered
understored, they are also underscreened, Ratner concluded. So the
company is building a combined bookstore and movie theater called
the Heights, at Court and Schermerhorn Streets in Brooklyn, as well
as two theaters on Staten Island, Hylan Cinemas, at 101 Quintard
St., and Forest Avenue Cinemas, at Forest Avenue and South Street.
</P>
<P>
   One of the difficulties of building large stores in the city was
to translate concepts that were developed in suburban malls to the
urban environment. ``We had to learn the business, because nobody
had ever done it before,'' Ratner said. ``There were issues
regarding parking, security, financing and the micromanagement of
goods depending on the neighborhood.''

 NEW YORK: the neighborhood.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One conclusion was that it was simply not possible to provide as
much parking as is available in the suburbs. A typical suburban
mall has five parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of
shopping space. In the city that ratio is 1.5 to 3 cars per 1,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that with land scarce and expensive, shopping was
going to have to be vertical. Atlantic Center, for example, is
three stories high, with the Pathmark food store on the first floor
and Caldor on the third, with Marshall's and Sports Authority in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Finding sites in the city is difficult, company officials said.
``There are no vacant sites, you have to create them,'' said
Mathrani. He said the company had videotaped the city by helicopter
and identified major street and traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was a matter of knocking on the doors of people who
own large tracts of land and convincing them to sell,'' Ratner
said. None of the land was being offered for sale when the Forest
City Ratner people came calling, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Financing the projects was another obstacle. Since no one had
done these types of stores in an urban setting before, there was no
track record to demonstrate they could be economically successful.
``Four years ago you couldn't get banks to lend on these
projects,'' said Ratner, adding that ``we went to every one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, Credit Lyonnais agreed to finance Atlantic
Center, and the success of that undertaking has made financing less
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the density of the population in the city, he said,
many of the stores are doing very well compared with their suburban
counterparts. He said one Caldor store in the city had $50 million
in sales in one year, compared with $25 million to $30 million for
a typical suburban Wal-Mart or $20 million to $22 million for a
suburban K-mart. He said one of the supermarkets sold $800,000 of
groceries a week compared with about $200,000 a week in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of developing in New York, Ratner said, is
that the city has not lost population, like his hometown of
Cleveland or Detroit. As people have moved to the suburbs they have
been replaced by more recent immigrants eager to partake in the
material aspects of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-seven percent of the city's population is made up of
immigrants and it is 50 percent if you count immigrants and their
children,'' Mathrani said. ``Many of them have been deprived of
basic necessities like television and a refrigerator, so they have
a propensity to spend more than people who have been here for
awhile.''

   TSAR-BURIAL _ MOSCOW _ On Friday, Russia will hold a royal
burial unfit for a king. On the 80th anniversary of the murder of
the last tsar, Nicholas II, by a Bolshevik firing squad, his
charred bones and those of his family will be laid to rest in the
former imperial capital of St. Petersburg. The Yeltsin government
had hoped it would be a day of national reconciliation, a chance,
said the government official in charge of the burial, to stop the
civil war which has been smoldering in Russia since 1917.'' Now, it
seems, the Kremlin simply wants the ceremony low-key and quick.

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

Khatami. Now, reformers are channel surfing between World Cup
soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one
called and asked that I not tell anyone I was with them. These

REAL ESTATE: IN A HEALTHY ECONOMY, A SQUEEZE IN RETAIL SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is shaping up to be another good one for New Jersey's
retail sector, giving rise to a burst of new and renovated
shopping-center projects across the state.
</P>
<P>
   A robust economy continues to increase consumer spending, and
financing for development is available. Some retailers are
consolidating or closing stores, but others are expanding and new
ones are entering the state. This has resulted in an increase in
demand for space at a time when the vacancy rate in the 11-county
northern and central New Jersey market is low, developers and
industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the activity are four projects, together totaling
1.3 million square feet of new and renovated space, that are moving
forward or are soon to begin in Clifton, Bridgewater, Riverdale and
North Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing now are development deals coming on line
after two very strong retail years with the growth spurred by a
number of aggressive retail tenants,'' said Matthew Harding, senior
vice president of Levin Management, based in North Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
   His concern, which manages some 4.6 million square feet of
retail space in New Jersey, puts the retail vacancy rate in centers
in northern and central New Jersey, excluding regional malls, at 5
percent, down from 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kraus, who heads TKL/The Dealmakers, a retail consulting
firm in Mercerville, puts the vacancy rate even lower, at 3
percent. ``Despite the competition Jersey continues to be a great
retail state because of the vast amount of shoppers and buying
power that exists here,'' he said. He added, however, that the
upshot was that ``weak tenants shall perish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rickel Home Center chain, for example, filed for bankruptcy
last year and closed its 53 stores, 42 of them in New Jersey. Most,
however, have since been leased by Staples, the office-supply
retailer. At the same time Lowe's, another home-improvement chain,
based in North Wilkesboro, N.C., is making a foray into the state
with a store planned as part of a 421,000-square-foot shopping
center under way in Piscataway, while Home Depot continues to add
new stores. Over the last 18 months Home Depot opened seven stores
and plans to open three more by next July for a total of 29 in the
state, said Katrina Blauvelt, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other ``big box'' retailers like Wal-Mart and Target,
the discount department store chain and a relative newcomer, are
also expanding in the state. Their growth, in turn, has pushed up
rents; Harding of Levin said the rents have risen 5 percent to 8
percent over the last year depending on store size. Large blocks of
100,000 square feet or more average about $15 per square foot a
year, up 7 percent from 1997, he said. He added, however, that
while he does not see ``any abrupt changes in the market in the
near future there could be flattening in rent increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of retail space in the state has also increased,
putting some downward pressure on retailers' sales volume. Data
compiled by Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage, show
144 million square feet of space in 1994 in all shopping centers,
excluding regional malls, with retailers averaging $150 a square
foot in annual sales. As of Jan. 1, 1998, the latest figures
available, there were 158 million square feet and retailers were
averaging $139 a square foot in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that retailers are making less money, they
continue to open stores, ``keeping the market healthy,'' said Jerry
Putterman, senior vice president at the West Orange office of Grubb
&AMP; Ellis. But, he said, if interest rates rise and money gets tight
there ``could be a real reversal, spurring more consolidations
within the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, construction continues. Brokers said that along with
big-box retailers the big space takers are supermarkets and movie
theaters. They are being constructed in free-standing locations
like the one on West Central Boulevard in Palisades Park where a
65,000-square-foot Shop Rite opened last month or they are moving
into key spots within retail centers, often as anchors.
</P>
<P>
   But sites for new centers are becoming more difficult to find,
prompting the recycling of land once occupied by industrial or
office buildings into retail use. In the process, ``new retail
pockets'' are being created, said Arthur E. Weiss, senior retail
associate at the Teaneck office of CB Richard Ellis, the national
commercial brokerage. The creation of such a location, he said, is
occurring on 33 acres along Route 3 in Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   There, a 285,000-square-foot retail-entertainment center is
rising on 11 acres formerly occupied by Automatic Data Processing
offices and 22 acres of the adjacent 62-acre property once used by
ITT for its headquarters. Called Clifton Commons, it is the first
phase of a larger 73-acre mixed-use project planned by Related
Retail Corp., an affiliate of the Related Companies, a large
Manhattan development company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is the hole in the retail doughnut between Paramus,
Secaucus and Wayne,'' said James Jarosik, executive vice president
at Related Retail, adding that whatever the market, ``having land
with frontage along Route 3 is irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Commons, scheduled for completion next spring, has been
nearly fully preleased and will be anchored by an
80,000-square-foot, 16-screen General Cinema complex along with a
65,000-square-foot Edwards supermarket, 130,000 square feet of
stores and two restaurants. Eventually, the remaining 40 acres, now
home to a 950,000-square-foot building that the avionics division
of ITT Industries has leased back from Related Retail until 2002,
will also be redeveloped into up to 1 million square feet of hotel,
housing and additional retail uses, said Jarosik.
</P>
<P>
   In Riverdale, construction is under way on a 240,000-square-foot
open-air retail strip that replaces a former swim club on 35 acres
along Route 23, one-half mile north of Interstate 287.
</P>
<P>
   The center _ where Staples, Home Depot and BJ's Warehouse Club
have signed on as tenants _ is being developed by Starwood Heller
LLC, a joint venture of Heller Enterprises of Edgewater and
Starwood Opportunity Fund IV, an affiliate of Starwood Lodging of
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new retail location in a growing area not yet served
by these types of tenants who see it as a way to increase their
market share,'' said Todd Heller, vice president of leasing and
marketing at Starwood Heller.
</P>
<P>
   The partners also see Edgewater's Hudson River waterfront as
another retail growth area and are planning to develop at least
250,000 square feet of stores as well as a 14-screen National
Amusement movie theater in three projects along River Road there,
said Heller. A key reason, he said, is that more than 4,000 new
residential units are under way or planned at the river's edge in
Edgewater as well as nearby West New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgewater, site work began last month on a
625,000-square-foot shopping center on 70 acres at Route 28 and
I-287 that were once part of the American Cyanamid corporate
campus. Bridgewater Promenade, as the center is called, will have a
75,000-square-foot hotel with up to 175 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is in desperate need of this kind of mixed-used
project and the site, in terms of location, access and
demographics, can support it,'' said William Krame, president of
Krame Development Co. of Paramus, which is developing the center in
partnership with the Kimco Realty Corp. of New Hyde Park, Long
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Krame said the project was fully leased to such big-box
retailers as Target, Babies `R' Us and Home Depot as well as to
smaller tenants, including a bank, a video store and three
restaurants. Completion is expected by the summer of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Older centers are also being redeveloped to remain competitive.
An example is the 145,000-square-foot North Village Shopping
Center, on 12 acres where Routes 1 and 130 meet in North Brunswick,
which Levin Management plans to begin renovating this fall. The
center, built in the '60s, is now mostly vacant due to the closing
of a 30,000-square-foot A&AMP;P and an 80,000-square-foot Bradlees.
</P>
<P>
   The work includes reducing the size of the center to 130,000
square feet, dividing the former Bradlees for two or three users
and giving the reconfigured center a new facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking outmoded space and renovating it into a
`mini-power center' to attract a few mostly big-box retailers,''
said Matthew Harding, Levin's senior vice president. He added that
deals for that space were being negotiated with such tenants as a
bookstore and an office-supply chain.

DESPITE DESPERATE TIMES, RULING PARTY EXPECTED TO PREVAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese voters go to the polls Sunday as &UR;  &LR; the country's
once-invincible economy is facing its worst recession and highest
unemployment since World War II, the deficit is ballooning, banks
are teetering, and fewer than one in three people approve of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In most democracies, this would be a golden opportunity to throw
failed politicians out. But in Japan, where the opposition is weak,
the ruling party is backed by powerful business &UR;  &LR; interests, and the
populace turns conservative in times of crisis, the LDP is
predicted to &UR;  &LR; win more contested seats than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP has done a rotten job in the last few years. But the
good news for them is there's no competition,'' said Richard
Jerram, chief Japan economist at ING Baring Securities. ``At any
given time, there seem to be 101 opposition parties. They shuffle
the pack, but it's still the same jokers.... If you want to vote
for someone other than the LDP, who do you vote for?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the election for half the seats in the Upper House
of parliament represents a potential vote of confidence _ or the
lack thereof _ in the LDP and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. His
party had hoped to win 69 of the 126 seats up for grabs, to gain a
majority in the Upper House. After dismal showings in polls, LDP
officials scaled back expectations, saying the party would declare
victory if it held onto the 61 seats it controls already.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote will determine how strong a mandate the LDP can
claim _ and the party's ability to implement painful economic
reforms. A strong showing could leave the LDP smug and unwilling to
shake things up, and could kill off some opposition parties. A poor
showing could force Hashimoto to step down, which could cripple his
party with infighting and stymie the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP controls the more powerful Lower House, of which
Hashimoto is a member, so it should remain in charge regardless of
Sunday's results. But votes cast on Sunday will shape the face of
parliament for a long time, since members elected Sunday will serve
until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the financial crisis that has pummeled
Asia this year makes it more critical than ever that Japan yank its
economy _ the world's second-largest _ out of a nearly nine-year
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stagnant economy has become the sole campaign issue.
Increased government spending has postponed suffering, but since
the first recession in 23 years was declared last month, the
long-patient public is finally getting fed up.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP realizes this, and its campaign pitches have
turned &UR;  &LR; desperate. On the first day of the campaign, Hashimoto
begged voters: ``Please believe in the LDP. Please help us to make
the situation stable.'' Last week, he called for permanent tax
cuts, after twice changing his stance within a few days. Other
officials also flipflopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes these guys look like the Keystone Kops, running
around with everyone saying something different.... It further
undermines the already questionable credibility of the ruling
party,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Matsui Marine
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP has governed Japan for all but two years since the end
of World War II, and it has a loyal voter base among big business,
farmers, and construction, to whom it has awarded projects and
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest opposition force, the Democratic Party of Japan
(DPJ), has a popular leader, but his two-year-old party is weak.
The Communists have dedicated loyalists but are still viewed by
most Japanese with suspicion. These two are the only parties
besides the LDP that are expected to gain seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, the LDP was great, because they brought
our GDP (gross domestic product) to second place in the world. But
the world has changed, and what we need are new ways of doing
things, new parties that can adapt to a new reality,'' said Banri
Kaieda, a DPJ member of the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut long advocated by his party, Kaieda said, is a
bitter pill for the LDP, because it would mean cutting spending
that supports loyalists. But in the end, the LDP has called for
long-term tax relief, an example of how it neutralizes the
opposition by adopting its platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats call themselves middle-of-the-road. The LDP is
the whole road,'' Neuffer said. ``Its strength is that it's not a
party based on policy or principles, but a party with a number one
goal of getting elected.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an old joke in Japan that the real opposition is the United
States, which has held considerable sway over Japanese policies
since the postwar period. ``I'd say there's a new opposition party
_ the (global) financial markets,'' which rate Japan's performance
through stock and currency showings, said Ronald Bevacqua,
economist and vice president at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The best outcome, he said, would be for the LDP to do well
enough ``to quiet opposition within the party, but for the markets
and the US to keep holding their feet to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States recently increased the heat on Japan to reform
after its currency, the yen, dropped precipitously. US observers
worry that if the yen collapses, it could set off a round of
competitive devaluations across the region, destabilizing Asia and
sending ripples as far as Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is very important because it will have a great
influence on unemployment, health insurance, prices, even the
environment,'' said Kaoru Okano, a political scientist and former
president of Meiji University in Tokyo. But Okano lamented that
politicians here are so tied to special interests that it is hard
to envisage anyone brave enough to undertake drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 5 percent of candidates are statesmen and 10 percent are
politicians, (then) 85 percent are wheeler-dealers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former minister of construction recently said publicly and
without embarrassment that reiki yudo, or ``getting votes in return
for projects to help the constituency,'' was a politician's most
important job.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, it is easy to see why many voters are
disillusioned. A poll last week showed 85 percent of people were
fed up with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys this month suggested turnout might hit record lows of 40
percent, which could boost the LDP and the Communists, who have
dedicated supporters. But a poll published Thursday predicted a 64
percent turnout, which could mean more protest votes than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for change, but nothing has gotten any
better. I no longer ... trust the LDP,'' said Akiko Saito, 42, a
secretary who prefers the Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But many young voters interviewed Saturday said they would stay
away from the polls entirely. ``Whatever those politicians promise,
they're not going to do anyway, so why bother voting?'' said Kaori
Kawamoto, a 26-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   If the LDP gets trounced Sunday, Hashimoto, who is not up for
reelection, could be forced to resign and the Lower House could be
forced to call new elections. Markets could also lose confidence,
causing the yen and stocks to drop.
</P>
<P>
   There are some analysts who say an LDP defeat would be good for
the nation, because it would scare them into making radical
reforms. But others say a tattered ruling party would be hindered
from undertaking unpopular changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that even with a big win, there's no evidence
the LDP, the bureaucracy, and the public will bite the bullet and
implement reforms that would cause short-term pain but long-term
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often blame the government, but I think all Japanese people
should be blamed. We have lived without the courage to face
economic reality,'' said Teizo Taya, managing director of Daiwa
Institute of Research. ``Unfortunately, this election won't change
that. We haven't yet suffered enough.''

`PRETTY FACE' GORDON DRAWS CHALLENGE FROM FRESH FACE OF MAYFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Same as last summer, Jeff Gordon leads the NASCAR Winston Cup
points chase at the midseason turn.
</P>
<P>
   And this could be a good thing. The second half of the 1997
season produced the tightest three-way finish in Cup history, with
Gordon bagging his second championship in three years by a 14-point
margin over Dale Jarrett and a 29-point advantage over Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen races into 1998, the fresh face of Jeremy Mayfield has
emerged to join Martin, Jarrett and the usual suspects in pursuit
of Gordon. Much like Jeff Burton in 1997, Mayfield is in the midst
of a breakthrough season that has seen him win his first Cup race
and lead the standings for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the way it feels up there,'' said Mayfield, who is 40
points behind Gordon heading into today's Jiffy Lube 300 at New
Hampshire International Speedway. ``A lot of guys told me that once
you get a taste for winning _ once you get a taste for leading the
points _ you'll never be satisfied with second again. I'll tell you
what. I was never satisfied with second to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to win again and to do what we can to get that
points lead back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's rise to worthy contender rates as the headline story
of the first half, which reached 16 races June 28 at Sears Point
Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. Seventeen events, including the
rescheduled Pepsi 400 on Oct. 17 at Daytona International Speedway,
remain to decide a championship worth a guaranteed $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon earned his series-leading fifth pole position on the
redesigned road course in Sonoma, and went on to his fourth victory
of 1998, tying him with Martin in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, meanwhile, became the eighth different and only
first-time winner June 21 at Pocono International Raceway.
Mayfield, 29, has eight top-five and 10 top-10 finishes. That run
has allowed him to upstage Penske-Kranefuss Racing teammate Rusty
Wallace, the 1989 champion who paced the points race for eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Refinishes Chevrolet Monte
Carlo, tops the series in laps led with 864 of 4,962. But Mayfield
does not have a DNF _ Did Not Finish _ completing an amazing 4,953
of 4,962 laps (99.8 percent). Similar consistency carried Terry
Labonte, Gordon's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, to his second
Cup title at Gordon's expense in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have been this year is consistent,'' said
Paul Andrews, crew chief of Mayfield's No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus.
``The fact that we won Pocono doesn't automatically make us `the
guys to beat' the next week. But we think we've become one of the
guys to beat on a fairly regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, whose victories include the Texas 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth, is third _ 10 points behind Mayfield and 52
in back of Gordon. Jarrett, a two-time winner, also is within
striking distance, 74 points back of Gordon. With 17 races
remaining last year, Jarrett also was fourth _ but 172 points
behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Same time last summer, Mayfield stood 10th in points _ 569
behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're liking what we're doing right now,'' Mayfield said. ``We
have kept our nose right in the thick of things.'' THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five items that might come to pass in the second half of the
NASCAR season:
</P>
<P>
   1. The 1999 Winston Cup schedule will expand by only one race,
to 34, with the addition of the reconfigured Miami-Dade Motorsports
Complex in Homestead, Fla. Best guess on a second race at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth is for the 2000 season, after NASCAR
completes its three-year commitment for non-points events in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   2. High-profile crew chief Larry McReynolds, dumped by Dale
Earnhardt and paired with Mike Skinner, will not return to work for
team-owner Richard Childress in 1999. Skinner, who has only one
top-10 result in 13 starts, could be axed sooner. One scenario has
McReynolds joining Joe Gibbs Racing as Winston Cup rookie Tony
Stewart's crew chief in '99.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jeff Gordon and crew chief//confidant Ray Evernham are
planning to form a team that will run a very limited, five-race
Busch Grand National schedule in 1999. Gordon's wife, Brooke, also
is expected to be a part owner. Gordon would drive, and Evernham,
who has been vocal about not wanting to be a crew chief forever,
will test the waters as team owner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Current Busch Grand National points-leader Matt Kenseth, a
protege of Roush Racing star Mark Martin, will join the Wood
Brothers as teammate to Michael Waltrip in 1999. The deal would be
an extension of the recently announced alliance between Wood
Brothers Racing and Roush Racing, in which the latter is providing
marketing, management and engine manufacturing services to the Wood
organization.
</P>
<P>
   5. Roush Racing could field a six-car Cup stable next year.
Current rookie-of-the-year contender Kevin Lepage has been signed
for a full ride in 1999. The final size of the Ford Taurus team
depends on whether Ted Musgrave is retained for another season.
RUMOR OF ALL RUMORS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rumor that Dale Earnhardt's storybook victory in the
season-opening Daytona 500 was ``manufactured'' by NASCAR refuses
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Earnhardt, the sport's second seven-time champion,
had been 0-for-19 in NASCAR's Super Bowl until his dominating
victory Feb. 15. Conspiracy theorists contend that NASCAR officials
allowed Earnhardt some sort of rules advantage _ most likely a
little larger restrictor plate atop his Chevrolet SB2 engine _ as a
payback for all ``The Intimidator'' has meant to the sport.
Earnhardt's emotional victory also served as a proper kickoff to
NASCAR's 50th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing theory. But whom among the doubters wants to be
the first to run it past Earnhardt, face to face? &QL; 
WHO'S HOT, WHO'S NOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A look back at the headline news makers from the season's first
half: {Hot, hot, hot}
</P>
<P>
   1. Bruton Smith, Eddie Gossage and the management of Speedway
Motorsports Inc. All deserve kudos for the bold reconstruction of
Texas Motor Speedway. Told by NASCAR president Bill France Jr. on
April 5 to fix the track's water seepage problem or risk losing
their Cup date, Smith had the track torn up, a new drainage system
installed, the banked turns reconfigured and the entire surface
repaved in time for NASCAR Craftsman Truck//Pep Boys Indy Racing
League practice June 4. The track has yet to receive the Papal
Blessing, or Rusty Wallace's. But apparently, SMI got it right this
time.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jeremy Mayfield and crew chief Paul Andrews. Mayfield has
finished 15th or better in 13 of 16 races, and is the only driver
to post a top-25 result in every race in 1998. Andrews, who was
crew chief for dictatorial owner//driver Alan Kulwicki when he won
the Cup championship in 1992, deserves credit for his Ray
Evernham-like influence on young Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mark Martin and crew chief Jimmy Fennig. Martin has recorded
seven consecutive finishes of seventh or better, including
victories at the California and Michigan speedways. Martin also
goes into the record book as winner of the last Cup race at the
``old'' Texas Motor Speedway. Martin has matched series
points-leader Jeff Gordon in bonus points (75) and victories (four)
and has no DNFs compared to Gordon's two.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jeff Burton and crew chief Frank Stoddard. The latter has
taken some heat after replacing the popular Buddy Parrott as
Burton's chief wrench. But Burton said Stoddard was the team's
``hands-on'' chief last year when Burton won three races and
finished fourth in points for team-owner Jack Roush. A preseason
championship favorite to many, Burton has six top-10 finishes in
the past seven races to climb to eighth in points.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bobby Labonte and crew chief Jimmy Makar. Usually driving the
only Pontiac Grand Prix worth watching, Labonte has five top-10
finishes in the past six races and has improved a spot, to sixth,
from last year. That's stout, considering Joe Gibbs Racing has more
DNFs (3) than victories (2) this season. {Not, not, not}
</P>
<P>
   1. The Brothers Bodine. Todd Bodine was fired by team owner Bob
Hancher on Wednesday after failing to deliver for new and
big-dollar sponsor Tabasco. Bodine, the 1997 Busch Grand National
points runner-up, qualified for only seven Cup events and had only
one top-10 finish. Meanwhile, big brother Geoff Bodine has finished
23rd or worse in the past six races.
</P>
<P>
   2. Johnny Benson Jr. Has five consecutive finishes of 18th or
worse. In a Ford Taurus. Owned by Jack Roush. Cue up The Who,
because crew chief Steve Hmiel can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kyle Petty. With 14 finishes of 22nd or worse in 16 races,
Kyle, in the Not-So-Hot Wheels Pontiac, is among seven drivers who
have not scored a bonus point in 1998. Even Robert Pressley has
scored five bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   4. Derrike Cope. Has only one top-15 finish and five DNFs in his
Pontiac. But he lead four laps at Atlanta Motor Speedway, scoring
five bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   5. Kenny Wallace. His six DNFs tie him with fellow Taurus-driver
Geoff Bodine for the lead in that dubious category. &QL; 
RACES TO WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Aug. 1, Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Talk
about your one-groove racetracks: This is it. But 300,000 fans and
the sound of the V8s reverberating off the ancient grandstands is a
rush. 2. Aug. 9, The Bud at The Glen, Watkins Glen (N.Y.)
International. Have a bad day on the second and last road-course
race of the season, and your championship hopes could turn to junk.
3. Aug. 22, Goody's 500, Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway. Touted as
the toughest ticket in NASCAR, thanks to night racing on the
half-mile oval's 36-degree banked turns. 4. Sept. 6, Southern 500,
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. What's more traditional than Labor Day
Weekend at NASCAR's oldest superspeedway? Pass the chicken, son. 5.
Oct. 11, Winston 500, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway. Break out the
superspeedway shocks and restrictor-plate engines, and hope to
avoid that inevitable ``One Big Wreck.'' 6. Oct. 17, Pepsi 400,
Daytona International Speedway. Rescheduled from July 4, this will
be the first time teams are forced to run back-to-back
restrictor-plate races. May the best driver, and engine shop, win.
7. Nov. 8, NAPA 500, Atlanta Motor Speedway. A championship chase
involving two, three or four drivers will pack them into the
lightning fast 1.54-mile quadoval. &QL; 
THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR &QL; 
FACTS AND FIGURES FROM THE FIRST HALF: &QL; 
RECAPPING THE SEASON &QL;
</P>

qualified in the first round (top 25) only five times. But three
have come in the past three races.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bodine, Steve Grissom and Darrell Waltrip are the only
drivers who have qualified for all 16 races without posting a
top-10 start.

<P>
   After posting only one finish better than 30th in the first
eight races, Darrell Waltrip has finished 20th or better in seven
of the past eight events.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Musgrave and Kyle Petty are the only drivers who have
competed in all 16 races without leading a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett has led at least one lap in 13 of 16 races, most of
all drivers.
</P>

<P>
   Thirty-eight drivers have led laps in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Mark Martin's total of $1,823,630, eight drivers have
more than $1 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The first eight races produced eight different pole winners, a
modern-era record. There have been 10 different pole winners in the
first 16 races. &QL; 
TOP-FIVE PERFORMANCES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five of the 80 top-five finishes of 1998 have been scored
by multi-car teams. The breakdown is Roush Racing (19), Penske
Racing (16), Hendrick Motorsports (15), Robert Yates Racing (11),
Richard Childress Racing (two), Team Sabco and Petty Enterprises
(one each) and Elliott Racing (zero).
</P>

earned on those tracks with 1,788. Jeremy Mayfield is second, three
points behind.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin has nine top-10 finishes in 12 superspeedway starts,
most of any driver. Martin also has earned 70 lap leader/bonus
points on those tracks, most of any driver.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the top-10 drivers in the superspeedway rankings are
involved in a multi-car team arrangement. The exceptions are Bobby
Labonte and Jimmy Spencer. &QL; 
CAR WARS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All three manufacturers have posted at least one victory this
season. Ford and Chevrolet each have seven victories, and Pontiac
has two.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford Taurus has claimed 50 of the 80 top-five finishes. A
Chevrolet Monte Carlo has scored 23 top fives and a Pontiac Grand
Prix has only seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has led 2,611 of the 4,962 laps raced. Chevrolet has led
1,971 laps, and Pontiac has paced 380 laps.
</P>
<P>
   The road-course event at Sears Point Raceway marked the first
time in 1998 that two Pontiac drivers _ John Andretti (third) and
Bobby Labonte (fourth) _ finished in the top five. &QL; 
STILL WINLESS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers who scored victories in 1997 are winless at
midseason: Jeff Burton (three victories last year), Ricky Rudd
(two) and John Andretti, Ernie Irvan and Rusty Wallace (one each).
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen active drivers remain winless during their Winston Cup
careers. The top five in 0-fers are Michael Waltrip (378 races),
Dick Trickle (268), Rick Mast (261), Ted Musgrave (232) and Wally
Dallenbach Jr. (146).
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt ended a 59-race winless streak, the longest of
his career, with his victory in the season-opening Daytona 500. The
driver who has won at least one race now mired in his
career-longest winless streak is Rusty Wallace, who has gone 45
consecutive races without a victory. &QL; 
NUTS AND BOLTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte leads active drivers with 585 consecutive starts,
a Winston Cup record.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin has been running at the finish in the past 32 races.

HOUSE FACTIONS NEAR DEAL ON FINANCE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opposing House factions are near a pivotal
agreement that would limit the long, winding debate over rewriting
the nation's campaign-finance laws and force a final vote on the
issue before the House begins its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the effort to limit big money's influence over
politics say that meeting the Aug. 7 deadline is crucial to give
the Senate enough time to act on the measure before Congress
adjourns for the year in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The push for change comes as the major parties and candidates
scurry to raise an estimated $800 million they will spend this year
on congressional election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, House Republican leaders would reduce the
number of proposed amendments _ to 34 from 258 _ to the most
prominent overhaul bill sponsored by Representatives Martin T.
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Christopher Shays, a
Connecticut Republican. Overall debate on the issue would be
limited to about 20 hours, split over many days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   For seven weeks, GOP leaders have relegated the unwieldy debate
to so many late-night sessions that backers of the overhaul plan
are calling the effort ``vampire reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pending pact means an end may be in sight to the
late-night drama. Meehan said he hopes to seal the agreement with
Republican leaders on Tuesday, when lawmakers are scheduled to
resume the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of getting through the legislative minefields
that have been set up to try to defeat this bill,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed in a highly
publicized handshake with President Clinton to address problems in
the campaign-finance system, Gingrich has helped devise special
rules for the debate that Shays-Meehan backers described as a
blatant attempt to kill the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, GOP leaders are permitting the House to
consider 12 campaign-finance bills, including the Shays-Meehan
measure. But in a rare procedural free-for-all, the bill that
receives the most votes will prevail in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Shays-Meehan measure say they have assembled a
coalition of at least 225 House members. But their fragile majority
remains threatened by several rival plans and the pending
amendments, some of which could alter their proposal enough to
siphon off vital support.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Shays and Meehan have failed to persuade GOP leaders
to stop scheduling the campaign-finance debate in intermittent
late-night sessions, which generally receive little public
attention. Shays-Meehan supporters say the GOP strategy makes it
difficult to maintain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think this debate is going to be held
at a time when Americans will be focused on it,'' Meehan said.
``It's going to go late into the evening many nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would ban large, unregulated contributions
known as soft money that have increasingly influenced state and
national elections. The proposal also would tighten disclosure
requirements and regulate spending by corporations, unions, and
nonprofit groups on advertising that influences federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's leading foe, Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas
Republican who is the House majority whip, is scheduled to offer a
major amendment next week that would eliminate the Shays-Meehan
proposal to regulate advocacy campaigns against elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, groups are not required to disclose who gives
them money and how they spend it on advertising that does not
specifically call for a candidate's election or defeat. Advocates
for changing the law say special-interest groups spent more than
$150 million in the last federal elections on such unregulated
advertising, including so-called voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Supreme Court decisons, DeLay said the advocacy efforts
are protected by free-speech rights. In a speech on the House
floor, he referred to a position paper by the National Right to
Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such commentary is not an abuse or evasion of federal law,''
Douglas Johnson, the group's legislative director, wrote in the
paper. ``Rather, it is fully protected by the First Amendment,
which is not a loophole but, among other things, the nation's
paramount election law.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on DeLay's amendment is expected to be sensitive for
many House members because the Christian Coalition and National
Right to Life Committee plan to record the roll call in their next
voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big hurdle for Shays-Meehan,'' said a senior House
aide. ``If the amendment passes, they could lose the coalition
behind the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also is threatened by another amendment scheduled
for consideration this week. The measure, sponsored by
Representative Vito J. Fossella Jr., a Republican who represents
Staten Island, N.Y., would ban noncitizens, including legal
permanent residents, from contributing to federal election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Current law permits legal permanent residents to contribute. And
the effort to deny them the privilege is strongly opposed by the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is prohibit legal residents who are living in
the United States, working, paying their taxes, fighting in the
military, giving up their lives, from exercising their right to
participate in the political process in this country,'' said
Representative Patsy Mink, a Hawaii Democrat. ``It's absolutely
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays-Meehan backers hope to preserve their coalition by
defeating the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan said he might agree to adopt several other amendments
without a vote to try to maintain support for his bill. Notable
among those measures are GOP-sponsored salvos at the Clinton
administration over fund-raising irregularities, including an
amendment that would ban the use of White House meals and
accommodations for political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have faced widespread
criticism for hosting White House coffees for many donors and
permitting some to stay overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied soliciting contributions in the White House,
although he said he could not recall if he made telephone calls
from the Oval Office asking for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged making fund-raising calls from his White House
office, but he asserted the practice was not prohibited by any
``controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said current law prohibits fund-raising in the White
House and described the Republican amendments as duplicative. ``If
we can reach accommodations on bills that are meant to embarrass
Democrats but make no change in the present law,'' he said, ``we
will try to do that.''

U.S. team roster trimmed to 16
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL; 
CHICAGO _ The list of hopefuls for the U.S. World Championship of
Basketball team was trimmed to 16 on Saturday as Rudy Tomjanovich
and his staff sent 12 players packing.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable among the cuts were former NBA players Larry
Stewart, Acie Earl, Gerald Madkins, Tim Kempton and Randy
Livingston, who played one season with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy task because the guys were so competitive and
the level of talent was very close,'' Tomjanovich said. ``There are
several guys who played very well who are not here. I feel bad
about those things, but they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Left to battle for the 12 roster spots for the team that will
play in Athens, Greece, starting July 29 are 16 players of diverse
backgrounds and abilities. The survivors include 10-year pro David
Wood and college underclassmen such as Mateen Cleaves and Trajan
Langdon, European refugees such as Warren Kidd and Wendell Alexis
and athletic NBA fringe players such as Jimmy King and Jason
Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the first round of cuts was Tim Breaux, who sat out
most of the first three days of workouts with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is pleased with those who made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move on from here,'' he said. ``Out of these 16, I believe
we have some versatility because we have players who can play a
couple of different spots. I'd like to say that we can get real
big, but we just don't have a big team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main focus coming is that we have to push the ball and get
some easy transition baskets. But we can't forget about the
execution of the half-court game, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some really good kids. They're very receptive and
they play hard, with their hearts. And I think we're going to have
a determined team, a team that feels honored to go out and
represent the USA and it's going to be a great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he's unsure whether the roster will be cut
further before the team leaves for Monte Carlo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance we could make another cut,'' he said.
``There's a chance that we could take more than 12 over there and
make the final cuts in Europe. There's an outside chance we could
pick up another player.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``outside chance'' probably would not be a marquee player
with NBA experience. More likely, he would be a member of the
Goodwill Games team that will scrimmage the U.S. squad Monday and
Tuesday at Chicago.

THIS TEAM USA IS NO MATCH FOR THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing like hanging your dirty laundry out for all the world to
see.
</P>
<P>
   And we do mean all the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the NBA labor lockout, the league's players have
callously withdrawn their participation in this month's FIBA World
Basketball Championships. They are taking their ball and staying
home, thus proving a point.
</P>
<P>
   That it's not the heat _ it's the stupidity. Somebody needs to
explain to me the logic behind not representing your country in
order to prove a point to owners like the Minnesota Timberwolves'
Glen Taylor, who gave Kevin Garnett a $126 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the oft-debated Dream Team concept is considered the
plaything of NBA ownership. By disbanding Dream Team IV, the
players hope to make their point that they are the straw that stirs
the NBA martini.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but whatever happened to ``I pledge allegiance to the flag
...'' and all of that?
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of boycotting Dream Teamers such as Grant Hill, Gary
Payton and Tom Gugliotta, the sport's governing body in this
country, USA Basketball, will be represented in Athens, Greece, by
the likes of Wendell Alexis, Ashraf Amaya and Acie Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball scabs, a good union man might call them. And they are
about to get hit on the heads with a global pipe wrench.
</P>
<P>
   Let's review the stakes. The winner in Athens gets a free pass
into the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The other 15 teams
don't necessarily get anything.
</P>
<P>
   Each of FIBA's geographic regions _ Europe, Asia, Oceania and
the Americas _ will likely get to send two more teams to Sydney.
The constitution of FIBA, the game's world governing body, says
only the qualifying tournament winner from each region, plus the
``five or six best-placed teams,'' will round out the Olympic
field.
</P>
<P>
   It seems ludicrous any selection committee would leave out a
card-carrying Dream Team of true NBA stars, but this is FIBA. As
Munich in 1972 proved, schnitzel happens.
</P>
<P>
   And, book it, this Team USA in Athens will get drummed.
Jackhammered. It might not win as many as two games.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis, for instance, plays in Berlin, after last being seen at
Syracuse _ the school, not the island _ in 1986. Amaya plays for
the Idaho Stampede. Earl toils for the Continental Basketball
Association's La Crosse Bobcats. And Gerard King, playing ball in
Italy, earned his basketball sheepskin at Nicholls State.
</P>
<P>
   The CBA thing, history tells us, will not work. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The last time USA Basketball assembled a crew of CBA players and
outfitted them in Team USA jerseys was at the Pan American Games in
Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The team we sent down featured, among others, Sean Gay of Texas
Tech, ex-Michigan star Rumeal Robinson and Notre Dame center Scott
Paddock. They hailed from teams like the Yakima Sun Kings, the
Shreveport Crawdads and the Mexico Aztecas.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines, however, didn't know any better. As far as they
knew, the Pittsburgh Piranhas (Brian Davis, forward) played the
Chicago Bulls every night.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA finished 4-3, barely edging Uruguay in overtime, and
losing to the host team twice. When the Argentines won the
gold-medal game, 90-86, the standing-room-only crowd of 9,000
poured onto the arena floor, while players hugged and cried and
shouted, ``We beat the Dream Team! We beat the Dream Team!''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was only slightly less bogus than that game
against the Martians in ``Space Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, however, the day is long passed when we can send
over any 10 stiffs and expect to bring back the gold. Any gold.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hasn't won the men's gold medal at the Pan Am
Games since 1983. In 1991, a team that featured Grant Hill, Jim
Jackson, Christian Laettner and Eric Montross finished in third
place. And the last time a non-Dream Team of U.S. players competed
in the Olympics, 1988, it, too, could do no better than the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment that we don't have the NBA guys, but
it's happened, and the guys that are here are working real hard,''
said Rudy Tomjanovich, who is coaching Team Scab.
</P>
<P>
   It's happened, but it's wrong. This isn't an owners' thing. It's
a red, white and blue thing.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a message the NBA players are trying to send, it's
all Greek, so to speak. The ones who aren't going to Athens look
greedy, foolish and unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the whole world knows. Fan-tastic.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name: The city gained its name from a Wichita Indian
encampment near a small waterfall along the Wichita River. A flood
washed away the five-foot tall waterfall in the late 1890s. Nearly
100 years later, the falls are back. A man-made ``falls'' were
built by the citizens of Wichita Falls during the city's centennial
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Wichita Falls is home to 26 hotels, from staples
such as Holiday Inn and Ramada Inn to the Henrietta Township Bed
and Breakfast on the Square. Guests of the Henrietta can enjoy hot
bubble baths in an antique claw-footed tub and be catered to with
hot tea served in the room, gourmet breakfasts, homemade muffins
and a cup of hot chocolate before bed. Visitors choose from a
Pioneer room, Victorian room, Maw Belle Telephone Room, Cowboy Room
and Miss Katy Train Room. The hotel also features murder mystery
weekends; the mysteries are based on actual happenings in the area
and include period costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: Wichita Falls has 93 restaurants, ranging from
cafeterias to barbecue to Mexican, Italian and Oriental cuisine. In
addition to places such as Uncle Lynn's Catfish and Fat McBride's
Steakhouse, there is a dual fare establishment, Bubba's Burgers &AMP;
Christy's Mexican, that should keep everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: In addition to 12 shopping centers, Wichita Falls
has a set of popular attractions. The Wichita Falls Symphony
Orchestra, the Wichita Falls Ballet, the Wichita Falls Museum and
Arts Center and Wichita Theatre and Arts House should satisfy the
tastes of the art-starved.
</P>
<P>
   Historical sites include a World War Memorial, the Wichita Falls
Waterfall, the Spanish War Veteran Memorial and the Littlest
Skyscraper. Three lakes are within a 30-mile radius of the city,
including Lake Arrowhead State Park, which has 106 miles of
shoreline and offers camping, swimming, fishing, boating, wildlife
observation, hiking and horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife offers a bevy of country and western clubs, such
as Lonesum Dove and Little Brothers, which features the Lone Star
Six Pack band. The American Legion Post 202 offers dances every
Saturday. Graham Central Station has become the biggest attraction.
It has five clubs in one building, including a country dance area,
a karaoke show bar, a nostalgic dance area, a top 40 dance area, a
game room and a sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers crunch: Wichita Falls has a population of 103,312, until
Wednesday. It is a two-hour drive east from the Fort Worth-Dallas
area and two hours south of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Company is coming: Approximately 100,000 visitors are expected
to Wichita Falls during the month-long training camp. They won't be
empty-handed, either. Austin's Visitors Bureau said that the
Cowboys' presence in Austin represented an economic impact of $3
million per year.
</P>
<P>
   How hot is it? Wichita Falls is home of the Hotter 'N Hell
Hundred bicycle criterium. It's a moniker that city officials spend
plenty of time trying to downplay when luring tourists to town. So
how hot does it get? Officially, the normal temperature during July
and August ranges from 71.4 to 97.2 degrees, with an average high
reading of 96.6. Going out on a limb here, the Cowboys will be able
to count on one finger _ maybe with room to spare _ the number of
70-degree days they encounter during camp.

   ATLANTA -- Little-known Yankees general manager Brian Cashman is
starting to sound get a little cocky. Not that there's anything
wrong with that, but when asked recently about his team's 61-20
record in the first half, Cashman said, ``I honestly believe that
if you took one of these two All-Star teams and they played our
schedule, they'd be hard-pressed to do 61-20. It's not meant to put
anyone down; it's just a statement of how special our first half
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Even with their disappointing Incredible as it sounds
with a 40-50 record, the Orioles have made the fewest errors in
baseball, with 36. But they are 0-10 in games when they allow an
unearned run. ... The Orioles have used 11 different starting
pitchers this year, second only to the Cardinals. ... A leftover
from a game last weekend between the Red Sox and White Sox: The two
clubs managed to throw 378 pitches, but there were just four
strikeouts. ... Tampa Bay's Randy Winn, the 3,000th strikeout
victim of Roger Clemens, said, ``It's really not a shame, because
I'm going to strike out a lot more times.'' ... The Devil Rays have
faced Cy Young winners in 13 games this season for a 4-9 record.
... The Yankees are trying to work out a long-term deal with third
baseman Scott Brosius. ... The last time the Yankees had five
players at the All-Star Game but no position starters was in 1965,
when Elston Howard, Mickey Mantle, Joe Pepitone, Bobby Richardson
and Mel Stottlemyre were there.

   Typically, Most switch hitters typically don't stick switching
to just one side of the plate. But Minnesota's Dennis Hocking is
having trouble from the left side, and manager Tom Kelly met with
his young shortstop and strongly suggested a change. What was
Hocking's response? Said Kelly, ``I think he's receptive to the
idea of staying in the major leagues,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: There are problems with White Sox starter Jaime Navarro,
who said, ``Maybe this isn't the right team for me. Maybe I should
just get out of here, go to the bullpen or do something. I know I'm
not getting it done as a starter, and I don't know why. Maybe I'll
go in and ask for a trade, because it's not working out for me
here.'' Navarro is 7-10 with a 6.04 ERA. ... No wonder the Indians
have a 10 1/2-game lead in the division. They are 15-5 against
teams in the division this year. ... Cleveland's Kenny Lofton on
playing left field in the All-Star Game instead of his natural spot
in center: ``(Ken) Griffey. He's the man. He got 4 million votes.
Wherever he wants to play, it's up to him.'' ... Royals
right-hander Kevin Appier, who has been out since undergoing
surgery on his shoulder in March, is down in Florida throwing
simulated games.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Next time Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. thinks that he's going to
get some rest and skip decides to at first not to participate in an
event the fans want him to man who lived out a love-hate
relationship with the city's sports fans frequently attempted to
convince the populace he was ``for real.'' Few heeded Sanders'
words. At the ``Prime Time Tuesday'' study sessions, though, he has
no such problem maintaining attention, drawing a big crowd,
manifesting his humanity or detailing his shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Even last week, when the service was moved without notice from
the Grace Outreach Center to the more intimate Willow Bend Church a
few miles away, his followers found him, a small Christian convoy
snaking into the parking lot just before the 7 p.m. start. Only a
tiny van ferrying a contingent from the National Federation of the
Blind failed to locate the service.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders does not actively advertise the Bible study. There are
no fliers, no billboards along the North Dallas Tollway. Even a
recent article in a national magazine didn't give away the
location. ``People just sort of find their way somehow,'' said
Dallas Cowboys free safety Omar Stoutmire, who with Sanders and
tailback Emmitt Smith was baptized last October. ``Every week there
are new people who wander in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The worshippers last Tuesday included evangelists Jane Willhite
and Rosalind Baker of Kalamazoo, Mich. The two were in town to
visit The Potter's House, one of the country's fastest-growing
congregations. The interdenominational church was founded by the
Rev. T.D. Jakes, the man who baptized Sanders, Smith and Stoutmire,
and who last Thursday and Friday brought his message to large
crowds at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sanders donated $1 million to The Potter's House to
help fund ``Project 2000,'' a wide-ranging social service ministry
instituted by Jakes, the church's bishop. The donation included his
$465,000 advance for ``Power, Money and Sex: It's a Man Thing,''
his first book, which is to be published in October.
</P>
<P>
   The book, Sanders hopes, will be an extension of his burgeoning
lay ministry. His work includes weekly speeches at Dallas-area
schools, frequent visits with prison inmates and occasional
television appearances. But the Tuesday sessions, and the feeling
of grass-roots outreach which resonates from them, are closest to
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through word of mouth, (Sanders') service is talked up,''
Willhite said. ``And we didn't want to leave Dallas without seeing
it. It's a powerful thing, very inspirational.'' Said Syrenna
Joseph, a first-timer from the adjacent suburb of Carrollton:
``Deion, he has a message all people ought to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who will be 31 next month, readily conceded he was one
of the last to pay attention to the message. ``It is ironic, I
guess, that all these people can find Deion, and it took him so
long to find himself,'' said Viola Murphy of Irving, Texas, after
hearing Sanders preach at the Calvary Temple there.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friends and teammates, past and present, have confirmed
Sanders' claims that he has never touched alcohol, recreational
drugs or cigarettes. Only in moments of frustration has he cursed,
and last week he took offense when an article in ESPN magazine
featured the word ``damn'' in a headline. Close friend and onetime
Cincinnati Reds teammate Lenny Harris describes Sanders as ``the
most boring guy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sanders' vice was sex _ and plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delilah and Jezebel, they are real,'' said Sanders, admitting
to his weakness. ``Maybe I wasn't always looking for (women), but
they were finding me. But I wasn't closing the door, either,
really. I heard them knocking, and I didn't bolt the latch, you
know? I caved in to my biggest weakness. I surrendered to it. I
climbed into the pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have had another car, (but) that wouldn't have made me
happy. More jewelry or another (expensive watch)? Uh-uh. Really,
all the women didn't make me happy, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' epiphany coincided with his arrival at rock-bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a divorce from his wife, Carolyn, and the loss of his
daughter (Deiondra Yvonne) and son (Deion Luwynn Jr.), Sanders said
he twice attempted suicide while in Cincinnati. Other than to admit
he ``rehearsed the thing out'' and then botched the efforts,
Sanders declined to discuss the incidents. They will, he promised,
be a prominent chapter in his book. ``But you don't let someone
lick the bowl,'' he said, ``until you're finished icing the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   After one of the suicide attempts, Sanders said he was awakened
from his sleep by a bright light in his Cincinnati apartment, and
his conversion commenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say what they want (about his life's turnaround),''
Sanders said. ``All that's important is, I know where I've been,
who I've been and what I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics and conspiracy theorists seeking evidence of a
Sanders scam, of course, abound in and outside metropolitan Dallas.
Despite his donations of time and money, the naysayers note that
Sanders is hardly the second coming of St. Paul. He lives in a
development with golfer Fred Couples, NBA center Shawn Bradley and
several CEOs of Dallas-based corporations, and his driveway still
features an impressive collection of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But when one gives over his soul to Jesus, Sanders noted, it
doesn't necessarily follow that he must sacrifice all material
possessions. And others, said Paul Crouch, founder of the Trinity
Broadcasting Network and a new fan of Sanders' work, must reconcile
for themselves the seeming dichotomy of Sanders' obvious wealth and
the fact he plays in the NFL for the Cowboys _ a team that has led
the league in arrests _ and his new vocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just listen to Deion for a few minutes, and there can be no
doubting his sincerity,'' said Crouch, who recently hosted Sanders
as a TV guest.
</P>
<P>
   Broad appeal
</P>
<P>
   If there are doubting Thomases, they are not present at the
Willow Bend Church, where Sanders' conversion is viewed as a major
Christian turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings such a spirit to this place,'' says Jane Decker, who
attends the Bible study every week. ``The one week, when he was
visiting a prison and wasn't here ... there was a real void.'' Adds
fellow regular Patricia Howard: ``He's an instrument that brings in
the people, especially the young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fiery rhetoric of Sanders and David Forbes, the
pastor, in fact the most striking element of ``Prime Time Tuesday''
is the manner in which it appears to cut across demographics of
race, religion and socioeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   Most newcomers arrive expecting to see an assembly primarily
made up of African-American and Southern Baptist worshippers. But
on this Tuesday evening, the congregation is about 65 percent white
upper-middle and upper class and includes no fewer than five
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we're here for everyone,'' says Forbes, who every Tuesday
flies from his Columbus (Ohio) Christian Center to Dallas to team
with Sanders. In fact, while Sanders is the magnet that gets people
into the church for the first time, it may well be Forbes who draws
them back time after time.
</P>
<P>
   An eloquent and emotional speaker, Forbes' style is equal parts
Elmer Gantry revivalist tent meeting, hip-hop jargon, clever
word-play and evangelism. His points of emphasis are alternately
mesmerizing, sobering and knee-slapping funny, interrupted by the
assembly's very verbal approval.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the middle of the front row, stripped down to his
T-shirt at one point, a rapt Sanders is a willing student. Sanders
is in a gray area right now in his study _ a ``Bible baby,'' Jakes
calls him. He is learned enough to have authored an articulate
dissection of 2 Timothy, but still struggling to grasp the entire
message.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is integral to the session, and the worshippers
clearly enjoy Sanders' verbal byplay. At one point, he asks local
home builder Steve Roberts, a recent convert, to rise and
concluded: ``With Steve in our camp now, I know all his homes will
have strong foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the session, Sanders hums to the tune ``Lean
on Me,'' digresses briefly into his conversion and asks the
congregation to find a partner on whom to lean.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who met Sanders last year when agent Eugene Parker asked
his own pastor in Fort Wayne, Ind., to help him find help for his
client, concludes the service by asking all those who suffered from
depression or ever contemplated suicide to come forward and pray
with him. Sanders leads the small parade.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene that those who knew Sanders in his wilder days
might find unthinkable. In Atlanta, where Sanders sported his
trademark doo-rag, most fans might not recognize the guy who has
replaced it with a blue headband that has ``Jesus'' written across
it.
</P>
<P>
   They might be surprised to know that Sanders, who once got into
a slapping match with wide receiver Andre Rison at the Georgia
Dome, last year knelt in front of the fan who had dumped beer on
him in Washington and prayed aloud. The cornerback, who once high
stepped with interceptions, steps more gingerly now, he says, ``in
the footsteps of the Lord'' and greets opponents he once taunted
with scripture passages.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Romo, a friend and weekly visitor to the Bible study
class, concludes Sanders has ``recreated his soul.'' As the organ
blares out a snappy recessional and the night's amens begin to
fade, Forbes leaves little doubt he considers a reborn Sanders the
real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember this,'' Forbes says. ``You cannot clone a soul.''

<P>
   ATLANTA -- While everyone has praised Atlanta's Greg Maddux for
his pitching this season, his hitting has been overlooked. At the
All-Star Game, his .302 batting average was better than 15 players
there, and that's not including other pitchers. The group included
Juan Gonzalez (.293), Ken Griffey Jr. (.299), Kenny Lofton (.282)
and All-Star MVP Roberto Alomar (.291). Maddux went into the season
as a .173 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Here is something that may interest Maddux and David
Wells of the Yankees: Going into the All-Star Game, pitchers over
the years that started the game were a collective 716-264 in the
first half for a .731 winning percentage but after the break fell
off to .576 (407-300). ... Interesting that Mets pitcher Rick Reed
went to the All-Star Game but won't benefit from the revenue from
it. Reed was a replacement player and has not been allowed to join
the players union, so he won't get a pension when he retires. The
money the union receives from the All-Star Game goes into the
pension fund. ... The Phillies were upset that the Cardinals gave
J.D. Drew a $7 million deal. It has hurt Philadelphia's
negotiations with their first pick, the No. 1 choice in the draft,
Pat Burrell. The Phillies had picked Drew last year and, said
general manager Ed Wade, ``He never played professional baseball
and ended up with those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his chase after the Roger Maris home-run record, Mark
McGwire put out this warning before the second half began:
``Everything people are talking about is a projection. There's
always projections at the All-Star break and nobody realizes the
second half is the toughest part of the year. Let's be realistic,
there's a long way to go and a lot of things may happen. My goal is
to finish the season without having gray on my goatee.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: While McGwire has MVP numbers, some feel Astros leadoff
man Craig Biggio had a better first half. Biggio was hitting .323
at the break, .373 with men in scoring position and .425 with
runners on base. His on-base percentage was .398 and he leads the
league in runs with 75. He also is a Gold Glove. ... One of the
best quotes from the All-Star Game came from injured Cubs slugger
Sammy Sosa, who said, ``I have to control myself from wanting to
take batting practice. I'm just a bat boy and a hitting coach
trying to have a good time.'' Hitting coach? That's interesting
coming from a player whose strategy is simple: Swing as hard as you
can at all times. ... A team to watch in the second half is the
Reds, who won nine of 10 going into the break and picked up
talented young players Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes from the
Dodgers.West
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers found themselves 13 1/2 games back at the
break, they can take heart from the fact such deficits have been
overcome before. Take, for instance, the 1978 Yankees, who were 14
games back at the break but went on to win the World Series. And
the Braves in 1991 were 9 1/2 games back and won the division,
catching and passing, you guessed it, the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Diamondbacks have been showing slow improvement,
going 7-20 in April, 10-19 in May and 12-15 in June, although they
are 1-5 this month. ... One leftover from Andy Ashby's 75-pitch
complete game last Sunday. Here is the San Diego right-hander's
inning-by-inning pitch count: 8, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 11, 11, 10. ... The
Rockies realize they are not going to the postseason, but pitching
coach Frank Funk has come up with a reason to play better in the
second half: ``We can come back in the second half and make life
miserable for the opponents that think they are going to run away
with it.''

With ticket policy, NBA risks alienating fans 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL; 
CHICAGO _ No matter who wins the NBA's labor fight, it's clear who
the big loser will be.
</P>
<P>
   You, the fan.
</P>
<P>
   This is no shock, of course. When baseball had its strike in
1994 and let an October go by without a World Series, fans lost.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout sports history, work stoppages have been part of the
business. And each time a league has problems, fans are alternately
snubbed by multimillionaire owners and players, and then asked to
embrace sports when the games start anew.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the NBA locking out its players and nobody
expecting a collective-bargaining agreement before November, when
the regular season would start, fans are braced for another slap in
the face.
</P>
<P>
   They already have received one, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, season-ticket holders for the Rockets and all
28 other NBA teams are being asked to pay for their tickets in
full. For many teams, the deadline has passed.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing out of the ordinary about requiring ticket
holders to pay for a full season up front, but it does seem to be a
curious public-relations move during a summer when owners are being
captioned as greedy, inept and incapable of harnessing their
spendaholic ways.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled fans are a dime a dozen these days. But they have a
fair question when they ask why they should pay for a full season
ticket when even NBA commissioner David Stern has said he would not
be surprised if part of the 1998-99 season is lost to the labor
battle.
</P>
<P>
   At places such as Michael Jordan's restaurant and similar sports
bars across the country, fans are fed up with the games played by
owners, lawyers, agents and other powerful politicos in the sports
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're holding the public hostage,'' said Randy
Creamer, 42, a businessman who has lived in Chicago since 1975 and
was meeting friends at Jordan's last week. ``Fans are not even
considered in the equation by NBA owners. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad, really, because sports is nothing but big
business now. And I think fans are disgusted by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But NBA teams are banking on the fact fans won't turn
away, even as owners and players try to outgreed each other during
collective-bargaining negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, for example, have set Wednesday as the deadline for
season-ticket holders to pay for next season's seats. They mailed
notices in late May, well before the NBA imposed its lockout of
players, that payment for season tickets would be due in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proceeding with business as usual because we're
optimistic there will be a season as planned,'' Rockets spokeswoman
Angela Blakeney said. ``There will be a leaguewide policy for
refunds if games are lost due to the labor dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA representatives said the league must operate in a
business-as-usual mode because nobody can predict when the labor
standoff will be settled. With everything from tickets to
scheduling to marketing strategies to game operations, the NBA is
conducting its affairs as if the season will tip off on schedule in
early November.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of logistics, that makes sense. If the labor
impasse is solved in October, the league would be incapable of
starting the season on time without the proper preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to season-ticket holders giving an owner
thousands of dollars in July for a product that might not be
available until Jan. 1, fans wonder why a better payment schedule
couldn't be establish, perhaps an installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Rockets season-ticket holder says he is fed up with
sports in general and the NBA in particular, but walking away is
hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it all,'' says Alan Reid, who has had Rockets
tickets since 1973. ``And I'm sincere when I say I'm seriously
considering not sending in my money this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the owners have us over a barrel because they know
somebody will buy those tickets if I don't. And after 25 years,
I've got great seats that I'd really hate to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's seats _ at center court in the lower level _ cost $89.50
apiece last season. When he first purchased them in '73, they were
$8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disenchanted with the whole system,'' Reid said. ``The
players' salaries are ludicrous. Nobody else in society has had
their salary increase as fast as athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA salary cap has escalated from $3.1 million when it was
instituted in 1983 to an expected $30 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales and television revenue combine to defray the bulk
of that major expense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, an owner like the Rockets' Leslie L.
Alexander could generate about $20 million from ticket sales, which
will earn interest whether or not there's a lockout. And there will
be no player contracts to pay during a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think they'd have learned from the baseball snafu,
especially when it looked like the NBA was doing everything
right,'' said Peter Stark, a native New Yorker who lives in
Chicago, noting the NBA has ridden a wave of popularity through the
1980s and '90s and never has lost a game to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   Stark added there might be nothing fans can do to vent their
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the larger markets, it seems like there's always somebody
waiting in line for any seat that comes open,'' he said. ``I would
like to see fans get fed up, but I'm not going to hold my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Creamer: ``Sports are no longer about the general public.
It's corporate America that owns sports now. And I don't think it's
going to change for the next 20 or 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Creamer and family members were leaving Jordan's
restaurant to go to Comiskey Park for a White Sox game. The price
of their tickets _ $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it won't even be close to a sellout,'' Creamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Stern's term as commissioner, the NBA has enjoyed a
terrific run. Attendance has been at more than 90 percent of
capacity every season, and virtually every team has been profitable
over the long haul. The worth of franchises has increased more than
tenfold since the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The league last season signed a four-year, $4 billion television
contract with NBC. The owners are guaranteed $1 billion this
season, regardless of whether there is a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much of a gamble on NBC's part. The network usually
only televises one game _ on Christmas Day _ before Jan. 1. The
weekly telecasts don't start until after the Super Bowl in late
January.
</P>
<P>
   Even the worst forecasts don't have the NBA lockout going past
the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern claims nearly half of the 29 teams in the league lost
money last season. When he announced the lockout of players two
weeks ago, Stern said many owners would be better off financially
if there was no season rather than play under terms of the previous
labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but the NBA has done nothing to improve fan
relations with the current labor squabble. If the players union and
the league cannot compromise and have a new agreement in place in
time to start the season as scheduled, fans will let their anger be
known.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has spent the past four years trying to repair the
damage done by its strike in '94. And the scars are still evident.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the NBA can survive the same sort of problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, with season-ticket money set to start pouring in, the
league is walking a thin line with its popularity.

WICHITA FALLS RUSHING TO EMBRACE THE COWBOYS, BUT ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital) They're holding the big dance here beginning this
week, and the local girl is both all excited and more than a little
bit nervous. See, she can't quite figure out if her date is really
interested in her for who she is, or whether he's just using her
before moving on to someone a whole lot flashier. (end ital) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ To understand the psyche of a city, you
really have to live in it for a while. But to appreciate the
ambivalence many Wichita Falls residents admit feeling about the
arrival this week of the Cowboys, all you need do is talk to a few
of them. Folks such as David Gaines, a 52-year-old graduate
research assistant at Midwestern State University, where the
Cowboys open training camp Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gaines about the last time this many media crawled around
town and he recalls the day in May 1995 when a plane crashed into
an apartment building and parking lot on the north side of town,
killing two people. The accident, he remembers, attracted reporters
and camera crews from all the TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   The time before that, it was the killer tornado of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the kind of attention you want to get,'' he
testifies. ``We're hoping the Cowboys will be more of a positive
thing for the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the not-small matter of the Cowboys' reputation.
What kind of culture clash shall ensue when a group known for
trashing dorm rooms and making more court appearances than Judge
Wapner meets a town that touts family values over excitement?
</P>
<P>
   Gaines remembers going to see a touring production of ``The Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas'' nearly 20 years ago at a local hall.
When the actors let loose some pastel-blue language early in the
play, he recalls, ``There was a distinct take of breath in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't blame the 100,000 or so people in this city 120
miles north and west of Fort Worth-Dallas for holding their breath
for the duration of training camp. Outside media, who have
portrayed their community in an unflattering way before, are back,
complaining about too much heat and too little to do after hours.
And a football team known nationally in recent years for its
gun-toting coaches and drug-abusing players will be stuck in the
middle of their conservative home until the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course there are some mixed feelings about the Cowboys
coming to their town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they've acted in the past, well, I'd like for them to
act more like role models,'' says Juanita Westmoreland, 72,
speaking of the Cowboys character issue. ``I have four grandsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says ``90 percent'' of the people in her community
are excited about their coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're known as a little hick town,'' Westmoreland says
bluntly. ``This gives us a little prestige. And maybe with a new
coach, it'll be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Greg James, 45, understands full well the
conflicting feelings of his fellow towns people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the stories from Austin,'' he says, recalling the
room-trashing incident at St. Edward's University.
</P>
<P>
   He also wonders, as do many residents, whether Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones will pack up his summer place caravan and take it west
to El Paso next year. A bigger town, a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our city's bent over backwards for these guys,'' James says.
``I hope they're not just using us.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, there is talk of traffic congestion, exacerbated by nearby
road-construction projects, and parking problems in and around the
pleasant, leafy campus.
</P>
<P>
   Such collective anxiety make sense when put into the larger
context of civic history. The city's namesake falls, really just a
drop-and-a-splash at about five feet in height, were destroyed
around the turn of the century in _ irony of ironies _ a flood. A
``new'' falls was built, far taller and in three levels, about a
decade ago to satisfy inquiring tourists who found a bone-dry town.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rebuilt falls has all the charm of an
oversized miniature golf prop. Even residents deride it and its
murky water.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't hope for the best, but have concern for the worst?
</P>
<P>
   But if Wichita Falls residents are worried about the Cowboys'
behavior, or the team's possible departure after a single summer,
they're not showing it in their hospitality. It is difficult to
turn a street corner and not see a shop bearing a ``Welcome
Cowboys'' sign in the window.
</P>
<P>
   At the Midwestern school bookstore, fans bought the 700
available training camp commemorative T-shirts in less than a week.
Another 800 have been ordered.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney opened a Cowboys merchandise store in a vacant
auto-repair garage
</P>
<P>
   near the campus and filled it with team logo items ranging from
bait lures to helmet serving bowls to soap dispensers to shower
curtains. Business is brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the objective is, naturally, to make a buck.
Restaurants, bars, Sikes Senter Mall, the hotels and motels all
expect to earn their share of the estimated $3.5 million that is
spent in any city holding Cowboys training camp. Even a bed and
breakfast in Henrietta, 20 minutes away, is offering training-camp
weekend specials complete with tours of the area. But much of the
greeting seems sincere enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Texas way of doing things, to welcome people,''
explains Rick Brown, 38, manager of Jerry's Scoreboard, a local
sporting-goods shop.
</P>
<P>
   Optimistic as Brown is that the Cowboys' visit will help his
city's economy and image, he still fully expects Jones and company
to pull out next year. His mix of hopefulness and self-deprecating
realism seems common.
</P>
<P>
   Residents suggest visitors will be pleasantly surprised by what
they see in Wichita Falls. Yet, they add, it might not be as much
as they would like to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know where we are,'' says Meredith Nolan, a 21-year-old
Midwestern student, ``but they don't know what we have, which isn't
much compared to Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents appear equally modest when asked about rubbing the
padded shoulders of Cowboys players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm realistic,'' says 20-year-old Midwestern student Joey
Heenan. ``They probably no more want to talk to me than the man on
the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the jokes about Cowboys players having nothing to do at
night, because there's nothing to do, are met good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   Says Gaines, ``If the idea is to return the franchise's image to
the way it was in the days of Tex Schramm, this might be a good
place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Mertens, president and chief executive of the Wichita
Falls Board of Commerce and Industry, says his city is used to
handling big events, pointing to the annual bike race, the Hotter
'N Hell Hundred. The difference, he admits, is that training camp
lasts a month, not a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If Wichita Falls can pull off its role as host to America's
Team, it will provide the town a big boost, Mertens says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major morale builder,'' he says. ``The community is
given a sense of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Wichita Falls residents, such as Chris Scheer, owner of
The Plum Thicket, a Sikes Senter store, have somewhat lesser
expectations, the kind you might expect from a nervous girl
awaiting her big night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll just be nice to have something different in town,''
Scheer says. ``Things never really change much here.''

`PRETTY FACE' GORDON DRAWS CHALLENGE FROM FRESH FACE OF MAYFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Same as last summer, Jeff Gordon leads the NASCAR Winston Cup
points chase at the midseason turn.
</P>
<P>
   And this could be a good thing. The second half of the 1997
season produced the tightest three-way finish in Cup history, with
Gordon bagging his second championship in three years by a 14-point
margin over Dale Jarrett and a 29-point advantage over Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen races into 1998, the fresh face of Jeremy Mayfield has
emerged to join Martin, Jarrett and the usual suspects in pursuit
of Gordon. Much like Jeff Burton in 1997, Mayfield is in the midst
of a breakthrough season that has seen him win his first Cup race
and lead the standings for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the way it feels up there,'' said Mayfield, who is 40
points behind Gordon heading into today's Jiffy Lube 300 at New
Hampshire International Speedway. ``A lot of guys told me that once
you get a taste for winning _ once you get a taste for leading the
points _ you'll never be satisfied with second again. I'll tell you
what. I was never satisfied with second to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to win again and to do what we can to get that
points lead back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's rise to worthy contender rates as the headline story
of the first half, which reached 16 races June 28 at Sears Point
Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. Seventeen events, including the
rescheduled Pepsi 400 on Oct. 17 at Daytona International Speedway,
remain to decide a championship worth a guaranteed $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon earned his series-leading fifth pole position on the
redesigned road course in Sonoma, and went on to his fourth victory
of 1998, tying him with Martin in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, meanwhile, became the eighth different and only
first-time winner June 21 at Pocono International Raceway.
Mayfield, 29, has eight top-five and 10 top-10 finishes. That run
has allowed him to upstage Penske-Kranefuss Racing teammate Rusty
Wallace, the 1989 champion who paced the points race for eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Refinishes Chevrolet Monte
Carlo, tops the series in laps led with 864 of 4,962. But Mayfield
does not have a DNF _ Did Not Finish _ completing an amazing 4,953
of 4,962 laps (99.8 percent). Similar consistency carried Terry
Labonte, Gordon's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, to his second
Cup title at Gordon's expense in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have been this year is consistent,'' said
Paul Andrews, crew chief of Mayfield's No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus.
``The fact that we won Pocono doesn't automatically make us `the
guys to beat' the next week. But we think we've become one of the
guys to beat on a fairly regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, whose victories include the Texas 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth, is third _ 10 points behind Mayfield and 52
in back of Gordon. Jarrett, a two-time winner, also is within
striking distance, 74 points back of Gordon. With 17 races
remaining last year, Jarrett also was fourth _ but 172 points
behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Same time last summer, Mayfield stood 10th in points _ 569
behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're liking what we're doing right now,'' Mayfield said. ``We
have kept our nose right in the thick of things.'' THE RUMOR MILL
</P>
<P>
   Five items that might come to pass in the second half of the
NASCAR season:
</P>
<P>
   1. The 1999 Winston Cup schedule will expand by only one race,
to 34, with the addition of the reconfigured Miami-Dade Motorsports
Complex in Homestead, Fla. Best guess on a second race at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth is for the 2000 season, after NASCAR
completes its three-year commitment for non-points events in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   2. High-profile crew chief Larry McReynolds, dumped by Dale
Earnhardt and paired with Mike Skinner, will not return to work for
team-owner Richard Childress in 1999. Skinner, who has only one
top-10 result in 13 starts, could be axed sooner. One scenario has
McReynolds joining Joe Gibbs Racing as Winston Cup rookie Tony
Stewart's crew chief in '99.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jeff Gordon and crew chief/confidant Ray Evernham are
planning to form a team that will run a very limited, five-race
Busch Grand National schedule in 1999. Gordon's wife, Brooke, also
is expected to be a part owner. Gordon would drive, and Evernham,
who has been vocal about not wanting to be a crew chief forever,
will test the waters as team owner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Current Busch Grand National points-leader Matt Kenseth, a
protege of Roush Racing star Mark Martin, will join the Wood
Brothers as teammate to Michael Waltrip in 1999. The deal would be
an extension of the recently announced alliance between Wood
Brothers Racing and Roush Racing, in which the latter is providing
marketing, management and engine manufacturing services to the Wood
organization.
</P>
<P>
   5. Roush Racing could field a six-car Cup stable next year.
Current rookie-of-the-year contender Kevin Lepage has been signed
for a full ride in 1999. The final size of the Ford Taurus team
depends on whether Ted Musgrave is retained for another season.
RUMOR OF ALL RUMORS
</P>
<P>
   The rumor that Dale Earnhardt's storybook victory in the
season-opening Daytona 500 was ``manufactured'' by NASCAR refuses
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Earnhardt, the sport's second seven-time champion,
had been 0-for-19 in NASCAR's Super Bowl until his dominating
victory Feb. 15. Conspiracy theorists contend that NASCAR officials
allowed Earnhardt some sort of rules advantage _ most likely a
little larger restrictor plate atop his Chevrolet SB2 engine _ as a
payback for all ``The Intimidator'' has meant to the sport.
Earnhardt's emotional victory also served as a proper kickoff to
NASCAR's 50th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing theory. But whom among the doubters wants to be
the first to run it past Earnhardt, face to face? WHO'S HOT, WHO'S
NOT
</P>
<P>
   A look back at the headline news makers from the season's first
half: Hot, hot, hot
</P>
<P>
   1. Bruton Smith, Eddie Gossage and the management of Speedway
Motorsports Inc. All deserve kudos for the bold reconstruction of
Texas Motor Speedway. Told by NASCAR president Bill France Jr. on
April 5 to fix the track's water seepage problem or risk losing
their Cup date, Smith had the track torn up, a new drainage system
installed, the banked turns reconfigured and the entire surface
repaved in time for NASCAR Craftsman Truck/Pep Boys Indy Racing
League practice June 4. The track has yet to receive the Papal
Blessing, or Rusty Wallace's. But apparently, SMI got it right this
time.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jeremy Mayfield and crew chief Paul Andrews. Mayfield has
finished 15th or better in 13 of 16 races, and is the only driver
to post a top-25 result in every race in 1998. Andrews, who was
crew chief for dictatorial owner/driver Alan Kulwicki when he won
the Cup championship in 1992, deserves credit for his Ray
Evernham-like influence on young Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mark Martin and crew chief Jimmy Fennig. Martin has recorded
seven consecutive finishes of seventh or better, including
victories at the California and Michigan speedways. Martin also
goes into the record book as winner of the last Cup race at the
``old'' Texas Motor Speedway. Martin has matched series
points-leader Jeff Gordon in bonus points (75) and victories (four)
and has no DNFs compared to Gordon's two.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jeff Burton and crew chief Frank Stoddard. The latter has
taken some heat after replacing the popular Buddy Parrott as
Burton's chief wrench. But Burton said Stoddard was the team's
``hands-on'' chief last year when Burton won three races and
finished fourth in points for team-owner Jack Roush. A preseason
championship favorite to many, Burton has six top-10 finishes in
the past seven races to climb to eighth in points.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bobby Labonte and crew chief Jimmy Makar. Usually driving the
only Pontiac Grand Prix worth watching, Labonte has five top-10
finishes in the past six races and has improved a spot, to sixth,
from last year. That's stout, considering Joe Gibbs Racing has more
DNFs (3) than victories (2) this season. Not, not, not
</P>
<P>
   1. The Brothers Bodine. Todd Bodine was fired by team owner Bob
Hancher on Wednesday after failing to deliver for new and
big-dollar sponsor Tabasco. Bodine, the 1997 Busch Grand National
points runner-up, qualified for only seven Cup events and had only
one top-10 finish. Meanwhile, big brother Geoff Bodine has finished
23rd or worse in the past six races.
</P>
<P>
   2. Johnny Benson Jr. Has five consecutive finishes of 18th or
worse. In a Ford Taurus. Owned by Jack Roush. Cue up The Who,
because crew chief Steve Hmiel can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kyle Petty. With 14 finishes of 22nd or worse in 16 races,
Kyle, in the Not-So-Hot Wheels Pontiac, is among seven drivers who
have not scored a bonus point in 1998. Even Robert Pressley has
scored five bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   4. Derrike Cope. Has only one top-15 finish and five DNFs in his
Pontiac. But he lead four laps at Atlanta Motor Speedway, scoring
five bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   5. Kenny Wallace. His six DNFs tie him with fellow Taurus-driver
Geoff Bodine for the lead in that dubious category. RACES TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   1. Aug. 1, Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Talk
about your one-groove racetracks: This is it. But 300,000 fans and
the sound of the V8s reverberating off the ancient grandstands is a
rush. 2. Aug. 9, The Bud at The Glen, Watkins Glen (N.Y.)
International. Have a bad day on the second and last road-course
race of the season, and your championship hopes could turn to junk.
3. Aug. 22, Goody's 500, Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway. Touted as
the toughest ticket in NASCAR, thanks to night racing on the
half-mile oval's 36-degree banked turns. 4. Sept. 6, Southern 500,
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. What's more traditional than Labor Day
Weekend at NASCAR's oldest superspeedway? Pass the chicken, son. 5.
Oct. 11, Winston 500, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway. Break out the
superspeedway shocks and restrictor-plate engines, and hope to
avoid that inevitable ``One Big Wreck.'' 6. Oct. 17, Pepsi 400,
Daytona International Speedway. Rescheduled from July 4, this will
be the first time teams are forced to run back-to-back
restrictor-plate races. May the best driver, and engine shop, win.
7. Nov. 8, NAPA 500, Atlanta Motor Speedway. A championship chase
involving two, three or four drivers will pack them into the
lightning fast 1.54-mile quadoval. THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR FACTS AND
FIGURES FROM THE FIRST HALF: RECAPPING THE SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has 13 top-10 qualifying efforts, including five Bud
Poles. Both are tops among all drivers. Gordon has won five poles
in the past seven races.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton has five top-10 qualifying efforts in the past seven
races.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt has posted only two top-10 starts in 1998 and has
qualified in the first round (top 25) only five times. But three
have come in the past three races.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bodine, Steve Grissom and Darrell Waltrip are the only
drivers who have qualified for all 16 races without posting a
top-10 start.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin Jr. has been the top finishing rookie nine times.
Kevin Lepage has topped the rookie class six times and Jerry Nadeau
has done so once.
</P>
<P>
   Ten drivers have led the most laps in a race this season. Mark
Martin (four times), Jeff Gordon (three) and Jeremy Mayfield (two)
are the only drivers to lead the most laps more than once.
</P>
<P>
   After posting only one finish better than 30th in the first
eight races, Darrell Waltrip has finished 20th or better in seven
of the past eight events.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Musgrave and Kyle Petty are the only drivers who have
competed in all 16 races without leading a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett has led at least one lap in 13 of 16 races, most of
all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no back-to-back victories in the first 16 races.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight drivers have led laps in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Mark Martin's total of $1,823,630, eight drivers have
more than $1 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The first eight races produced eight different pole winners, a
modern-era record. There have been 10 different pole winners in the
first 16 races. TOP-FIVE PERFORMANCES
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five of the 80 top-five finishes of 1998 have been scored
by multi-car teams. The breakdown is Roush Racing (19), Penske
Racing (16), Hendrick Motorsports (15), Robert Yates Racing (11),
Richard Childress Racing (two), Team Sabco and Petty Enterprises
(one each) and Elliott Racing (zero).
</P>
<P>
   All five Roush Racing drivers have scored a top-five finish, as
follows: Mark Martin (eight), Jeff Burton (six), Johnny Benson Jr.
(three) and Chad Little and Ted Musgrave (one each).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has 10 of the 15 top-five finishes scored by
Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt has both top fives for Richard Childress Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven drivers comprising Team Sabco, Elliott Racing and
Petty Enterprises, only Joe Nemechek and John Andretti (one each)
have a top-five result. SUPERSPEEDWAY ACES
</P>
<P>
   Twelve races have been run on superspeedways, tracks measuring
one mile or longer. Jeff Gordon leads all drivers with points
earned on those tracks with 1,788. Jeremy Mayfield is second, three
points behind.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin has nine top-10 finishes in 12 superspeedway starts,
most of any driver. Martin also has earned 70 lap leader/bonus
points on those tracks, most of any driver.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the top-10 drivers in the superspeedway rankings are
involved in a multi-car team arrangement. The exceptions are Bobby
Labonte and Jimmy Spencer. CAR WARS
</P>
<P>
   All three manufacturers have posted at least one victory this
season. Ford and Chevrolet each have seven victories, and Pontiac
has two.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford Taurus has claimed 50 of the 80 top-five finishes. A
Chevrolet Monte Carlo has scored 23 top fives and a Pontiac Grand
Prix has only seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has led 2,611 of the 4,962 laps raced. Chevrolet has led
1,971 laps, and Pontiac has paced 380 laps.
</P>
<P>
   The road-course event at Sears Point Raceway marked the first
time in 1998 that two Pontiac drivers _ John Andretti (third) and
Bobby Labonte (fourth) _ finished in the top five. STILL WINLESS
</P>
<P>
   Five drivers who scored victories in 1997 are winless at
midseason: Jeff Burton (three victories last year), Ricky Rudd
(two) and John Andretti, Ernie Irvan and Rusty Wallace (one each).
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen active drivers remain winless during their Winston Cup
careers. The top five in 0-fers are Michael Waltrip (378 races),
Dick Trickle (268), Rick Mast (261), Ted Musgrave (232) and Wally
Dallenbach Jr. (146).
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt ended a 59-race winless streak, the longest of
his career, with his victory in the season-opening Daytona 500. The
driver who has won at least one race now mired in his
career-longest winless streak is Rusty Wallace, who has gone 45
consecutive races without a victory. NUTS AND BOLTS
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte leads active drivers with 585 consecutive starts,
a Winston Cup record.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin has been running at the finish in the past 32 races.
</P>
<P>
   Owner/driver Ricky Rudd has won at least one race in each season
from 1983 to 1997, a stretch of 15 consecutive years.

Vasser has financial incentive in Cleveland Grand Prix 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Starting from the pole is always nice, but winning
the pole for the Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland gives Jimmy
Vasser a financial opportunity no CART driver has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   If Vasser wins today's race on the runways of the Burke
Lakefront Airport, he will claim the official $100,000 purse for
the victory. But he also will add a $265,000 bonus from the
Marlboro Pole Award, making a pole-to-checkered flag-finish worth a
total of $365,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest amount of bonus money in CART history, but
Vasser said it won't be on his mind when the race begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is great and it would be fantastic to win it, but it
won't change the way I do things in the race,'' said Vasser, who
drives the Target Reynard/Honda. ``I will have the same motivation
and determination I have in every race.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser's lap of 134.385 mph from Friday's first qualifying
session held up when the drivers took the course again Saturday. At
road courses, CART drivers have qualifying attempts Friday and
Saturday, but it's rare when the speeds Friday hold up for the
Saturday session.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer weather made the speeds slower Saturday, but two drivers
managed to move up near the front. Dario Franchitti turned a lap at
133.868 mph to qualify second. Alex Zanardi, the defending champion
at Cleveland and Vasser's teammate, moved up to third with a speed
of 133.658 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi, the 1997 CART champion and the current points leader,
won the pole last year at Cleveland, and Vasser won the pole in
1996 on his way to the CART championship. The two men who drive for
Chip Ganassi have dominated the event, but Zanardi teased his
teammate about why Vasser won the pole this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is still angry with me because I told him Americans are
better at everything except motor sports,'' Zanardi said. ``I think
it fired him up, so he should thank me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for Jimmy. Our cars have been running almost
identical, so the only thing he had better than me must have been
his right foot. But I'm still going to kick his tail tomorrow. I'll
probably get by him on that first turn of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the pole-winner won a CART event was one year ago
when Zanardi won on the Lake Erie shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has the circuit gone an entire year without a
pole-sitter claiming victory, which is why the Marlboro Pole Award
is at a record total. The previous high for the pole bonus was
$160,000, which was claimed by Al Unser Jr. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Any driver who wins a race at an event where he won the pole
earns a bonus worth $15,000. But that bonus money rolls over to the
next race if the man on the pole does not win the race, building up
to an ever-increasing amount until someone accomplishes the feat.
</P>
<P>
   As the pole bonus has increased this season, the importance of
qualifying has increased with it. Drivers are working harder and
taking more chances in qualifying runs to try to earn the pole and
get a chance at the money.
</P>
<P>
   Many CART drivers have contracts worth millions of dollars, but
the chance to take home $365,000 is more than all but two drivers
have earned in prize money this season. Zanardi has claimed
$590,000 in purse money and Greg Moore has earned $383,250.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, 32, has won $359,250 this year, so the Californian can
more than double his 1998 earnings with a victory today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy to win a race,'' Vasser said. ``So many things
can factor into the outcome, but the money won't be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil de Ferran, who qualified 11th in the Valvoline
Reynard/Honda, thinks Vasser might be trying to hide his true
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't like to get that kind of money,'' de Ferran said.
``And this is a track where the guy on the pole has a good chance
to win the event. If you're fast, you have a chance to put some
distance on the field when you are out in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser and Zanardi have been in front of the other drivers for
most of the past two months. Zanardi has won three of the past four
CART events, and Vasser won the other, so it's a good possibility
one of the Target cars will be in front at the end today. But only
Vasser has a shot at an extra quarter of a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you I will give it everything I've got,'' Vasser
said. ``But I'll do it for the points, not for the money.''

 &HT;    Home venue attracts Adkins
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Another time and place, Derrick Adkins would call in
his regrets. But tender hamstring and all, the Atlanta Olympic
hurdles champion returns home to New York to compete in the
Goodwill Games, which begin next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't here, I probably wouldn't be running,'' said
Adkins, an Atlanta resident and Georgia Tech graduate who grew up
four miles from where the track competition will be contested on
Long Island. ``I'm not in top condition right now. I think I'll be
able to have a good race, but not an Olympic performance or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The four days of track competition, kicking off next Sunday with
Adkins in the 400-meter hurdles and Marion Jones headlining the
women's 100 meters, is the marquee sport of the Games, which offers
competition in 14 other sports as well over a two-week period. The
track meet will feature at least nine Atlanta Olympic gold
medalists, including Michael Johnson (400 meters), Dan O'Brien
(decathlon), Gail Devers (100) and Donovan Bailey (100).
</P>
<P>
   To attract top track athletes, the Goodwill Games is putting up
$1.8 million in prize money and a lucrative bonus program.
Officials are promising as much as $100,000 for a world-record
performance and $40,000 to winners in a half-dozen events,
including the men's and women's 100 meters, both 400 meters, the
decathlon and heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   For Adkins, though, it's just a chance to run on the same
Mitchell Athletic Complex track where he trained as a high school
kid and competed in the Nassau County schoolboy championships.
</P>
<P>
   After an injury-riddled season _ and with U.S. champion Bryan
Bronson and runner-up Angelo Taylor, a Georgia Tech sophomore, in
the field _ Adkins says he'd be content to finish in the top three.
At this point, he's not even sure if he'll run again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important for me to run here,'' Adkins said.
``I've been looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins is one of several top athletes who are ailing. Johnson,
star of the Atlanta Games, has dropped out of the 200 because
nagging leg injuries have cut into his training. Chances are he
won't be favored in the 400, having finished third last week at the
Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Atlanta sprinter Gwen Torrence is in doubt.
Because of a severe strain of her left hip flexor and quad muscle,
Torrence has withdrawn from the 100 and 200. If she runs at all, it
will be the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still not healed, and she's about 90 percent at
practice,'' said Manley Waller, her coach. ``She can't do anything
fast. So she might need to leave the shorter sprints alone for a
year or so. At least the 400 allows her to gradually pick up speed
as she goes.'' Even with Torrence out of the 100, the race figures
to be closely watched with Olympic champion Devers and Jones, who
has ruled the event since joining the circuit last year. The men's
race offers a rematch of the 1997 World Championships, with Maurice
Greene and Bailey again headlining a field that could challenge
Bailey's world record set in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The meet also features O'Brien in his first decathlon since
capturing gold in Atlanta, while the incomparable Jackie
Joyner-Kersee competes in her final heptathlon before retiring
after this season.

 &HT;    Craven's road to recovery
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Ricky Craven dispensed with the butterflies
Friday in winning the pole for today's Jiffy Lube 300. Now, he can
go forhis first Winston Cup victory on the track where he gained
fame early.
</P>
<P>
   Craven returns to the Winston Cup circuit following an almost
four-month absence while battling post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put this thing in prespective,'' Craven said.
``Winning the pole was a big step. Now, I need a win. That's the
next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left the sport following an examination in Atlanta,
Craven didn't know when he would return. His doctors said recovery
would take at least three months but told him it was something that
could be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   But they made no promises. For the first time in his life,
apprehension became his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me encouragement, but it was awfully difficult to
sit home on Sunday and watch the show go on without you,'' Craven
said. ``My greatest concern following that meeting was medically
getting myself back to 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He's there now. He passed the initial test two weeks ago,
finishing ninth in the Busch Grand National event at Watkins Glen.
That gave him the confidence for a full confrontation on the
Winston Cup level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all knew that Ricky would come back, we just didn't
know when,'' said Jeff Gordon, his Hendrick Motor Sports teammate.
``I think we saw in qualifying Friday, where he won the pole, just
how far he'd come back.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't coincidental that Craven made the Jiffy Lube 300 his
return. New Hampshire International Speedway is nearly home Craven,
a native of nearby Newburgh, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He has raced 20 times here NASCAR's Busch North series, winning
the series championship in 1991. He was the circuit's most popular
driver twice, in '90 and '91.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bypassed a few races to wait for this,'' Craven admitted.
``One of the key elements missing for me was confidence. We knew we
would have more confidence coming back here. Everything just played
out perfectly. It was just awesome winning the pole. That was the
perfect script.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight was rolling down pit lane after winning the pole
and getting high fives from his team, then Gordon, who had the pole
wrapped up until Craven ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty emotional day for me,'' Craven said. ``I feel
like I'm home again and whole again.''

MELVIN THRIVES BY RELYING ON ATTENTION TO DETAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Inspiration lies readily available at Doug
Melvin's fingertips in his stately center-field office overlooking
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   His desk and bookshelves are lined with biographies and how-to
books written by or about some of the great minds of the 20th
century, including Winston Churchill, Pat Riley, Red Auerbach,
George Will and Don Shula.
</P>
<P>
   The Churchill biography, which has been in Melvin's office since
he was hired as Rangers general manager in 1994, could be
particularly useful should he want to give his team a rousing
speech about fighting the American League on the hills, beaches and
in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I haven't read that one yet,'' Melvin said with a
smile. ``I've been meaning to, but I haven't gotten to it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Will, the Pulitzer Prize-winning political analyst,
Melvin said, ``I've read his baseball books. He sends them to me. I
knew him in Baltimore. But I haven't read his political books;
they're a little hard to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's vast collection of baseball books are not, and they
don't have the layer of dust that covers Churchill's life story.
``Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book'', a baseball primer written by
a pioneering Hall of Fame executive who built championship teams
for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers, gets plenty
of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in there is pretty interesting,'' Melvin said. ``It
just shows you how brilliant he was and how far ahead of his time
he was. I think it's good to know as much about the past of
baseball as you can. I'm a big believer in managing by
storytelling, and baseball is great at that. It helps you sell an
idea a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wanted to give Dave Stieb a chance, some people thought
I was nuts because he hadn't pitched in four years. I remember
though when Fernando Valenzuela hadn't pitched in a while in
Baltimore, but we thought he could get people out with his
knowledge of pitching. He won some big ballgames for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Rickey's 50-year-old book are two more recent
books about baseball managers, a biography of Hall of Famer Connie
Mack written in 1950, a biography of Rogers Hornsby and ``Lords of
the Realm'', the definitive history of baseball's labor troubles.
On a coffee table are 40-year-old copies of ``Baseball Digest''.
Stat books, scouting folders and media guides are piled on a
cupboard behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin also has access to numerable studies done by his baseball
people, including one about the on-base percentages of all Rangers
minor-leaguers, one about all major-leaguers who have had to repeat
a season in the minors and one
about termination pay owed by every major-league team the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The office is a portrait of a baseball junkie but also a person
who, Arizona Diamondbacks vice president Roland Hemond said, ``has
a great feel for the game. He has very good analytical mind, he's
very thorough and he's always well-prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Others confirm that opinion of the man who is currently focused
on trying to arm the Rangers with more starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with Doug, he has always been very
straightforward,'' Florida Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski
said. ``He knows what you need and what his desires are and what
are the strengths of each organization. That shows you he's always
well-prepared and organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Any baseball man would learn to be meticulously prepared if his
first job in baseball was working for George Steinbrenner, the most
demanding owner in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin started with the New York Yankees by doing menial tasks
and eventually worked his way to the key position of scouting
director. Melvin knew being unprepared when Steinbrenner calls is
the fastest way to have a budding baseball career come to a
premature end.
</P>
<P>
   ``George kept you on your toes,'' Melvin said. ``If he was
talking about a trade with someone, he would want to know who the
top 10 prospects in the organization were. And he wanted to know
right away. He didn't want you to go look it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president Tom Schieffer isn't quite as demanding, but
the work habits haven't changed. Under Steinbrenner, Melvin left
for work at dawn and didn't get home until the wee hours of the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   His day usually doesn't end until the last out of the last game
on the West Coast, sometime after midnight. He has a satellite
system at home, which allows him to watch any and all major-league
games. It's probably why he hasn't delved into Churchill yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to read for 30 minutes or so every night after the
family had gone to bed,'' Melvin said. ``Now, I go home after our
game, and the West Coast games are on. Plus they have that Classic
Sports Network. I like watching that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the family gets neglected. Melvin has watched many a
game in the family room while pitching a foam ball to his son,
Cory. While Cory takes batting practice and whacks the ball off the
walls, Melvin keeps an eye on the television for a player who might
eventually help the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has also consummated two trades while attending family
reunions in Canada and has talked to agents on a cellular phone
while taking Cody and his daughter, Ashley, swimming at a local
water park. He even coached third base for his son's Little League
team, although sources said Melvin's performance suggested he
should not quit his day job.
</P>
<P>
   His children don't need a bat or glove to get their father's
attention. On a recent road trip to Arizona, Melvin and the two
children rose at 4 a.m. to take a one-hour hot-air balloon ride in
the desert. Branch Rickey probably never did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to see the sun come up, and it was absolutely quiet in
the desert,'' Melvin said. ``We were a mile high, and you could
hear a dog bark on the ground below.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers then went on to San Francisco, allowing Melvin and
his family to spend Friday afternoon touring Alcatraz Island and
the notorious prison. On Saturday night, they took a cable-car ride
then had dinner in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very family-oriented person,'' Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Road trips also allow Melvin to catch up on some actual
recreational reading. He just finished ``Into the Wild'', a true
account of a boy who leaves his privileged eastern upbringing and
sets out on his own into the Alaskan wilderness. Next on his list
is ``Into Thin Air'' by John Krakauer, the true story of an
ill-fated climb of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do read some,'' Melvin said. ``I've read all of John
Grisham's books. I like mysteries, those kind of books. But I'm a
slow reader. My kids are always getting on me about that. I'll
start a book in spring training, then here it will be the All-Star
break, and they'll say, `You haven't finished that yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reading and movies, Melvin has few hobbies outside
baseball. His one other passion is basketball. Melvin loves pickup
games but not always for their recreational benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very competitive,'' Ellen Melvin, his wife, said. ``He
called our daughter, Ashley, the other day and said he and
(assistant general manager) Dan O'Brien were going to go play
basketball. She said, `Daddy, don't you know what's going to
happen? You're going to be hurting for three days.' You're going to
be saying, ``Oh my back, oh my knee.'' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin has ulterior motives. He said he can tell much about
a person just from the way they play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell how competitive a person is,'' Melvin said. ``You
watch when they lose. Do they say, `That's enough for today,' or do
they say, `Let's go again?' I like to see their reaction or if they
take all the shots or if they congratulate a teammate after making
a shot. You can learn a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin doesn't come across as competitive. He has an easy-going
air about him, and friends describe him as patient, level-headed
and even-tempered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to push him to get him past his breaking
point,'' Ellen Melvin said. ``He doesn't panic. I do that enough
for everybody. But he's always calm.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also driven. He was a mediocre minor-league pitcher who
never got past Double A. Realizing his limitations, Melvin was
preparing himself for a front-office job in baseball even before
his playing days were finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I recognized I wasn't going to be a major-league pitcher,
I used to watch the other team take infield while my teammates
would go inside,'' Melvin said. ``I would sit there and try to
identify who were the prospects and the players. My manager, Mike
Ferraro, would come up to me and ask, `All right, who is going to
be in the major leagues?' ''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates in the minors called him ``Scoop'' because he
would devour daily newspapers and ``The Sporting News'', analyzing
each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would quiz him on the bus,'' said Arizona manager Buck
Showalter, a teammate in the minor leagues. ``We would ask him,
`Were is this player now?' Doug would know. He'd say `New Britain'
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin did hold a variety of off-season jobs outside baseball.
He worked in a factory machine shop, picked apples, delivered
furniture and was a school janitor, working the graveyard shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that job,'' Melvin said. ``After I got the rooms
cleaned up, I'd go into the gym and shoot baskets for a couple
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never has considered a career outside baseball, even if
his first job with the Yankees was pure drudgery. He started with
the Yankees in 1979 compiling scouting reports for Yankees manager
Bob Lemon, charting pitches and throwing batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Lemon told me way back then,'' Hemond said. ``He told me,
`Roland, there's a fellow with the Yankees who if you ever get the
chance, you should hire him.' He's got a real good baseball mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemond would find out first-hand. Melvin was already with the
Orioles when Hemond became general manager in 1988. Melvin would
become his assistant. Hemond would become his mentor. Together,
they rebuilt a once-proud franchise that suffered through an
extremely embarrassing 107-loss season in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   When Rangers president Tom Schieffer went looking for a new
general manager after firing Tom Grieve in 1994, he solicited
opinions from a number of people in baseball as to who would be a
strong candidate. Melvin's name was on everybody's list.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Rangers won their first division
championship, and Melvin was honored as American League executive
of the year in a survey of fellow general managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be successful,'' Melvin said. ``I want to be one of
the best. You have to take pride in it, because this position is
only one of 30 in the game. I don't live in fear of losing my job,
but I realize we better win, and I understand Tom Hicks wants to
win. But I feel my job is to make sure this club is competitive
year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the John Elway Theory. The Denver Broncos were
always competitive year after year, and last year they finally won
it. That's what I'd like to see happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't happen, it won't be because the general manager
was brushing up on the life and times of a certain former British
prime minister.

 &HT;    In praise of women: Author, preacher T.D. Jakes rocks Georgia
Dome
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bishop T.D. Jakes glided across the pulpit like a
dancer, his shirt soaked in sweat, and raised his arms in
exultation as 52,000 screaming women rocked the Georgia Dome on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women!'' Jakes growled, ``thou art loosed!''
</P>
<P>
   Loosed they were. Screams erupted. Women crumpled to the floor
in tears. Some pounded their chairs in relief or turned to give
strangers high-fives. A squad of women bolted toward the stage
where, feet furiously pumping, they did a Holy Dance.
</P>
<P>
   On a sticky Saturday where the mercury topped 90 degrees, Jakes
unleashed some heat of his own. Jakes preached a 90-minute sermon
on the final day of his ``Women, Thou Art Loosed!'' conference that
solidified his standing as one of the country's top preachers.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon's theme _ building a woman's self-esteem _ was simple
but powerful because no other preacher has bothered to zero in on
the angst of Christian women. Jakes, who has already written nine
Christian best sellers, has just released another book for women,
``The Lady, Her Lover and Her Lord'' (G.P. Putnam's Son, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Jakes demonstrated his ability to connect with women at numerous
times during his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you when real prayer starts,'' Jakes said. ``You start
praying when your rent is past you due, you can't get your kids to
school and you're hoping that Freddy doesn't call you tonight
because you're lonely. That's when you pray.''
</P>
<P>
   And in one particularly touching moment, Jakes called his wife,
Serita, to the stage to profess his admiration for her. As she
rested her head on his chest, Jakes turned toward the women in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made a lot of sacrifices to make me available to you,'' he
said. ``All those nights when I was writing about love I would
rather have been making love.''
</P>
<P>
   The women in the crowd roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I be real?'' Jakes responded as they roared even louder.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' ability to be real is part of his popularity. His
television show, ``Get Ready with T.D. Jakes,'' airs three times a
week on Black Entertainment Television and the Trinity Broadcasting
Network. His church in Dallas, The Potter's House, has gained
14,000 members in the past 18 months. Even celebrities such as NFL
star Deion Sanders have professed their admiration for Jakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real, He doesn't polish anything,'' said Christine Ward,
58, who traveled from Savannah to hear Jakes. ``He takes the Word
and makes it vibrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said she first heard about Jakes from her daughter _ who
called from Egypt where she had seen a broadcast of one of Jakes'
sermons.
</P>
<P>
   As she read Jakes' books, Ward said she was struck by Jakes'
humble beginnings. He grew up poor in a small West Virginia town
and struggled to cope with the early death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of preachers are puffed up,'' Ward said. ``But men like
T.D. Jakes, you can reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' humility is what also brought Leisha McDaniel to the
Georgia Dome on Saturday. McDaniel, 33, said she was moved by
Jakes' struggle to lose weight (he recently lost 100 pounds).
``He's human,'' McDaniel said. ``He worries about things everybody
else worries about.''
</P>
<P>
   He is human, but Jakes is also something else _ a preacher on
the rise, said Noel Erskine, a associate professor of theology at
Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakes is an icon,'' Erskine said. ``Jakes is like the new
Martin Luther King. He sets the tone. All the preachers, black and
white, are trying to preach like him now.''

 &HT;    Bombings suspect leaves agents still on the hunt
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The team of federal agents still searching western
North Carolina for Eric Robert Rudolph has been there long enough
to watch the seasons change and encounter a new set of obstacles:
With freezing temperatures long gone, summer foliage makes mountain
forests even denser.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force still believe Rudolph,
wanted in the Jan. 29 bom-- ing of a Birmingham abortion clinic, is
in western North Carolina. That conviction is based in part, they
say, on reports that Rudolph told people that if trouble ever came,
he would hide among the familiar shadows, crags and cliffs of the
Blue Ridge, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, hasn't been seen beyond the foothills since Jan.
30, federal agents said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there have been numerous reports of sightings in western
North Carolina, none of which resulted in apprehension,'' said Jack
Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. ``Some can be eliminated _ that it was not
him. In other cases, we don't know whether it was him or not. The
people who were calling in believed they saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Elvis, Rudolph has been reported spotted in cars, in
stores, and crossing the road, only to disappear into mountain
meadows. Unlike Elvis, Rudolph is believed to be alive and well,
and information leading to his capture is worth $1 million in
federal rewards. Agents want witnesses to especially look for the
scar that crosses Rudolph's chin. The number to call is
1-888-ATF-BOMB. In Atlanta and Birmingham, agents with the ATF,
FBI, GBI and Birmingham Police Department continue gathering
evidence in bombings at Centennial Olympic Park in July 1996, a
Sandy Springs abortion clinic in January 1997, an Atlanta gay
nightclub in February 1997 and at the Birmingham abortion clinic,
which killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that the investigation is all one
investigation,''said Woody Enderson, the FBI inspector in charge of
the bomb task force. ``And that's true from both the substantive
standpoint in trying to develop evidence and from a fugitive
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has not been charged in the Atlanta bombings and neither
Killorin -- or Enderson would say if they have been able to place
Rudolph in metro Atlanta during the time of the bombings here.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said agents have studied a possible courtroom
presentation in the Birmingham case that could include thousands of
pieces of evidence and hundreds of witnesses. ``We want to be ready
when he's arrested to move as quickly as the prosecutors want to
move,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has brought in Terry Turchie to command the North
Carolina search. Turchie helped direct the search for the Unabomber
from the bureau's San Francisco office and has a background in
counterterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a person who is a team builder,'' said his former FBI
boss, Jim Freeman, who is retired. ``He's someone who can have the
respect of the agents with the FBI and other agencies. It's one of
the hardest things to do _ work in multijurisdictional
situations.'' About 35 agents have made Murphy, N.C., and Andrews,
N.C., second homes. They lease an office in Andrews, they rent
apartments, attend church and are invited to cookouts at the homes
of locals, agents say.
</P>
<P>
   And they are chipping away at the distrust of local residents
with this message: They are not looking for moonshiners, poachers
or marijuana growers. They are not the advance team for the New
World Order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given one consistent message to the people in the
area, and that is we're here for one reason and one reason only _
to find Eric Rudolph,'' Turchie said. ``When we finish our job, we
will leave.''

 &HT;    South searching for `New Democrats'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- After a disastrous year recruiting Southern
Democrats to run for Congress, especially in Georgia, the
Democratic Party is looking to a handful of ``New Democrats'' from
North Carolina to Texas to lead the party back from near extinction
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting that Southern Democrats will regain the
ground lost in 1994 when Democratic incumbents dropped like weekend
joggers in the Peachtree Road Race. Rather, the party is looking
for ``symbolic'' victories in a few House races and an upset or two
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was in Atlanta Thursday to drum up some
campaign cash for Democratic Senate hopeful Michael Coles, a
self-made millionaire hoping to topple Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.)
and one of the South's new crop of Democratic challengers.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule these so-called New Democrats are more likely
to be business people than lawyers; less likely to rely on labor
union support; and arguably more conservative than even Clinton on
a handful of social issues such as abortion, sex education and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   They embrace Clinton's call to devote budget surpluses to the
Social Security trust fund and praise the president's handling of
the economy. But they also are trying to cultivate independence
from Clinton, who coined the term New Democrat when he chaired the
Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) in 1991 and prepared to run for
president as a conservative Southerner from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are much freer to run truer to their own beliefs and
closer to their districts and not feel as though they have to mold
themselves to any particular ideology, which traditionally has been
a little bit out of touch with where Southern Democrats really
were,'' says Simon Rosenberg, director of the New Democrat Network,
a political action committee planning to distribute $1 million to
new Democratic candidates this year. ``It's the end of the old
liberal Democrat orthodoxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain of the team
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton passed through the Cincinnati airport recently,
Democratic House candidate Ken Lucas of Boone County, Ky., went to
the airport to tell the president he shouldn't have vetoed
legislation banning late-term abortions and urged him to spend some
time with Kentucky tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for Clinton when I think he's right and I'm against him
when I think he's wrong,'' says Lucas, judge-executive of Boone
County, the equivalent of county commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the 64-year-old Lucas could be the captain of the
Southern New Democrat team. Campaigning to fill the seat being
vacated by Rep. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.), who is running for Senate,
Lucas is a financial planner with longstanding ties to the northern
Kentucky business community. He was both chairman of the local
chamber of commerce and a member of the state chamber of commerce
board, positions that have helped him reel in checks from such
traditional GOP sources as the associations representing home
builders, bankers and wholesale distributors.
</P>
<P>
   He is anti-abortion, defends the right to bear arms and supports
term limits, pledging to serve only three terms himself if elected.
His opponent, Kentucky state Rep. Gex ``Jay'' Williams, is the
favorite of religious conservatives and is being advised by former
Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be comfortable in our party,'' said Rep. John Linder
(R-Ga.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ``I don't think he'll win, but if he did he could switch
because he stands for pro-life and pro-gun and his stands on a
balanced budget may make him very uncomfortable with a party that
doesn't agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanche Lambert Lincoln, the Democratic nominee for Senate in
Arkansas, also is pushing her conservative ties with voters.
Lincoln, a former member of Congress from Arkansas, was a so-called
Blue Dog Democrat in the House, a group of fiscally conservative
Democrats who championed a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln reminds voters that she opposed the Brady Bill mandating
waiting periods to buy handguns, and boasts that she is a frequent
duck hunter. She also supports voluntary prayer in school.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 9 Arkansas primary runoff, Lincoln triumphed over a
Democratic opponent who had the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the
nation's umbrella labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the DLC and a
Democratic moderate, says the party has been forced to accept more
conservative candidates _ particularly in the South _ out of
political necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about electing people,'' Lieberman says. ``Being
in a minority will tend to make you more tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the year Georgia's congressional delegation went from
majority Democrat to majority Republican, exit polls in the South
showed that Democrats were supported by only 20 percent of voters
who described themselves as conservatives, according to Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never win a majority of those folks, but if we are down
in the 20s we are going to be the minority party in the South for a
long time,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn the tide
</P>
<P>
   Probably no Southern Democrat has been more aggressive in trying
to reverse that trend than Joe Turnham, a self-described
evangelical Christian who until recently was executive director of
the Alabama Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the state party hired a director of faith
outreach, published faith-and-values voter guides and adopted a
plank in the state party platform on ``Judeo-Christian values.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Turnham is running to unseat Rep. Bob Riley (R-Ala.) in a
district around Auburn, Ala., that had always been represented by a
Democrat until Riley won it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll either discuss issues or do Bible sword drills; I'm
prepared to do either one,'' says Turnham. ``We'll talk about
prayer, the Ten Commandments or what to do with the long-term
funding of entitlements. I'm willing to do it, want to do it, can
do it. And I'll talk Auburn-Alabama football or hunting or adult
literacy rates. I think that's what a New Democrat is.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Coles, who lost to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
in 1996, is a little more difficult to pigeonhole. As the founder
of the Great American Cookie Co. and a man worth upward of $50
million, Coles has the business credentials that put him in a
league with Republican gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner, founder
of Norrell Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Coles says he favors low taxes and small government. But he is
also championing a $1 per hour increase to the minimum wage, one of
the top issues of organized labor. To date, Coles has received more
than $85,000 in campaign contributions from labor unions, or 12
percent of the money he has raised (excluding personal loans to
himself of $500,000).
</P>
<P>
   Coles favors engagement with China, but opposes giving the
president fast track trade authority _ one of the top issues for
most so-called New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen firsthand factories close,'' Coles says. ``I've
seen real people lose their jobs. We have to have free trade, but
we've got to have fair trade.''

   If you have to be on the mend, there are worse places in which
to heal than Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe underwent surgery on his left shoulder
June 18 in Los Angeles and has been rehabilitating near his home in
Manhattan Beach. A Los Angeles King doctor, Ronald Kvitne,
performed the operation _ a bankart repair _ at Kerlan-Jobe
Hospital, which is well known for repairing the injured shoulders
of major league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe injured the joint in his catching glove arm late in the
season, but he played through the pain. Trainer Don Del Negro said
Dafoe never complained much and used ice packs to deal with the
soreness. As the playoffs approach, players seldom talk about
injuries; they're worried about giving an opponent any edge. Dafoe,
who helped lead the Bruins into the postseason, didn't want to miss
playing time with what he thought was a minor injury.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the season, Dafoe realized things weren't
improving, so he had the surgery to stabilize the shoulder and
prevent it from slipping out of the socket. Ironically, it's the
same procedure that ended Bruins goalie Jim Carey's season. Part of
the reason the Bruins retained Carey was their concern over Dafoe.
It takes 12-16 weeks for a complete recovery, and Dafoe said he's
hopeful he can be ready for training camp. He plans to begin
skating in August, as he always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery went really well,'' said Dafoe. ``It was the same
doctor who did my knee surgery last year. I was under about four
hours. I had a needle (for the pain) in my neck for about 12 hours
after I woke up. Then I was in a sling for several days.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe started his rehab with stretching exercises, which he said
were excruciating. Last week, he used weights for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over the hump now,'' he said, ``I'm able to do more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be best man for the wedding of Washington goaltender
Olaf Kolzig in Arizona, and next month he and his fiancee, Kim,
will visit family and friends in Vancouver. There's only one thing
Dafoe really wants to do that he can't right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting to play volleyball on the beach,'' he said.
``It's hard watching everyone else and not being able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;

<P>
   Stop the insanity. The Dallas Stars opened the financial
floodgates for  &UR; Brett Hull  &LR; just over a week ago as the Blackhawks
were doing the same for  &UR; Doug Gilmour &LR; . Now comes word that
defenseman  &UR; Uwe Krupp  &LR; has signed a four-year deal with the Red
Wings that will pay him an average of $4.1 million a season. If
Krupp is worth that much, what must  &UR; Ray Bourque  &LR; be worth?
Unbelievable. Especially when you see  &UR; Steve Duchesne  &LR; sign with
Los Angeles for $3.75 million. The Flyers signed goalie  &UR; John
Vanbiesbrouck  &LR; to a two-year $7.25 million contract. A third year
is possible, too, for $3 million if the club picks up the option.
If the Flyers don't, Vanbiesbrouck still walks away with $1.25
million ... A possible deal that would have sent goalie  &UR; Felix
Potvin  &LR; from Toronto to Edmonton apparently has fallen through.
Reportedly, the Maple Leafs wanted to dump Potvin's $2.7 million
salary (US funds) and use that money (and much more) to sign
free-agent goalie  &UR; Curtis Joseph &LR; . The Oilers reportedly were going
to give up  &UR; Boris Mironov  &LR; and  &UR; Boyd Devereaux  &LR; to the Leafs in
exchange for Potvin. The reason for the death of the deal is said
to be that Oilers general manager  &UR; Glen Sather  &LR; didn't want to be
the one to help the Leafs get Joseph, who walked away from the
Oilers at the end of the season. Toronto associate GM  &UR; Mike Smith
 &LR; said there are no other takers in the league for Potvin. ``I'm
tired of the Felix Potvin fiasco,'' said Smith. ``He's one of the
best goalies in the league and yet we have received nothing but
poor offers from other teams. It's an embarrassment to us. We now
have no intention of trading him. He will be our goaltender next
year.'' ... Speaking of Krupp, his family pronounces his first name
like ``Oo-vay,'' though his name in hockey circles has been
pronounced ``Oo-we.'' Seems that the change in pronunciation came
courtesy of Wings coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman  &LR; who signed Krupp to his
first contract in Buffalo in 1986. ``He handed me this paper and
said, `Sign this, Oo-we,' '' said Krupp. ``How was I going to argue
with Scotty Bowman?'' ... The Sabres signed former University of
Massachusetts-Lowell goalie  &UR; Dwayne Roloson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was a free
agent, to back up  &UR; Dominik Hasek &LR; . The 28-year-old last year played
39 games for Calgary, earning an 11-16-8 record, a 2.99 goals
against average and .890 save percentage ... Speaking of
netminders, it will be interesting to see how things shake out in
Tampa when training camp opens.  &UR; Daren Puppa &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been
plagued by back problems, was limited to six games in 1996-97 and
26 this past season. ``I'm in better shape now than I've ever been
in,'' said Puppa, 33. ``They need some talent. We need some
centers. We still need to get some guys who can put the puck in the
net.'' ... Look for Bowman to be back behind the bench as the Red
Wings defend their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship.
Bowman recently had a thorough health exam and the veteran coach,
who turns 65 in September, said he'll find out the results this
week. ``They let me out, so I guess that's a good sign,'' he said.

   &UR; Doug MacLean &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was fired as coach of the Florida Panthers
last fall, is loving life as president/GM of the Columbus Blue
Jackets, who will begin play in 2000-01. ``I definitely don't ever
want to coach again,'' the 44-year-old MacLean told reporters. ``I
want to build an organization. This is too big an opportunity.''
MacLean has plenty of time to put together his staff, which he'll
do about a year from now. He said he'll hire a coach in the next
year ... Devils GM  &UR; Lou Lamoriello  &LR; reportedly has ordered all of
his players to wear gloves with cuffs that extend six inches beyond
the wrist. What prompted him to take that step was an accident that
resulted in  &UR; Jason Arnott  &LR; being cut by  &UR; Randy McKay &LR; 's skate as
McKay climbed over the boards in a playoff game. Arnott is still
being treated for nerve damage ... Even though Phoenix GM  &UR; Bobby
Smith  &LR; pulled the team's latest offer to  &UR; Keith Tkachuk  &LR; off the
table and suspended talks on a restructuring of the player's
contract, Tkachuk is saying he believes everything is going to be
fine. ``I'm not worried or frustrated about it at all,'' Tkachuk
told reporters. ``I still believe it will get done in time. My
prediction is that I'm going to sign with the Phoenix Coyotes and
be there for a very long time.'' Reportedly, Tkachuk is seeking an
average of $8 million a year and has already rejected the club's
offer of an average of $6.5 million a year. He has indicated he
would sit out until he gets what he wants despite having two years
remaining on his current pact. ``Obviously, it wouldn't be smart
for the player or for the team, I know that,'' Tkachuk said. ``It
doesn't make any sense, so let's get a deal done. There's still
plenty of time left.'' Tkachuk said he realizes he is probably
taking a public relations hit with his firm stand. ``But people are
hearing only one side of the coin,'' said the Coyotes' captain. ``I
know I'm getting portrayed as a bad guy, but I know I'm not. People
don't know what's going on in the marketplace. They don't
understand what's gone on behind the scenes. The only people who
really know are Bobby Smith, myself, (owner)  &UR; Richard Burke  &LR; and my
agent ( &UR; Bob Murray &LR; ).'' ... Hard to believe that  &UR; Alan Eagleson  &LR; is
already out of jail. He served just six months of an 18-month
sentence for fraud. It's hard to determine which was the bigger
fraud, the sentence or Eagleson himself ... The unbalanced schedule
came out last week, and it didn't take long for some teams to cry
foul. The Senators have expressed dismay at the way their schedule
is structured. ``No hockey team is ever happy with the schedule _
ever,'' said Vancouver GM  &UR; Brian Burke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who swapped his league
duties at the end of the playoffs for a job with the Canucks. ``But
overall (the Canucks' schedule) is a schedule we can live with.
We've got a couple of tight spots. It's unfortunate we don't get
Gretzky; we'll get him the next year. But I wouldn't be surprised
at all if in the future we get a conference-only schedule. I know
some owners are pushing for that already.'' Gee, maybe even more
trips to Buffalo in the dead of winter someday soon? Sign me up.

 &HT;    Students compete for medal, scholarship in contest
 &HT;    By Raven Hill

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The spotlight was missing but the corridor of the
Georgia World Congress Center was DeShay Carter's stage.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting her turn to perform for the judges in the 20th annual
NAACP ACT-SO competition, DeShay, 15, reviewed the motions of her
dance routine for what seems like the hundredth time.
</P>
<P>
   ACT-SO (Afro-academic Cultural Technologial Scientific Olympics)
features 850 high school students sponsored by local NAACP branches
from across the country, and is one of the first events on the
schedule for the 89th annual NAACP convention. Saturday kicked off
two days of competition in academics and the arts. The awards
ceremony is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As DeShay gestured and swayed, her grandmother Angela Harper
offered tips along the way. The pair had a long wait ahead of them.
DeShay had number 77; the judges were watching participant number
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the gold medal,'' said DeShay, a high school junior
from Pittsburgh. She said she is trained in various dance forms and
has been taking lessons for five years. ``I have a lot of
expectations for the weekend. I hope it will increase my
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   DeShay was not the only participant having an impromptu
rehearsal. The strains of singer Desree could be heard through the
hall while another performer perfected her routine. Many
participants were in costume and could be found stretching and
twirling _ any last-minute preparation that might help them capture
the coveted gold medal and scholarship prize.
</P>
<P>
   Free day offerings
</P>
<P>
   With no workshops scheduled to start until Monday, NAACP
delegates were free to do as they pleased on Saturday, the first
day of the civil rights group's annual convention. Delegates could
take a picture with Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president, or visit the
vendors fair at the GWCC, where the smell of collard greens hit
delegates at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Foods, one of 150 vendors, hawked samples of greens,
macaroni and cheese and chicken and dumplings. L'Eggs products
hosted a drawing for a year's supply of pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's Restaurants offered root beer floats.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates could even test their strength on an eight-foot
``chin-up'' exercise bar provided by the U.S. Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some people do 20 today,'' said Capt. Corey Thomas.

AN IRISH TOUR DE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The last time somebody hightailed it out of here for
Paris, James Joyce had gone into exile and was well on his way to
becoming immortal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, on the first leg of a three-week journey to Paris, 189
riders dashed through the narrow streets of this city that Joyce
described in such exhausting detail that if it ever burned down,
they could rebuild it by using the pages of ``Ulysses'' as a
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday was just the prologue, a short sprint to establish
a leader for the exhausting Tour de France. The first stage of the
world's biggest bicycle race begins Sunday, setting off for the
first time from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason that the world's third biggest sporting event is
beginning in Ireland is because the biggest one, the World Cup
final, is taking place in France. Given their druthers, the Irish
would prefer to host the World Cup, but the country simply doesn't
have the facilities. But it does have the enthusiasm and the
requisite punishing hills to host the prologue and first two stages
of the Tour, which will conclude Aug. 2 on the Champs Elysee.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled the Tour has arrived. This is a small
country, and getting around it this time of year, with its narrow
roads and bed &AMP; breakfast joints chockful of tourists, is hard
enough. Saturday's time trial shut down a city that has in recent
years developed a traffic problem to rival Boston's. Downtown
retailers estimate they lost about $7 million in business. The
first and second stages Sunday and Monday will shut down almost
half of the eastern seaboard at the height of the tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of grumbling. But most people seem proud to host
the race. Easing the pain are estimates that the Tour and its
entourage _ 2,000 journalists, 1,500 race officials, and untold
thousands of fans _ will pump about $40 million into the Irish
economy. This after a government investment of just about $3
million to get the Tour here.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Tour is as much a rolling celebration as it is a
bicycle race, leaving festivals and parties in its wake. The Irish
hardly need an excuse for a celebration, and can rival the French
in stamina and joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   In its 85 editions, this is only the seventh time the Tour has
started somewhere other than France. Because the World Cup final in
Paris coincided with Sunday's launch of the Tour, the race
director, Jean-Marie Leblanc, thought it was a good time to take it
abroad again.
</P>
<P>
   After a successful start in Britain in 1994, Ireland was a
logical choice, especially given Ireland's connections to the Tour.
In 1963, Shay Elliott, Ireland's first professional cyclist, became
the first English-speaking rider to wear the yellow jersey that
signifies the Tour leader. When Leblanc was a teenager, he got
Elliott's autograph in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc points to the more recent contributions of the greatest
Irish cyclists of the last generation. Sean Kelly, a Tipperary man,
rode in 14 Tours, a feat bettered by only two other riders in the
Tour's history. Kelly never won the Tour, but in 1987, Stephen
Roche became the first and only Irishman to win the race. About a
third of the 3.5 million people who live in the Irish Republic
turned out to welcome Roche when he returned home from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Pat McQuaid, an Irishman and former Tour rider who is credited
with getting Leblanc and the rest of the Tour organizers to go for
the idea to come here, said, ``it wouldn't have happened without
Sean and Stephen.''
</P>
<P>
   But, much to the disappointment of this cycling-mad country,
this is one of the few years in the last two decades in which there
will be no Irish rider in the field. Among the favorites are last
year's winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany, Bjaarne Riis of Denmark,
Marco Pantani of Italy, and Abraham Olano of Spain. The French, who
haven't won their own race since 1985, will be pinning their hopes
on Richard Virenque, who finished second and third in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   McQuaid is responsible for the mind-boggling logistics of
bringing the Tour entourage here then getting them on a ferry for
France. He has traveled to every town and village through which the
Tour will pass, getting local communities to sign on and get in the
spirit. He said it hasn't been hard.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the roads fixed, however, is considered a minor miracle,
even in this land renowned for its saints. Local authorities have
spent $9 million _ or three times as much as the national
government kicked in _ to upgrade Ireland's notoriously bad roads.
It will be the Tour's most lasting contribution to Irish society.
</P>
<P>
   The prologue course, which began at Trinity College and ends in
the heart of O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, was
chosen to show off some of city's most impressive Georgian
architecture. Sunday's first stage heads through the dramatic
Wicklow mountains. Monday's stage will finish in Cork, mainly
because that was the shortest route by ferry to France.
</P>
<P>
   The routes have been mapped out not only to challenge riders
with Ireland's rolling hills, but to honor the country's three
greatest cyclists. The first stage starts in Dundrum, Roche's home
village. Monday, the racers will pass through Elliott's hometown of
Bray, and his grave at Kilmacanogue in Wicklow. Monday's stage also
passes through Carrick-on-Suir, Kelly's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   As in France, the biggest bicycle race in the world will pass
through some of the smallest villages in Europe. Monday's second
stage will pass through Glenmore, population 68, which is a
metropolis compared with Meyrignac l'Eglise, population 50, the
village in central France where the seventh stage will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Some villages, including Glenmore, are spending as much as
$75,000 to put on festivals to draw crowds that will stay on long
after the cyclists race past in a blur. In any given town or
village this weekend, you can see some of the best traditional
music acts, from De Dannan to the Clancy Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of organization and viewing audience, the Tour is the
third largest sporting event in the world, behind the World Cup and
the Olympics. With an estimated television audience of 900 million
viewers in 163 countries, the Tour will have more people getting a
look at Ireland than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   William Power, who owns the Tinakilly Country House Hotel, a
charming hostelry in Rathnew, a village in County Wicklow where the
race will pass, said the Tour will do more to expose Ireland to the
world more than anything previously, including the writings of
Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race will benefit every single person in the country,''
he said. Not everyone is as enthusiastic. Besides the
inconvenience, some can't understand the agonizing routes, and why
so many people follow it so rabidly. Tom Humphries, the acerbic
Irish Times sports columnist who brings to cycling the same
enthusiasm Dan Shaughnessy does to soccer, says ``only the French
could have come up with something as impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything less practical, more grand, any crazier in
the wide world of sport?'' he asks. ``Is there anything built to a
scale less comprehensible to the ordinary human?''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Brady is more typical of the Irish who are excited about
the Tour. An insurance broker from Dun Laoghaire, a Dublin suburb,
Brady gave up running because of his creaky knees and is one of
myriad middle-aged Irishmen who keep in shape by cycling. They are
everywhere here, daredevils riding on country roads and the
shoulders of major highways.
</P>
<P>
   Brady will take his two young sons to ``watch a little history''
Sunday, just a few miles from his home.
</P>
<P>
   And, he notes, they'll be back home in plenty of time to watch
Brazil vs. France.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect day,'' said Joe Brady.

DRAFT-PICKING CAN BE RISKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The great thing about football is that one expert's opinion is
usually rebuffed by another expert.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Joel Buchsbaum's Pro Football Weekly named
the 10 riskiest picks in the draft. The list was based on an
anonymous polling of NFL scouts. A few of the Patriots' selections
were mentioned prominently. In fact, the publication selected
Syracuse defensive back Tebucky Jones as the riskiest pick of them
all. Even the Patriots admit that Jones was a ``risky'' pick, but
they absolutely covet him as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier wouldn't
respond then and he won't respond now. The opposing view comes from
ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr., recognized as one of the nation's
top draft experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tebucky Jones isn't a risky pick at all,'' said Kiper, who
claims he hasn't seen Buchsbaum's poll. ``In fact, it may be the
least riskiest. At least he has a safety net in that if he doesn't
make it as a corner he can be moved to the inside. He's a big guy
who could be the next Jason Sehorn. If that doesn't work out, the
kid can play safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiper also likes the Jones pick because it was made by coach
Pete Carroll, whose area of expertise is defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach has their own area of expertise, and sometimes
they see things in a player at that position they feel is really
special,'' Kiper said. ``Tebucky Jones is a heck of an athlete.
He's going to play somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiper's comments support what Grier said just a few weeks ago:
If you ask 30 different people, you may get 30 different answers.
Grier said he didn't give a damn what anybody thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Football Weekly poll created some panic in the eyes of
some Patriots fans, especially considering the team passed on North
Carolina defensive tackle Vonnie Holliday to take Jones.
</P>
<P>
   While Kiper stamped his approval on Jones, he didn't completely
validate the rest of the team's draft. He recently graded out all
teams and gave the Patriots a C-plus. That's at least better than
the C-minus he gave them last season when he thought the team could
have done better than Chris Canty, Brandon Mitchell, Sedrick Shaw,
and Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Kiper wonders why the Patriots passed up the chance to solidify
their defensive line with a big guy in the middle in addition to
selecting Jones, who gives them the aggressive player Carroll wants
in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest guy they have on their line is Ferric Collons,''
noted Kiper. ``They could have taken Holliday and Jones and then
taken a chance with a running back later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Kiper doesn't dispute Pro Football Weekly's poll
regarding running back Robert Edwards, who was ranked the third
riskiest player; second-rounder Tony Simmons, a receiver from
Wisconsin (sixth riskiest), and Alabama tight end Rod Rutledge
(eighth).
</P>
<P>
   On Edwards: ``He's a kid who has durability questions attached
to him,'' said Kiper. ``We've seen in this league that you can pick
up a decent running back later in the draft. Twenty of the starting
30 running backs in the league were taken after the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   On Simmons: ``He comes from an offense that wasn't a pro style,
therefore his route running and knowledge of the position isn't as
good as it should be for a second-rounder. He's got a lot to learn.
He's probably not a guy who's going to be able to step right in,
but one who needs to learn with a year or two under his belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiper sees Rutledge more as a fourth-rounder than a
second-rounder. He said tight ends picked this high should be able
to help the team as a ``pass receiver as well as with their
blocking.'' Rutledge appears more of a blocker right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an injury question with Rutledge and he doesn't have
great speed,'' said Kiper. ``I wouldn't say he's risky, but he's a
reach in the second round. He has good hands and maybe that part of
his game develops, but for a guy who's limited like he is, he
projects more as a fourth-rounder.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiper thinks third-rounder Chris Floyd from Michigan was an
acceptable pick, but he joins the chorus on the team's second
third-rounder, Greg Spires, because of his size (6 feet 1 inches,
273 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the big physical prototype end that everyone is
looking for,'' said Kiper. ``You don't see many guys in his size
range make it in the NFL. But what you might get is situations
where he can beat some offensive linemen because he's a little
quicker and because those linemen don't see too many guys Spires's
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiper thinks University of Houston defensive tackle Leonta
Rheams is a ``developmental'' player in the fourth round. He said
fifth-round linebacker Ron Merkerson of Colorado would have
projected as a third-rounder because of his quickness if not for
some injury questions. He said both Southern Mississippi running
back Harold Shaw and seventh-rounder Jason Andersen, an offensive
lineman from Brigham Young, were taken where they were projected.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   None, really. Just someone else's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   It would be maddening if, for example, Miami got better
production from running back John Avery, taken with the 29th pick
of the first round, than the Patriots did with Edwards (No. 18), or
if Washington got better value with Skip Hicks in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Then the skeptics and second-guessers could have a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the ``what if'' stuff is jibberish, good fodder for
talk shows and football columns, but not very meaningful. Until the
players are in pads, it's nearly impossible for even coaches to
know how good they are.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did take risks, no doubt. But risky picks aren't
always bad picks. The Patriots wanted to improve their athleticism,
their overall team speed, and add players who can help now and in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they did that. Maybe they didn't. The experts are split.
</P>
<P>

   Canty and Shaw are two among the sophomore class who are staying
away from the media, feeling they were singled out for their lack
of contributions to last year's team. Shaw did do a Patriots
Football Weekly interview in which he said he thought the media was
unfair. They are using the ``me vs. them'' mentality to get
themselves psyched for the '98 season. Fellas, as one former
Patriots coach would say, that stuff doesn't work ... Carroll
thinks Canty is in better shape than he was last year as a rookie.
The cornerback was one of the more loyal participants of  &UR; Johnny
Parker's  &LR; strength and conditioning program, and the coaching staff
took note of his work in the minicamps. Shaw was also faithful to
the program and is stronger and bigger than last year. Running
backs coach  &UR; Kirby Wilson  &LR; said Shaw made big strides throughout
the year in practice, after a less-than-stellar exhibition season
... In one of the minor issues in camp, it'll be interesting to see
how much of a shot  &UR; Mark Gagliano  &LR; gets to become the team's
kickoff man if  &UR; Adam Vinatieri's  &LR; kickoffs don't improve. Gagliano
is the nephew of former Red Sox and Cardinals infielder  &UR; Phil
Gagliano  &LR; and showed some good leg strength on punts during the
minicamps ... One Patriots official said about Northeastern
quarterback  &UR; Jim Murphy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``He's a kid you'd want to go to war
with.'' Now the big test: Murphy has to show during the exhibition
season he can play quarterback in the NFL ... The Patriots haven't
responded to a proposal made by  &UR; Ted Johnson's  &LR; agent,  &UR; Jack
Mills &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  The proposal is similar to the five-year, $28 million
deal given to Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker  &UR; Levon Kirkland &LR; .
Mills would rather not discuss a long-term deal with the team after
training camp starts Sunday at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I.
If the proposal is rejected, he currently has no counter-proposal
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Bengals coach  &UR; Bruce Coslet  &LR; likes to have a
high-powered offense. He had it with  &UR; Boomer Esiason  &LR; last season,
but didn't have a defense to match, and with Esiason gone, he is
hoping to create enough competition at quarterback to achieve his
desired result. Thus, the Bengals gave  &UR; Jeff Blake  &LR; competition by
adding  &UR; Neil O'Donnell  &LR; to the mix. With Blake, O'Donnell, and the
underrated  &UR; Paul Justin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was signed to a $2.5 million deal in
the offseason, there should be lots of competition. The job is
Blake's to lose. In the past he's been electric, but he became
complacent last year and Esiason took over. O'Donnell, a good guy
and a winner, is looking for a rebirth after a horrible experience
in New York under  &UR; Bill Parcells &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who recently replaced the
former Steeler with  &UR; Vinny Testaverde &LR; . O'Donnell was afraid to
make a mistake under Parcells; now he'll be able to let loose in
Cincinnati's wide-open offense, which already has a good back
( &UR; Corey Dillon &LR; ) and two fine receivers in  &UR; Carl Pickens  &LR; and
 &UR; Darnay Scott &LR; . ``He's not gonna be the guy who loses the game for
you,'' said Coslet. ``He's gonna lean toward safe and sane rather
than risky and flashy, and that's the kind of guy I want.'' As for
Blake, his agent,  &UR; Ralph Cindrich &LR; , says his client is up for the
challenge. ``He's never once complained about it,'' said Cindrich.
``He'd heard rumors about different quarterbacks all summer long
and he knew he'd have to be on top of his game to keep his job. I
think at this point that challenge is really driving him. I think
he wants back what he believes is his.'' ... Which brings us to
44-year-old  &UR; Steve DeBerg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who will join the Atlanta Falcons
following a five-year absence in the NFL. It appears teams are
becoming less tolerant of younger quarterbacks in backup roles
because in the NFL, you have to step in and produce when the star
QB goes down. It's one reason the Patriots have held on to  &UR; Scott
Zolak &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now in his eighth year in the league. He has spent five of
those backing up  &UR; Drew Bledsoe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who hasn't been injury prone.
``There are some situations out there where Scott could have played
more and contributed,'' said Cindrich, who also represents Zolak.
``He's always wanted to play, but it's never been a problem for
him. He's always been recognized as a team player and when teams
have a veteran, experienced quarterback like Scott, they don't let
them go. They're valuable. It's a position where the backup is
becoming crucial given the number of injuries.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Veteran running back  &UR; Rodney Hampton  &LR; is still unemployed, but
he has begun to receive some inquiries. A proven inside runner, the
Patriots have not expressed interest in the veteran ...  &UR; Terry
Kirby's  &LR; agent,  &UR; Mike Battle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said he's moving ahead with
negotiations with another AFC team (believed to be the Chiefs)
since he hasn't heard from the Patriots. It was thought Carroll
wanted Kirby, a good pass receiver who could assume the role of
third-down back, but the Patriots are still waiting until training
camp to pull the trigger ... One player who probably isn't in their
mix is former Bears running back  &UR; Raymont Harris &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is
reportedly asking the Packers for $2.5 million a year. The Packers
were interested in Harris as their negotiations with  &UR; Dorsey Levens
 &LR; went nowhere. Levens recently reduced his demands, but not by much
... Some agents are griping that teams should have a uniform
vacation policy in which the entire league breaks up for a summer
respite. ``We see teams who are going forward trying to sign their
draft picks right away and other teams who are on vacation and
won't even begin talking to guys until later,'' said one agent.
``It's hard to get a guy signed.'' One player who may go right to
the wire is Carolina defensive tackle  &UR; Jason Peter &LR; . The Panthers
are up against the salary cap, so it will take some creative work
to get him in camp on time ...  &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; did something rather
surprising this week. First, he decided to back  &UR; Lawrence
Phillips &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been accused by a woman of assaulting her at a
Pembroke Pines nightclub June 27. Johnson said he spoke to Phillips
and came away believing him. In fact, Johnson said, ``The incident
is history.'' That comment didn't sit well with the Broward County
chapter of the National Organization for Women, which is angry that
Johnson made that statement before the police investigation has
been completed. If Phillips is innocent, he's going to have to
prove that a friend of the woman is lying when she says Phillips
not only struck the alleged victim in the mouth, but also chipped
two teeth and caused swelling in her face. There are also pictures
of the woman taken at the hospital showing facial bruises ... The
Dolphins are going to head into camp trying to find a left guard
and a defensive end in house. These are their two major needs. It
appears Northeastern's  &UR; Josh Taves &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had a big year in NFL
Europe, will get the chance to be that find on defense ... The
Dolphins are already calling Avery their third-down back and not
looking for a veteran ... The Raiders, who are involved a stadium
mess with the city of Oakland over naming rights for the Coliseum,
hired an old-time quarterback of their own this week, signing
39-year-old  &UR; Wade Wilson  &LR; to back up  &UR; Jeff George  &LR; and  &UR; Donald
Hollas &LR; . Wilson is being called the third quarterback, but you know
if George goes down (and there's a chance he will as Raider
quarterbacks were sacked 58 times last year) coach  &UR; Jon Gruden
 &LR; probably would feel more comfortable with Wilson ... Despite the
feeling that the Patriots' defense will be much better this season
than last, one thing both Carroll and defensive coordinator  &UR; Steve
Sidwell  &LR; are emphasizing starting in training camp is for the
defense to play tough in their regular package. The Patriots
certainly were tough with their blitzing packages a year ago, but
Sidwell wants the defense to be just as effective without the
gimmicks. We shall see.

SUKER GIVES CROATIANS THIRD

   PARIS _ Davor Suker pulled into a tie for the World Cup
goal-scoring lead Saturday in somewhat dramatic fashion, converting
the winner as Croatia took a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in
the third-place game at Parc des Princes last night.
</P>
<P>
   When Suker scored in the 36th minute to put Croatia ahead to
stay, it was his fifth goal, equaling tournament leaders Gabriel
Batistuta of Argentina and Christian Vieri of Italy. Brazil star
Ronaldo, who plays for the championship Sunday, has four.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats were the surprise of the tournament, eliminating
Romania in the second round and Germany in the quarterfinals, then
taking the lead against France before falling, 2-1, in the
semifinals. This was the best finish by a nation making its World
Cup debut since Portugal finished third at England '66.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Prosinecki, returning to the starting lineup for the
first time since the first round of the tournament, scored the
game's first goal in the 13th minute after spinning away from three
defenders in the penalty area, then shooting low past Dutch
goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands tied the score in the 21st minute when Boudewijn
Zenden, a 21-year-old midfielder from PSV Eindhoven, dribbled up
the right side, cut across the middle, and sent a left-footed shot
over goalkeeper Drazen Ladic.
</P>
<P>
   Suker, who had been relegated to a reserve role with Real Madrid
by the end of last season, scored the deciding goal after the ball
had gone from Prosinecki to Aljosa Asanovic to Zvonimir Boban. When
it finally came to Suker, he blasted a shot through the legs of
Manchester United-bound defender Jaap Stam.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch appeared to have tied the score in the second half
when Clarence Seedorf headed in an errant clearance by Mario
Stanic. But Seedorf was ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Croatia held on for another upset.

SURVIVORS REMEMBER THE CRYING AND SHOUTS

   EAST STROUDSBURG, Pa. _ In the pediatric unit of Pocono Medical
Center here, two young survivors of a van crash on Friday _
Shaquasha Chambers, 6, and Jalea Moses, 7, _ were covered with
bruises and gauze as they fanned themselves with silvery ``Get Well
Soon'' balloons.
</P>
<P>
   For Shaquasha, whose mother also survived the crash, the tears
ran afresh on Saturday when she discovered that emergency workers
had sliced her beloved pink bathing suit to ribbons while treating
the slashes to her forehead, chest, back, left knee and right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquasha, Jalea and Jalea's older sister, Janee, 8, had enjoyed
a summer day at Knoebels Amusement Park with their fellow campers
from a day camp run by the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., a
community development organization in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   After a rented school bus had been filled with the older
campers, the 3 girls were among the 20 youngest campers, between
the ages of 5 and 10, who were crowded into a van owned by the
corporation and driven by one of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride home, several of the children, exhausted by the
thrill rides, fell asleep. So did the driver, the police said, and
the van crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquasha's mother, Patricia D. Parrish, a 22-year-old
counselor, recalled sitting on the highway in shock as a 7-year-old
girl stumbled toward her, crying for help. ``I couldn't move so I
told her to lay down,'' Ms. Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what her injuries were,'' she said. ``She came
and laid on my lap and she just kept crying.'' Nearby, she could
hear Shaquasha crying as well. ``I just told her, `Lay down, don't
get up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   From a bed in the trauma center of Community Medical Center, a
counselor, Mwando C. Bailey, 17, remembered some children shouting:
``I don't want to die,'' and ``I want to go to the hospital.'' He
added, ``I was screaming for help, too.''

'78 BAD KARMA HAS SURFACED

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The temptation was too great. I know what the folks
back home are thinking because a lot of the folks back home are
here in Baltimore this weekend. And they are getting nervous, as
Sox fans do.
</P>
<P>
   So I had to go to Dennis Eckersley's locker and ask, ``What do
you think, Eck? Too early to start having flashbacks to 1978?''
</P>
<P>
   Eck was there, you know. He was part of the apocalyptic Red Sox
collapse against which all others must be measured. He was a
20-game winner for the Manila Folders of 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, too early,'' he said. ``I don't think we're going to
blow a 14-game lead over the Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, reeling before the All-Star break, Saturday beat
the Red Sox by one run for the third straight day. All the good
feeling the Red Sox engendered back in Boston before the break has
dissolved in three well-played games in which the Sox simply
haven't hit. Straight sets _ 3-2, 3-2, and 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Now only the Jin Ho Cho Trail separates the Red Sox from a
four-game sweep. It's said that the kid has ice water in his veins.
Here's hoping Cho is not the Korean Bobby Sprowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he doesn't know about the Boston Massacre,'' said
Cho's teammate Jim Corsi, who was learning his trade at Newton
North High when the wheels came off in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   And does it mean anything that Jesse Orosco, who was standing on
the mound when the Red Sox finally lost the 1986 World Series, has
two wins and a save in this Lost Weekend? Or that this series
opened under a full moon?
</P>
<P>
   Bad mojo, man.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are still wild-card favorites, still leading the Angels,
Rangers, and Blue Jays for that fourth playoff spot. But the team
that scored 45 runs in three days at Fenway has scored five in
three games in the hitters' paradise on Camden Street. That's five
runs in three games against the team with the second-worst (5.04)
ERA in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of Red Sox fans hanging out at the Inner
Harbor this weekend and several made their feelings known during
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nation is getting nervous,'' said one guy in a Boston cap.
``If we can't hit here, where can we hit?''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, sounding more like Chance the gardener every day,
said, ``Three tough games. We pitched good and played good. We just
can't seem to get enough hits. But we start tomorrow, 0-0. That's
the way you play baseball, the way the game is. We're a good
hitting ball club. We hit. We have good hitters and they're gonna
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody seen Jim Leyritz?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always concerned about the offense,'' acknowledged Mo
Vaughn. ``But we'll keep it together.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to overreact to this little bump in the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway. But that, gentle readers, is what we
do in Boston and the Hub representatives who have invaded the
shores of Maryland made it very clear that they expected more from
their team this weekend. The bars on Pratt Street last night were
littered with thirsty Sox fans convinced that the big slide has
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The longest losing streak of this Sox season was six games (four
to the Yankees, two to the Jays, all brutal) and it was heroically
stopped by Bret Saberhagen May 30 in New York. The streak was the
most serious threat in this feelgood campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Sox face another mini-crisis. And the veteran
ballplayers know that if the losing continues, there will be talk
of second-half folds, 1978, and trades that could or should be
made. Vaughn's All-Star break contract story will be cited as a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox get to play their Tampa cousins the next two days,
then face a heavy dose of Cleveland and Toronto before the
ever-dreaded West Coast (plus Texas) trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half is no joke,'' said John Valentin. ``In the
second half, every team you play is going to bear down. It's going
to get a lot tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   These have been tough losses, but not poorly-played games. The
worst thing you can say is that Boston wasted three solid pitching
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Sox and Orioles will break the Camden Yards four-game
series attendance record. The representatives of Red Sox Nation
will be easy to spot in the stands. They'll be the ones sitting on
their hands, hoping none of that bad history is coming back to
haunt them.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Man the barricades, keep the powder dry, and say a
prayer for Jin Ho Cho.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday afternoon's 2-1 loss in Camden Yards, the Korean
rookie is all that stands between the Red Sox and a four-game sweep
by the Baltimore Orioles, which is not the way to stamp yourselves
as legitimate playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Red Sox' history of failure that is anticipated long
before it becomes reality, perhaps it's best that Cho's language
skills don't allow him to read either the team's media guide or
newspaper sports sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's probably good he doesn't know that he has to be our
stopper tomorrow,'' said reliever Jim Corsi after the Red Sox lost
by a run for the third straight game. ``Those are three pretty
tough losses right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every loss is tough, but in the last three games the team is
doing what it's supposed to do. We've gotten good pitching, played
good defense, but they've outpitched us.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Red Sox haven't done is hit, which left Tim
Wakefield in the same predicament as Bret Saberhagen and Pedro
Martinez. All three pitched well enough to win, with Wakefield
Saturday playing the part of a bow-legged tightrope artist,
allowing 11 hits in 6 2/3 innings but just two runs, on Joe
Carter's home run and Jeff Reboulet's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox answered with just four hits off Orioles starter
Scott Erickson and lefty nemesis Jesse Orosco, the 40-year-old
rally-killer who needed just one pitch to induce Mo Vaughn to tap
the game-ending ground ball to Reboulet at second.
</P>
<P>
   That's a total of five runs and 17 hits for the Red Sox in three
games in the hitters' playground that is Oriole Park at Camden
Yards, or 10 fewer runs and three fewer hits than they scored in
their last game in Fenway Park before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half is no joke,'' said John Valentin, whose 12th
home run leading off the eighth inning accounted for Boston's only
run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin is one of the few Sox players swinging the bat since
the break, with five hits, including two home runs, in 10 at-bats
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the Orioles are a bad team because of their
record?'' he said. ``They're very good, they just haven't played
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, every team you play is going to be bearing
down and it's going to get a lot tougher. You can see that just
from these games the last three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles hadn't won three straight games since the first
three days in June. The Red Sox hadn't dropped three straight since
falling to the carpetbagging Phillies from the National League June
22-24. But Saturday, Erickson struck out the side in the first and
set down the first 13 Red Sox hitters in order until Troy O'Leary
blooped a single into right field with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary was quickly erased attempting to steal and the Sox
managed only singles by Scott Hatteberg in the sixth and Nomar
Garciaparra in the seventh before Valentin's home run.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg then drew a walk and pinch runner Donnie Sadler
advanced on pinch hitter Midre Cummings's chopper to second, but he
would get no farther as Darren Bragg tapped to the mound and first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro made a nice backhanded pickup of Darren
Lewis's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough game to lose,'' said Wakefield, who maneuvered
out of a second-and-third situation with no outs without allowing a
run in the third, and after Carter's home run, loaded the bases
with no out in the fourth and allowed just one more run on
Reboulet's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare to see three ballgames decided by one run here,''
said Wakefield, now 10-4 after his first loss in six starts dating
back to June 6. ``But we'll get something rolling tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a new experience for Cho, who lost his big-league
debut on the Fourth of July when the Red Sox were shut out by the
White Sox, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Erickson) threw the ball as well as he's thrown, today,''
Vaughn said. ``The pitching has been there for us, and we're going
to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we've got to stay patient, not get excited, no
added pressure. It will change for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No time for a history lesson for Cho, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just going to go out there and pitch,'' Vaughn said,
``and not get caught up in all this stuff. That's a great thing.''

Vegas. While local residents have become experts on which buffets
offer the best bargain, perhaps the most ardent pilgrims are

put the price of a limitless meal for two below $11. That includes
non-alcoholic beverages and as much pie, cake and pastry as a body

ethnic sub-buffets. Overstuffed, underpriced smorgasbords have long
been a staple of Las Vegas' tourist trade, an enticement and reward
for spending money in casinos. But a lure for heavy rollers is
becoming a lifestyle for heavy eaters as the city's resident
population swells, in more ways than one. (Monica Almeida/New York

SUMMER READING ON THE BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we move into the nuclear summer, let's take one more look at
some Chicago stories:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NEXT COACH:  &LR; We've heard that the Bulls have narrowed their
list of candidates to five, but don't be surprised if general
manager Jerry Krause has something else in mind. He's been known to
do the unexpected, hiring both Doug Collins and Phil Jackson with
neither having NBA coaching experience. With many rumors swirling,
here's what we think is absolute: The Bulls want assistant coaches
Frank Hamblen, Tex Winter, and Bill Cartwright back on the bench.
(The Chicago assistant coaches' contracts usually run until
August.) Winter has mentioned retirement, but that apparently is an
annual exercise. Krause not only wants Winter back, he expects to
continue to run the famed triple-post offense, with or without
you-know-who. If Tim Floyd gets the head job, that would likely
signal Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen that the rebuilding is
about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST COACH:  &LR; It has been three weeks since Jackson left on
his motorcycle and said good-bye. ``I'm not surprised he did that.
Not one bit,'' said Joe Kleine, who spent last season with Chicago.
``He looked relieved when it was all over. It was like he was
freed. The whole season wore on him. As controlled and together as
he can appear to be, I think getting that last championship was a
real relief. He's looking forward to being away for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUPERSTAR I:  &LR; You may recall that Jordan decided to return to
basketball when the baseball labor situation was at its
ultra-messiest. Could the same thing make him decide to leave the
NBA? ``One thing is not going to force Michael either way,'' says
David Falk, Jordan's agent. Jordan already has eased off his
earlier, unequivocal, no-room-for-second-guessing remarks that he
wouldn't play for anyone other than Jackson. ``If they can get
Scottie back and a coach he approves of, I think Michael would do
it again,'' Kleine said. ``But if they don't, I don't think there's
a chance. He won't be a part of any rebuilding program, and if
Scottie doesn't come back, that's what it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUPERSTAR II:  &LR; As for Pippen, Kleine doesn't think it's a lost
cause in Chicago. ``I think it would take at least three years, or
two years at Michael Jordan money,'' Kleine said. ``At his heart,
Scottie is a businessman and it makes sense to listen to Chicago.
But he's like Mike in that he doesn't want to be there for a
rebuilding situation, either. He knows he can probably get $50
million to $60 million in the open market. And without Phil,
there's a lot of uncertainty. This past year was very, very
frustrating for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOOR:  &LR; Dennis Rodman was in an ideal situation in Chicago:
a veteran team with a hip head coach who allowed him to be himself.
``He's not evil. He's not a bad person,'' Kleine said. ``But if you
put him in a situation like Los Angeles (Lakers), he could be
disruptive. He is going to do his own thing, and you have to
understand that. In San Antonio, they tried to treat everyone the
same. That won't work with Dennis. He has to be treated
differently.'' Kleine said the team wasn't all that upset when
Rodman blew off practice during the Finals to go to a wrestling
promo. ``It wasn't going to disrupt that team,'' he said. Only an
incentive-laden deal, along with the return of Jordan and Pippen,
would probably even bring Rodman's name up for discussion for
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AFTERMATH:  &LR; What was it like in the Chicago locker room
immediately after Game 6, when the Bulls had beaten the Jazz to
annex title No. 6? ``There was some jubilation,'' Kleine said,
``but mostly, there was a huge feeling of relief. A lot of people
were simply glad it was finally over, there had been so much stress
and pressure. I mean, people said we had a terrible year and we won
62 games. That's why I think guys were more relieved than anything
else.'' Meanwhile, Kleine was definitely in the jubilation mood. It
was his first title.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE 13th MAN:  &LR; Kleine was left off the playoff roster, and he's
still upset about that. ``Well, you know, I'm like a lot of NBA
guys. If I don't have anything to complain about, I complain about
that. It could have been worse. A lot worse. I realize that.'' The
Bulls told Kleine that he was left off the roster because of
matchups, a curious explanation given their likely bruising battle
with Indiana. ``In my opinion, I was the new guy,'' he said. ``I
think Phil felt more comfortable with the guys he knew. But it was
very disappointing to me because that's what I went there for.''
Kleine is a free agent and will wait and see what happens. ``I may
have to move on to Chapter 2,'' he said. ``The only problem with
that is that it hasn't been written yet.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHEEP:  &LR; When the Bulls' season-ticket holders got their
playoff ticket applications, they were given the following
``options.'' They had to purchase tickets for the maximum number of
games at playoff-inflated prices; in Chicago's case, that would
have been 15 games. There was a box you could check that offered a
refund if the team didn't play all 15 games. But the application
warned that if you took the refund, you were deemed to have
cancelled your season tickets for next season. According to agent
Herb Rudoy, a Bulls' season-ticket holder, it was an easy decision.
He re-upped, and so did most everyone he knows. ``Most people are
not going to turn their tickets in with the possibility that Jordan
might be back,'' he said. Rudoy said he was told by Bulls director
of ticket operations Joe O'Neil that the renewal rate for 1998-99
is close to 100 percent. Meanwhile, one season-ticket holder with
four seats at halfcourt, five rows up, was offered $10,000 per seat
for his seats for what everyone thought would be the clincher, Game
5 against Utah. The ticket holder said ``no thanks,'' and the Bulls
went out and lost the game.

   Short story
</P>
<P>
   &UR; xr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rick Pitino's  &LR; already short free agent list may soon get
trimmed in half.  &UR; Zan Tabak  &LR; is ``95 percent'' certain to sign this
week with a team in Istanbul. (That would make  &UR; Popeye Jones  &LR; the
only Celtic free agent; we're excluding late-season fill-in  &UR; Reggie
Hanson &LR; .) Tabak's deal is comparable to $2 million a year, says
Rudoy, who represents the Croatian center. ``Zan loved Boston, but
we had no assurances from the Celtics,'' Rudoy said. ``Zan is a
very realistic guy, and this is a fabulous deal for him. These
Turkish teams have money, and he can't afford to wait. He has no
problem playing over there.'' The Celtics did call Rudoy to say
that Tabak was in their plans. ``That wasn't enough,'' Rudoy said.
Boston also could do nothing once the lockout was imposed on July
1. ``You may see more of this as the summer goes on,'' Rudoy said.
 &UR; Jayson Williams  &LR; is saying he's been contacted by an Italian team
offering large lire. But it won't be as much as he'll get when he
re-signs with Jersey or goes elsewhere in the NBA ...  &UR; Walter
McCarty  &LR; started 64 games for the Celtics last season, second only
to  &UR; Antoine Walker's  &LR; 82. Those starts were at small forward,
which, we're being told, is the place being held for rookie  &UR; Paul
Pierce &LR; . Not so fast, says McCarty. ``Let's wait and see what
happens when we get out on the court,'' he says. ``I'm not
conceding anything to (Pierce) or to anyone else.'' McCarty has put
on about 16 pounds already and is, according to Pitino, ``in
terrific shape.'' McCarty knows it's best to stay that way, too.
``You had better be ready because when it (the lockout) ends, camp
is going to be tough,'' he said. Pitino, meanwhile, worked out
Pierce in Los Angeles just prior to the lockout and said that the
rookie was calling out the name of every player drafted ahead of
him when he went up to take a shot. ``I was impressed by what I
saw,'' said Pitino ... Former Celtic Assistant Coaches Update:  &UR; Don
Casey  &LR; has an offer from Detroit to join  &UR; Alvin Gentry's  &LR; staff.
It's a two-year offer with a slight bump in salary, and the Nets,
Casey's current employer, have him on board for only one more year.
If Casey does go to Detroit, look for  &UR; John Calipari  &LR; to bring in
old friend  &UR; Bob Hill &LR; . Ironically, when Cal first took the Nets
job, it was Hill, then the coach of the Spurs, who arranged for
Calipari and Casey to get together ...  &UR; Dennis
Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; meanwhile, has been helping Toronto coach  &UR; Butch Carter
 &LR; work out some Raptors and also was involved in preparing  &UR; Jason
Williams &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  DJ had Williams, a point guard from Florida, for about
three weeks prior to the draft. ``I had him on the floor, getting
him to think, putting him through drills, stuff like that,''
Johnson said. ``He was supposed to be a low lottery pick and he
ended up going seventh. I'd like to think I had something to do
with that.'' Johnson says he is hoping to catch on with someone
this year, possibly in a scouting position. There's nothing firm
with Toronto, but, as he put it, ``I'm going to call (general
manager)  &UR; Glen  &LR; ( &UR; Grunwald &LR; ) and see if I can't extend it into
something.'' He also said he threw out his name to  &UR; Elgin Baylor
 &LR; for the Clippers' opening and for an opening with a CBA team in
Idaho. ``You have to let people know you're available,'' he said.

   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution got ahold of an FBI affidavit
in which Hawks backup  &UR; Cadillac Anderson  &LR; admitted to being
involved in a cocaine operation. Anderson already has been charged
with several counts relating to possessing and distributing the
drug. He told the newspaper last week that he would ``get through
it.'' He is a free agent ...  &UR; Dee Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a Reebok fixture
throughout his NBA career, has not been totally jettisoned from the
shoe company, a la Shaq. But his new offer is worth half as much as
the old one, another indication that the shoe companies are cutting
back when they can. Then again, with Brown in Toronto, you may
wonder why Reebok is interested at all. Brown is elated with the
changes the Raptors have made, namely the acquisitions of veterans
 &UR; Charles Oakley  &LR; and  &UR; Kevin Willis  &LR; and the drafting of  &UR; Vince
Carter &LR;  ... The Beantown Basketball League over at Boston College
has some interesting participants, including  &UR; Marcel Anderson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a
6-foot-6-inch bruiser who has quite a few passport stamps. He
played at Northeastern in the 1980s, had two appearances at the
Celtics rookie-free agent camp, and has spent the last two years
playing in China. ``The first year was fine,'' Anderson said.
``Last year, it wasn't so great. The league kinda got postponed.''
Postponed? ``They started this second league and it was financed by
the government, and if you're going to make it over there, it's no
secret that you have to do business with the government.'' Chinese
rules allow four Americans per team, twice as many as Europe, but
no more than two can be on the court at the same time. They play
NBA rules, with a 24-second clock and no zone defenses. ``It was an
experience,'' Anderson said. He also has played in Turkey and
Portugal. His memories of Celtics camp in the late 1980s and early
1990s? ``I didn't have much of a chance. That was when they had the
family all together.'' And now? ``Tell them I'm available. They
could use a good shooter and defender.'' Consider it done.

ROYAL OPEN TEST LOOMS AT BIRKDALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The presence of Ian Baker-Finch will be felt only peripherally
next weekend at the 127th British Open at Royal Birkdale. Just
seven years ago at Pleasant Valley, Baker-Finch lost to Bruce
Fleisher in a playoff that lasted seven holes before he hastily
crossed the pond and won the championship. He would return to the
Greater Hartford Open, the claret jug in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch was sitting on top of the world of golf, an unknown
Australian a few years earlier when he jumped into the British Open
hunt before fading on the last day. But as soon as his star
ascended at Royal Birkdale, it fell out of the golfing skies, and
he has now given up competitive golf.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw was at Royal Troon last year when he withdrew
after an opening round of 92. He had missed 32 consecutive cuts and
was finding it increasingly difficult to hit his ball in the
fairways. ``Really,'' he said earlier this year, ``what I would
like to be able to do is to change my name, come back in a
different body, and go play without the pressure of being Ian
Baker-Finch.'' Next weekend he will be doing commentary for ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Birkdale is a baby in the rotation of courses selected for
the game's oldest championship. The British Open was contested
there for the first time in 1954, when Australian Peter Thomson won
the first of his five Opens. He also won his last title (1965) over
the rugged links course on England's Lancashire Coast. The others
on Royal Birkdale's honor roll of champions are Arnold Palmer
(1961), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976), Tom Watson
(1983), and Baker-Finch. It's the US 4, Australia 3.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has fond memories of the course. ``I remember the last
full shot I hit was a 2-iron on the 72d hole,'' said Watson at the
recent Children's Charity Pro-Am at Willowbend. ``I had 215 (yards)
to the flag, and I had to really flush it to get there. It was into
the wind.'' Watson then had to wait for David Graham to finish out.
``He was slower than molasses,'' said Watson. ``It was about the
best 2-iron I ever hit, and when I did, the crowd went on a full
run. They used to allow them to run up and circle the green. It was
like a freight train. The ball's in the air and they're running up
to the green. I didn't know how close it was. I couldn't hear the
crowd. I heard them clap. I wanted it 2 feet from the hole so I
could two-putt to win. It was 15 feet, so I two-putted from 15 feet
to win by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is typical links golf. It's one of my
favorites. Most of the holes sit down with dunes on either side.
The course fits into the low parts of the land form. The first hole
is a very difficult par 4. I started off with a triple bogey in
1976 and missed the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer won the first of his two British Opens at Royal Birkdale,
and there is a commemorative plaque on the 16th hole at the spot
where he gouged a 6-iron shot to the green en route to the
championship. This is where Jack Nicklaus conceded a putt to Tony
Jacklin for a tie in the 1965 Ryder Cup Matches. This is where a
19-year-old Spaniard named Seve Ballesteros chased Miller to the
wire. This is where Watson won the last of his five Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   They simply introduce the winner on the 18th green as ``the
champion golfer for the year.'' The latest is Justin Leonard, who
left the United States Saturday to get ready to defend his title.
Last year at Scotland's Royal Troon, there were 32 players in the
hunt entering the final round. The only player of the 32 to break
70 was Leonard, who shot a 65. That's how major championships are
won, and that is why many projected the Dallas resident out of the
University of Texas to become one of the game's elite. He went on
to finish second in the PGA Championship and won The Players
Championship in March at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's last tuneup was last weekend at the Greater Hartford
Open, where he finished joint 31st on a 71_275. ``I'm not thinking
about the British Open while I'm on the golf course,'' he said
after a third-round 66. ``I'm hitting the ball well. I haven't
putted all that well. I feel pretty good about the way things
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Birkdale has been lengthened, and some 6,000 scrub pines
have been removed from the vast and sprawling sand hills. The
latter move, wrote Dudley Doust in Golf Magazine, ``has not only
returned a proper links feel to the place but rendered Birkdale the
finest viewing course on the British Open rota. Also, clearing the
trees has let seaside winds rage and frolic in the fairways that
flow through the valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open will mark the end of Jack Nicklaus's incredible streak
of 154 consecutive major championships for which he was eligible
and 146 straight from his first year as a professional in the 1962
Masters. ``I wanted to end the streak on my own terms,'' Nicklaus
said Wednesday on the eve of the Senior Players Championship in
Dearborn, Mich. The ailing left hip that has dogged him in recent
years was the primary reason. He said he might need a new hip, and
realized the time had come. ``I don't want to go out and embarrass
myself,'' said Nicklaus. This isn't a farewell for Nicklaus,
however. He has said he'd like to wind it all up in the British
Open at St. Andrews in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pete Morgan &LR; , who was the surprise first-round leader of the
Greater Hartford Open with a 64, finished with a double bogey and a
73_277 worth $5,022. He grew up in Harwich before attending
Jacksonville University and settling into the Florida mini-tours.
This was the first cut the 35-year-old has made in four PGA Tour
appearances, and he left Cromell, Conn., upbeat about his future.
Morgan, who recently won the Cape Cod Open for the third time and
has won the Massachusetts Open, has made it through the first phase
of Tour Qualifying School only once in eight tries. ``I'm not going
to worry too much about the finish,'' Morgan said. ``I just know
now I can compete with these guys out here.'' ... The hardest part
of getting into the British Open is the qualifying, which takes two
days. For nonexempt US players, it can be an expensive proposition.
``I'm not in,'' says  &UR; Billy Andrade  &LR; of Bristol, R.I., who played
last year at Royal Troon. ``That's not a fun trip to go over and
miss and come all the way back. The reason a lot of guys don't go
is you have to make your hotel arrangements for a week. If you
don't make it, you're out ($4,800).'' ... Tickets for the 1999 US
Open (June 17-20) at Pinehurst CC sold out within 24 hours on June
22. The US Golf Association will be mailing confirmations or
rejections of all applications no earlier than July 31. It is the
Open's 13th consecutive sellout ... Because he failed to make the
cut at the GHO,  &UR; Casey Martin  &LR; decided to accept a sponsor's
exemption to this weekend's Quad Cities event; so he will not be
playing the CVS Charity Classic at Pleasant Valley in two weeks ...
 &UR; Brad Faxon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been struggling amid personal problems
including a divorce, finished on a high note at Hartford, closing
with a 66. ``I woke up,'' he said after the round. ``It was a long
wait. I played great today. It's the best round I've played, the
best round I've putted. It's the most solid I've hit it, the best
I've driven it.'' He will need it all at Royal Birkdale ... Faxon
took time to lament the passing of the PGA Tour stop at Pleasant
Valley after the CVS Charity Classic July 23-26. ``The area
couldn't keep up with PGA Tour corporate golf,'' said Faxon.

   Nothing like hanging your dirty laundry out for all the world to
see.
</P>
<P>
   And we do mean all the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the NBA labor lockout, the league's players callously
threatened to withdraw their participation in this month's FIBA
World Basketball Championships. They were taking their ball and
staying home, thus proving a point.
</P>
<P>
   That it's not the heat _ it's the stupidity. Somebody needs to
explain to me the logic behind not representing your country in
order to prove a point to owners like the Minnesota Timberwolves'
Glen Taylor, who gave Kevin Garnett a $126 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the oft-debated Dream Team concept is considered the
plaything of NBA ownership. By disbanding Dream Team IV, the
players hoped to make their point that they are the straw that
stirs the NBA martini.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but whatever happened to ``I pledge allegiance to the flag
...'' and all of that?
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of Dream Teamers such as Grant Hill, Gary Payton and Tom
Gugliotta, the sport's governing body in this country, USA
Basketball, will be represented in Athens, Greece, by the likes of
Wendell Alexis and Ashraf Amaya.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball scabs, a good union man might call them. And they are
about to get hit on the heads with a global pipe wrench.
</P>
<P>
   Let's review the stakes. The winner in Athens gets a free pass
into the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The other 15 teams
don't necessarily get anything.
</P>
<P>
   Each of FIBA's geographic regions _ Europe, Asia, Oceania and
the Americas _ will likely get to send two more teams to Sydney.
The constitution of FIBA, the game's world governing body, says
only the qualifying tournament winner from each region, plus the
``five or six best-placed teams,'' will round out the Olympic
field.
</P>
<P>
   It seems ludicrous any selection committee would leave out a
card-carrying Dream Team of true NBA stars, but this is FIBA. As
Munich in 1972 proved, schnitzel happens.
</P>
<P>
   And, book it, this Team USA in Athens will get drummed.
Jackhammered. It might not win as many as two games.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis, for instance, plays in Berlin, after last being seen at
Syracuse _ the school, not the island _ in 1986. Amaya plays for
the Idaho Stampede. And Gerard King, playing ball in Italy, earned
his basketball sheepskin at Nicholls State.
</P>
<P>
   The CBA thing, history tells us, will not work. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The last time USA Basketball assembled a crew of CBA players and
outfitted them in Team USA jerseys was at the Pan American Games in
Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The team we sent down featured, among others, Sean Gay of Texas
Tech, ex-Michigan star Rumeal Robinson and Notre Dame center Scott
Paddock. They hailed from teams like the Yakima Sun Kings, the
Shreveport Crawdads and the Mexico Aztecas.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines, however, didn't know any better. As far as they
knew, the Pittsburgh Piranhas (Brian Davis, forward) played the
Chicago Bulls every night.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA finished 4-3, barely edging Uruguay in overtime, and
losing to the host team twice. When the Argentines won the
gold-medal game, 90-86, the standing-room-only crowd of 9,000
poured onto the arena floor, while players hugged and cried and
shouted, ``We beat the Dream Team! We beat the Dream Team!''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was only slightly less bogus than that game
against the aliens in ``Space Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, however, the day is long passed when we can send
over any 10 stiffs and expect to bring back the gold. Any gold.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hasn't won the men's gold medal at the Pan Am
Games since 1983. In 1991, a team that featured Grant Hill, Jim
Jackson, Christian Laettner and Eric Montross finished in third
place. And the last time a non-Dream Team of U.S. players competed
in the Olympics, 1988, it, too, could do no better than the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment that we don't have the NBA guys, but
it's happened, and the guys that are here are working real hard,''
said Rudy Tomjanovich, who is coaching Team Scab.
</P>
<P>
   It's happened, but it's wrong. This isn't an owners' thing. It's
a red, white and blue thing.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a message the NBA players are trying to send, it's
all Greek, so to speak. The ones who aren't going to Athens look
greedy, foolish and unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the whole world knows. Fan-tastic.

SHOCKED FATHER DIES AFTER SON IS MURDERED ON ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   OAK BLUFFS, Martha's Vineyard _ An early-morning stabbing, the
first murder on Martha's Vineyard in two decades, developed into a
double tragedy for a well-known Vineyard family, police said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Moreis, 37, was stabbed in the chest in an attack outside
his home on Warwick Avenue, according to Police Chief Joseph
Carter. As Moreis was being treated at Martha's Vineyard Hospital,
his 66-year-old father, Peter, suffered a fatal heart attack while
rushing to see his son.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Moreis was transported to Boston Medical Center,
where he died at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths left the town's 3,000 year-round residents reeling,
not only because of the rarity of violent crime on the island, but
also because Peter Moreis was a well-loved figure.
</P>
<P>
   Police have no suspect in the stabbing, which they said occurred
during a fight. Authorities have interviewed one witness and
recovered a knife they believe to be the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   While police declined to discuss a motive in the stabbing,
speculation among Vineyard residents that the slaying was
drug-related was fueled by Gary Moreis's June 19 arrest for cocaine
possession. Those charges were pending at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Moreis also was arrested for selling cocaine in 1986. The
charges against him and 24 others in that case were dropped because
an undercover agent had used cocaine with the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The older Moreis, known in Oak Bluffs as ``Peter Pop,'' suffered
a heart attack at 2:35 a.m. in the hospital parking lot. He had
undergone open-heart surgery a few years ago and was in poor
health, according to a family friend. Police blame the shock of his
son's stabbing for precipitating the heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Moreis, who had a 6-year-old son and a 12-year-old stepson,
worked as an auto mechanic. His father, who had five other
children, was a former police officer who wore innumerable hats in
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Moreis held the elected title of town constable for the
past decade and served as a volunteer firefighter and on several
town committees. He drove a school bus in winter and a shuttle for
vacationers in summer. He also managed the local Veterans of
Foreign Wars post and was a VFW district commander.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Williamson, a retired Oak Bluffs police chief, called the
elder Moreis one of the most popular citizens on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any church on the island could hold all the
people who will come to his funeral,'' Williamson said. ``Peter Pop
was very, very kind to people and always a lot of fun and full of
laughter. He could charm anybody with his blue eyes _ they looked
right through you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson was looking forward to sharing an annual birthday
beer with Moreis, who would have turned 67 next week. They had been
close friends since serving as patrolmen together in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Moreis, Peter Moreis's nephew, counted his uncle among the
best of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call him `Peter Pop the Rotten Cop,' because he
used to chase us kids around and made sure we didn't do anything
wrong,'' Jimmy Moreis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Rusczyk, chairman of the town Board of Selectmen, said:
``Peter Pop was a man of boundless humor, and he was genuinely
loved in our community. He had contagious laughter _ you heard it
before he even came around. His death is a real blow to this
community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Moreis was lesser known around town, locals also
spoke of him with affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary was a fun-loving guy,'' Jimmy Moreis said. ``He had some
problems, but he would take the shirt off his back for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vineyard's last murder, in 1978, also ultimately left both a
father and son dead.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday night in January of that year, 20-year-old Duane
Brady sat in the living room with a shotgun, waiting for his
father, the Rev. D. Norman Brady, to return from the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The son then chased the minister out of the house and into the
nearby Charlotte Inn, where he killed his father.
</P>
<P>
   In court, the younger Brady was acquitted by reason of insanity
and committed to Bridgewater State Hospital. He hanged himself two
years later.

BARTHEZ'S GOAL IS KEEPING GAME IN PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAINT-DENIS, France _ His shaved head, shining like a cue ball
beneath the lights of Stade de France, has become a lucky charm, a
porte-bonheur, for his defenders, who rub it just before kickoff.
Fabien Barthez has been in goal for every minute of every match for
France in the World Cup, and has allowed just one goal during the
run of play.
</P>
<P>
   While the buzz in this suddenly soccer-mad country has been all
about Zizou (Zinedine Zidane), Lolo (Laurent Blanc), and Thuthu
(Lilian Thuram), the ``joyful hermit'' has been the comforting
constant, prowling the box in smooth pate, goatee, and all-black
garb, hanging up zeros.
</P>
<P>
   And if France can do what the rest of the planet deems
impossible (and they themselves concede is as unlikely as Voltaire
coming back to play stopper) and beat champion Brazil here Sunday
for the world title, odds are Barthez will be the man who made it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   He is the last line of Les Bleus' formidable defense, its
gardien de but. There are tenders of goal and keepers of goal
elsewhere, but in France they are guardians of goal, with a
responsibility that approaches the religious. ``We owe it to
ourselves as gardiens,'' says Barthez, ``to be the masters of our
18-meter domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Barthez wants to be master of more than that. He'll come well
out of the area to boom the ball downfield. He'll roam with it at
his feet like an 11th field player or hurl it to a midfielder,
looking to create something at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Barthez's non-identical twin is Paraguay's Jose Luis Chilavert,
who'll often sally into the other half of the field and even takes
free kicks. ``I honestly believe Fabien could convert one, too,''
says Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   He may work in a cage, but Barthez is a free spirit who yearns
for open space. ``In my head, I'm a player,'' he told L'Equipe,
France's sporting daily. ``I don't want to stay in the goal all
alone. I have to be with the others, to share the game with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing behind one of the world's best defensive units actually
makes Barthez antsy. Guarding the goal in the early blowouts of
South Africa and Saudi Arabia made him feel Garboesque. ``It's
tiring not to touch the ball,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Barthez prefers the ocean to the stadium. His favorite playmates
are dolphins _ he has one tattooed on a shoulder. Onze magazine
photographed him chewing on a daisy stem, looking a bit like Pete
Townshend of The Who. He'll be the one who isn't singing ``La
Marseillaise'' during the pre-match anthem ceremony, the one who's
smiling. ``That's how I am,'' he shrugs. ``I don't want to change
my way of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including national coach Aime Jacquet, thought the
26-year-old Barthez was a bit too free-spirited to guard the goal
for Les Bleus in the Mondial, especially after he tested positive
for marijuana three years ago and was suspended from the French
league for four months.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Bernard Lama, who had 37 international
appearances for France, holds the record for most consecutive
scoreless minutes (800) with Les Bleus, and figured to be starting
keeper, was suspended for the same thing last year. Paris
Saint-Germain dumped Lama, who had to go across the Channel to find
a job with West Ham United.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jacquet did put Lama on the Cup roster, he decided to go
with Barthez, who'd backstopped Monaco to last year's French league
title. Once he shut out the South Africans in the opener in the
teeth of a howling Mistral in Marseille, Barthez became the
guardian angel. And as Les Bleus kept advancing and the stakes got
higher and his mates stopped scoring, Barthez simply loomed larger.
</P>
<P>
   He kept Paraguay off the board until Blanc provided ``La
Delivrance'' with a goal in the 113th minute. Then he shut down
Italy for 120 in the quarterfinals and blocked a penalty kick by
Demetrio Albertini in the shootout right after Bixente Lizarazu had
one stopped by Italian keeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
</P>
<P>
   And in last week's historic semifinal against Croatia, Barthez
finally conceded a goal, on a breakaway, but then slammed the door
time after time while Les Bleus played a man down for the final 16
minutes. Yet all the while Barthez appeared unruffled, even
tranquil. ``He's a very relaxed lad,'' says his father, who played
stand-off half for the rugby team at the Narbonne Racing Club. ``He
doesn't think he's Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Barthez doesn't feel the squeeze, especially with Les
Bleus on a ride that's already touched off the greatest celebration
in Paris since the Liberation. ``Even if I sometimes have a relaxed
air about me, I feel the same pressure as the others,'' he says.
``But I handle it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He may want to roam the field, to share the game with his mates,
but Barthez is a guardian alone and he knows it. The unruffled
expression is a mask.
</P>
<P>
   Barthez constantly worries about being scored on. He stewed
about the penalty kick he gave up to Denmark's Michael Laudrup for
days; he wanted to keep a clean sheet for the tournament. He says,
``I'm always telling myself: `Fabien, pay attention. No
stupidity.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, attention must be paid to the Brazilians _ and then
some. Ronaldo, Bebeto, Rivaldo, and the rest are out to make some
history of their own _ no country has won five Cups and none since
Brazil in 1962 has repeated. Blanc will be sitting out a red-card
suspension, and the French attackers haven't scored for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If Barthez can keep a clean sheet tonight and put Les Bleus on
top of the world, they'll erect a statue to him under the Arc de
Triomphe _ with a daisy in its mouth. ``Whatever happens, when the
Mondial is over, the guys back home in Lavelanet will see the same
Fabien they've always known,'' he says. ``I'll stay the same.''
Napoleon, he ain't.

RESEARCHERS TEST ANTI-IMPOTENCE PILL ON FEMALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Those little blue pills may hold promise for women,
too.
</P>
<P>
   This week, two Boston University researchers will begin the
second phase of one of the first US studies on the effects of
Viagra on women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Berman, 34, a urologist, and her sister Laura, 29,
a sex therapist, are conducting the pioneering two-year study of
women and Viagra, which has been demonstrated to increase the blood
flow to the genital area of some men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cure-all pill that is going to make a marriage
better, make someone happy, or increase desire,'' Jennifer Berman
said. ``But what it does do is increase sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman is a protege of Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a professor of
urology at the BU School of Medicine and a leading expert on male
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary research, the Bermans say, indicates Viagra may
increase the ability of many women to have pleasurable sex and
reach orgasm. If the hypothesis proves correct, Viagra could
revolutionize the sexual lives of millions of women, a fact that
seems to have been lost amid the din of chest thumping and locker
room talk that has characterized debate over the new drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early reports seem to indicate that a woman's sexual
problems seem to get better with Viagra,'' said Dr. Robert J.
Krane, chairman of the BU urology department. But, Krane cautions,
``it obviously needs to be studied to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the study, which will include about 100
women, some from as far away as Hawaii and Michigan, will include
an evaluation at BU and culminate for many in a prescription for
Viagra. The cost of participating ranges from $300 to $700.
</P>
<P>
   Women capable of bearing children generally are excluded,
because it is not yet known how the drug affects fertility.
Additionally, the women will be required to periodically complete
surveys detailing their sexual behavior and response.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, about 36 have been enrolled for the second phase, with
others calling, writing, and pleading for appointments in the
coming months. The study is the first conducted by the new Women's
Sexual Health Clinic at BU. Jennifer Berman, who is director of the
new center, led the first phase of the study at the University of
Maryland at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Mary R., a 54-year-old graphic designer from Wakefield, is
hoping Viagra will allow her to experience orgasms again, four
years after a hysterectomy robbed her of a healthy sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like cutting off your arm,'' she said. ``You are
not the same person, you don't feel the same, and you feel a little
less of a woman because you can't respond enough to a physical
relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to lose by trying it and seeing what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's ability to increase blood flow to the penis and
remedy erectile dysfunction in some men may hold particular
implications for women, since the clitoris essentially is the
female version of the penis and becomes engorged with blood during
arousal. In addition, Viagra seems to help women become aroused by
relaxing the smooth muscles of the vagina.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years menopausal women have been written off, because
you are not supposed to want sex at an older age,'' Laura Berman
said. ``The reason they are not interested in sex is because sex is
not pleasurable.'' Sexual intercourse may be more painful, and the
vagina more difficult to lubricate.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra also has inadvertently opened the door to more medical
interest and research into the mechanics of female arousal, a
subject traditionally considered a province of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we were met with resistance and jeers and snickers;
people were horrified,'' said Jennifer Berman, who is financing the
study in part through a grant from the American Foundation of
Urological Disease. ``Nobody understands female arousal. As long as
you were able to have intercourse and it didn't hurt, everybody
thought everything was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the difficulties is that it is more difficult clinically
to measure female sexual arousal. And dysfunction in women is
harder to pinpoint, its causes more tricky to define. Researchers
are still grappling with a basic question: Which comes first,
physical arousal or desire?
</P>
<P>
   Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of
sildenafil citrate, or Viagra, for male impotence last spring,
doctors have been inundated with requests for the drug, which is
manufactured by Pfizer Inc. Launched April 10, Viagra prescriptions
through June 26 totaled 2.7 million, pushing US sales of the drug
to $409 million its first quarter in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The pills, which are supposed to be swallowed 30 minutes to one
hour before the desired effect, retail for between $7 and $10
apiece. Many health insurance companies will not reimburse patients
for costs associated with taking Viagra, as it is considered a
sexual enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects can include dizziness, flushing of the skin, and
digestive difficulties. Also, some heart medications can be deadly
when combined with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has yet to conduct US trials on the efficacy of the drug
on women, though it is conducting a trial on several hundred women
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pfizer has conclusive data supporting use of Viagra for
women, it is not advising them to take the medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never take a drug where there isn't scientific data
to back up its use in a particular population,'' said a company
spokeswoman, Mariann Caprino. ``It just hasn't been studied.''
</P>
<P>
   But antecdotal evidence indicates that some determined women are
obtaining Viagra through their doctors, or from husbands with
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Viagra is generating its share of unabashed female
converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's miraculous how it works,'' says Bonnie Myers, 41, who
participated in the first phase of the study. Myers, who had a
hysterectomy 12 years ago, says she had not experienced an orgasm
in a decade _ until Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend $30 a week to have sex; that's horrible, but it's a
fact of life. And, it is a medical miracle for me and that's the
way I look at it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying I am a hornball,'' she added with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A few younger folks on her husband Russell's softball team tease
him about his wife's use of Viagra, but he just brushes it off.
``The only thing I could say for the husbands: Don't feel slighted
and embarrassed, because your wife is going to try it,'' he said.
``It has nothing to do with your manhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might find it much more enjoyable,'' he added.

TAKE A BREAK FROM THE HEAT; SURF THESE COWBOYS PAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys training camp opens Wednesday in Wichita Falls, which
means, if you're a diehard fan, you can do one of two things:
</P>
<P>
   Drive to Wichita Falls, wait around in 150-degree heat with the
sweating huddled masses for a glimpse of your heroes with hopes
that they'll sign an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Or stay in the climate-controlled comforts of your home or
office, calling up Cowboys sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose the first option, fold this newspaper into a big
hat because you'll need it in that searing Wichita Falls heat. If
you selected the latter option, here's one Web surfer's guide to
quality Cowboys pages: &QL; 
BEST PAGES BEHIND ENEMY LINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winner: Though Gary Morris of Folsom, Calif., might be stuck
in San Francisco 49ers country, it doesn't appear to deter his
enthusiasm for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Morris posts from five to 25 Cowboys articles
per day on Gary's Cowboys News Site (www.jps.net/garywm). He posts
the latest updates to rosters and depth charts. He also includes a
section to find the Cowboys on satellite, a must when trapped
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   Morris personalizes his effort with game previews and reviews
and his handy ``Gary's Technical Guide to Pro Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up: Deep in Redskins country, David Braesicke of
Washington has loads of information on his favorite team at his
Cowboys page (wj.net/braesick/cowboys/cowboys.html). During the
season, the Game Day section includes box scores and statistics of
the current game and a running account of the season's best
performances. Braesicke also posts a Ring of Honor section, a
trivia section, links and a lot of media-guide data.

   Another runner-up: A fan since 1967, Keith Bauer of Menominee,
Mich., said he started Keith's Cowboys Page
(user.cybrzn.com/~keith) ``just to see if I could and to show
people that not everyone who lives in this area is a Packers fan.''
During the season, Bauer posts updated statistics for Troy Aikman,
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin. Bauer also has a pictorial history
of the Cowboys quarterback position and images of the team's famous
cheerleaders. &QL;

<P>
   The winner: Jim Beasley of Franklin Park, N.J., has compiled a
no-frills unofficial media guide of the Cowboys since 1960 on his
Dallas Cowboys History and Stats Page
(www.geocities.com/~jrbeasley/dallas/start.html). Beasley also
posts the team's yearly draft selections and historical summaries
of how the Cowboys have done against the rest of the NFL.

<P>
   Best fan page made by a Longhorns fan: Neil Panchal, a
19-year-old sophomore electrical engineering major at the
University of Texas, has been a Cowboys fan since birth, and it
shows.

MAYFIELD IS NASCAR'S NEW BIG WHEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOUDON, N.H. _ Earl Sadler just wonders what took Jeremy
Mayfield so long to get to the top of NASCAR's racing world.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1989 and Mayfield, then 20, had gone about as far as his
own cash was going to take him driving go-carts and then race cars
and it was time to leave home in Owensboro, Ky., and get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of ran out of money to keep driving my race car,'' said
Mayfield, inside his car hauler at New Hampshire International
Speedway Friday afternoon. ``But all I ever wanted to do was be in
racing, either on a crew or doing something else to make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield hooked up with Earl Sadler of Sadler Bros. Trucking and
Leasing in Nashville _ Earl Sadler, who had sent a few other
drivers, Sterling Marlin and the late Davey Allison among them, on
to Winston Cup fame.
</P>
<P>
   There was no driving in the Mayfield deal. No guarantee driving
would ever be part of the deal. Mayfield was a fabricator, helping
build cars. Race cars. Fabricating, not racing. But it was a job in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a metal man, and he was real good at that,'' Sadler
said from Nashville the other day. ``I had some other drivers at
that time, and he started setting up their cars to race. He was
almost like a crew chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Mayfield was driving. He was real good at that, too.
</P>
<P>
   He ran a local series in Nashville for Sadler and did well
there. Ran the Automobile Racing Club of America series for Sadler
and cleaned up there.
</P>
<P>
   He made his Winston Cup debut with a single race for Sadler in
1993. By the end of the next year, Cale Yarborough had come along
with a better offer and Jeremy Mayfield was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know the name? You will.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of Winston Cup racing already do. His hauler here is
parked in between Jeff Gordon's and Mark Martin's. Gordon, a
two-time Cup series champion and winner of two NHIS races, leads
the points race again and thus gets parking spot No. 1 in the row
of haulers. Mayfield is next, as befits his No. 2 spot in points.
Martin, Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace, and the brothers Labonte are
among those giving chase.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield starts 30th in Sunday's race. He was 17th in last
July's race here and 25th in September, but in both races had
worked his way into the Top 10 before running into problems. He ran
into raindrops during his qualifying attempt Friday night and
missed out on the Top 25 and had to qualify again Saturday. ``When
you get raindrops hitting your windshield, that kind of knocks your
confidence down a little,'' he said. ``But I'm sure that we'll get
back up front sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield got his first career Cup victory a couple of races ago
at Pocono. He led the points standings for three weeks with a
series of consistent finishes. He's the only driver to finish in
the Top 25 in every race this year.
</P>
<P>
   The name recognition is coming.
</P>
<P>
   He was back near Owensboro the other night for a hometown
autograph session that was scheduled for two hours and stretched to
four. He has enjoyed watching as his support has picked up
throughout the country. He was thrilled by the backing of his
colleagues at Pocono, where the drivers came up beside him to
congratulate him on his victory lap and their crews stood and
cheered him on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the best feeling of the whole win for me,''
Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, the Cuppers were in Sonoma, Calif., when a young
fan approached looking for a Mayfield autograph and asked one of
the two guys dressed in team Mobil 1 uniforms. And then was
directed to the other _ Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield just laughed. And signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came up through in my career, you'd hear that stuff,''
Mayfield said. ``Who's this? Who's that? That's what drives me. It
motivates me. `Who's that guy?' Whatever. It gets my blood pumping.
I love that. It pushes you to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if it's not Jeremy who? it will be something else, he
figures. He and Rusty Wallace, his teammate this year, were talking
about it just the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty was laughing,'' Mayfield said. ``With me it was I
haven't won a race, I haven't won a race. Rusty hasn't won in
40-something races. It's always something. That's what makes the
sport great. But for us to get wrapped up in that, that will never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, he says, will he spend a lot of time thinking about a
series championship. Stay focused. It helps during a long season.
Helps on the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good talent for missing wrecks,'' said crew chief
Paul Andrews, who won his first Cup championship with the late Alan
Kulwicki in 1992. ``He's got a good eye for when they're getting
ready to happen. He watches the guys in front of him and sees the
cars and sees who's getting wild and who's getting crazy. Some guys
are so focused on what their car is doing, they're unfocused on
what is happening around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, he said, looks to get the most _ but not too much _
out of the car. Most of the time, there has been plenty to get out
of the Michael Kranefuss and Roger Penske-owned Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been pretty awesome,'' Andrews said. ``It just gets
better with more experience. To me it's a confidence level, and
ours is up. Confidence means a lot in this business, in any
business. And our car keeps getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a third-place finish in the season-opener at Daytona
and then shots at the first win at Darlington and Texas and finally
the break-through race at Pocono.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Mayfield, 13th in points overall last season
after staying in the Top 10 most of the season, has maintained an
even keel.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked his way up the hard way. He's humble. He has a
feel for the car and does a nice job letting his crew in on that
feel and what the car might need for adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fancy. Nothing flashy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a style and an attitude that will likely continue to bring
him fans like Steve Black of Scituate, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be Davey Allison fans and really haven't had
anybody to root for since,'' Black said. ``Jeremy has a good ride
and he's doing well. He's not like Gordon, running everyone off the
track. He's a pretty fair racer. You've got to give Gordon credit,
he's a good racer, but he pushes it a little too hard sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayfield is more like an old-time racer like Yarborough or
(David) Pearson,'' Black said. ``He races hard but fair. He's
climbed the ladder and he's got up there with the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Earl Sadler knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it all, I want to say he's a one-man show,'' Sadler
said with a laugh. ``He's a little late in getting there, I think.
But he just hasn't had the car, that's the main thing. He can do it
all. He can sheet metal. He can paint. He's just a fine boy. And he
enjoys it. He enjoys what he's doing. You can get to the top if you
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's gotten there.

- on a cool and lovely evening on the beautifully restored Great

other motorcycle-friendly bars in the city are seeing larger crowds
of bikers this summer. Veteran riders, for whom it has never been
uncool, say interest has actually been building in New York for the

women's movement. King believes that tennis has failed to embrace
new ideas that could rejuvenate it. Her most consistently

Station's $9.99 buffet, one of dozens of casino buffets in Las
Vegas. While local residents have become experts on which buffets
offer the best bargain, perhaps the most ardent pilgrims are
retirees, who get coupons, discounts and other breaks that often
put the price of a limitless meal for two below $11. That includes
non-alcoholic beverages and as much pie, cake and pastry as a body
can manage. (Monica Almeida/New York Times Photo)

in Las Vegas has a buffet that spans 50 yards with more than seven
ethnic sub-buffets. Overstuffed, underpriced smorgasbords have long
been a staple of Las Vegas' tourist trade, an enticement and reward
for spending money in casinos. But a lure for heavy rollers is
becoming a lifestyle for heavy eaters as the city's resident
population swells, in more ways than one. (Monica Almeida/New York

CONNORS FINALLY PUT IN HIS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The blue-collar tennis player got his eternal
blue ribbon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While a band played ``When the Saints Go Marchin' In,'' James
Scott Connors strode onto the lawn where the inaugural US Tennis
Championships was staged 117 years before, shortly to be anointed
as one of the game's saints himself. A sellout crowd of 3,800 at
the antique timber playground, Newport's Casino, screamed, stomped,
waved, applauded _ not exactly proper form for a canonization _
because their man was going into the International Tennis Hall of
Fame, the 59th American male to make it.
</P>
<P>
   He was everyman's champ, and knew it. Boston blueblood Dick
Sears won the first seven US titles on this sod. Connors, hardly a
kindred spirit, won five on three different footings (grass, clay,
asphalt) in rather more trying times and ``wanted to bring tennis
to the general sports fans, to make it really exciting. That's why
I put out, gave the best I had all the time. I wanted to go beyond
the usual tennis fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Way beyond. Pugnacious Jimmy Connors _ ``Jimbo'' to
his doting and demanding mom, Gloria Connors _ gave the customers
transfusions and got the same in return. ``The fans won me more
matches than I can remember _ whether they were for me or against
me. I think they liked my workmanlike style. It was work _
grinding, dedication, sacrifice. But work I loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Trim and poised as he nears his 46th birthday, but confessing he
now has to wear glasses to read, he pulled them out for his
affecting speech in which he lauded his mother, wife Patti,
daughter Aubree, 12, and towering son Brett, 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom,'' he says, ``gave me this game, along with her mom
(Bertha Thompson). They rolled balls to me when I could hardly hold
a racket. That was the start. For all these years my mom has been
three things: mom, coach, and friend. And it's still that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyful tears glistened in the sunshine on the cheeks of wife and
mother as he saluted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to write that Patti must be a saint to put up with
Jimmy Connors. That's one thing the press got right. I was selfish,
a loner with pretty much one thing in mind _ winning. I was away a
lot. But Patti and I agreed on how we wanted the kids raised. That
they're going in the right direction, and following their own paths
as I did _ they don't play tennis _ is the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying in early after beating Patrick McEnroe in a World Team
Tennis match Friday night, Connors was clearly touched by his
introduction to Newport and the Hall's museum.
</P>
<P>
   He had never set out to make this journey, not a man for
ceremony and nostalgia. But, he smiles, ``This is it. The
culmination of all those years of breaking my back to be the best.
I am truly honored. I'd only heard about the Hall, but now, seeing
all those people inducted here, I'm glad to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny David, daughter of the other member of the Class of '98,
the late Herman David, felt ``thrilled to accept for him.'' David,
once an Oxford Blue, got his blue ribbon here, cited as a bold,
thoughtful, historic English administrator. The Wimbledon boss in
1968, he was determined, his daughter says, ``that the best players
must play there, whether amateur or professional.'' Largely through
his influence and energetic persuasion, the segregation of amateurs
and pros was knocked out and ``open tennis'' came in 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   David was a rebel in his genteel way, Connors more conspicuous
in his rebelliousness _ adored or despised but never ignored. His
disputes with court officials got him thrown out, suspended, fined,
and his hand signals and antics would not have qualified him as an
altar boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bad boy _ and I liked it at the time,'' Jimmy says,
his brown eyes mischievous at the memory. ``This didn't come from
home, but the street. I grew up with some tough people.'' Early
days in rough-edged East St. Louis and Belleville, Ill., weren't
the usual environment for tennis, but they made him a fighter. As a
boy he saw a man killed in a saloon where he had accompanied his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where my intensity came from, but (John) McEnroe
wasn't the only perfectionist out there. I got cranky when I
couldn't meet my own expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, with his record 109 pro singles titles (eight majors)
is the most highly decorated American male to settle into the Hall
since Don Budge brought his six majors in 1964. Budge, 85, the
original Grand Slammer, was among the witnesses, and he, too, was
cheered by the throng on the 60th anniversary of his majestic feat,
duplicated only by four others: Rod Laver (1962, '69), Maureen
Connolly (1953), Margaret Court (1970), and Steffi Graf (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy slammed thousands of winners, and a few doors in the faces
of reporters, including this one. ``It was all part of the fun,
wasn't it?'' he laughs. He's right. He generated fun for anyone who
saw him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the best was the 11 days in 1991, the US Open,'' he
says. ``Wrist surgery saved my career, but I was supposed to be
finished.'' Coming in at No. 936, a wild card, he surged to the
semis. ``It was crazy. Pandemonium. It's the way I wanted tennis to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the day of James the Great.

CRAVEN FOCUSING IN ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ It was the morning after the magical night before
and race car driver Ricky Craven, the pride of Newburgh, Maine, was
still toast of the track and the talk of the pits at New Hampshire
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals raved about how Craven captured the moment Friday evening
and grabbed the top qualifying position for Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300
in his first competitive run in his Winston Cup car since March.
</P>
<P>
   How he grabbed the pole as the last car to go out to qualify.
Grabbed it in front of hometown fans on the track where he
established much of his fame.
</P>
<P>
   All certainly would wish Craven _ recently sidelined with
post-concussion syndrome _ luck the rest of the weekend, too.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he didn't mind luck that started with second place.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it was time to turn attention to Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Craven recognized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect script as if someone had written it,'' Craven
said of his Friday night. ``You love to watch those movies. Well,
yesterday we played in it and it was pretty cool. Really the focus
now is that we've got half the job done and there's a still a lot
of work left.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the focus of teammate Jeff Gordon, who is starting
alongside Craven on the front row and has won two races here, four
Cup races this year, and is the Cup points leader. And it is the
focus of Dale Jarrett and Chad Little, who start in the second row,
Jeff Burton and Kyle Petty in the row behind that.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the many who will make a run in Sunday's 300-lap
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in pretty good shape,'' Jarrett said. ``If we
had to start the race right now, I think we'd have a car we could
put in the Top 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and the others near the front of the pack have taken
care of step one _ track position _ for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Position on the track has always been hugely important here,
where the configuration with its tight, slightly-banked corners
make it tough to pass. Drivers can't carry a lot of speed into the
corners and thus have to worry about bringing their cars back up to
speed before they worry about passing as they head down the
straightaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a place that's one of the easiest to pass,'' said Ken
Schrader, who is starting 26th. ``You need to get by people any way
you can. You try to get by them on the track, beat them in the
pits.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to not only have a good car and driver, you've got
to really pay attention,'' said Ray Evernham, crew chief for Jeff
Gordon. ``You've got to have good pit stops. It falls on the whole
team and the crew chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham and Gordon and Co. have made the track work. They won
the last race here in September when Evernham called for taking on
gas only during a late pit stop while challenger Ernie Irvan took
on tires. Gordon gained track position and Irvan could never catch
him.
</P>
<P>
   They also won in 1995, the only team with two victories here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tricky place,'' Evernham said. ``It's interesting for
fans and I guarantee one thing _ nobody is going to take off and
run away and make this a boring race.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven's crowd wouldn't mind a boring race. Or a win at the wire
for that matter. This is Winston Cup race No. 98 for Craven and
he's looking for his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're halfway there,'' one fan told him after practice
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he needed was to come home, right?'' another fan said to a
crew member outside Craven's hauler.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.

FINAL IS CONFLICT OF STYLES, EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Regardless of the result of the World Cup final,
France's national team will be honored on the Champs-Elysees Monday
and participate in Bastille Day celebrations the next day. There is
a feeling of gratitude and relief that France has finally reached
the championship game, nearly 100 years after Frenchmen Gabriel
Hanot and Jules Rimet conceived the idea of a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's fate is not as certain. The Brazilians are 5,000 miles
from home, and the nature of their welcome is based solely on the
outcome of Sunday's game at Stade de France. Theirs is the only
country that has participated in every World Cup finals, and they
are fully expected to perform joyously and win every time.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for France are different. Traditionally, Les Bleus
have charmed and enticed with skillful, thoughtful play.
Entertainment and style were first, results secondary. But in this
World Cup France has broken with tradition, using a pragmatic,
defensive scheme to steamroller into the championship game for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   So, what stereotyping would indicate to be an inspiring, all-out
attacking exhibition between Brazil's samba soccer and France's
champagne soccer will likely be a clash of South American flash and
European conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, as usual, will come to play. But only after the
first 20 minutes _ which is about the amount of time coach Mario
Zagallo figures it will take for his team to find its rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an early goal is scored, there is little chance of this
game duplicating the fireworks of these nations' Mexico '86 meeting
in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   France, which produced the World Cup's first goal in 1930 and
the event's all-time leading scorer, has recoiled into a defensive
shell. The French have scored 12 goals, one fewer than Just
Fontaine converted in leading them to third place in the 1958 World
Cup, and surrendered two.
</P>
<P>
   Either French sensibilities have changed, or the euphoria of
success has corrupted their appreciation of the aesthetics of
sport.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other factors involved. After failing to
qualify for USA '94, France went nearly three years without losing,
convincing many that coach Aimee Jacquet was going in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also captured imaginations because of the way it
reflects the country's assimilation process. There is a strong
flavor of Africa, Armenia, the Caribbean, and Polynesia combined
with Basques, Bretons, and traditional Gallois. Jacquet has
successfully blended these players, dropping those who he
considered potential problems. That has meant the exclusion of
imaginative performers, leaving France without a playmaker in the
mold of Eric Cantona or Michel Platini. The skillful French players
_ Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane _ do not perform efficiently, do
not make tasks appear easy, partially because of the composition of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet has developed a group that destroys more than it
creates, earning him consistently strong criticism from the sports
daily L'Equipe. Midfielder Didier Deschamps, the captain and
France's player of the year two years ago, was described as a
``water carrier'' by Cantona. But these Gunga Dins of soccer are on
the verge of accomplishing more than the poets of the past,
prompting President Jacques Chirac to nominate the team for the
Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   The domestique playing style can take a team only so far. Now,
the French must dredge up some creative elements, especially since
their defense could become vulnerable without Laurent Blanc,
suspended after being ejected from the 2-1 semifinal win over
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil does not seem to have the same sense of purpose as the
1994 champions, whose uncompromising defensive tactics offended the
sensibilities of many Brazilians but provided the basis for a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   This Brazil team is in transition, not yet molded by the trials
of having to qualify for tournaments. Brazil has flaws _ a
vulnerable defense, lack of a true ``No. 10'' midfielder, an
unsettled striking combination. But the Brazilians have reverted to
their instincts, which means they will take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though this has been a wide-open World Cup, the best
match-ups have been when the Europeans have had to react to
unfamiliar or unorthodox tactics of African, Asian, Caribbean, and
Latin American teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play like Brazilians, creative football,'' Zagallo
said during training at Ozoir La Ferriere. ``I don't like European
football.''

ULSTER FOES IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVOID CLASH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Protestant and Roman Catholic
officials, refusing to meet one another face to face, had several
hours of contact through intermediaries on Saturday, trying to
prevent increasing violence over the Protestant Orange Order's
insistence that it be allowed to march through a resentful Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown, west of here.
</P>
<P>
   Only slight progress was reported as the session was adjourned
until next week, possibly Tuesday. This meant that the two sides
were risking more violence among Protestants who want the march to
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The march by the Orange Order, down the Garvaghy Road in the
Drumcree neighborhood, was blocked last Sunday by the British
government, which has deployed several thousand police officers and
army troops to keep the Protestants away from the Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   The blockade has produced nightly violence by Protestant
protesters in Portadown, 25 miles west of here. The violence has
also spread to the rest of this predominantly Protestant British
province.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no agreement over the weekend, politicians and
security officials say, the violence will increase on Monday, when
more than 500 Orange parades are to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants say the marches are a basic democratic right of
assembly and an expression of their cultural and historical
heritage, as they celebrate a 17th-century military victory of
Protestants over Catholics in Ireland. Catholics say the marches
are triumphalist and demeaning to them.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators were obeying rules that forbid them to talk to
reporters, who learned only that the talks were being held in a
local government office in Armagh, west of here. The talks were
initiated by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who sent his
chief-of-staff, Jonathan Powell, to Belfast to arrange them. Two
intermediaries, called ``facilitators,'' were to shuttle between
the sides, which were in separate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse over the march was largely a matter of face-saving
for the Catholic Residents Coalition and the Orange Order. Neither
side wanted to be vulnerable to charges that it flinched or backed
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholics insisted that there be ``no Orange feet on the
Garvaghy Road,'' that the government ban on the march must be
enforced. Their leader, Breandan MacCionnaith, also insisted that
the Orangemen meet him face to face if they wanted to compromise.
They rejected his offer to allow a modest parade to pass down the
road next year, but not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen object to meeting MacCionnaith because they
consider him a terrorist. He served three years in a British prison
for his role in the bombing of a Protestant meeting hall in
Portadown in 1981. He is not a member of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army, but Sinn Fein helps him to be
elected a local councilor by not running its own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and security officials fear that if there is no
resolution to the dispute by tonight, tens of thousands of
Protestants from all over the province will march on Drumcree and
clash with the security forces blocking the roads connecting the
Protestant and Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics say the blockade, set up for their protection, is
putting them in a cage. To dramatize their contention, they have
been bringing in carloads of groceries and arguing that the
Orangemen and the army are trying to starve them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, the day the march was blocked, Protestant
protesters have attacked the police with more than 500 gasoline
bombs, hijacked and burned dozens of cars, and blocked major roads.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, protesters have broken through the first line of
three barbed-wire coils forming the defensive cordon, and they
seriously injured three policemen with homemade pipe bombs. Other
protesters shot large ball bearings out of slingshots. The police
responded by firing plastic bullets, which are rarely deadly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday nights, the violence continued, although
news of the new talks appeared to have reduced the number of
protesters. On Thursday, the police estimated that there were
20,000; Friday night the number was down to 2,000 or 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, 20 civilians were injured, according to the
Orange Order. The police said 54 of their officers had been hurt.
They also released a film made Friday at Drumcree showing two
masked men firing rifles at the security forces. The shots hit no
one, the police added, but struck armored Land Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, Catholic and Protestant, fear that more violence is
likely over the weekend and on Monday, when tens of thousands of
Orangemen march throughout the province to celebrate the victory at
the 1690 Battle of the Boyne, which established Protestant
dominance and English rule in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Drumcree crisis also threatens the stability of the Northern
Ireland peace agreement, approved last May, which provides the
province with a new Assembly to restructure politics to give the
Catholic minority more political power.
</P>
<P>
   If Protestant unionist members of the assembly were to resign
over the banning of the parade, the body would be weakened and this
could lead to a resumption of widespread sectarian guerrilla
warfare.

BRAWLEY JURY DELIBERATES FOR A THIRD DAY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ The jury in the Tawana Brawley defamation
case deliberated for a third full day on Saturday without reaching
a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations of the six-member jury are to continue Monday,
after the sequestered jurors spend Sunday at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at state Supreme Court said that the jurors sent at
least one note on Saturday, the contents of which were not publicly
described by the judge, S. Barrett Hickman. But participants in the
case said the jurors had asked for one of the many videotapes that
were part of the nearly eight-month trial in the civil suit against
three advisers to Ms. Brawley, Alton H. Maddox Jr., C. Vernon Mason
and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, these advisers said that Steven A. Pagones, a former
assistant district attorney in Dutchess County, kidnapped and raped
Ms. Brawley, who was 15 at the time. Pagones filed a defamation
suit seeking $400 million in damages after a grand jury in 1988
exonerated him and discredited Ms. Brawley's account.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Saturday whether the lengthening deliberations were
worrisome, Pagones' lawyer, William E. Stanton, said he had not
expected a rapid verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very long case and a long verdict sheet'' that the
jurors must complete, he said.

ROCKERS TO VISIT FORUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sparks hope to get back to the business of winning today as
they play host to Cleveland Rockers at 1 p.m. at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (3-8) returned to the basement for the second time
this season Wednesday after shooting 36 percent, losing to the
Sacramento Monarchs, 76-71, for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, center Pamela McGee had perhaps her best game
with the Sparks, scoring 16 points and grabbing nine rebounds,
which would be a positive sign for the Sparks should she continue
in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, who opened the season 4-1, fell to 6-6 after
losing, 76-60, to the Phoenix Mercury Friday. Leading a balanced
attack for Cleveland are Isabelle Fijalkowski and Janice Braxton,
who average 12.1 points per game each. Suzie McConnell-Serio, a
former Olympian who returned to the hard court after a six-year
layoff and four children later, leads the WNBA in assists with 6.8.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were 2-2 against Cleveland last season.

FRANCE TAKES AIM AT HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France A chance to make history drives both
combatants in tonight's World Cup final at the Stade de France,
although the aims, the means, even the dreams that guide the
masters from Brazil and the upstarts from France remain vastly
different.
</P>
<P>
   The final World Cup match of the century, and the 64th game of
this 33-day tournament, will either provide the Brazilians,
reigning champions and the world's most admired side, with an
unparalleled fifth title or add France to the roster of nations,
just six, that have won the title since its inception 68 years ago,
the first first-time winner since Argentina in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crown the Brazilians expect to lift indeed, nothing else
is acceptable but the French squad, whose run to the title game has
enveloped France in unprecedented euphoria, believe it has what it
takes to pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the chance to go down in history,'' says Zinedine
Zidane, the brilliant midfielder who dictates every aspect of
France's attack. ``We must grasp this chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 80,000 at the futuristic stadium in this Parisian suburb
and a television audience extimated at 1.7 billion will see the
French try to do so, a difficult assignment given Brazil's
abilities, experience and confidence. With Ronaldo and Rivaldo, two
of the world's finest attackers, running things up front, and the
rugged Dunga orchestrating from deep in midfield, the Brazilians
are a dream team, capable of striking from anyplace at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The champion may well be determined on how well France's
defense, which has surrendered only one goal from the run of play
during six World Cup matches, can contend with Brazil's
multipronged attack. The French's weapon in this regard is Marcel
Desailly, who has been flawless in the Cup; its Achilles is Laurent
Blanc, its superb libero who will watch from the bench after
receiving a controversial red card in France's semifinal win over
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo is public enemy No. 1,'' charged French captain Didier
Deschamps. ``Even if we mark him man-to-man, that might not be
enough to stop him because he is genius. ...He will cause us a lot
of problems if we let him play his own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can stop him, but to do it we need to show real
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   If France halts Ronaldo, at 21 acknowledged the world's greatest
player, there are plenty other weapons Brazil can call upon. They
have the veteran Bebeto and stunning Rivaldo, the best Brazilian
player in this tournament, plus wing-backs Roberto Carlos and Cafu,
and Denilson at $26 million the second-most expensive player on the
planet (after Ronaldo) coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It's not rhetoric when France coach Aime Jacquet, who built a
superb team from the remnants of an ailing side that had failed to
qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, calls Brazil the
``masters of world football'' and the ``world's best team.'' And
although the French will have a decided home-field advantage, they
are aware they will be, for the first time this tournament, huge
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not expected to win,'' admits Deschamps. ``A victory
would be a bonus. ... Brazil doesn't have to possess the ball to be
dangerous; tactically, we can't match up with them. We'll have to
focus on our strong points, namely defense, and I hope our defense
wins the battle, because they have the best attack in this World
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians have scored 13 goals, four by Ronaldo and three
each by Rivaldo, Bebeto and Cesar Sampaio.Their defense is suspect,
but the French attack has been dormant since the knockout phase
began, scoring just three goals in three games, all by defenders.
</P>
<P>
   None of that may matter come kickoff. France will have the
majority of the fans, Brazil will have its history, its four
championships in 1958, 1962, 1970 and 1994 and the confidence that
success has instilled in the team.
</P>
<P>
   For the French, winning isn't everything. Getting to the final,
their first, has been a tremendous accomplishment, and the team's
responsibility in linking all strata of French society has, it is
hoped, opened doors that had long been slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered one of Europe's most racist countries, an imaged
egged on by rightist politician Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-foreigner
tirades, France has had a mirror turned on itself during the Cup,
primarily by its multicultural team.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane is Algerian, Desailly was born in Ghana, semifinal hero
Lilian Thuram is from Guadeloupe, and (ital) Les Bleus (end ital)
also have Armenians and Argentinians and players whose roots are
imbedded deep in the French turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mixed-race team says so much about who the French are
today,'' wrote Roland Castro, a leftist activist and architect, in
Liberation. ``These French people, that's France.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin: ``Watching those we call
black and beurs (French-born North Africans) rejoicing, waving
tricolor flags and singing the Marseillaise ... made me feel these
were opportune images of the current period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see all these French,'' Gaulist politician Philippe
Seguin notes, ``seemingly so different but in fact so similar,
sharing the same enthusiasm ... you wonder if there isn't a cement,
a principle, a solution to all our problems. And that is love of
France.''
</P>
<P>
   If the World Cup has, for once, unified the French, it has,
again, raised expectations on the Brazilians that they can not
afford to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a disaster for us if we do not win, but we will
win,'' says Coach Mario Zagallo, who as a player (in '58 and '62),
head coach (in '70) or assistant coach (in '94) has been a part of
Brazil's previous titles. ``We have reached the final of the World
Cup, but all this counts for nothing if we don't win the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overconfident. I'm just confident, and this is what I
want to pass on to everyone. We all have our feet on the ground.''

RUNNING OF THE BULLS, AMERICAN STYLE (I.E., TAME)  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for updating)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Nev. _ Pumped up by the sort of foolishness that
flourishes at bachelor parties as nowhere else, Jim Hamill and
several buddies interrupted their weekend-long debauchery in Las
Vegas to drive about an hour northeast to a dusty ranch here for
what they expected to be the wildest, craziest adventure
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Along with more than 600 other people, they entered a long,
narrow pen Saturday morning to be chased by, and run with, massive
bulls weighing up to 1,500 pounds, an event meant to evoke the
violent, sometimes lethal rampage every July in the streets of
Pamplona, Spain. Hamill said he had figured it would be good for a
flood of sweet adrenaline. But he was forced to make do with a
trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly what I expected,'' Hamill, a Los Angeles
police officer, conceded moments after his brush with the bulls was
over. ``One minute the bulls were behind us, then they were gone.
You couldn't really even see them through the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the chest thumping by promoters and hand wringing by
animal welfare advocates, all the swaggering by those who planned
to participate and gawking by those who stormed the sidelines to
watch, the first ``Running of the Bulls'' in the United States was
a relatively tame spectacle, less bloody rampage than bizarre
promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Twice from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m., over a dozen bulls were let
loose at the start of a fenced, curving track of powder-dry land,
their quarter-mile path to a snack of alfalfa blocked by hundreds
of whooping, hollering thrill seekers with red sashes tied around
their heads or waists.
</P>
<P>
   And twice the bulls rushed by them in a matter of seconds,
kicking up clouds of dirt but exhibiting little interest in
anything other than the meal at the end of the line. Many
participants were left to saunter through a brown fog as they
listened to the murmur of distant hoof beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't running with the bulls _ it was walking with the
cows,'' groused Chris Carroll, a Las Vegas police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was more than 100 degrees, but Carroll had
barely broken a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going out of my way to try to get bull contact and I
couldn't even get near one,'' he said. ``This is a disappointment
bordering on heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment seemed a bit harsh. Orderly as most of the bulls
were, one did press a horn into the back of a man. He had a
perfectly round hole in his T-shirt and a thick red abrasion
between his shoulder blades to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got gored,'' Justin Hayes, a writer for Las Vegas Weekly,
said in a disbelieving voice as he held his tattered shirt in his
hands. ``I guess I'm the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who was planning to write a first-person account of his
participation in the event, did not even need stitches. Another man
twisted his ankle and fainted, presumably from the heat, and about
15 other participants and spectators were treated for heat, said
Dr. Philip Hartwell, the chief medical officer on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was an anti-climactic denouement for an event that generated
so much debate and news coverage in the weeks leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The principal organizer of the Running of the Bulls, a Phoenix
rodeo promoter named Phil Immordino, had shopped the idea around to
cities like Phoenix and Long Beach before finally finding a taker
in Mesquite, a desert outpost of 10,000 people, several golf
courses and a few enormous casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mesquite officials said that they wanted to advertise their
city and put it on the map, while others countered that this
particular strategy was imprudent and reckless.
</P>
<P>
   State officials concurred, denying Immordino the use of Mesquite
Boulevard, a state road running through the center of town. The
event was moved three miles east to a private ranch on the Arizona
border.
</P>
<P>
   But that did nothing to address the concerns of animal welfare
advocates, who said it was cruel to incite bulls into a panicked
run simply for human entertainment. These advocates said they
distrusted Immordino's assurance that the bulls would not be poked,
prodded or pinched into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was difficult to get a clear look at the bulls in
the starting pen, they seemed to have been set off by nothing more
than the movements of several men on horseback herding them toward
the participants.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of these people were men between the ages of 20 and
40, with more tattoos and better physiques than any random sampling
of the male population. They each paid $50, signed liability
waivers and perused a sheet of tips on preparation that began,
``Check your health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they loved taking risks, whether through parachuting,
bungee-jumping or getting up close and personal with an enormous,
unpredictable mammal. Many said they were drawn by the superlatives
surrounding the event _ the first, the only _ and the bragging
rights it would give them for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Many simply relished the nuttiness of it all. One man wore his
own set of plastic horns; another had made a T-shirt with targets
painted on the front and back and the legend: ``Give beef a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sullivan, a waiter in a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas,
said he might have tempted fate with all the sizzling beef fajitas
he had served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put a little note on my back saying I'm a
vegetarian,'' Sullivan said before the event.
</P>
<P>
   After, he pronounced himself duly exhilarated by the nearness of
the dread beasts, saying: ``Remember how I told you I wanted to
feel that thumping of the heart that people in Pamplona talked
about? Well, I felt it: boom, boom, boom.''

 &HT;    '98 Open returns to Birkdale
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ It is not the most glamorous venue of those
in the British Open rotation. It is not dripping with as much
tradition or natural beauty as St. Andrews, Turnberry or Royal
Troon. Yet much has transpired here at Royal Birkdale Golf Club,
where American Justin Leonard will defend his title beginning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A seaside links course marked by huge sandhills and
rough-covered dunes _ even a clubhouse shaped like the bridge of a
giant tanker to extend the nautical theme _ Royal Birkdale is:
</P>
<P>
   Where Australian Ian Baker-Finch won the British Open in 1991,
then began a slide from which he never recovered, finally quitting
competitive play because he worried about injuring people in the
gallery. Baker-Finch will be at Royal Birkdale this week, but as a
TV analyst for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Where Arnold Palmer prevailed in 1961, striking a bold shot out
of deep rough on the 15th hole, slashing at the ball with such
power that it defined the style that thrilled his armies for the
next decade. A plaque marks the spot today.
</P>
<P>
   Where Hale Irwin in 1983 whiffed the ball as he extended to tap
in a two-inch putt and eventually lost by a one stroke to Tom
Watson despite a final-round 67.
</P>
<P>
   Where Lee Trevino nearly blew a three-stroke lead on the 17th
tee, barely pulling out a victory in 1971 over Formosan Liang Huan
Lu.
</P>
<P>
   Where Johnny Miller shot a final-round 66 in 1976, manufacturing
a six-shot win over Seve Ballesteros and Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes have been made to Royal Birkdale since
Baker-Finch's victory in '91. All the greens were rebuilt between
1992 and 1994 to improve what had been a suspect putting surface.
The turf was lifted and a ``problem layer'' about 2 to 6 inches
below the surface was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are going to putt considerably harder than in
1991,'' says Michael Bonnallack, secretary of the Royal &AMP; Ancient
Golf Club. ``They are beautifully contoured and were pretty quick
even in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers have made Ernie Els the favorite at 9-1, followed by
Tiger Woods (10-1), David Duval (12-1), Colin Montgomerie (15-1),
Davis Love III (18-1) and Lee Westwood (18-1). Leonard is 20-1,
along with Fred Couples and Tom Lehman. U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen is 25-1, with Masters champion Mark O'Meara 33-1.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a poor U.S. Open, Leonard will be looking for last
year's splendid memories _ a final-round 65 that ranks as one of
the finest in major championship history _ to return him to
contending form.
</P>
<P>
   A question mark for much of the last two years largely because
of putting problems, England's Nick Faldo is an even greater
unknown for Royal Birkdale. The three-time British Open champion
pulled out of this past week's Loch Lomond World Invitational
because of ``stabbing pain'' in his right elbow, which was put in a
soft cast.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Montgomerie has been in such a cranky mood lately,
you would think he was preparing to play in the States again. He
skipped the awards ceremony following the Irish Open and then
refused to talk about his opening round of 73 at Loch Lomond.
Montgomerie declined to talk to reporters after his Saturday round
in Ireland because of a newspaper article written about his temper.
</P>
<P>
   The British Open field will include Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar,
who missed the cut at Loch Lomond and has been made a 99-1 choice.
While speculation continues about the 20-year-old U.S. Amateur
champion's pro plans, Kuchar will try to make it three straight
major championships successes. He finished 21st at the Masters and
tied for 14th at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 58, pulled out of the British Open on Wednesday
because of groin and hip problems, ending at 154 his streak of
major championships for which he has been eligible. Son Gary,
however, could carry on the tradition if he qualifies today and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to try that much harder now in the qualifier now
that Dad's made his decision not to play,'' said the 29-year-old
Nicklaus.

 &HT;    Getting saves routinely
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Trevor Hoffman and Robb Nen, two of baseball's best
closers, are nasty pitchers: They wear goatees and snarl when they
go to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to being a good closer than just the look.
</P>
<P>
   The two have different approaches, but they are getting similar
results.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Nen has perhaps the heaviest workload of any
reliever. He already has thrown 55 1/3 innings in 45 appearances,
unheard of for a closer with half as many saves. Nen has allowed
only six runs and blown just one save and is striking out 1.3 an
inning. Hoffman's opponents are hitting just .177, and he has
converted 33 saves in a row, dating to last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's success is based on a mental approach with a strict
daily routine. For the first five innings, Hoffman sits in the San
Diego clubhouse. Then he takes a shower and heads to the training
room for an arm massage. He dresses, does eight arm exercises and
heads to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find (that) doing the same thing every game gets me into a
great routine, a pattern,'' Hoffman said. ``I also never think
about what happened the night before. If you look back, it has a
tendency to backfire. I look at it as going out and just getting
three outs, but I don't think about the second out until I get the
first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nen also remains in the clubhouse the first five innings. In the
sixth, he puts a hot pack on his arm. In the seventh, he heads to
the bullpen, where he throws to outfielders between innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tends to loosen me up,'' Nen said. ``I really don't try
to think about too much out there. You never think about a save you
blew the night before, or for that matter, you don't think about a
save you picked up. You take one game at a time. You focus on that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Such routines are working not only for Hoffman and Nen but also
for a number of other closers, including Jeff Shaw, now of the
Dodgers; Montreal's Ugueth Urbina; Mariano Rivera of the Yankees;
John Wetteland of the Rangers; and Boston's Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of guys throwing the snot out of the ball,''
Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Nen both say dominance can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nen has had his problems in the past, and Hoffman has had his
bad days. So there is hope for a strong return by Braves closer
Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is finding some momentum,'' Hoffman said. ``Once you
do, it steamrolls, and you take advantage of it. But it's just not
a one-game thing. You have to come to the park every night thinking
you are going in there, and you are going to get three outs.''

ALICEA LIFTS RANGERS PAST ATHLETICS, 4-2, IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A crowd of 26,458 booed Luis Alicea at the
Oakland Coliseum yesterday over a hard-nosed play from the night
before. The Oakland Athletics would have been a more worthy
recipient of their derision.
</P>
<P>
   Two ninth-inning errors kept the Athletics from putting the
Rangers away, and Alicea made them pay for it, smacking a three-run
double to lift his team to 4-2 come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been booed like that before,'' Alicea said. ``It
will probably be worse tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Rangers' third consecutive against the
Athletics, all coming in the ninth inning. They've also won five
consecutive games, going back to before the All-Star Game, a
winning streak that has pushed them back into first place in the
American League West for the first time since June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through a 162-game season, you go through some
downs, but in these three games, we've played a little bit
better,'' outfielder Rusty Greer said. ``Hopefully winning a game
like this, coming from behind in the ninth inning, will help
establish some confidence and momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, trailing 2-0, looked dead going into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   They had managed just four hits off Oakland starter Blake Stein
through seven innings and had a budding eighth-inning rally snubbed
out by Athletics shortstop Miguel Tejada's dazzling double play.
</P>
<P>
   But the Athletics gave them one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Greer started the comeback with a one-out single to right and
Ivan Rodriguez battled Fetters for a walk. Lee Stevens then hit a
possible double-play grounder to first baseman Brian Lesher, who
had just entered the game as a pinch runner in the eighth. But
Lesher fumbled the ball trying to get two and instead got none, an
error that left the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough enough in the major leagues when you've got to give
a team three outs,'' Fetters said. ``It's just about impossible
when you give them four and five outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters got Kevin Elster on a soft line drive to Tejada, leaving
only Alicea. He was starting yesterday to give Fernando Tatis a day
off and was booed in every at-bat. Oakland fans were still miffed
at him for dumping Oakland catcher A.J. Hinch the night before on a
hard slide at home plate, a play the Athletics and umpire Jim Joyce
said was clean and legal.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea worked the count full, then belted one off the wall in
right-center to clear the bases. He's hitting .346 with runners in
scoring position this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good split-finger (fastball), and he keeps the ball
down a lot,'' Alicea said. ``It was a do-or-die situation and I
just wanted to make sure I got a good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics then gave the Rangers an extra run when Rickey
Henderson dropped Tom Goodwin's easy pop fly in short left field.
The Rangers have scored nine runs in three games this series, and
eight of them have come in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the toughest one,'' Oakland manager Art Howe said.
``Our starting pitchers have gone out there for us and pitched
outstanding and have nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele, continuing the Rangers' post-break run of good
starting pitching, wasn't bad, allowing only a two-run single to
Matt Stairs in the third. But it looked like it would be in a
losing effort against Stein, until the Athletics gave the Rangers a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win three straight low-scoring games, that's important,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I don't think most of these
guys realize it's OK to win a 4-1 ballgame. It looked like to me we
were out there pressing, thinking we needed to score eight runs to
win. We don't need to do that with this kind of pitching.''

   He knows that he has to prove himself to college coaches all
over again. But unlike some athletes who walk away from
scholarships for two years to spread a religious belief, the
passion to play still burns in the former Mesa Dobson High School
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment,'' he said, ``is getting back to
reality. For two years, you're separated from the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   From the summer of 1996 to the beginning of this summer, Carlson
did not touch a football. As part of his church commitment, he saw
no television. No movies. He didn't read the newspaper. He didn't
date. He rarely worked out.
</P>
<P>
   His only contact with his parents was through letters and the
two phone calls he was allowed to make to them each year _ on
Christmas and Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, a part of the world he didn't know before, he and a
companion studied Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
scripture, prayed and shared their beliefs with those who would
listen _ many times getting doors slammed in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets discouraging,'' Carlson said. ``But the purpose of
what you're doing outweighs the discouragement and keeps you
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to serve the church was made easier for Carlson
after he broke an ankle after starting the first six games at
quarterback for Dixie College in southern Utah three seasons ago.
His mission, he said, was ``a spiritual awakening, the greatest
experience I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   So great that as the time ap proached for his return to Mesa
from his two-year mission, Carlson lost 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my appetite,'' he said. ``I was depressed. It was hard
on me because I loved it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is getting used to what he calls ``civilian'' life. The
21-year-old gets up early for school. He throws spirals at night at
Scottsdale CC, where he said he may attempt to resume his football
career in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how fast I've picked things up since I left
home,'' said the 6-foot-3, 215-pound Carlson. ``I thought I'd have
to reteach myself. But I guess the Lord made up for what I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said he is no different than most Mormon boys who grow
up eagerly awaiting the day they get the call to go out in the
world and teach the word. It is not required by the church, but
highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Some women and married couples go, but it is mostly young men
who take the call once they turn 19. They do not know where they
are going or whom they are going to be coupled with until the call
comes. They go in twos and can be sent anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They generally save money to finance their missions by working
through high school. As a rule of thumb, it requires about $10,000
for a two-bedroom apartment. If they don't have enough saved, they
get financial help from family members or the church.
</P>
<P>
   College coaches pray their players aren't sent to Third World
nations, where they run the risk of malnutrition and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Bevell, a tight end at Scottsdale Chaparral and Eastern
Arizona College, lost about 25 pounds during his mission in
Paraguay because of a parasite.
</P>
<P>
   He finally killed the parasite and regained the weight after he
returned home and began taking black walnut tablets. He played two
years at Eastern Arizona and now is a Mesa police officer.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Darrell, a quarterback at Chaparral in
1986-87, spent his mission in Cleveland, Ohio, a football hotbed.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell said there was much rejection, more bad days than good,
but he held onto his beliefs and said his missionary experience
strengthened him on the football field, where he later led
Wisconsin to a 1994 Rose Bowl victory over UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts life in perspective,'' Darrell said. ``When you have
guns pulled on you and dogs sicced on you, you come back to
Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey isn't so perilous in most cases, and it is difficult
to find an athlete who calls his mission a waste of time and
unrewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Many return more physically and mentally mature, ready to take
on anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was an advantage,'' said Fred Mortensen, a former
Tempe High quarterback who, after serving his church mission,
helped Arizona State beat Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl in the 1975
season and later, spent five seasons in the NFL as a backup. ``You
learn what it takes to be happy and content and deal with the
challenges that go along with performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattlers Coach Danny White, a Mormon whose two sons went on
church missions, elected to play out his football career at Arizona
State instead of going on a mission in the early 1970s. He ended up
setting many school passing records and captured two Super Bowl
rings with the Dallas Cowboys. But he said he now regrets not
serving a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't as much emphasis on serving a full-time mission
as there is now,'' White said. ``I had advice from church leaders.
Some said to stay under scholarship. I took advantage of the full
ride to ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all changed now. Kids mature a lot during those two
years. If the athlete is in them, I don't think (the mission) will
take it out of them. More colleges are seeking returned
missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in Utah, which has the largest Mormon
population in the world. On the Utah football team, there are 38
returned missionaries, including former Mesa High all-state center
and linebacker Steve McKane, one of four brothers who have served
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ron McBride, in his ninth year at Utah, started a
missionary program seven years ago. It basically reactivates a
player's scholarship upon his return. The NCAA clearing house is
notified, and the player's eligibility clock is put on pause once
he enters the missionary training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our state, you have to (accept missionaries) or forget
about recruiting the state,'' McBride said. ``Ninety-six percent of
the kids we recruit go on missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The returned missionaries leave school as grown men, at age 23
or 24, instead of 21 or 22, causing some to feel it's boys against
men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a Wisconsin player saying, `It was like having a
man in the huddle,' '' Jim Bevell said about his son, Darrell.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said the maturity level, the dedication and the work
ethic, pay off in the long run. Utah has played in four bowl games
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're on their missions, they think about the things
they want to do,'' McBride said. ``Sometimes, kids do change. The
importance of what they're doing can do that. But in most cases,
the same football guys come back with the same passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are concerns from college coaches who may have
immediate needs to fill and are more willing to give a scholarship
to a player they know is committed to athletics for four
uninterrupted seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young quarterback Todd Mortensen, who said he will
embark on his mission in October, discovered that in 1996, his
senior year at Tempe High, where he led the Buffaloes to an
undefeated state championship season. Many schools backed off on
recruiting him once they learned he planned to go on a mission. Not
Brigham Young, which will have 50 returned missionaries on this
year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of colleges are not recruiting missionaries in general,
because they have immediate needs at a position and they don't want
to wait,'' said Mortensen, Fred's son, who redshirted last season
and will have four years of college eligibility beginning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had older cousins serve missions, and I've seen the
rewards in their lives and how happy they are. I can't wait to go.
I feel I'll come back much more able to focus on my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder, who coached eight years at Utah State,
recruited Mortensen. He signed Mesa Mountain View tight
end/linebacker Todd Heap, knowing that last year's Arizona Player
of the Year intends to serve a mission after this season. Heap's
true value in a Sun Devils uniform may not be seen for another four
years. Snyder is patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to still be here in four years,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Heap said he wants to compete for playing time his freshman
year, then go on a mission. If he has to redshirt, four years of
eligibility await him when he returns. Provided he still wants to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big gamble for a coach, especially if you sign a kid
before he goes on his mission,'' McBride said. ``We've had a great
deal of luck with our kids. They brought a lot of maturity to our
football team. I think they learn a lot about themselves, about the
world, about dedication, about sacrifice and things that are
important. It's a huge plus for a young kid.''
</P>
<P>
   At ASU, Snyder has had only a handful of missionaries, including
safety Paul Reynolds, even though Arizona ranks among the top four
states in LDS membership. Snyder said he doesn't try to avoid the
missionary athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``You manage your numbers,'' he said. ``You look at your depth
chart and see if you can withstand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has found the missionary athlete to be coachable and
unselfish, people he doesn't have to worry about getting in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, when you get one back that is focused, you have a mature
person,'' he said. ``I'm not LDS, but you give yourself to a bigger
picture. That's what I like. Everybody gives up a little
individuality for the greater good of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, much goes on in an athlete's head during the two years
spent living in a spiritual, rather than athletic, world.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said he feels stronger, more confident on the field than
when he left Dixie. He said there is structure, discipline, a
mental toughness to get through a routine that wasn't there before.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted it's a struggle at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much know what direction you're going when you
leave for a mission,' said his father, Dave Carlson. ``You know
what to do every day, what the objectives are. For two years,
you're feeling very spiritual. When you come home, people are
pulling you in a lot of different directions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard on the parents, too.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson football Coach Mike Clark cried the day his son, Cauley,
an outstanding tight end and trumpet player, went away to serve his
mission in Argentina nearly two years ago. He returns home July 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy sorrow,'' Clark said. ``I miss him every day. But
I wouldn't want him anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently more than 58,000 missionaries serving in the
world, most of whom are young men like Carlson, who left behind a
girlfriend, a loving family and an athletic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've found that they come come back in one or two
extremes,'' Snyder said. ``One, being really committed
athletically. Or, they completely have a non-athletic direction,
like, `I've outgrown it, it was fun while I did it, but I've got
other things.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Moore's last basketball game was played at America West
Arena in 1995, when the 6-foot-5 forward helped Mountain View cap a
31-0 season with a victory over Shadow Mountain in the 5A final.
</P>
<P>
   He received numerous offers from junior colleges to play
basketball but decided to serve a mission for two years in Omaha,
Neb., where he teamed with a BYU football player. His partner now
is having trouble returning to a field of hate, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're taught to love everybody (on the mission), have fun,
treat people well,'' Moore said. ``On the court, the golden rule is
to do unto others before they do unto you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that was the hardest thing, turning on that switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has kept the switch off, satisfied that his athletic
career ended with a high school championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, the switch turns off for good and you don't
want the super adrenaline of sports rushing anymore,'' Moore said.
``While on my mission, I learned that there are other things more
important than basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore fell in love when he returned home this spring. He helps
run a florist shop in east Mesa with his fiancee, Julie, and dreams
of starting a family, not making jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mission taught me the basics of life, being in a
good relationship with God, working hard, loving what you do,''
Moore said. ``It taught me to love work, to love people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I hadn't found out what I wanted out of life, the
other side of life, I'd go after sports right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clint Carlson learned anything on his mission, it is how
fleeting football can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football, before, was my life,'' he said. ``Now it's real
temporary. Just like life is. Anything can end right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Bevell never let his football dream end, despite going
five years without taking a snap.
</P>
<P>
   He missed his senior season in high school because of a broken
finger, spent a redshirt season at Northern Arizona, served a
two-year mission, then transferred to Wisconsin and sat out another
year. Once he got back on the field, however, he held the starting
job for four years, a tenure highlighted by running for the winning
touchdown in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen all the time,'' said Bevell, now the
receivers coach at the University of Connecticut. ``I had
confidence in my abilities. I had faith in what I was doing at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson hopes for a similar storybook ending to his football
career. But if it doesn't happen, Carlson feels he's already done
something for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot more after this life than what I'm living
right now,'' he says.

<P>
   Maybe you've noticed the trend. Sports are beginning to resemble
pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson bites off a man's ear. Didn't George ``The Animal''
Steele do that to Randy Savage, or was it vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar and Bill Romanowski. Their spitting incidents
call to mind Nikolai Volkoff and the ``Iron Sheik.'' In their
hey-day, the tag-team partners would rooster-strut around the ring
and conclude every interview by grabbing the microphone and
boasting, ``Russia Number 1! Iran Number 1!. . .USA?'' They spat _
ptoooey _ enraging every red-blooded American.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Carlesimo was lucky. According to witnesses, Latrell
Sprewell only choked his coach. Sprewell was restrained before he
could deliver a leg drop and grab a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrestling is the theater of the absurd. I'll never forget
attending one of those mat extravaganzas staged in a football
stadium. The featured villain was Kamala, the Ugandan Giant.
</P>
<P>
   Kamala stood 6 feet 6 and weighed more than Oliver Miller, at
least 400 pounds. The actor was faithful to the offensive
stereotype of an African chieftan in an old Tarzan movie.
</P>
<P>
   Kamala wore a leopard-skin loin cloth and a witch-doctor's mask,
probably purchased at Pier 1. A yellow half moon was painted on his
giant belly. Of course, he carried a spear. &QL; 
According to Kamala's manager, Skandor Akbar, who identified
himself as an Arab from a family of unlimited wealth, the Ugandan
Giant was largely untamed, which explained Akbar's riding crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a savage,'' Akbar warned, ``and I want to keep him that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, the glowering giant had his way with his opponent.
Kamala repeatedly grabbed Terry Gordy by his underarm and squeezed
mightly, causing Gordy to drop to his knees and whimper for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd booed, Kamala grinned a toothless grin. He patted
his enormous belly. Gordy retaliated, biting Kamala on the
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is a farce, but at least one could separate the actors
from the athletes in professional sports. Not anymore. Today, in
San Diego, two NBA stars will battle one another in a tag-team
event billed as the ``Bash at the Beach.'' The pay-per-view event
sounds like a Don King production. (Today the line between boxing
and wrestling is blurred).
</P>
<P>
   In the main event, Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman will take on
``Diamond'' Dallas Page and Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's involvement isn't surprising. But why is Malone party
to this low comedy? The Utah Jazz wonders. Surely, he doesn't need
the money. &QL; 
Rodman has adopted a stage name. Rodzilla. ' Malone is the Mauler.
The men who battled each other in the NBA Finals dutifully promoted
the event on TV, with the soft-spoken Malone trying out his new
persona before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said of Rodman, ``Him and his little coward friend
(Hogan) will get beat in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Malone promoted the match during the NBA championship,
forming the ``Diamond Cutter'' sign with his hands. The Diamond
Cutter is Diamond Dallas Page's signature hold. By all accounts,
when properly executed, the hold renders a man defenseless. It's
deadlier than the Siberian spleen clamp.
</P>
<P>
   You sigh and wonder. Is this where sports are headed? Star
athletes behaving like wrestlers, and in some cases, pretending to
be wrestlers themselves?
</P>
<P>
   If NBA players are shameless enough to share the stage that has
given us Mr. Moto, the Undertaker and ``Nature Boy'' Rick Flair,
how about the league whose first-year marketing campaign was ``We
Got Next''? Will WNBA players follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   I won't climb into the ring with Cheryl Miller. Don't know if
she can wrestle, but when it comes to microphone technique and
working a crowd, she's got Hulk Hogan beat. &QL;

D-BACKS WINNING TV BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While the Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays fight
it out in the baseball futility arena, it's no contest where it
really counts _ television ratings, which translate into eager
sponsors with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   June ratings for the Diamondbacks on Channel 3 (KTVK) hit 7.1,
with Fox Sports Arizona at 4.0, numbers that are representative of
most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Sunshine State, where the other first-year franchise
resides, the smiles aren't so wide. The Devil Rays' numbers for
their Sunday afternoon games on Channel 10 (WTSP) have been fairly
constant at 3.8, and at Channel 32 (WB-32), where other games are
shown, a spokesman said the numbers ``are a couple of points
lower'' than the Diamondbacks' average. The team's cable outlet,
Sports Channel Florida, refused to reveal any ratings, fostering
the belief that they are low since it would be the first time in
history a TV station covered up good numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Even pitted against an established franchise such as the
Dodgers, the Diamondbacks win. On Channel 5 in Los Angeles (KTLA),
the month of June showed the Dodgers with a 4.1 rating. On Fox
Sports West2, the rating was 1.9 with less than full distribution.
</P>
<P>
   All the numbers, provided by sources, are attributable to
Nielsen. Cable ratings are generally lower based on household
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers in the Valley, who can't evaluate the whole picture
until after the season, can hear the money tills ringing.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One is a common sponsor on both Channel 3 and FOXAZ
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a production standpoint and from delivering quality, we
are absolutely delighted,'' Bank One spokesman  &UR; Steve Roman said.
``We can't relate our sponsorship to sales directly, but we
introduced a product called Diamondbacks Banking in March and
advertised it around baseball-related events, and it has done
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our annual budgets that were our guesstimates on where we
would end up for this product . . . in the first four months, we
have exceeded some of those and are on our way to meeting all
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co. is also into the advertising in a big way,
and spokesman  &UR; Steve Lauletta said he looks at the TV ratings as
just one piece of the puzzle. He said the company views its
sponsorship as part of an overall relationship. &QL;

MINNESOTANS DON'T TRUST MCCOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Twin Cities fan walked into a Bloomington, Minn., sporting
goods store last week and asked for some San Antonio Vikings gear.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was late at night,'' said  &UR; Dan Owens, sales clerk at
Goldy's Locker Room at the Mall of America. ``I didn't quite grasp
it at first. Once it hit me, I laughed and thought, `OK, whatever.'
I knew the guy was joking.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger question is whether prospective Vikings owner
 &UR; Red
 &UR; McCombs is serious when he says he has no plans to move the team to
his hometown of San Antonio and play in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the corner store the other night (in Minneapolis)
and a girl behind the cash register told me, 'So, you're buying the
Vikings, but you're not moving them to San Antonio,' '' McCombs
said, ``and then she gave a little wink.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that (kind of talk) is not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings fans are understandably skeptical. Owner  &UR; Norm Green
moved the NHL's Minnesota North Stars to Dallas in 1993. The NBA's
Minnesota Timberwolves were sold to boxing promoter  &UR; Bob Arum to
move to New Orleans in 1994, but the NBA rejected the move. Last
year, Minnesota Twins owner  &UR; Carl Pohlad threatened to move the
major league baseball team to North Carolina. McCombs has been
trying to get San Antonio an NFL franchise for years, and, already,
there is talk of a Vikings preseason game there in 1999 against the
New Orleans Saints, owned by another San Antonio car dealer,  &UR; Tom
Benson.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the ``San Antonio Express-News'' said McCombs'
ownership of the Vikings will help San Antonio get an NFL team. The
editorial didn't say which team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Express-News'' columnist  &UR; David King revealed facts about
Minnesota ``that don't beg the team to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's main body of water, Lake Superior, is the
temperature of an average glass of ice water. Texas has the Gulf of
Mexico year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has an official state muffin, blueberry, and an
official state mushroom, the morel.
</P>
<P>
   King also wrote the top 10 reasons why ``Texas is better than
Minnesota'' or ``why Red's purple team should be playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few: _ 10. Visitors walk along our river during the
winter, not across it.
</P>
<P>
   9. Five words: Last freeze date, April 1.
</P>
<P>
   8. In Texas, our mosquitos are insects; in Minnesota, they are
referred to as the state bird.
</P>
<P>
   7. Minnesota's stadium (Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome) was named
after a guy who was vice president _ under a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   6. We've got more professional hockey teams (we're gonna have a
team in Abilene _ Abilene? _ next season).
</P>
<P>
   McCombs, the 70-year-old former owner of the NBA's San Antonio
Spurs, will be a big change from the committee that ran the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to cuss out a committee,'' McCombs said. ``I
think it's very important for the fans to know there is one guy who
is ultimately in charge. They want to be able to say, `That damn
Red, he screwed it up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . Where I grew up in Texas, there were a lot of sayings we

<P>
   He made $11.75 million with the Jets the past two years and will

   It will be the first year the team has trained in Wichita Falls

<P>
   Writer  &UR; Skip Hollandsworth, a Wichita Falls native, said the
heat there is ``as heavy as wool'' and ``after sweating under the
sun for an afternoon, you start smelling like road kill.''

   Wrote Hollandsworth: ``If you spend too much time outside, the

   ``Of course, it's hot here,'' wrote editor  &UR; Carroll Wilson,

 &HT;    '98 Open returns to Birkdale
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ It is not the most glamorous venue of those
in the British Open rotation. It is not dripping with as much
tradition or natural beauty as St. Andrews, Turnberry or Royal
Troon. Yet much has transpired here at Royal Birkdale Golf Club,
where American Justin Leonard will defend his title beginning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A seaside links course marked by huge sandhills and
rough-covered dunes _ even a clubhouse shaped like the bridge of a
giant tanker to extend the nautical theme _ Royal Birkdale is:
</P>
<P>
   Where Australian Ian Baker-Finch won the British Open in 1991,
then began a slide from which he never recovered, finally quitting
competitive play because he worried about injuring people in the
gallery. Baker-Finch will be at Royal Birkdale this week, but as a
TV analyst for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Where Arnold Palmer prevailed in 1961, striking a bold shot out
of deep rough on the 15th hole, slashing at the ball with such
power that it defined the style that thrilled his armies for the
next decade. A plaque marks the spot today.
</P>
<P>
   Where Hale Irwin in 1983 whiffed the ball as he extended to tap
in a two-inch putt and eventually lost by a one stroke to Tom
Watson despite a final-round 67.
</P>
<P>
   Where Lee Trevino nearly blew a three-stroke lead on the 17th
tee, barely pulling out a victory in 1971 over Formosan Liang Huan
Lu.
</P>
<P>
   Where Johnny Miller shot a final-round 66 in 1976, manufacturing
a six-shot win over Seve Ballesteros and Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes have been made to Royal Birkdale since
Baker-Finch's victory in '91. All the greens were rebuilt between
1992 and 1994 to improve what had been a suspect putting surface.
The turf was lifted and a ``problem layer'' about 2 to 6 inches
below the surface was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are going to putt considerably harder than in
1991,'' says Michael Bonnallack, secretary of the Royal &AMP; Ancient
Golf Club. ``They are beautifully contoured and were pretty quick
even in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers have made Ernie Els the favorite at 9-1, followed by
Tiger Woods (10-1), David Duval (12-1), Colin Montgomerie (15-1),
Davis Love III (18-1) and Lee Westwood (18-1). Leonard is 20-1,
along with Fred Couples and Tom Lehman. U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen is 25-1, with Masters champion Mark O'Meara 33-1.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a poor U.S. Open, Leonard will be looking for last
year's splendid memories _ a final-round 65 that ranks as one of
the finest in major championship history _ to return him to
contending form.
</P>
<P>
   A question mark for much of the last two years largely because
of putting problems, England's Nick Faldo is an even greater
unknown for Royal Birkdale. The three-time British Open champion
pulled out of this past week's Loch Lomond World Invitational
because of ``stabbing pain'' in his right elbow, which was put in a
soft cast.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Montgomerie has been in such a cranky mood lately,
you would think he was preparing to play in the States again. He
skipped the awards ceremony following the Irish Open and then
refused to talk about his opening round of 73 at Loch Lomond.
Montgomerie declined to talk to reporters after his Saturday round
in Ireland because of a newspaper article written about his temper.
</P>
<P>
   The British Open field will include Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar,
who missed the cut at Loch Lomond and has been made a 99-1 choice.
While speculation continues about the 20-year-old U.S. Amateur
champion's pro plans, Kuchar will try to make it three straight
major championships successes. He finished 21st at the Masters and
tied for 14th at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 58, pulled out of the British Open on Wednesday
because of groin and hip problems, ending at 154 his streak of
major championships for which he has been eligible. Son Gary,
however, could carry on the tradition if he qualifies today and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to try that much harder now in the qualifier now
that Dad's made his decision not to play,'' said the 29-year-old
Nicklaus.

THE COOLEST TACO STAND IN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)   By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
It was dollar-off-taco day at Pepe's North of the Border, and the
place was jammed with tourists _ 114 by Fran Tate's count.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Here I am wearing a halter top and short pants, and I'm still
swea tin','' she said. ``I had to go over and prop the front door
open to get some air circulating.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Tate turn her back, however, than a German tourist
scurried over to the door and slammed it shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freezing!'' said the man, who wore a fur-trimmed parka inside
the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' Fran said, fanning herself. ``It's
sweltering out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The man shook his head. Fran smiled and ambled over to a group
of Japanese customers. They ap peared to be a little concerned over
the menu item referred to as a ``burro.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the crowd thinned out and Fran had time to talk, I
asked her exactly how hot it was at Pepe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a second,'' she said, ``I'll go check the thermometer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 52 degrees outside,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a longer pause.
</P>
<P>
   `'Are you there?'' Fran asked.
</P>
<P>
   More pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' she said. ``How hot is it down in
Phoenix?''
</P>
<P>
   I told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's why you're calling,'' she said. ``Well, why don't
you just hop in the car and drive up here? Tell them you're going
for takeout.''
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after 11 a.m. &QL; 
MISS THE SPECIAL, TOO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I left the office right then, drove straight to the
restaurant and back, I could be sitting in front of the computer
again by, say, mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd probably miss the taco special, too,'' Fran said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe's North of the Border is lo cated in Point Barrow, Alaska,
a town at the edge of Arctic Ocean, about 600 miles from the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago I visited there.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists pass through on sightsee ing packages tied to nature
and commerce _ the midnight sun and the big oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Barrow is the spot where Will Rogers and the
aviator Wiley Post died in a plane crash in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Fran Tate quit her job at a drilling station
to open Pepe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pushing tacos ever since,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There've been a lot of changes over the years. When Fran
arrived, Barrow was home to 1,700 citizens and thousands more
caribou. Now there are more than 4,000 residents _ and thousands
more caribou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress,'' she said. ``But I guess it isn't so bad. One of
the oil companies painted my building re cently. Things are looking
up. And, it's beginning to feel like summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ocean, which was frozen solid for months, has begun pulling
away from the shore. The ice is breaking up. &QL; 
TIME FOR A CALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I think of it,'' Fran said, ``this is the time of
year you usually call.''
</P>
<P>
   I've contacted her several times over the years, mostly when the
temperature in Phoenix creeps over 100 _ and stays there _ and the
humidity slips under the door like an evil spirit, wrapping its
hands around our throats.
</P>
<P>
   Starved for a cool break but un able to get out of town, I'll
take a quick trip, by ear, to Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   They'd just been through a heat wave, Fran said. There were
record-breaking high temperatures. One day in late June it got all
the way up to 63 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   `'Must have been El Nino,'' she said, ``Or Nino El, or whatever
it is we're blaming everything on these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Other days, it's cold enough for snow flurries. I can picture
them, now, swirling gently like feathers or knifing sideways in the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Walking in the wind at Barrow can be work. There are no trees to
hide behind. Nothing to slow down the fierce gusts. A person has to
tilt forward and fight for every step. It can use you up, make you
tired and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Just writing about it gives me an appetite.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking . . . tacos. &QL;

METROSTARS ARE AGAIN FRUSTRATED AT HOME BY LOWLY MUTINY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Tampa Bay Mutiny has the worst
record in Major League Soccer this season, but it has had plenty of
success against the MetroStars. The Mutiny has only five victories,
but it defeated the MetroStars Saturday night by 2-1 for its second
victory at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the MetroStars' losses against Tampa Bay came even
though they dominated the action. The first loss, a little more
than a month ago, was because of brilliant goalkeeping by Thomas
Ravelli. Saturday night the MetroStars simply could not turn their
domination into goals, even though Ravelli was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Ravelli was suspended by the league's disciplinary committee and
was fined $5,000 on Friday for hitting Referee Ruben Rodhas with a
kicked ball in Tampa Bay's loss to New England a week ago. Ravelli
lost his temper following a penalty kick for New England in the
75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Petras started in goal for the Mutiny Saturday night, and
the MetroStars tested him early, taking three shots in the first
five minutes. The young goalkeeper responded well before the
MetroStars beat him in the 11th minute for their only goal.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rooney scored on a blast from outside the penalty area,
after an exchange of passes between Eduardo Hurtado and Giovanni
Savarese and a pass by Tab Ramos, who played with more gusto than
all the other MetroStars. Ramos was a constant threat, whether he
was attacking down the right flank or through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Prampin tied the game for Tampa Bay with a header from
close range in the 36th minute, when the MetroStars' defenders were
caught flat-footed and goalie Tony Meola was left at the mercy of
Prampin, who converted a pass from Steve Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lapse of concentration by our defense,''
MetroStars Coach Alfonso Mondelo said. ``This was very frustrating
and disappointing because the playoff race is getting tight.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars are third in the Eastern Conference with a 9-9
record.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored its winning goal five minutes into the second
half when Jan Eriksson leaped high and headed the ball past Meola
after a corner kick from the right side by Paul Dougherty, who was
traded to Tampa Bay by the MetroStars last month for Mike Duhaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it away on the corner kick,'' Meola said. ``You can
run all game, but if you don't run five yards to cover on a corner
kick, you pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which is last in the Eastern Conference, is an
improved team since Tim Hankinson took over as coach from John
Kowalski four games ago. Hankinson has made several personnel
changes and may be on the right track in getting the team in the
playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some firepower in midfield, and we had to make
adjustments,'' Hankinson said. ``We have to roll up our sleeves and
work hard. We were sitting in last place, and we knew we had to put
some things together.''

YANKEES BEAT TAMPA BAY, 2-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ As the chauffeur for David Cone's
comeback, catcher Joe Girardi has uttered superlatives after many
of Cone's outings. His best stuff of the season, Girardi said after
a game in May, after another game in June, and again last week.
</P>
<P>
   As Girardi started to offer the same analysis again Saturday
night, after Cone beat Tampa Bay, 2-0, with eight shutout innings,
Girardi stopped himself. ``We talk about this every time, don't
we?'' he said to reporters, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. It seems as if Cone's stuff is always getting better, he
always wins, and the Yankees cannot possibly lose a game. They have
won nine straight, their second streak of nine victories this
season, and that has not happened since the 1961 season. They are
14 games ahead of Boston, the Yankees' largest American League East
lead since July 25, 1976. Their 64-20 record matches the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates for the best 84-game record this century. The
Yankees' last loss occurred at Shea Stadium, in the 2-1 decision
against the Mets on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let me look at it,'' Manager Joe Torre said of the
team's record, ``because then you start dealing with the law of
averages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are creating new laws, new standards. Mariano Rivera
pitched the ninth inning for his 24th save, and before he allowed a
bloop single to Paul Sorrento with Wade Boggs at second, Yankees
pitchers had not allowed a hit with runners in scoring position in
39 consecutive innings. Opponents had been 0 for 32 in that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   And now Cone is 13-2 and tied for the major league lead in
victories, incredibly, after pitching so badly in his first two
starts of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu and his interpreter, George Rose, went for lunch
Saturday, and Rose relayed the view of others that Irabu had shown
great fortitude in his victory on Friday. In response, Irabu
mentioned Cone. How could I quit, Irabu explained, after watching
the way Cone kept fighting in April?
</P>
<P>
   Cone briefly thought about quitting three months ago, after
giving up 16 runs in his first nine and two-thirds innings. Since
then, however, he has a 2.72 earned run average, and it is as if he
is getting better and better. ``I'm thrilled with the way things
have gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone battled for command in the first two innings, and from the
Yankees' dugout, Torre could see him stomp around the mound a bit,
frustrated. Pitching in a new ballpark, on an unfamiliar mound,
Cone said later, can require some adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   But it just so happened that Cone was finishing his delivery by
landing in the same hole as the Tampa Bay starter Rolando Arrojo,
and this helped Cone find his rhythm quickly. By the third inning,
he was dominating, his fastball reaching 91 miles an hour, and he
often threw his curveball for first-pitch strikes against
left-handed batters. After Kevin Stocker's double in the third
inning, Cone allowed a single hit the rest of the game, retiring 12
of 13 hitters at one point. He walked Boggs three times, the only
three walks he permitted, and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitched knowing the Yankees would be fortunate to squeeze
more than a run or two from Arrojo, the Devil Rays' All-Star
pitcher who, like Orlando Hernandez, is a defector from Cuba and a
master of many angles.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was with Cuba's national team in the summer of 1996, and
the team stopped to play in Albany, Ga. On the night of July 9,
Arrojo called Joe Cubas, an agent who was staying in the same
hotel, and said, ``Come get me.'' In his pajamas, Arrojo slipped
out of his room at midnight, and he and Cubas drove to Miami.
(Seventeen months later, Cubas would aid Hernandez after the
pitcher escaped Cuba).
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, who is right-handed, throws harder than Hernandez, and
when he drops his shoulder and throws sidearm, he intimidates
right-handed batters. Going into tonight's game, they were batting
.149 against him, or 168 points less than left-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the right-handed hitting Chuck Knoblauch who was
responsible for both of the Yankees' runs. Arrojo hit Knoblauch
with a fastball to lead off the game, and Knoblauch stole second
and scored when Quinton McCracken misplayed a line drive by Paul
O'Neill into a double.
</P>
<P>
   Six innings later, Scott Brosius blooped a single and Joe
Girardi followed with a hit-and-run base hit. Brosius scored when
Knoblauch hit a fly deep to center.
</P>
<P>
   Cone flirted with real jeopardy only in the sixth. He walked
Boggs with two outs and then threw a first-pitch curveball to Fred
McGriff. The slugger anticipated this, and smashed a high drive to
right. Cone was sure it was a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill settled under the ball at the warning track, and
Cone cruised through the final two innings, cutting down the last
hitter he faced, McCracken, with a backdoor slider that broke over
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitch he threw, Girardi agreed. The best. But that is
what has been said about the Yankees all year.

MILLIONAIRES FIND THEIR DESERT DREAM BEHIND GUARDED GATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)   By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a few millionaires, Lost Canyon north of Scottsdale is a
saguaro-laden Shangri-La with a security gate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where they can build their own playground on their
own chunk of pristine desert.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the buyer from the East Coast who is planning a 14-car
garage with a remote-controlled turntable. Why? So he can punch a
button and rotate his vehicles into easy reach like a tuna sandwich
in a vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   A buyer from Texas paid a couple of million dollars for her
privacy. She bought 12 acres of Sonoran Desert so she can build a
home far enough from neighbors so she doesn't have to hear the ice
cubes clinking in their single-malt Scotch on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another landowner is installing a shooting gallery in his home.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the buyers in Lost Canyon will have their own
private desert hiking trails in their back yards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother trying to get a look at it. The
not-so-rich-and-famous are locked out. A guard will be posted 24
hours, making it possibly the only gated-canyon community in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how developer Kent Heyl bills it. He bought 240
acres, or three-eighths of a square mile, from the State Land
Department for $4.2 million in 1994. Heyl, who is moving to the
canyon himself from Paradise Valley, put almost $6 million into
developing it as a private and posh retreat for those who can
afford entry.
</P>
<P>
   He got the land before the political climate changed toward
developing desert land in north Scottsdale. Several developments in
the area during the past few years have been nixed because of
opposition from desert preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Heyl says preservation activists should not object to Lost
Canyon, because most of the land will never be developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their desert,'' Heyl says of his wealthy clients. ``If
someone buys 6 acres, they are only allowed to build on one. The
rest is untouched desert land.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing experts say that Lost Canyon, with its aura of seclusion
and luxury, is the latest hot property for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Paul Cook, a real estate analyst with Landiscor, said
years ago the exclusive areas that the rich coveted were Casa
Blanca near Camelback Mountain and the Biltmore Estates around the
resort. Then Paradise Valley became the first choice of the
wealthy. Golf course developments like Estancia and Desert Mountain
in north Scottsdale were next.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Cook, many people with money want untouched desert
land and are willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent buyers in Lost Canyon are shelling out up to $1.1
million for land alone. Their ``Architectural Digest''-quality
houses will cost at least another $3 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a sanctuary to drive home to every night,'' said
Jim Pupillo, an executive with the investment firm Smith Barney in
Scottsdale, who is building a home on a 9-acre parcel.
</P>
<P>
   The homes planned for Lost Canyon could provide material for
several episodes of ``Lifestyles for the Rich and Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   A billionaire who recently bought in Lost Canyon is
contemplating buying a 300-year old Mexican mansion made of stone
and having it shipped to his Lost Canyon lot.
</P>
<P>
   Several homes will be equipped with wide-screen movie theaters
complete with curtains, stadium seating, soft-drink machines and
popcorn makers that use real butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked all over the Valley and found nothing as unique as
Lost Canyon,'' said Zoran Maric, an orthopedic surgeon who with his
wife, Debbie, is building a multimillion-dollar home with a copper
roof and an unblemished view of the McDowell Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Marics' home, going up on a $900,000 lot, will have a movie
theater with three-tiered seating, a wine cellar and a pool and
Jacuzzi built into the natural boulder formations that are part of
the back yard of their 9-acre spread.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 35 lots have been sold, averaging around 6{ acres
each. Heyl had planned for 50 buyers but cut it back to get more
open space.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding space is safe from future development because
it's been set aside to be put in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve,
while nature has provided a getaway that can be locked away.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what drew one couple, Craig and Karen Stull. The
Stulls' new home, which will feature an underground movie theater
and lagoonlike swimming pool with waterfall and boulders, is under
construction on a 3.5-acre parcel in Lost Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, I was reading ``Phoenix Home &AMP; Garden''
magazine, when I saw this ad for the only gated-canyon community in
Arizona,''said Craig Stull, who owns a national computer consu
lting firm.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife came to Phoenix from Virginia shortly after,
drove straight to the community, even though it wasn't officially
open for sales, and bought a site.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the last chance to buy such a unique
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like oceanfront property,'' said Norm Kitzmiller of
Pinnacle Peak Realty Inc., who sells homes in the area and whose
company is marketing the lots. ``When its gone. It's gone.'' &QL;

METS BEAT EXPOS, 8-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a roar from the crowd at Shea Stadium
Saturday night when Todd Hundley's name was announced in the
lineup. There was another ovation when he emerged from the dugout
to play some catch, accompanied by a big smile and a tip of his
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley doffed the cap again to the fans along the left-field
line as he made his way to the outfield for the first time in a
major league game. And he got a standing ovation as he stepped to
the plate as a Met for the first time since last September.
</P>
<P>
   The 48,006 fans on hand for Hundley's return _ there were
approximately 35,000 tickets sold since Monday's announcement that
he would play _ remained on their feet through a called strike and
two balls, before Hundley flared a single to right-center field in
his first at-bat of 1998. And that brought the biggest cheers of
all. For the first time in weeks, everything seemed to be clicking
at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a blown three-run lead could dampen the evening, as the
Mets (45-41) rallied for a pair of fifth-inning runs on their way
to an 8-4 victory over the Montreal Expos. The Mets snapped a
five-game losing streak to give Rick Reed his 10th victory of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it was not entirely a storybook evening? There were
no home runs from the converted catcher, no sensational plays in
left. Instead, Hundley, who fielded the only two balls hit his way
without incident, finished 1 for 4, and drove a ball to the warning
track in right in his second at-bat, before being removed for
defensive purposes after striking out in the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hits belonged instead to John Olerud and Mike
Piazza. Olerud belted a pair of home runs to become the first Met
to reach 50 runs batted in this year, and Piazza, the catcher who
has taken Hundley's place, drove in Olerud from first with an
opposite-field double in the fifth to break a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's mere presence in the lineup had its desired
effect. The top five hitters in the order accounted for the Mets'
first six runs. Olerud was 4 for 4 with three runs scored and three
runs batted in. He, Piazza and Bernard Gilkey each drove in a run
in the same game for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   As Hundley had said before the game, ``It's good to be back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gilkey had said it felt like a homecoming or a reunion.
There was his best friend, Hundley, back in the Mets' clubhouse,
wearing his old No. 9 and ready to play in a major league game for
the first time since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery over
nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And with Greg McMichael back in a new locker, too, after five
weeks as a Los Angeles Dodger, the playful banter came from all
over the room:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, it's like the first day of school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anybody seen Mlicki?''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael, who was traded with Dave Mlicki for Hideo Nomo on
June 4 and then back to the Mets on Friday night for Brian Bohanon,
even got the final two outs in relief.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a couple of weeks, there was a genuine
feeling of warmth spreading around the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets might have dropped 9 of their last 11 games before
Saturday night, but their leader on the field was back in uniform,
and there was another familiar face around to bolster a struggling
bullpen. And that is why General Manager Steve Phillips remarked,
``I probably feel more peaceful than I should.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was so excited, he barely slept on Friday night in
Indianapolis, where he had played two games with Class AAA Norfolk.
Manager Bobby Valentine asked the two-time All-Star catcher where
he felt most comfortable in the outfield; Hundley had played both
left and right in the minors. Hundley picked left field, and for
the first time since Sept. 7, 1993, Gilkey made a start in right.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, on Hundley's first day as an outfielder, Butch Huskey
became the odd man out. He did not sound happy about it, although
Valentine said that Huskey would play Sunday, so either Gilkey or
Brian McRae will take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did not ask Hundley where he preferred to hit.
Saturday night, Hundley batted cleanup, behind Piazza and in front
of Gilkey, with Edgardo Alfonzo leading off and Olerud hitting
second.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets responded right away with a pair of first-inning
runs, one more in the second, two in the fifth, another in the
seventh and finally two in the eighth on McRae's 11th home run of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Hundley arrived, Gilkey, Huskey and McRae had
started hitting, perhaps mindful that their playing time would soon
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the last couple of days were any indication, it might spark
everyone into getting a couple more hits,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sure was right on that.

AUTOPSY SAYS HEART DISEASE KILLED ABIOLA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and refine)   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ American and other Western doctors who
completed an autopsy on Saturday on the body of Moshood K.O.
Abiola, the Nigerian opposition leader who died in detention on
Tuesday, said they had found no evidence of poisoning and concluded
that his death was caused by heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report, anxiously awaited by an angry and
disoriented nation, showed that ``there was severe longstanding
disease of the heart of a type and severity that can cause
unexpected death,'' said Dr. James G. Young, the chief coroner of
the province of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The results, confirming the official account of Abiola's death
given by the Nigerian military government, seemed unlikely to
assuage Nigerians, who have reacted with fury to the death of the
opposition leader on the eve of his promised release by the new
military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been ruled by
military governments for all but 10 years of its 38 years of
independence. Abiola, who appeared poised to win presidential
elections in 1993 when the armed forces annulled the vote,
incarnated the country's long-frustrated hopes for democracy. He
was imprisoned by the military government on charges of treason in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who headed a five-man team including two American doctors
and an American technician, said that after a detailed examination
of the body including the abdomen, chest and brain, and after
conversations with witnesses present at the time of death, ``we
believe that poisoning is extremely unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that for the sake of complete certainty,
toxicological examinations of samples taken from the body would be
performed at the Center of Forensic Science in Ontario. He said
that tissue samples would also undergo microscopic examination in
London and that a final report would be issued in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and followers of Abiola have argued that he was
poisoned, pointing to the cup of tea he drank with the U.S.
undersecretary of state for political affairs, Thomas Pickering,
and other American and Nigerian officials shortly before he was
taken ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said nothing that happened on the day of Abiola's
death, or that was in his body, ``lead us to believe that poisoning
was a factor.'' He added, ``At this time, our preliminary opinion
is that death was due to natural causes as a result of his
longstanding heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, 60, had never had a heart attack before. Young said his
team had not been given any written medical reports compiled during
the opposition leader's four years in detention, but had talked to
Nigerian medical officials who said they had seen him in those
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's irrelevant,'' Kola Abiola, the opposition
leader's son, said of the autopsy. ``You don't have to poison a
man, you don't have to spike his tea, to kill him. My father was
locked up for four years without proper medical treatment, and that
is what leads to death. We know who was responsible for locking him
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kola Abiola on Saturday presided at the tumultuous burial of
Abiola in the front yard of the large Abiola family compound in
Lagos. Women sobbed and men wailed as the body, wrapped in white
cloth as prescribed by Muslim custom, was laid to rest in the red
earth, beneath a palm tree, just eight hours after the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   For a national figure of such standing, the attendance was not
huge, amounting to perhaps 500 people. Representatives of the
government were conspicuously absent. Although Abubakar said this
past week that the death of Abiola represented ``one of the saddest
moments of our life,'' he was a prominent member of the government
of Gen. Sani Abacha that jailed him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the impassioned mood of the mourners, any attempt by
military figures to appear would almost certainly have led to
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The army and military police officers initially deployed about
50 yards from Abiola's house, but later fell back before
protesters, taking up positions about 500 yards away from it.
Although they blocked some people, they did not use their automatic
rifles. Clearly, Abubakar had called for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, a man of the southwestern Yoruba tribe who had converted
to Islam, the faith of the Hausa and closely related Fulani tribes
of the north, tried to overcome the ethnic divisions of his
country.
</P>
<P>
   His death, just as it seemed he would be freed, has left many
Nigerians with a sense of deep frustration at a moment when
Abubakar is talking about the need to put the army back in the
barracks and restore democracy. Sporadic rioting, in which as many
as 50 people have died, has gripped the country since Tuesday, but
Lagos was calm Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who arrived here on Thursday, said the autopsy showed
that Abiola had longstanding heart disease of two types, both of
which could cause unexpected death. ``There was severe narrowing of
the main coronary arteries by fatty plaques,'' he said. ``In
addition there was very significant enlargement of the heart due to
longstanding hypertension.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor declined to be drawn into discussing whether four
years of imprisonment might have contributed to this hypertension
by causing extreme stress. ``Is it desirable to have the best of
diets and the most stress-free life?'' he said. ``Yes, of course it
is.''

PARENTS OF SON OF SAM VICTIM ARE ANGERED BY PLANNED MOVIE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was late one July night in 1976 that David
Berkowitz, the serial killer known as the Son of Sam, opened fire
on Donna Lauria, an 18-year-old emergency medical technician, in
front of her family's home in the Westchester Heights section of
the Bronx, near the Throgs Neck Bridge. The shooting, and those
that followed, cast a pall of fear and sorrow over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Now preparations for a Spike Lee movie tentatively called
``Summer of Sam,'' about the era and how people in the area were
affected by the shootings, which left six people dead and seven
injured, are summoning those bitter memories.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauria's parents, Michael and Rose Lauria, and their
supporters looked on disapprovingly Saturday as hundreds of people
lined up at the American Legion Post only a mile or two from their
home at a casting call for extras in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to make money and I'm going to make
heartaches,'' said Lauria as he stood stiffly behind a police
barricade, a picture of his lost daughter pinned to his tan shirt.
``They're exploiting us and the other victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been 22 years since the Son of Sam prowled New
York, Lauria still leads the local chapter of a group called
Parents of Murdered Children, at Calvary Hospital on Eastchester
Road in the Bronx on the third Saturday of every month. And on the
anniversary of his daughter's death, he said, there are always
people who come knocking at their door, asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people in line said they felt bad for the Laurias,
but most saw little harm in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right to protest,'' said Lauren Stoltze,
gesturing at the Laurias. ``I feel bad that people are making money
off their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the person most unnerved by the Laurias' protest was
Victor Colicchio, who wrote the original script for ``Summer of
Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The project had seemed a breakthrough for Colicchio. Spike Lee
had agreed to direct it. Financing was falling into place.
Colicchio said he had not anticipated the pain it would bring to
the victim's parents, whom he met for the first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Colicchio called the Laurias' loss ``heartbreaking,'' and
nervously smoked cigarette after cigarette as he talked about
meeting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to let me know how they felt, and I couldn't argue
with them since I'm a father, too,'' he said. He said he could not
stop the film, but would suggest dedicating it to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But then he shook his head. ``I feel terrible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, dark-haired man in his mid-40s, Colicchio, too, grew
up in the Throgs Neck area. He said the script was, in part, an
attempt to exorcise the past, when he and a group of friends tried
to find the murderer and turn him in, but ended up beating up a man
