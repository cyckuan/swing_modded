<HEADLINE> Mobutu Agrees in Principle to Meet Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko has agreed to meet rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, as has
been suggested by South African President Nelson Mandela, the
presidential special advisor Honore Ngbanda Nzambo announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda, who is a member of the negotiation committee appointed
by Mobutu to talk with the rebels, today handed over a letter from
South African President Nelson Mandela to Mobutu inviting the
latter to meet Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Officials in South Africa said that Mobutu and Kabila could
most probably meet next week in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda said that the date and venue of the talks are "part of
the technical problems that are in the process of being solved,"
and that "the details and methods of this meeting are being
studied and will be announced at a proper time."
</P>
<P>
He said that at the request of President Mandela, both sides of
the negotiation have "the reserving right of not compromising the
very serious things."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the meeting could take place "in less than a
week."
</P>
<P>
On the rebels' call for Mobutu's resignation from his office,
Ngbanda said that it is the Zairian people who should decide who
will be their leaders them through "transparent, just and
non-exclusive elections."
</P>
<P>
"President Mobutu is ready to confront no matter who (in the
elections)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "finance minister" of the rebels, Mawapanga mwana Nanga,
said on Thursday that Kabila is ready to meet Mobutu "whatever
time for a peaceful transfer of power."

<HEADLINE> US Local Phone Giant's Earnings Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bell Atlantic Corporation,
which offers local phone service in six mid-Atlantic states and
the District of Columbia, announced Thursday that its earnings
rose sharply in the first quarter of this year, which is said to
have demonstrated the local phone business in the United States
remains remarkably healthy.
</P>
<P>
The company' earnings in the period increased 11 percent from
the comparable period last year to 515.6 million U.S. dollars. And
its number of line grew 3.9 percent from a year earlier to 20.8
million, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Much of that growth came from second lines, which customers are
using for fax machines and home computers. In the first quarter
Bell Atlantic installed 245,000 second lines, a 20 percent
increase over the comparable period in 1996. It plans to sell one
million additional lines this year.
</P>
<P>
The marked results were scored despite all the regulatory
uncertainty that hangs over it. The company had announced that it
would acquire Nynex, a phone company in New York, in what is
described as a deal trying to become the No. Two company in the
United States only next to At&AMP;T company. But the 22 billion U.S.
dollar merger has been reportedly blocked by the Department of
Justice, which has been conducting an antitrust investigation. the
length and intensity of the investigation has stoked fears that
the Federal Government might kill the deal on the ground that it
will diminish future competition in Bell Atlantic and Nynrx's
markets.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Falls to 2.7 pct in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's underlying inflation
rate fell from 2.9 percent to 2.7 percent in March, the lowest
level for two years, but just short of meeting the government's
target rate of 2.5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), the headline inflation rate, which includes
mortgage interest payments, also dropped, hitting an annual rate
of 2.6 percent, down from February's 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures were a touch lower than economists had expected and
therefore reduced the pressure for a post-election interest rate
hike, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The ONS noted that a sharp fall in the price of seasonal food
over the month was chiefly responsible for the drop in the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Seasonal foods have now fallen in price by 15.6 percent over
the past year, the largest decline since 1983. Overall food prices
have fallen 1.6 percent in the last year, the largest fall since
1960, as food retailers have competed on price.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sterling's rise had also contributed to the fall
in food prices, the ONS added.
</P>
<P>
However, inflation rates in households goods, clothing and
footware rose sharply as retailers took advantage of growing
consumer demand to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that the figures showed that
Britain's economy is booming while inflation stays well under
control.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Labor Party seized on the government's
failure to meet the 2.5 percent target as another broken promise
on the economy.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Extends Ban on Former World Cup Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body FIFA
Friday extended a European ban on a former World Cup referee
accused of bribery, saying further investigations into
match-fixing allegations will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said in Zurich that Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger
would be "permanently banned from all official activity within
FIFA or any of its member associations."
</P>
<P>
It said it would look into allegations of bribery at a World
Cup qualifier between Switzerland and Norway last November.
</P>
<P>
UEFA banned Roethlisberger for life earlier this month in
connection with an incident before a Champions Cup match between
the Swiss side Grasshoppers and Auxerre of France last fall.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said the Swiss referee had approached Grasshopper
officials and suggested that he might be able to convince Vadim
Zhuk of Belarus, the referee assigned to the match, to favor the
Swiss club for 100,000 Swiss francs (70,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> German Military Denies Link with Chemical Exports to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's defense ministry today
rejected charges by Iran that the government and army knew that
German firms were involved in chemical exports to Iraq,
describing the accusation as "sheer nonsense."
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said the German army had never been
involved in chemical deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, chief of the
Iranian Judiciary, said during a prayer ceremony today in Tehran
that Iran had evidence linking the German government and army to
chemical exports to Iraq by German firms during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence, even video tapes, that German firms ... made
chemical exports to Iraq with the awareness and permission of the
German government and army," Yazdi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the chemicals were sent directly to the Iraqi
army and Iran had video tapes showing German officials negotiating
with Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said Iran would sue 24 German firms and the German
officials that Iran accuses of having helped Iraq produce chemical
weapons. Iran alleges these were used in gas attacks on Iranian
soldiers and civilians during the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 complaints have reached the Iranian judiciary from
relatives of the toxic gas victims, demanding compensation and
trial of the relevant German firms and government officials.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary chief also called on the 400 war veterans to end
their three-day sit-down demonstration in front of the German
embassy in Tehran, promising to bring their case to international
tribunals.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi also criticized the April 10 Berlin court verdict which
linked Iran's government and religious leadership to the 1992
killings of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin, calling it
"satanic" and "politically oriented."

<HEADLINE> EU Council Approves EU/US Deal on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the European
Union has approved on Friday the U.S.-EU deal on trade with Cuba,
Iran and Libya, formally announcing the suspension of EU's World
Trade Organization complaint against the U.S. Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called Understanding, hashed out in telephone
negotiations a week ago, EU's suspension would be rewarded by a
promise from the Clinton administration to work with Congress over
the next six months to protect European companies from the trade
sanctions in Helms-Burton legislation and the D'Amato Acts, which
seeks to penalize foreign investment in Iran and Libya's oil and
gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
The deal also calls for the two sides to negotiate a common
policy on properties seized by the Cuban government after the 1959
revolution, and try to globalize "strong standards" on protecting
property rights.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council warned that the European Commission would resume
WTO Panel or launch new WTO procedure if commitments to amend
Title III or Title IV of Helms-Burton legislation were not
respected by the US, or if waivers were not granted or withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The Title III allows naturalized US citizens to sue foreign
firms suspected of profiting from disputed properties in Cuba
while the Title IV bars executives of these companies from
entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU Council reiterated in a statement its "strong
opposition " to the imposition of extraterritorial legislation as
a means of advancing foreign policy objective.
</P>
<P>
"It considers such legislation to be unacceptable both in law
and in principle," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Leader Insists on Mobutu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila today reiterated his alliance's position that President
Mobutu Sese Seko must step down, otherwise rebel forces will march
on to the capital Kinshasa, a latest report available here said.
</P>
<P>
"The South African initiative is about transfer of power. When
he (Mobutu) is ready for this, I shall go and attend a short
day's ceremony on the peaceful transfer of power," Kabila was
quoted by the report as saying in Zaire's second largest city
Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
He added, "there will be no protracted negotiations with
Mobutu, never, never. The issue is about transfer of power,
otherwise we march on to Kinshasa."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels now appear to be building up forces for
a possible assault on the Zairean capital.
</P>
<P>
No official response has so far been available from the Muboto
government on today's bombshell remarks of Kabila. But Mobutu's
son and spokesman Nzanga Mobutu confirmed on Thursday that his
66-year-old ailing father was ready to meet Kabila but refused to
step aside from power.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's departure would bring chaos to Zaire, Nzanga said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila went to Cape Town of South Africa on Wednesday to hold
talks with President Nelson Mandela on the Zairean crisis. Later
on, Mandela also held discussions on the same issue with Mobutu's
special envoy Honore Nganda.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, South African Deputy Foreign Affairs
Minister Aziz Pahad announced at a news conference in Cape Town
that Mandela had formally invited Mobutu to meet Kabila
"as soon as possible" for talks in South Africa and the talks are
likely to take place "early next week".
</P>
<P>
The rebels took up arms to topple President Mobutu last
October. In less than six months, Kabila's Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) has
captured more than half of the territory of the third largest
country in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Indictment Against Netanyahu Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- State Attorney Edana Arbel
today said she would announce her decision Monday on the police
recommendation to indict Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for
his role in the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
Arbel told Israel Radio that she had already made the decision
after consulting with Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein, and
would publicize it Monday evening before the Jewish holiday
Passover begins.
</P>
<P>
She described the decision as a very difficult one, for which
she would take full responsibility, but she declined to release
any detail.
</P>
<P>
The police team investigating the so-called "Bar-On for
Hebron" scandal recommended the state prosecution to indict
Netanyahu as well as Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime
Minister's Office Director-General Avigdor Liberman and Shas party
leader Aryeh Deri.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Hanegbi and Liberman were reportedly charged with
breach of trust in appointing former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On
as the attorney-general in January.
</P>
<P>
Deri was said to be charged with blackmailing in pushing for
Bar-On's appointment by threatening to vote against the Hebron
agreement which Netanyahu wanted so much to get it approved by
the cabinet on January 18.
</P>
<P>
By getting Bar-On appointed, Deri hoped to gain a favorable
plea bargain deal in his three-year long bribery trial. Ironically,
Bar-On resigned after one day in office only because of the public
criticism of his inadequate qualification and political
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
The police recommendation of corruption charges against
Netanyahu has triggered wide responses in Israel attracted
attention from the outside world as well. All eyes are now
focusing on the State Attorney's Office, which is to decide the
fate of the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties Labor and Meretz intensified their campaign
today to topple the government by holding a demonstration outside
the Prime Minister's Office to demand Netanyahu to resign
immediately. Dozens of Likud supporters also staged a
counter-demonstration at the same site to voice support to
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aides have predicted that the prime minister would
escape any indictment because of the insufficient evidence
against him in the police recommendation. They pointed out that
the police recommendation were based on only one witness, and
Netanyahu was only questioned once during the three-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Arbel will only endorse the police suggestions when she thinks
that the evidence gathered so far can stand at the court of law.
</P>
<P>
Hinting that Netanyahu would likely not be indicted, Arbel
reportedly said the prime minister would not be questioned for
second time in future.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Marks 1996 Massacre at Qana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- On the first anniversary of the
killing of 109 Lebanese civilians by Israel at the southern
Lebanese city of Qana, Lebanon today vowed that it will continue
fighting the Israeli occupation of Lebanon's land "in all
available forms and possible styles."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in the southern Lebanese port city of Sour,
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri stressed that "the resistance
is a natural result of the occupation and the peace weapon of
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"The resistance will not stop until all our national land is
liberated," he said. "The resistance will take all available
forms."
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery shelled a Fijian contingent camp of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Qana, some 90 kilometers south of
Beirut, on April 18, 1996, making the day the bloodiest during
Israel's Grapes of Wrath operation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
To mark the massacre, a rally was held in an ancient Roman
stadium in Sour and attended by government ministers,
parliamentarians, religious leaders, foreign diplomats and
some 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Berri expressed a fear that a "heavy armament of
Israel by the United States' will encourage the Jewish state to
always resort to violence."
</P>
<P>
"As long as Israel wants to kill our children, we have to be
candid that the problem is not only with Israel, but was and still
is with the United States and its policy," the house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
"The commemoration of the Qana massacre opens a room to
remember that it was the most advanced artilleries made in the
U.S. which were used by the Israeli army in shelling the post of
the Fijian contingent in Qana where 990 Lebanese citizens were
sheltered in," the house speaker pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This crime is the ugliest in the modern military history,
which, with other massacres that took place previously, invites a
reconsideration of the armament of the Israeli army by the
U.S. and the utilization of the U.S. weapons (by Israel) against
civilians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharply attacking the recent twin vetoes by Washington at the
U.N. Security Council against draft resolutions condemning
Israel's settlement activities in Arab East Jerusalem, Berri said
that the U.S. move encourages Israel to build more settlements and
resort to more violence.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, Berri and other officials went to the cemetery
of the Qana massacre's victims in the town and laid wreaths.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bomb Threats Affects Major's Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- When there are just 13 days left
before British voters go to the polling stations, Prime Minister
John Major's election campaign is shadowed by repeated IRA bombing
threats and explosions.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs blasted this morning in northern England cities,
Doncaster and Leeds, forcing police to seal off the city centers.
Police had also carried out a controlled explosion on a package at
Stoke rail station in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the explosions, rail and road traffic in northern
England was also totally blocked after police received telephoned
bombing threats this morning and closed a large section of major
highway M6 and four railway stations.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist actions appeared to be the latest attempt by the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerillas to disrupt Britain's
election campaign since Prime Minister Major was due to visit a
sports stadium near the closed section of the M6 highway today to
meet local voters.
</P>
<P>
This has reminded people of a huge explosion in London's
financial district in 1992 on the day that Major was re-elected.
IRA has claimed responsibility for that blast.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been fighting against British rule of Northern
Ireland over the past 26 years and has claimed responsibilities
for most of the terrorist attacks and bombing threats in the past.
It quit a 17-month cease-fire agreement in February last year and
resorted to bombings again on the mainland since then.
</P>
<P>
However, Major went ahead with his plans today to campaign in
the north but a bomb disposal squad was on hand throughout his
visit.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time Major's campaign tour was disrupted
since he announced the election day on May 1 in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
On April 5, a bomb warning forced the cancellation of the Grand
National Horse Race when the prime minister was in the region. One
day earlier, IRA bombing alerts forced the closure of three
important highways, costing transport industry millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, two bombs exploded near Wilmslow railway station in
northwest England, and Major had to campaign under tight security.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political Wing of the IRA, has
said it was unlikely the guerilla group would renew its cease-fire
before the general election. Sinn Fein has pinned hope for the
opposition Labor Party to win the election so that it could rejoin
the peace process in Northern Ireland. Labor officials has
promised to allow Sinn Fein to participate in the peace talks if
it gives up terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Major, whose Conservative Party has ruled Britain over the past
18 years, is now lagging behind the Labor Party by around 20
percentage points and seems set to be replaced by Labor leader
Tony Blair in the May 1 election.

<HEADLINE> Tisco Is Among The Best in Thailand, Says IBCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- IBCA, the European credit rating
agency, today published a detailed survey of the credit-worthiness
of seventeen of the largest Thai finance companies, undertaken in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agency found that the best ranking companies were Tisco
(affiliated to Bankers Trust), National (Siam Commercial Bank),
Dhana Siam (Siam Commercial Bank) and Phatra (Thai Farmers Bank).
</P>
<P>
It said, this group generally adopted conservative accounting
policies, exhibited high levels of capital and liquidity, and
adopted less aggressive growth strategies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
They maintain relatively sound asset quality and appear to be
adequately provided against loan losses, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Those ranked lowest on the survey list were International Trust
and Finance, General Finance, CMIC, Siam City Credit and Wall
Street Finance.
</P>
<P>
They exhibited weaknesses in several areas, including low
capital, a high level of accrued interest, low profitability (and
in some cases disguised losses), extremely low liquidity, and
evidence of deteriorating asset quality, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Says Zimbabwe on Road to Posperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy is expected
to grow by at least five percent this year.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe made the prediction in his speech to
celebrate the country's 17th independence anniversary at the
National Sports Stadium here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that performance of the agricultural sector would be
stimulated as a 25-year policy framework was now in place to chart
the growth, taking into account the country's population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, last year the manufacturing sector recorded a
significant growth of about 3.5 percent while the mining sector
was negatively affected by low international prices for major
minerals.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government would intensify efforts to facilitate
the creation of new businesses and expand those already formed so as
to create more wealth and generate employment.
</P>
<P>
''Work is also in progress on the establishment of a
semi-autonomous indigenisation and privatisation agency to speed
up the process of indigenisation and privatisation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe won independence from Britain on April 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Zimbabwean people held all kinds of performances to
celebrate the Independence Day. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Improvement of Greco-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government considers
that progress in Greco-Turkish relations will contribute to
settling the Cyprus problem, Cypriot Foreign Minister Yiannakis
Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with President of House
of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou, Cassoulides expressed his
welcome to a meeting in Malta earlier this week between high
ranking officials from the foreign ministries of Greece and
Turkey. He noted that understanding between Greece and Turkey is
at a preliminary stage, but has not yet reached any final
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides, the foreign minister said "current or
future discussions are not carried out on the basis of the
U.N. 1992 Set of Ideas. We have rejected them as a framework for
an overall agreement."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that he could not rule out the possibility of
discussing some of the concepts, contained in these ideas, such as
the idea of a Cyprus solution on the basis of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation and the notion of political equality.
</P>
<P>
The Minister explained that the Set of Ideas was brought to the
foreground by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash who wishes to
use them as a basis for discussion on a negotiated settlement in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel reiterated today
that various documents such as the High Level Agreements of
1977 and 1979, the U.N. 1992 Set of Ideas, as well as relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions are on the negotiating table for a
settlement to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The High Level Agreements provide for a bicommunal, bizonal
federation in Cyprus, and the U.N. Set of Ideas deal with
the constitutional aspects, security and guarantee, territorial
adjustments, displaced persons and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides have entered the sixth week, during which
U.N. envoy Feissel had bi-weekly separate meetings with President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash in a bid to
prepare the ground for face-to-face negotiations by the mid of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops landed and seized 37
percent of the territory in the wake of an Athens-backed
coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today urged schools in the country to find a workable formula for
character building to enable youth develop a "sound character and
upright moral attributes".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a passing-out parade by the National Youth Service
(NYS) recruits at Gilgil, 120 kilometers northwest of Nairobi,
Moi said that trained human resources and people of sound
character would play a "pivotal role" in industrialization.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that for many years now there had been a
"severe erosion" of the traditional institutions and cultural
values that once held our societies together.
</P>
<P>
At present, he added, the youth of the country no longer
receive adequate parental guidance and counselling as before.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that "the situation calls for urgent
attention and intervention particularly from the churches and
schools in order to find a workable formula for character
building."
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that his government would place great emphasis on
the need to undertake programs and activities which will help the
youth develop into "disciplined, hardworking and patriotic
citizens."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader paid tribute to the NYS in its efforts to
enable the recruits to acquire the necessary skill and develop a
sound and upright moral attributes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pandora's Box Opens for Netanyahu Government (I) (By Zhi Linfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- When Israeli police recommended
indicting Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for his alleged
involvement in a political scandal, the Pandora's Box has opened
for the 10-month old Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Edana Arbel today said she had already made
a decision, but she still kept the whole Jewish state,
perhaps the whole world, in anxious waiting for the fate of
the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
The wait will not last long, as Arbel will announce her
decision Monday on whether to endorse the police recommendation,
which was resulted from a three-month long probe into the
so-called "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal.
</P>
<P>
An upheaval shook the Israeli political spectrum and the whole
nation as well Wednesday when it was revealed that the
police team investigating the Bar-On scandal had recommended
an indictment against Netanyahu, together with Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime Minister's Office Director-General Avigdor
Liberman and Shas party leader Aryeh Deri.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Hanegbi and Liberman were reportedly charged with
breach of trust and fraud for their roles in appointing
former Jerusalem lawyer Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in
January.
</P>
<P>
Deri was said to be charged with blackmailing in pushing
for Bar-On's appointment by threatening to vote against the
Hebron agreement that Netanyahu wanted to get approved by
the cabinet on January 18. By getting Bar-On being appointed,
Deri hoped to gain a favorable plea bargain deal in his
three-year-long bribery trial.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is now under tremendous pressure from both the
opposition and the public to resign to take responsibility.
But he has flatly ruled out his resignation, insisting that
he was innocent and blameless and would fight for his
political survival.
</P>
<P>
However, legal experts and analysts agreed that the police
recommendation had opened the Pandora's Box of troubles for
Netanyahu and his government, regardless of state attorney's
decision to indict him or not.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu is indicted, it is almost certain that his
government will not survive and would be forced to resign to
open the way for new elections.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pandora's Box Opens for Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legally speaking, Netanyahu has the following options to
choose if indicted: resigning to pave the way for new
election of only a prime minister within 60 days; taking a
legally permitted 100-day leave in order to clear the charges
against him at the court, but if he fails to do so within the
period then new elections will be held; remaining in power in hope
to gather full support from his cabinet and coalition partners so
to give him time to prove his innocence at the court.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, Netanyahu can remain in power even
if he is indicted, but the question is whether he can hold
together the whole coalition around him in such a crisis.
Some ministers and ruling partners have made it clear that
they would leave the tarnished government if Netanyahu is
indicted.
</P>
<P>
And even if Netanyahu wins full support from the coalition, the
opposition parties will press further to petition the High Court
of Justice to force him to resign. The court has already set a
precedent in 1993, when it ruled that an indicted minister should
resign.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu is not indicted, it still does not mean that
he is clear of all troubles. First, the opposition can
also appeal to the High Court on the state prosecution's
decision not to indict him, or request the state controller
to investigate the prosecution's decision.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, if Netanyahu escapes the indictment but the justice
minister and the director-general of his office do not. Then, once
again his fate may be in the hands of the coalition partners,
which might bring the government down by leaving it because of
the damage to the government's credibility.
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers from the Third Way, one of the main ruling
partners, have said that they would withdraw support to the
government if a serious breach of public norms is found in
the Bar-On affair even if Netanyahu will not be formally
charged.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya, another major ruling coalition partner, today
also convened an urgent meeting to discuss the situation. Party
leader Natan Sharansky declined to make any comment, but he made
it clear during the course of the investigation of the Bar-0n scandal
that he would leave the government if any minister is found to
have been involved in the affair.
</P>
<P>
Despite the enormous pressure and accusations, Netanyahu, with
his characteristics of fighting spirit, vowed to fight for his
survival. Speaking at a party rally Thursday, he confidently
predicted that he would lead the country well till the year
2000 and even beyond.
</P>
<P>
But at this point, Netanyahu's greatest misfortune is that he
is not in any way in control of the situation, and there is
nothing whatsoever he can do to influence the outcome of the
present drama. He, like the rest of the world, has to wait for the
final verdict on his fate, to be issued Monday by the State Attorney's
Office.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: How Israeli Prime Minister is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Basic Law, which was
passed in 1992 and came into effect with the last elections on
May 29, 1996, contains several clauses pertaining specifically to a
situation in which the prime minister cannot function in his post.
</P>
<P>
One section refers in particular to a situation in which the
prime minister is accused of a crime of moral turpitude and can
be impeached without the Knesset (Parliament) being dissolved.
</P>
<P>
But there is no explicit requirement in the law that the prime
minister step down if indicted, or even convicted of a crime that
"carries with it disgrace" -- such as fraud and breach of trust,
the offenses allegedly committed by current Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in the "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the prime minister can be removed from office
in three ways:
</P>
<P>
1. By a majority of 61 out of 120 Knesset members, in which
case new elections are held within 60 days for both a new prime
minister and the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
2. By a special majority of 80 of 120 Knesset members, in which
case the Knesset serves out its full four-year term and only
elections for a new prime minister are held.
</P>
<P>
3. If the prime minister has been convicted of a crime of
moral turpitude, he can be impeached without dissolving the
Knesset by a simple majority of 61.
</P>
<P>
If the prime minister resigns, special elections are held just
for the premiership and the Knesset serves out its current term.
</P>
<P>
A criminal investigation of the prime minister can only be
carried out with the approval of the attorney-general, who is
also the only person authorized to hand the premier an
indictment. Charges against the prime minister must be heard in
Jerusalem District Court before a bench of three judges.

<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The current tight monetary policy
stance of the Nigerian government, with an equally tight fiscal
policy, is aimed at achieving macro-economic stability and
sustained growth, Finance Minister Anthony Ani said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the money market would be reformed in order to make
it a full-fledged secondary market in securities and short-term
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said while interest rates were being deregulated with the
cap removed, sectoral credit allocation would be eliminated, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum subsidy would eventually be removed when the
refineries are privatized, he added.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the external sector policy of the government,
Ani said that policies aimed at stemming the rising level of
disbursements through the adoption of market-determined exchange
rates were being pursued.
</P>
<P>
There are two exchange rates effective in Nigeria at present.
One is the official rate of one U.S. Dollar to 22 Naila, the
other is the market rate of one Dollar to about 85 Naila.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would strive to achieve consistency in
its macro-economic policies through the harmonization of fiscal
and monetary policies to attain the desired level of liquidity
and consequently stablize the exchange rate.

Mokhehle's application for a court order to set aside his

Maqutu said Mokhehle's term of office will expire in January
next year under the party's constitution. Therefore, he would
remain as interim leader until a new leader was elected at the

SANAA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's House of Representatives
today issued a statement, denouncing Qana massacre perpetrated by
the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon last April, in
which 109 Lebanese civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at the first anniversary of the Qana
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery shelled a Fijian contingent camp of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Qana, some 90 kilometers south of
Beirut, on April 18, 1996, making the day the bloodiest during
Israel's Grape of Wrath operation in south Lebanon.

The statement expressed full solidarity with the Lebanese
people in defense of Lebanon's rights and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "Yemeni House of Representatives was
against the Israeli provocative practices in south Lebanon and the
other occupied Arab territories."
</P>
<P>
It voiced deep concern over the hardline policy of Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community "to live up to its legal

Lebanese people under Israeli aggressions in an attempt to
partition Lebanon and violate its sovereignty."

"Such an attempt is so gross that it can not be neglected or

<P>
TUNIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Organization for
Investment and Agricultural Development (AOIAD) considers the
launching of an Arab export-import company in a bid to boost the
trade exchanges among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian daily Assabah today quoted Chairman of the AOIAD
Youssef Abdullatif as saying that the trade exchange among the
Arab states accounted only for 10 percent of the total Arab trade
exchange with foreign countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The trade exchange of farm products and foodstuffs among
the Arab countries did not exceed 10 percent of the total Arab
trade exchange, Abdullatif added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the low percentage to the inefficiency and the
high cost of the transport as well as the dominant belief among
the Arabs that foreign products are more competitive in terms of
quality and cheap prices compared with Arab products.
</P>
<P>
Abdullatif pointed out that there is a food shortage in the
Arab world due to negligence of agricultural investment that
constitutes just 9 percent of the total Arab investment.
</P>
<P>
The AOIAD based in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, has
recently organized the first forum for enterprises in which the
AOIAD is a partner with the participation of investors from 11
Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> SDP Head Blasts Land Lease Law for Undermining Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Takako Doi, head of Japan's Social
Democratic Party (SDP), today criticized a revision of law for the
continued compulsory leasing of land in Okinawa for use by the
U.S. military, saying it undermines the Japanese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech at a two-day convention of the SDP, Doi
said the revised legislation "violates property rights protection
under Article 29 of the Constitution and puts the status of the
U.S. military ahead of the Constitution", Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan's House of Councillors (Upper House) approved the
government proposed Okinawa land bill on Thursday. The bill became
law as it has already passed the more powerful House of
Representatives (Lower House).
</P>
<P>
The enacted revision of the 1952 law ensures that the
U.S. forces can continue to legally use land scattered in 12
military facilities in Okinawa Prefecture, owned by some 3,000
people who refuse to renew the leases after they expire May 14.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious" that the special land law runs counter to the
spirit of Article 95 of the Constitution, Doi, also a lecturer of
the Constitution, said.
</P>
<P>
The SDP chief accused some 80 percent of Diet (Parliament)
members of voting in favor of the Special law. SDP voted against
the law Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Doi also called on the government to help reduce the
U.S. military presence in Okinawa and promote the island
prefecture's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is home to 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities
in Japan. More than half of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan are
stationed in the island.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Speaker Questioned Over Hanbo Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors today questioned the
speaker of South Korea's parliament about whether he took money
from the scandal-hit Hanbo Steel Co. which collapsed under six
billion U.S. dollars of debt in January.
</P>
<P>
Kim is the highest level politician implicated in the Hanbo
loans-for-kickbacks scandal. In view of his status as head of the
legislative body, investigators visited him at his official
residence instead of summoning him to the prosecutors' office.
</P>
<P>
Kim is the first head of South Korea's legislature to be probed
by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said earlier this week that Chung Tae-soo,
founder of Hanbo, the country's 14th largest conglomerate, told
them he had donated funds to help Kim's parliamentary election
campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suspect more politicians may have taken bribes
in exchange for government-controlled bank loans and have so far
called in 33 politicians for questioning. Most of them have
admitted receiving money from Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
Chung is on trial for bribery and other charges along with nine
others, including three long-time political allies of President
Kim Young-sam, for their involvement in the collapse of Hanbo Steel Co
-- the flagship of the Hanbo Group.

<HEADLINE> Mao Zedong's Hometown Booming With Tourism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The hometown of the late Chinese
leader Mao Zedong is getting richer from tourists eager to eat
Mao's favorite foods and buy Mao-related souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the reform and opening up, the residents
of Shaoshan Village in central China's Hunan Province are making
the most of the tourism resources that abound in Mao's hometown.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the village earned a total of over 100
million yuan in 1996, and the annual income per villager reached
5,200 yuan. More than a decade ago, the village's total yearly
income was less than 60,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In many of Shaoshan's restaurants and hotels, varieties of
food, tea and wine that were favored by the late leader are
served. A number of hotels and shops also sell souvenirs, such as
commemorative music tapes and discs, coins, watches, and badges
that bear Mao's likeness. Even handkerchiefs and T-shirts are
printed with Mao's portrait, or poems or sayings.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the village has received several hundred
thousand overseas visitors, including more than a dozen state
leaders and high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Tang Ruiren, owner of the well-known "Mao's Hometown
Restaurant" which is located opposite the late leader's former
residence, said that she has received 300,000-plus visitors.
</P>
<P>
"I have branch restaurants in cities like Beijing, Guangzhou,
Harbin and Xi'an, and I'm quite well-off now," said Tang, who has
donated over 400,000 yuan to help orphans, poor students, elderly
people and disaster-stricken areas.

<P>
While the individually-run tourism services are flourishing in
the village, the overall economy has also grown quickly.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the village has received some 1.5 million
travelers annually in the past few years. To help accommodate
guests, the village government spent 200,000 yuan to build a
hotel, which has a yearly income in excess of one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
It has also invested 650,000 yuan for parking lots in three
famous scenic spots, bringing in a total annual income of more
than 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the village spent 40 million yuan to build the Mao
Zedong Commemorative Park, which has packed 15 man-made scenic
sites that have some connection with Mao into a 18-hectare
area. The park earned 11 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid tourism growth has also given impetus to the
development of the village's agriculture. The government spent
more than two million yuan last year for agricultural
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The growing area of high-quality rice in Mao's hometown
accounts for 60 percent of the total, and more than 200 tons of
quality rice go into the market every year from the village,
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 2,000 pigs and eight tons of fresh fish
were sold in the village last year.

<HEADLINE> 40 PLA Advance Personnel To Arrive in HK Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Forty advance personnel of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), led by Major General Zhou Borong,
will arrive in Hong Kong at 1:00 pm April 21 via the Lok Ma Chau
Crossing, a Hong Kong government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA advance personnel will be in uniform but will not
carry arms. The eight vehicles brought in by them will carry Hong
Kong number plates," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the border, the party will go through immigration and
customs clearance and declare articles imported in line with
normal procedures," he added.
</P>
<P>
After that, the party will proceed straight to the Prince of
Wales Barracks where they will be greeted by Major General Bryan
Dutton, commander of the British Forces in the territory, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Chinese and British sides on the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached agreement over the
first batch of the PLA advance personnel.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, 40 advance personnel, led by a deputy
commander of the future PLA Garrison in Hong Kong, who is an
officer of the rank of Major General, will arrive in Hong Kong in
late April.
</P>
<P>
They will make practical preparations for the PLA to take over
the responsibility for the defense of Hong Kong after midnight
June 30, including familiarization with the military sites,
liaison with the British Forces and the Hong Kong government, and
coordination of communications support.

<HEADLINE> Greek and Turkish Cypriots Exchange Visits as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 450 Turkish Cypriots today
crossed into the southern government-controlled areas for a
pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque in Larnaca, on the
southeastern coast, on the occasion of the Muslim religious
festival of "Kurban Bairam."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots were greeted at the Ledra Palace
check-point in Nicosia by Greek Cypriots, carrying olive
branches.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots also handed to their Turkish Cypriot
compatriots messages urging them to join forces in trying to
re-unite their homeland divided for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1974 that Turkish Cypriots
visited the government-controlled southern areas of the island.
</P>
<P>
The visit came as a good-will gesture on the part of the
Greek Cypriot side in the framework of on-going proximity talks
under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks, which began on March 10, are aimed at
breaking the current deadlock on Cyprus problem and paving the
way for the U.N.-proposed face-to-face negotiations between
leaders of the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Hala Sultan Tekke, located on the shore of Larnaca's Salt
Lake, was built in memory of Umm Haram, an aunt of Prophet
Mohammed and is considered one of the holiest Islamic shrines.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has also promised, as a good-will
gesture on its part, to allow Greek Cypriots to visit the
monastery of Apostolos Andreas, at the Turkish-controlled
northern part of the island, on Greek Orthodox Faster Sunday, on
April 27.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been separated and are
not allowed to cross the Green Line, which is controlled by the
1,200-strong U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus.

according to State Councillor Chen Junsheng.
</P>
<P>
Chen said at the meeting that flexible policies will be granted
to newly-opened land.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15.3 billion yuan will be spend on the country's

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Driving Force of Port City's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Overseas capital rapidly injected
in Tianjin, a port city in north China, has become a driving force
of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has witnessed double-digit growth in the
city annually since 1992. The local economy in the period has also
posted double-digit growth four years straight. The city has
attracted 16 billion US dollars up to last year. Registered
overseas-funded ventures totaled more than 10,000, of which two
thirds are in various industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has been used to revitalize the state
industrial enterprises, many of which have been operating at a
loss since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Some 68 local enterprises have cooperated with overseas
partners, greatly improving the technical and financial
management. Some even escaped from the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Medium- and small-sized state enterprises also found their part
to play in the renovation drive -- producing parts and components
for major overseas-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show a contingent of smaller factories found this an
effective way out of management deadlock. Some 42 companies which
produced parts and components for Japanese Honda Motors posted
sales totalling 220 million yuan. A pager ring producer obtained
70 million yuan-worth orders from US's Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies in recent years not only transplanted
brand-names into China, but also created new brands in China, thus
shortening the gap between local companies with overseas producers.
</P>
<P>
Job opportunities have also been created. The employees in
enterprises with overseas investment have exceeded more than
320,000 in Tianjin.

TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian military officer
today denied any link between his forces and a Saudi national
suspected of involvement in the last June bombing of U.S. Air
Force dormitory that killed 19 American servicemen in Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia
</P>
<P>
Major General Mohsen Rezaei, Commander of the Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC), rejected the accusation made
by the Washington Post Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The weekly alleged last week that a high ranking IRGC
official had been linked to Hani Abd Arahim al Zayegh who
was arrested in Canada last month for his alleged role in
the June 25 bombing.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time that America embarks on
telling lies about the Islamic Republic of Iran," said the
general.
</P>
<P>
Usually, he added, after such an incident, American and
Israeli officials and media try to hold Iran responsible without
producing any evidence.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has reportedly obtained information on the
anti-U.S. bombing but refused to divulge any details before the
investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
The United States accused Iran of involvement in the
bombing and warned that American forces would launch a military
strike if Iran is found responsible.

<HEADLINE> China to Carry on Negotiations for Joining WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will firmly and
unswervingly carry on negotiations for joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), despite the 10-year-long process such talks
have already taken, a senior Chinese government official stated
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium on the WTO and China's service trade,
Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Long Yongtu, who is also the country's chief trade negotiator,
said that China's access to the WTO means that the world's largest
country characterized by a planned economy would be included in
the multilateral system of a global market economy.
</P>
<P>
For China and the whole world, it will take time to coordinate,
adjust, and fit to each other in this process, he noted, adding
that during the past decade China has scored rapid economic
development, so the whole world will need time to regard and
accept an increasingly prosperous China.
</P>
<P>
Long said that China will not turn itself into a free trade
zone after it becomes a member of the WTO, and that its
enterprises will not benefit immediately.
</P>
<P>
How to seize the opportunities will require China's own efforts,
he said, since a multilateral global trade system can only create
a stable and sound multilateral and legal environment.

<HEADLINE> More Beijingers Turn to Stocks, Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Individual investors in the
Chinese capital opened more than 80,000 stock trading accounts in
the first quarter of this year, about 6.5 times the figure of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that stock turnover in Beijing totalled 51.32
billion yuan (about 6.18 billion US dollars) by the end of
February, which was 10.9 times that of a year ago. Financial
institutions here sold seven billion yuan in corporate and
treasury bonds between January and March.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that active trading in stocks and bonds has
slowed down the increase in bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding deposits at the financial system in Beijing
amounted to 448.41 billion yuan by the end of last month. The
quarterly increase of 3.94 billion yuan was 8.19 billion yuan less
than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that personal savings deposits of urban and
rural residents totalled 175.72 billion yuan by the end of March,
up 5.02 billion yuan over the start of the year, which was 10.09
billion yuan less than a year ago. The increase in the three-month
period was the smallest in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the banking system had a total of
216.5 billion yuan in outstanding loans by the end of last month,
down 1.77 billion yuan from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey by the Beijing branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China shows that the bonds sold in the first
three months were bought with money diverted from savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that Beijing reported a net money
supply of 440 million yuan in the January-March period, the
largest in the last five years.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Wu Xueqian met with foreigners who are
attending the Third Conference on Peace, Disarmament, and
Symbiosis in the Asia-Pacific (PDSAP) here today.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental meeting is attended by 40 persons from ten
countries including China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, and
Vietnam. It opened today and will conclude on Monday.

<P>
Wu told the foreign guests that peace and development, which
are the topics of the PDSAP meeting, are the two issues that are
of wide concern to the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that non-governmental contacts facilitate the exchange
of opinions and views and the enhancement of trust and
understanding among the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This
is not only good for maintaining peace and stability in the
region, but also for building a peaceful, stable, ever-growing,
and prosperous world in the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Den Hideo from Japan said that the meeting is of great
significance because it provides an opportunity of exchange among
people from different geographical locations, nationalities, and
countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Invest in Iran's Oil, Gas Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
Russia would invest directly in oil and gas sectors in the
Islamic republic despite U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Hojatollah Ghanimi-Fard, director
of the International Affairs of the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the Iranian Oil Ministry and the
Russian Gazprom Gas Company have signed agreements for
cooperation in the fields of oil and gas sectors during the visit
by Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri to Moscow
last week.
</P>
<P>
Ghanimi-Fard said that on the basis of these agreements,
Gazprom would invest directly in the gas fields, help increase
production capacity, refining, liquefication and transportation of
natural gas, and promote cooperation in upstream and downstream gas
industries in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also develop mutual cooperation in
other areas of interest, the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official gave no details about the agreements. He
did not mention how much the Russian company is going to invest
or when and where the cooperation will be launched.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, a consortium of two Russian oil
companies concluded a cooperation agreement with the NIOC for
drilling in territorial waters of Iran.
</P>
<P>
So far part of the technical data has been exchanged in this
field and the process will be completed by the end of this month,
the NIOC official added.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the NIOC and the oil company of
Tatarstan had also signed an agreement during Nateq-Nouri's visit
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will cooperate in joint
projects in upstream and downstream oil industries.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer and the second biggest
oil exporter in the world, pumps out 3.8 million barrels of crude
oil per day (bpd) and exports 2.6 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil export earned the country 19.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic republic has been under U.S. sanctions
since last August when U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a new
law to punish non-American companies investing annually 40 million
U.S. dollars or more in energy projects in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have proved little successful as the European
countries refused to follow suit on the ground that isolating Iran
would not help curb terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran was accused of sponsoring terrorism, but Tehran rejected
the charges.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Women Advised Not to Marry Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities warned its
female citizens not to marry foreigners in view of a lot of
troubles in the future, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qolam Reza Husseinpour, director in charge of foreign
nationals of the Khorassan province, has openly called on the
female in the country to "avoid marriage with foreign nationals
without legal registration."
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akhbar quoted the official as saying the
marriage of some Iranian females in the northeastern province
with Afghan nationals has created a lot of problems and
complications.
</P>
<P>
The children of such marriages lack any legal identities and
a number of Iranian women are living in chaos and confusion with
their children after they lose their spouses for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The provincial official said a recent national census showed
that some Iranian women were married to immigrants from Iraq,
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there are 400,000 Afghan immigrants
presently staying in various parts of the province either legally
or illegally.
</P>
<P>
Among the marriages with foreigners involved, he noted, some
30,000 marriages lacked any official registration at notary
offices.
</P>
<P>
Most of the problems come when foreigners such as Afghan
nationals suddenly disappear and abandon their Iranian wives and
their families.
</P>
<P>
In general, Iran does not encourage Iranians, females in
particular, to get married to foreigners, while males' marriage
of this kind is more tolerable, because theoretically they can
bring women back from other countries and increase the Muslim
populace.
</P>
<P>
But, some young girls, especially those who know foreign
languages, reportedly have the intention of marrying Americans
and Europeans.

GOTHENBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic champion Denis
Pankratov got another heavy blow at the World Short-course
Swimming Championships as he failed to make his second final here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who holds all the men's short-course and
long-course butterfly world marks, led the first 50 meters of his
200 butterfly heat but then lost his momentum. He could not
survive the challengge from defending champion Scott Goodman of
Australia and Germany's Thomas Rupprath, finishing a disappointing
ninth place, just out of evening's finals.
</P>
<P>
The world number one male butterfier clocked one minute 58.22
seconds, more than five seconds shy of the 1:52.64 world mark he

</P>
<P>
Pankratov did not manage a place in the 100 butterfly final on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
American Misty Hyman showed her perfect underwater technique

heats. She touched the pad in a championship record of 58.32.
</P>
<P>
Hyman set a world mark of 58.29 last December but that was
bettered to 58.24 on March 28 by Japan's teenager Olympian Ayari
Aoyama.
</P>
<P>
American Jenny Thompson, with a 100 freestyle gold and 50
freestyle silver already in her pocket, was second-fastest overall
in 58.67.
</P>
<P>
Claudia Poll, who broke her own 200 freestyle world mark on
Friday, faces a serious challenge from 15-year-old Australian
Natasha Bowron in the final of the women's 400 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Bowron, gold medallist in Friday's 800 freestyle, led
qualifiers in four minutes 8.72 seconds, beating Poll into the
second at 4:08.93.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Francisco Sanchez led qualifiers in the men's 100
freestyle with a time of 47.85.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cash Trees to Bring Money to Yunnan Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan province
is now allocating 420 million yuan of funds to launch a "Green
Poverty Relief Project."
</P>
<P>
The project plans to pull five million poor farmers out of
poverty by helping them plant nearly 27,000 ha of cash trees
through the next four years.
</P>
<P>
These poor farmers, living in 506 poor villages, accounted for
92 percent of the province's total poor population.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, It's only one of a series of
poverty relief projects to be carried out in the province.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan province, with its advantageous climate, is suitable for
a cash forest. To ensure the success of the project, the
provincial government has sent thousands of technicians to these
poor towns to guide farmers.
</P>
<P>
The province, as a remote province with poor transport
facilities, has the largest poor population in the country.
</P>
<P>
China sets the poverty line at annual per capita income of 500
yuan and per capita grain quota at 300 kilograms. Calculated on
this basis, the country still has 65 million poor people.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Day Ultimatum Extended in S. Lenone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 19 (Xinhua) - The seven-day ultimatum given by
the Sierra Leone government to a group of Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels holding Sierra Leone's ambassador in Guinea
and two officials of the Commission for the Consolidation of
Peace (CCP) has been extended "indefinitely".
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Hinga Norman told Xinhua in a telepone
interview here today that the ultimatum was also for those who
''continue to violate the ceasefire and the peace accord''.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he recently established contact with Colonel Sam
Bockari of the RUF who gave the assurance that the hostages were
safe and sound. Bockari is said to be the No. 2 man of the RUF.
</P>
<P>
''I warned Colonel Bockari that should any harm comes to the
abductees, the RUF group would be held responsible'', Norman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to extend the ultimatum was
''encouraged'' by an increasing number of rebels who have
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone envoy, Ambassdor Mohamed Diaby and seven
dissident officials of the RUF were kidnapped some three weeks
ago by a group of RUF fighters in far eastern Sierra Leone. The
group said it was opposed to the replacement of the RUF leader,
Corporal Foday Sankoh, who has been in Nigeria for about seven
weeks under unexplained circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven officials held are two RUF members, Fayia Musa
and Ibrahim Deen Jalloh, who are RUF representatives to the CCP,
set up to work out modalities for the implementation of the peace
accord signed in Abidjan last November. enditem

of the Lebanese community in Zaire, stressed that the Lebanese

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Nine companies have proposed
to undertake a project -- reclaiming 12,800 hectares of land from
the sea off the coast of Malaysia's northern State of Kedah.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was today briefed on
the proposed project, said to be the biggest ever in the world, at
Alor Setar, capital of Kedah, about 460 kilometers north from

</P>
<P>
The project, which is scheduled for completion by the year 2020
at an estimated cost of 30 billion ringgit (about 12 billion U.S.
dollars), will provide the land needed for housing and small
towns.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz Ibrahim, Director-General of the National Hydraulic

after briefing the Prime Minister, that the proposed project will
have no negative effect on the environment while preventing
coastal erosion and protecting the state's mangrove swamp.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Inflation Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing
registered a consumer price index increase of 6.4 percent in the
first three months of this year, according to latest statistics
from the local commercial commission.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 8.3 percentage points lower than that in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index increased 5.5 percent during the period,
down 4.5 percentage points from last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the city enjoyed an abundant retail market
and completed retail sales of 24.09 billion yuan, up 6.9 percent
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The commission attributed the falling inflation to the
effective macro-control measures adopted by the local
government. The prices for major agricultural products linked to
residents' daily life have dropped to the lowest point.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the impacting factors of both last year's inflation
and newly-adapted prices this year were lower than last year's.
</P>
<P>
The commission admitted that prices on services and housing are
still running at high levels.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (31-32) (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annex III of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates, "in
the case of old schedule lots, village lots, small houses and
similar rural holdings where the property was on June 30, 1984
held by, or, in the case of small houses granted after that date,
the property is granted to, a person descended through the male
line from a person who was a resident in 1898 of an established
village in Hong Kong, the rent shall remain unchanged so long as
the property is held by that person or by one of his lawful
successors in the male line."
</P>
<P>
In consideration of this provision and realities, the Basic
Law makes special provisions on the legitimate rights and
interests of the original residents of the "New Territories", and
the above-mentioned provision of Annex III of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration is written in full into Article 122 of Chapter 5
of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Question: What institutions will be established in the Hong
Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: With regard to the establishment of institutions in the
future Hong Kong SAR, the Basic Law follows two principles, First,
in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, no changes will be made unless such changes are
necessary, and no changes will be made if such changes are not
desirable. What is more, good elements of existing institutions
will be either assimilated or retained.
</P>
<P>
Second, given the characteristics of the Hong Kong SAR, there
will be neither a complete copying of the names of existing
institutions, nor a duplication of the mainland's people's
congress, procuratorate and judicial systems, nor a patterning
after its governmental structure.
</P>
<P>
The most important institutions of the Hong Kong SAR are: the
Chief Executive, the government, the Legislative Council and the
Court of Final Appeal. In addition, there are the Executive
Council as well as the Commission Against Corruption and the
Commission of Audit, both of which work independently and are
accountable to the Chief Executive. Under the Hong Kong SAR will
be a department of administration, a department of finance, a
department of justice and various bureaux, divisions and
commissions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (31-32)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What are the legitimate traditional rights and
interests of the original residents of the "New Territories"?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The legitimate traditional rights and interests of
people in the "New Territories" will be protected by the Hong Kong
SAR. Original residents of the "New Territories" refer to people
descended through the male line from a person who was in 1898 a
resident of an established village in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong people maintain that the rights and interests of
the original residents of the "new Territories" have been
inherited from common practices and customs of the Qing
Dynasty. In 1898 when Britain leased the "New Territories" by
force, it offered a series of conditions to the original residents
for purchasing land to expand the "New Territories".
</P>
<P>
These include:
</P>
<P>
1) The original male residents have the right to build family
</P>
<P>
houses (their male descendants may have the same right);
</P>
<P>
2) Village lots may be exempt from taxes to the government;
</P>
<P>
3) Compensation may be given for land exchanges and lease;
</P>
<P>
4) For village lots in renewal terms, only symbolic rent
</P>
<P>
needs to be paid; and
</P>
<P>
5) Residents are allowed to retain the right to traditional
underground burial in Fengshui land. These rights and interests
have remained unchanged in the form of government policies and
decrees.
</P>
<P>
A decision was made to allow holders of such traditional rights
to retain their rights during Sino-British negotiations in the
light of China's commitment to let Hong Kong "remain unchanged for
50 years."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects to Export Weapons to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Turkey are
preparing to boost arms deals after the former first lifted a ban on
weapons exports to the latter, the local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The decision (to lift the embargo) will only improve the
relations between the two countries," South African Ambassador to
Turkey Riaan Eksteen was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is a great potential of cooperation between South Africa
and Turkey, which should cover military and defense fields, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa imformed Turkey on Tuesday that it had lifted the ban
and placed Turkey in a list of countries with no limitations on arms
exports.
</P>
<P>
In a positive reponse, the Turkish government has also invited
South Africa to bid for a huge helicopter deal.
</P>
<P>
Local defense sources said major South African arms exporter Denel,
which produces the advanced Rooivalks attack helicopters, has a
reasonable chance of winning the Turkish tender for up to 145
gunships.
</P>
<P>
South Africa imposed a ban on arms exports to Turkey in April
1995 after the Turkish Army invaded northern Iraq to hunt down
separatist Turkish Kurds who had bases in the area.
</P>
<P>
It at the time denounced the Turkish incursion as a violation of an
independent country's sovereignty. In retaliation, Turkey placed South
Africa in its red list of countries, banning all potential arms deals.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Close Failed Community Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria is working
out modalities on how to close down the distressed community banks
that failed to recapitalize as the government requires, the New
Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Bank statistics, there are more than 1,000
community banks in the country and about 90 percent of them are
distressed.
</P>
<P>
The paid-up capital requiremenet of community banking has remained
250,000 naila (nearly 3,000 U.S. Dollars currently) since its
establishment in 1988, compared with 500 million naira (about 5.9
million dollars) for commercial and merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
The capital base of community banks has almost been eroded by
inflation over the years and can no longer withstand the inflationary
pressure, according to Central Bank Governor Paul Ogwuma.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has earlier this year announced all
distressed commercial and merchant banks should increase their paid-up
capital to the 500 million naila level before the end of March,
otherwise they will be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
The new capital requirement has not been announced publicly for
community banks, which are licensed with the aim of providing
assistance to people of the grassroots as well as encouraging banking
habit among the people.

<P>
The cases of the desease were put at 593 as at last month in all
the 11 local government areas of the state, one of Nigeria's six

completely incapacitated by the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The report said some civil servants described the situation as a
disaster, blaming the government for its negative attitude towards
checking the menace.
</P>
<P>
But Gombe State Commissioner for Health Jalo Daudu said that a
task force committee on guineaworm eradication has been set up to
check the menace.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the committee completes its report on effective
eradication, the government will swing into action, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the federal government and other
non-governmental organizations for aid.

PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A group of American and Ugandan researchers claimed the
discovery in Uganda of the fossil remains of a common ancester for
both mankind and apes. The animal, baptized Morotopitheque, was
believed to be living in the world 20 million years ago. It had no
tail, could have spent most of its time on trees, and has now
become the competitor of Proconsul, another presumed human
ancester, for the title of the oldest man on earth.
</P>
<P>
-- The Austrian city of Graz has cancelled a plan to host an
exhibition displaying the atrocities of the Wehrmacht, the German
regular army, during World War II, because no gallery is willing
to accommodate the exhibition with pictures showing German regular
troops joining massacres of Jews and civilians in the Soviet Union
and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- All political parties of France are now preparing for a
possible announcement on dissolution of the National Assembly,
which could be made by President Jacques Chirac on Monday evening
in a televised speech to the French people. Prime Minister Alain
Juppe said Friday that he was "ready" for such a decision.
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria's militant group, Armed Islamic Group (GIA), has
made a new threat to France in the April issue of its clandestine
bulletin "Al Jamaa (the Group)" distributed in London. While
claiming responsibility for a number of attacks in France,
including the bombing of Port Royal underground train station in
Paris last December, the GIA accused France of "waging an open war
on the group" and supporting the Algerian government.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers to Upgrade T-72 Tanks Supplied to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia has offered to modernize
India's T-72 tanks by supplying a comprehensive active tank
defense system, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a highly placed Russian official, the report said the
new system called "Arena", which would be mounted on the tanks
sold by Russia before, is capable of providing a high degree of
protection to tanks from anti-tank grenades, self-guided and
unguided missiles, all kinds of shells fired by infantry as well
as those launched from helicopters.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian military experts, the "Arena" can make
India's T-72 tanks, estimated to be around 1,400-1,700, almost
invulnerable to guided or unguided anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Arena" was created for the Russian T-80 tanks at the end of
1980s and is currently exported by the Russian arms trading
corporation "Roosvooruzhenie".

<HEADLINE> Iran's Papers Urge Government to Revise Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian newspapers urged today the
government to revise its foreign trade policy toward European
countries and not put all its eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
The official English dailies Iran News and Tehran Times
published editorials entitled "Don't Put All the Eggs in One
Basket" and "Realistic Approach to Foreign Trade Vital."
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that Iran should expand its economic cooperation
and trade with East European countries to encounter a western
campaign spearheaded by the U.S. to isolate the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with Russia and Eastward trends in the Iranian
economy could be the best answer to Western plan against the
Islamic Republic," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times commented in its editorial: "We must not create a
situation for our trade partners to use trade as a tool to
strangulate us."
</P>
<P>
"We must be very serious in diversifying the sources of our
foreign trade, for disproportionate dependence on a country or a
bloc of countries is tantamount to a 'commercial suicide' to us,"
it noted.
</P>
<P>
In the article, it urged the Iranian government to expand its
relations "with regional and Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
It also said in the editorial "In order to minimize the
chance of our partners to use trade as a pressure lever, our
policy makers must in the first instance review all our economic
plans and see if our plan can really lead us to self-sufficiency
and self-reliance."
</P>
<P>
Iran's relations with European countries have come into a
grave crisis and all ambassadors of the European Union (EU) states
except Greece were recalled shortly after the Berlin court ruled
on April 10 that the Iranian leadership was involved in the 1992
killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany is now the leading trade partner of Iran after the
United States broke off diplomatic and economic ties with
Tehran 18 years ago. The total annual trade volume of Germany and
the Islamic republic once topped 4 billion U.S. dollars in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Germany takes a lionshare of Iran's total import and
export. Its export made up 41.3 percent while its import amounted
to 32.8 percent of Iran's total in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EU imports to Iran total about 15-18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran News noted that Iran and the EU have had what it called a
head-on collision following the Berlin court verdict which, Iran
believed, was politicized.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warned Iranian economists not to keep all Iran's
eggs in one basket, adding "We have to look toward the East to
balance our trade and economy."
</P>
<P>
It called on the decision-makers in the country to make more
specific and comprehensive planning on the matter. "In the Pacific
region, the most modern technology is available," it said.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that, unlike Europe, the Pacific
region has never shown sensitivity against Islam, a vital factor
that makes business with them easier," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Not to Bow to Pressure by Donors, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin Amour
said on Friday that his government would not bow to pressure by donor
countries, many of which have suspended development aid to the Isles,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We have no business to woo donors who are reluctant to help us,"
Amour told an Idd El Haj Baraza at the House of Representative in the
town of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He said donors' decision to suspend aid will under no
circumstances affect the Isles pace of development.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president said donors should not dictate terms to
Zanzibar, insisting that people were the main players in bringing
development.
</P>
<P>
Amour's remarks were apparently in reaction to the recent European
Commission (EC) decision to freeze development aid to Zanzibar until
the prevailing political tension in Zanzibar is resolved and the human
rights record improved.
</P>
<P>
The political tension in Zanzibar arose after the 1995 presidential
elections when defeated Civic United Front (CUF) candidate, Seif
Shariff Hamad, claimed that the results were rigged and refused to
accept Amour as the legitimate leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Amour said he was aware that some Zanzibaris
devoted their time to convince donors to stop aids to the government
on grounds of lack of democracy but said the islands would shine star
despite suspension of aids to development.
</P>
<P>
He further said the government was aware of economic difficulties
facing the people but said hardworking and co-operation was a solution
to solve the snags.
</P>
<P>
He asked the people to maintain unity and peace asking them to
ignore political provocations aimed at disturbing unity and peace
there.  enditem

<HEADLINE> E. African Speakers Want More Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Speakers of national assemblies
of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have recommended formation of a joint
committee of the three houses to promote East African Co-operation
(EAC).
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, the recommendation came out of a
one-day meeting of the speakers in Arusha, Northern Tanzania this week
under the framework of EAC.
</P>
<P>
They said the compostion and mandate of the joint committee would
be determined through appropriate consultations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting it was considered pertinent that national
assemblies be closely associated with the process of the expanding
regional co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of the EAC, Francis Muthaura, told reporters
in Arusha on Friday that the meeting discussed how national
parliaments could be associated with the developments in the EAC.
</P>
<P>
He said, the speakers noted that the EAC was consistent with global
trend towards regional, political and economic integration as well as
enhancement of public accountability and pluralism.
</P>
<P>
"They highlighted the need to ensure that public opinion of EAC was
taken into account and in that regard, unanimously stressed the
importance of ensuring that political co-operation was developed
alongside economic co-operation as the two dimensions were
intertwined," Muthaura said.
</P>
<P>
He said that they noted political co-operation was therefore
necessary for sustenance of other aspects of co-operation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The respective speakers who attended the meeting were Pius Msekwa
of Tanzania, Francis Ole Kaparo of Kenya and James Wapakhabulo of
Uganda. enditem

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Achieve Higher Growth Next Year: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will try to
achieve a 9.5 percent GNP growth in 1998, much higher than the 7
percent projected by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the
country, said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today, Socio-economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said that realizing the goal requires
"more efforts to upgrade the country's infrastructure and
implementing policy reform agenda, particularly the comprehensive
tax reform package," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government also needs to continue its economic reforms such
as liberalization, deregulation and procuring more foreign direct
investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Philippines' gross national product (GNP) grew by
6.8 percent and gross domestic product (GDP) by 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its annual economic outlook report released here Thursday,
ADB said that growth in the country's GNP is expected to level off
at 7 percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
But Habito said that the country could achieve a higher growth
rate as the acceleration of the Philippine economy remains in the
uptrend.
</P>
<P>
However, Habito said, the Philippines cannot achieve the status
of the newly industrializing economy (NIE) by the year 2000
because his country's per capita income still falls short of the
2,000 U.S. dollars or above required to become an NIE.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ADB, in its annual report, cited only Hong Kong, South
Korea, Singapore and China's Taipei, as NIEs in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that as of 1996, the Philippines' per capita income
was at 1,200 dollars and the government will try to raise it to
1,400 dollars to 1,500 dollars by 1998 and 1,700 dollars to 1,800
dollars by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Former PAC Leader to Face Second Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) of South Africa is to continue its disciplinary action against
its former president Clarence Makwetu today in Pretoria for three
alleged violations of party's constitution, reported the local daily
Saturday Star.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, who earlier this month was suspended by the PAC's National
Executive Committee (NEC) as party's national chairman and NEC member,
indicated he would attend the hearing at PAC's Pretoria office, a
party spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu is facing three charges relating to allegations that he has
divided the party, created factions, and has violated the PAC's oath
of allegiance which states that a member will accept party leadership.
</P>
<P>
In spite of his absence from the first hearing, the disciplinary
committee went ahead with its inquiry on April 3.
</P>
<P>
PAC insiders said at the time the disciplinary committee had
recommended to the NEC that Makwetu be suspended and given another
opportunity to defend himself, to counter accusations by Makwetu's
supporters that he had not received a fair hearing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu lost the presidency to former Methodist Bishop Stanley
Mogoba at the PAC's national conference in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu's supporters claim that the elections were
unconstitutional and have refused to recognise the party's new
leadership, thus causing an internal strife and rival factions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Australian, New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
hailed the return of Australian and New Zealand ambassadors to
Tehran after "consultations" with their respective governments, an
official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, termed
their return as positive and important in the relations between
Iran and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will consider the move by the two countries in the future
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that by sending their ambassadors back to
Tehran, Australia and New Zealand would separate their interests
from those of the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of Australia, Canada and New Zealand,
non-member states of the European Union (EU), went home last week
for "consultations" in line with EU states after the Berlin court
ruled early this week that top Iranian leaders were involved in the
1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries, except Greece, recalled their ambassadors to
Iran shortly after the Berlin court handed down the verdict on
April 16. Iran rejected the ruling and called its ambassadors back
home in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Canada and New Zealand wasted no time to echo the
EU, an action further outraging Iran.
</P>
<P>
In response to Wellington's move, Tehran had announced that it
would stop buying meat, butter and wool from New Zealand. Iran is
also a substantial importer of Australian wheat and meat.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador Stuart Hume and New Zealand Ambassador
John Hayes flew back to Tehran Friday,according to local press
reports. But they could not be reached for comment so far.

<HEADLINE> Central Nepal Faces Power Shortage This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's capital city and other
parts of central Nepal are facing frequent load shedding this
summer as two hydroelectric stations are set to stop operation
next week, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The electricity authorities have decided to impose load
shedding on a rotatory basis to limit the consumption of
electricity in central Nepal when Kulehkani Project I and Project
II close due to the construction of a new sloping intake, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kulehkani Hydroelectric Project, located some 50 km south
of Kathmandu, is a major power supplier in central Nepal with its
two generating stations totaling over 90 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a new intake tunnel on the reservoir for
Kulehkani project has started earlier with a view to preventing
possible disaster, project officials said.
</P>
<P>
Engineers feared that an old intake on the reservoir would be
clogged in the future as the reservoir has been filled up to a
height of some 28 meters due to soil, sand and stones accumulated
since the project went into operation nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The project will resume power-generating in full capacity late
this summer when the reservoir is filled with rain water of this
year's monsoon season, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal at present has a total installed generating capacity of
nearly 300 megawatts and some 85 percent of the country's 20
million people still have no access to electricity.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) staged a strong recovery at the end
of this trading week but analysts said the rebound should not be
taken as a signal that the bearish sentiment of the past three
weeks was over.
</P>
<P>
For the week just ended, investors on the KLSE went through a
harrowing experience with many having got "their fingers burnt" as
share prices took a severe setback when Wall Street nose-dived on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index slipped 33.78 points to end the week at
1,104.58, the Emas Index eased 11.15 points to 318.25 while the
Industrial Index fell 55.4 points to 2,083.85.
</P>
<P>
Institutions abstained from accumulating shares aggressively as
local economic fundamentals had changed with the implementation of
the National Bank's latest lending curbs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign fund managers were sidelined as the flattering ringgit,
which tumbled close to 200 basis points over the previous week,
did not provide much incentive for them to invest in the bourse.
</P>
<P>
The week saw the listing of two new counters, Rubberex
Corporation (Malaysia) Bhd (Limited) and Seacorp-Schroder
Smallcap Fund Bhd (Limited).
</P>
<P>
Rubberex opened at 7.00 ringgit (about 2.8 U.S. dollars) but
ended the week at 6.85 ringgit (about 2.74 U.S. dollars) while
Seacorp opened below its issue price of 1.00 ringgit (about 40
U.S. cents), at 0.80 ringgit (about 32 U.S. cents) per share, but
managed to end the week higher at 0.92 ringgit (about 36.8 U.S.
cents).
</P>
<P>
Mainboard turnover totaled 1.177 billion shares valued at 7.021
billion ringgit (about 2.8084 billion U.S. dollars) against 1.207
billion shares worth 7.008 billion ringgit (about 2.8032 billion
U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Second board volume totaled 189.277 million shares worth 1.907
billion ringgit (about 762.8 million U.S. dollars) against last
week's 203.042 million shares valued at 2.213 billion ringgit
(about 885.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to a weekly volume of 141.959 million
shares valued at 1.192 billion ringgit (about 476.8 million U.S.
dollars) compared with 235.994 million shares valued at 1.702
billion ringgit (about 680.8 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The top ten active counters this week were Kuala Lumpur
Industries Holdings which fell 30 sen to 3.28 ringgit on a
turnover of 45.244 million shares, Aokam Perdana erased 16 sen to
3.32 ringgit with 43.157 million shares traded, Chase Perdana Bhd
fell 30 sen to 10.20 ringgit (31.768 million shares traded),

shed one sen to 2.80 ringgit (18.374 million shares traded) and
Samanda erased 70 sen to 14.70 ringgit (15.507 million shares
traded).
</P>
<P>
On a sectoral basis, consumer products accounted for 102.416
million shares traded, industrial products 241.169 million shares,
construction 92.688 million shares, trading/services 169.385
million shares, infrastructure 1.941 million shares, finance

million shares, call-warrants 80.013 million shares and closed

</P>
<P>
Analysts said stock market investors should approach the KLSE
with cautious optimism next week.
</P>
<P>
They said if the index can break the next resistance level of
1,175 points, then this could signal the return of an upward trend
and the entry of foreign funds in a big way.

<HEADLINE> Hectic Discussions on in India for New UF Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Efforts for a consensus
successor to outgoing prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda continued all
through the night but a choice remained elusive even after
marathon discussions till this morning among the 13-party United
Front (UF) partners.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Trust of India (PTI), front convener and
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu resumed parleys
early this morning to find out a consensus candidate.
</P>
<P>
Naidu, who has been authorized by the Front Standing Committee
(so-called core group within the Steering Committee) to undertake
an exercise to reach a consensus, told PTI that discussions were
still on and nothing has been finalized so far.
</P>
<P>
Naidu held discussions with Samajwadi party leader and Defense
Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and Tamil Maanila Congress chief G.K.
Moopanar, both considered to be in the race for the top political
post, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Front sources said the crucial meetings of the Standing
Committee and the Steering Committee were yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee, which was expected to meet Friday
night, deferred its sitting in view of the late arrival of the
prime minister and other Front leaders from a funeral held in
Orissa for the deceased veteran leader of Janata Dal, Biju
Patnaik.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed. All the markets were closed Friday following Moslems'
religious festival of sacrifice (Corban).
</P>
<P>
During the week, the CPO physicals market remained volatile
following uncertainties in the market but surged Thursday on some
late pre-weekend short-covering activity.
</P>
<P>
April South gained 20 ringgit (about 8 U.S. dollars) to close
the week at 1,325 ringgit (about 530 U.S. dollars) per ton against
1,305 ringgit (about 522 U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wong, a private forecaster, said during the week that
March's palm oil output was expected to rise 32 percent to
665,000 tons from February production.
</P>
<P>
He estimated end-March stock level at about 725,000 tons
against February revised stock level of 722,993 tons as announced
by the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA).
</P>
<P>
The CPO market is expected to hover around current price levels
next week despite the absence of a clear market direction, a
dealer said, adding prices were not likely to drop next week as
the commodity was still enjoying good demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was also volatile
during the week with prices moving in tandem with the London Metal
Exchange (LME) which moved up and down throughout this week.
</P>
<P>
The metal lost five sen to end the week at 14.05 ringgit (about
5.62 U. S. dollars) per kg following the significant fall in the
price of three-month tin on the LME.
</P>
<P>
Turnover this week eased to 443 tons from 449 tons last week
with local and European buyers accounting for the bulk of
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to experience choppy trading next week
following the uncertainty on the LME, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Malaysian rubber market was bearish and
the poor performance in the Tokyo rubber futures market coupled
with lower advice from regional markets of Thailand and Indonesia
also dampened market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
May International RSS One dipped three sen to close the week at
287.50 sen (about 115 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 fell 4.5 sen
to 270.50 sen (about 108.2 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for April 16 stood at 218.42
Malaysia/Singapore cents (sen) per kg against 221.64 cents (sen)
on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 220.39 cents per kg versus
222.86 cents previously.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to continue its downtrend
next week in the absence of fresh market moving factors and a
clear direction, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The market is currently void of any fundamental developments to
support the bearish market and against this background, players
are expected to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court has
ordered the city authorities to clear the roads of stray cattle in
order to avoid traffic jams and accidents, the Times of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page story, the newspaper said the Delhi High Court
has issued notice to the city government and to various local
bodies on a petition seeking removal of stray cattle and other
animals because they are a traffic hazard.
</P>
<P>
Advocate B.L. Wadehra contended in his petition that thousands
of cows, calves, bulls, pigs and other such animals are let loose
by their owners to roam around the city during the day.
</P>
<P>
These animals, he said, often end up on busy roads, lanes,
parks and markets and cause traffic jams and accidents besides
pillaging fruits and vegetable shops and leading to insanitary
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The petitioner argued that according to local legislation, it
is the statutory duty of the local authorities, including the city
government, to keep the city clear of such wandering animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a new kind of
flying machine that is a hybrid of helicopter and hovercraft.
</P>
<P>
The flying boat was co-developed by the Beihai Township
Enterprises' Inviting Outside Investment Center and the Beihai
Dayang Flying Boat Corporation Ltd. in Beihai, southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The craft, about to take test flights here, will be used as a new
means of marine transportation. Designed on the basis of a sea
plane and hovercraft, it can take off and land on water surface
and flies just 0.5 to 2 meters above it.
</P>
<P>
With a flight speed of 90-200 km per hour, it boasts such
advantages as smooth, stealthy flight, and it does not need an
airport or wharf.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the craft will be used widely in marine
transportation, patrol, and anti-smuggling efforts.

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister Tight Mouthed on Islamic Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano said today that he could not confirm or deny a military
intelligence report leaked to the Italian press about Islamic
terrorist threats against Pope John Paul II, and to major Italian
airports.
</P>
<P>
But he denied attending a security summit on Wednesday night at
which the report was said to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied saying security measures had been
tightened at major international airports in Milan and Rome.
</P>
<P>
Those who spread the alarm could only harm the cause of public
security, Napolitano said. "The threat of terrorism has been there
for some time in Italy, as in other European countries, and
vigilance in the face of any possible threat is permanent and
systematic."
</P>
<P>
The report of the military intelligence agency, Sismi, was
leaked to the Italian news agency Ansa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Islamic terrorists were plotting to
assassinate the Pope. The plot was said to be linked to the
weekend mining of a Sarajevo bridge the Pope was to pass over and
to the diplomatic crisis between the European Union and Iran after
a Berlin court found Iranian officials responsible for ordering
the murders of Kurdish opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Leonardo da Vinci international airport was put
on maximum alert today.
</P>
<P>
Airport sources said security measures have been tightened,
especially for United States and Middle Eastern airlines.

<HEADLINE> Alba Marks European Independence: Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The mission in Albania, codenamed
Operations Alba (Dawn), shows that dawn has come for the European
countries to cast aside the shadow of the United States, and
commit themselves to the European affairs directly, Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Operation Alba signals a brand new start for Italy
and Europe as a whole to shoulder the responsibility of solving
European problems -- without following their powerful ally across
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in the northeastern city of Trieste.
</P>
<P>
Operation Alba is headed by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), with the European Union (EU)
providing humanitarian aid supplies, and a multinational force
guaranteeing the security of the aid delivery.
</P>
<P>
In operations so far, the Italian-led 6,000-strong
multinational force had been sent to the chaotic Balkan country to
secure road and ports for aid delivery.
</P>
<P>
The force comprises troops from seven other countries, France,
Spain, Greece, Romania, Turkey, Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The participation of countries from the Baltic Sea to the
Mediterranean indicated that European nations had all explicitly
realized their duties within the region, Prodi said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's C. America Trip Aims to Consolidate Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton's visit to Central America aims to support the creation of
an Americas free trade area, the U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica,
Peter Jon de Vos, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to arrive here on May 7. He will meet the
presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and
Guatemala, the five Central American countries, and the president
of the Dominican Republic and the Belize prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Central American countries are willing to create a forum to
discuss regional problems with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The summit will focus on economic and commercial issues. The
Central American countries want to substitute the trade benefits
given them by the project of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)
with others granted by international agreements which cannot be
revoked unilaterally by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The CBI was initiated by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as
part of his strategy of war against the Sandinista government of
Nicaragua in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said the Clinton administration sent to
Congress a project directed to extend the benefits of the CBI.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said of most importance to the
U.S. government was the creation of better conditions for private
investments in Central America, and a new strategy to simplify
conditions for private capital.
</P>
<P>
The Central American countries said a free trade agreement
with the United States would guarantee investors more security in
access to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
But "it has not been determined how we are to advance in the
creation of the free trade area," de Vos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides the commercial theme, other proposals
worked out by the presidents of the hemisphere in the summit held
in Miami in December 1994, such as the war against drug
trafficking and terrorism, sustainable development, environmental
protection, democracy and a policy of open skies, would also be
discussed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Five workers of the Aeroperu airline
will be tried to determine the degree of their responsibility in
an airliner accident in October 1996 which killed 70 persons.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutorship of Lima said the five workers are
responsible for the crash of a Boeing 757 on October 2 of 1996 in
the sea off the coast of Chancay, north of Lima.
</P>
<P>
According to the charges filed by the prosecutorship, the
accident was caused by a human error, since the workers did not
retire opportunely the adhesive tapes they had closed the static
ports with, which affected the speedometer and the altimeter of
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutorship also blamed the pilot, who did not execute
the procedure of using the system of auditive alarms nor noticed
the deficiency in the lecture of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
The five workers will be sanctioned with penalties of two to
six years in prison if their responsibilities are
established.

<HEADLINE> Italy Complains About Albanian Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta complained today about setting the date for Albanian
election on June 29, saying it will bring Italy "heavy financial
burden and human risks".
</P>
<P>
Talking with Franz Vranitzky, special envoy for the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
Albania, Andreatta said public opinion in Italy will "not allow us
to keep forces abroad, which involve a heavy financial burden and
human risks."
</P>
<P>
Italy leads a 6,000-strong multinational protection force,
which started spreading out throughout Albania Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the minister admitted that a clearly-fixed date for the
election is essential for international community to pursue its
commitment, "with human and financial resources, to the rebirth of
Albania".
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, also former Austrian Chancellor, pressed the
Albanian political parties in Tirana Thursday to set the June 29
date for emergency parliamentary election aimed at moving this
anarchic country toward stability.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Europe want to help the Albanian people with all
their might and now it's the duty of the Albanians to commit
themselves in that direction," Vranitzky said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the multinational force, contributed by eight
European nations, Andreatta said there will be 3,500 to 4,000
troops deployed in the country by Monday.
</P>
<P>
"About two-thirds of the force will be deployed ahead of
schedule and command headquarters in Tirana will be up and
running," the defense chief added.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Dock Workers on National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Confederation
of Brazilian Dock Workers today declared a 48-hour national port
strike in support for an earlier strike by 24 union workers
demanding for exclusive hiring of union members.
</P>
<P>
Half a month ago 24 dockers went on strike and seized two ships
in Santos, the biggest maritime terminal in the country, to
protest the hiring of non-union workers in that port.
</P>
<P>
It prompted a bigger strike on Monday when 22,000 fellow
workers walked out in Santos port in the southeastern city of Sao
Paulo. On Wednesday police dislodged the 24 dockers from the ships.
</P>
<P>
The union president said the concerted action was aimed to
defend the laws that regulate port operations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Furniture Exports to Grow 4.6 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai furniture exports are
expected to reach 18.2 billion baht (728 million U.S. dollars)
this year, up 4.6 percent from last year, the Thai Commerce
Ministry predicts.
</P>
<P>
However, the department of business economics under the
ministry said Thai furniture exports this year will face fiercer
competition from other countries like China, Indonesia, India and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Thai furniture exports were valued at 17.41 billion baht (696.4
million dollars) last year, edging up only 0.1 percent from 1995
due to the sluggish world market, rising labor costs and a
shortage of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest importer of Thai furniture last year,
taking up 47.5 percent of the total, followed by the United States
with 18.6 percent, the European Union with 12.5 percent, South
Korea with 1.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Jiang Zemin's Visit, Important Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia attaches great importance
to the upcoming visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Moscow,
Deputy Foreign Minister Girgory Karasin said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official told the Itar-Tass news agency "our
relations with China are a permanent priority regardless of our
actions in other sphere."
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is to pay a state visit to Russia
 on April 22-26, during which he will meet Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and sign a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Karasin said the visit is "a very important event" for the
development of the relations between the two countries, noting
that the principle of confident and equal partnership, aimed at
strategic cooperation in the 21st century, is beginning to take
shape.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Russia and China demonstrated a mutual aspiration for
more confidence, showing the world sound trends in international
relations."
</P>
<P>
The trends are "not an enlargement of military blocs, not
expansion," Karasin emphasized, "but, on the contrary, an upgrade
of confidence-building measure."
</P>
<P>
The Russian deputy foreign minister, meanwhile, called as
"nonsense" statements by some politicians who alleged that "we are
developing relations with China because we reportedly are not
getting on well with NATO."
</P>
<P>
Karasin also said that Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin may visit China in the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Prevents Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin province
is taking new measures to prevent forest fire, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 forestry-conservation workers have been
positioned to keep round-the-clock observation of the woods around
the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The province has 7.6 million ha of forest, and so is vulnerable
to big blazes, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
With temperatures getting warmer and dry weather continuing,
local forestry officials are now on red alert and have warned that
fires have broken out in the southeast and northwest areas of the
province. However, they were quickly put out.
</P>
<P>
Research is under way using new technology that may help to
prevent and put out fires in the future.
</P>
<P>
The province has also enforced new regulations, which include
a ban on fires to make picnic lunches.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry will invest 5.4 million yuan to
support the province's forestry fire prevention campaign this
year, up one third over last year.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Heilongjiang province has also redoubled their
efforts to prevent forest fire, according to another source.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in the prevention of major forest fires for
almost ten years since the disastrous fire in northeast China Da
Xinggan Mountain in 1987, which wiped out five percent of
China's total forested area.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Investigate World Cup Bribery Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The soccer's world governing body
said on Friday that it would investigate allegations of bribery in
a World Cup qualifier between Switzerland and Norway.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was unveiled when UEFA investigated Swiss referee
Kurt Roethlisberger for allegedly trying to fix a European
Champions' league match between Grasshopper Zurich and Auxerre.
</P>
<P>
He was suspended for life on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Blick, a Swiss-German tabloid, claimed Roethlisberger offered
to fix the match for the favour of the Swiss at a price of 100,000
Swiss Francs (68,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Blick said the offer was made four days before the World Cup
qualifier in Switzerland, which Norway won 1-0.
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning it was just something between Roethlisberger
and a Swiss newspaper but now, after reviewing the UEFA documents,
it is something FIFA wants to look into since it was a World Cup
match," FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's output of light industry
enjoyed a year-on-year growth of 12 percent in the first two
months of this year, according to latest statistics from the China
National Council of Light Industry.
</P>

The sector completed output of 316 billion yuan-worth during
the period, said the paper, adding that the output of 14 out of 24
major products increased compared with the same months of 1996,
while that of other ten products dropped.

the same period last year, showed the largest growth.
</P>
<P>
Following it were dairy products, soft drinks, washing machines,
sugar and refrigerators.

The daily said that the growth was instigated by the brisk
consumer market during the Spring Festival, which fell in February
this year.

The nation's retail sales increased 16 per cent in the
January-February period reaching 450.2 billion yuan, and sales by

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River Runs Short Of Water At Lower Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Yellow River has run short
of water at its 786-km lower reaches for the twentieth year since
1972, and experts are racking their brains to think of ways to
make it run at full level again.
</P>
<P>
The 5,464-km river, China's second-longest next to the Yangtze
River, is the cradle of the Chinese culture and plays an important
part in the country's national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1990s, conditions in the river worsened. The
period of no water at the lower reaches stretched into 136 days in
1996, and 87 percent of the lower reaches' courses ran short of
water in 1995.
</P>
<P>
More areas along the river are suffering from this, according
to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the time when the river runs short of water at its
lower reaches happened at a much earlier date this year. In the
past it came between April and June, the water-consuming peak
seasons, but this year it occurred on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the situation to increased water use along
the river. By 1995, 122 projects diverting water from the river
were built at its lower reaches, with a total capacity of 4,000
cubic meters per second, far exceeding the river's possible water
supply of 58 billion cm annual runoff.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the river's annual runoff comes between
July and September, while less than 20 percent runs into the river
from April to June. Insufficient water supply has caused nearly
1.4 billion yuan-worth of economic losses over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Areas along the river should give top priority to saving water
and can also make use of groundwater to ease the river's
pressure. Water control projects on the middle reaches are needed
to improve the river's ability of regulating its water flow and
silt, experts suggested.
</P>
<P>
Diverting water from south China into the river is another
option. But the ultimate answer is to develop forestry in the
river valley, in a bid to improve its ecological environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An archeological complex of six Inca
mausoleums has been discovered in north Peru, a cultural institute
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Culture (INC) said that the
mausoleums were discovered by the institute's technicians in a
place called "Laguna de los Condores" (Lagoon of the Condors),
9,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
It is the most important archeological discovery in past
decades in this part of the country, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
The site, which has architectonic characteristics of the
Chachapoyas Culture and is decorated with cave paintings, rendered
almost a hundred funerary bundles, fine weavings, ceramics, wood
carvings, crowns, and diverse objects of a great archeological
value.
</P>
<P>
Experts also determined that the zone of the discovery suffered
depredatory activity. To determine the exact magnitude of this
damage the technicians recorded the plundered areas in photographs
and videos.
</P>
<P>
The INC said it has coordinated with the provincial procurator
of Chachapoyas and national police an operation to rescue missing
pieces.

<HEADLINE> Poland Calls for Equal Membership in NATO, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Polish President Alexander
Kwasniewski said here today that after the planned enlargement of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union
(EU), the new members should enjoy equal status with the old ones.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Saint Augustin
near Bonn, Kwasniewski said Poland's membership in the EU and NATO
was not its final goal, but only "the beginning of a new European
policy of Poland".
</P>
<P>
Poland would step up its European activities after joining the
two major Western organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, who is on a two-day visit to Germany, met with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kohl assured Kwasniewski that there would be "no membership of
less quality" after the NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the quick integration of Poland in the EU and the
NATO was an important goal of German foreign policy. Meanwhile he
also encouraged Poland to carry on its reforms consistently so as
to achieve the prerequisite of such an integration on its own.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Kinkel and Kwasniewski, both sides
agreed that the processes of the EU and NATO enlargement should
not create new rifts or security grey zones in Europe. Especially
Russia should be equally incorporated into the new European-wide
security architecture, they stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two world records fell on the
second day of the World Short-Course Championships in Gothenburg
on Friday, with Australians smashing the men's 800 meters
freestyle relay and Claudia Poll of Costa Rica beating her own
world record in the 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The Australian team of Michael Klim, Grant Hackett, William
Kirby and Matthew Dunn clocked 7:02.74, slicing more than two
seconds off the 11-year-old mark of 7:05.17.
</P>
<P>
Although Klim got a slow start and trailed Sweden's Anders
Lybring at the first 50m split, he surged back in the second 50
and the Australians never looked back. Sweden ended up with silver
and Britain was third.
</P>
<P>
Poll's 1:54.17 shattered the 1:55.42 record she set at the last
short-course championships two years ago in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Nian Yun of China took the silver behind Poll and Slovakia's
Martina Moravcova was third.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Voelker of Germany was denied a gold double after being
disqualified for staying underwater past the 15m mark in the 100m
backstroke. She had touched home first.
</P>
<P>
She opened Friday's finals with a 24.70 victory in the 50m
freestyle, beating America's Jennifer Thompson who touched home
first in the 100m freestyle the day before.
</P>
<P>
The duo of Thompson and Voelker ended Le Jingyi's freestyle
reign. Le, of China, who had won the 50m and 100m events at
previous two short-course championships, placed third in both.
</P>
<P>
China's Lu Donghua and Chen Yan took the gold and silver after
Voelker's disqualification and American Misty Hyman moved up to
third.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Patrik Isaksson, who had placed only seventh in the
preliminaries, won the men's 100m breaststroke before a boisterous
home crowd. She sped through the finals in 59.99.
</P>
<P>
Kristy Ellem of Australia won the women's 200m breaststroke in
2:22.68 and compatriot Natasha Bowron won the 800-meter freestyle
in 8:26.45. Cuba's Neisser Bent took the gold in the men's 200m
backstroke with 1:54.21.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Uzbekistan have agreed
to promote energy cooperation, the Ukrainian-Uzbek Joint Committee
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, before July 1, will sign an agreement which
will allow Uzbekistan to sell Ukraine natural gas from 1997 to
2005, said the committee.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee closed its first session today as Uzbek
Prime Minister Utkur Sultanov ended his two-day visit to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The committee also discussed the possibility to transport
Turkmen oil to Ukraine through Uzbek territories.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan will become an important oil source for Ukraine
when Ukraine begins to seek other energy partners rather than
Russia. At present, about 70 percent of Ukraine's energy is
imported from Russia, which has been considered an obstacle to
Ukraine's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Uzbekistan have also agreed on an oil-for-medical
equipment deal. This provides for Ukraine to send to Uzbekistan
medical equipment worth 30 million dollars in exchange for
Uzbekistan diesel fuel.

Chinese community leaders from southern California told a press
conference that the gathering will take place on June 28 in
Weingart Stadium of Los Angeles Jr. College, which can hold 20,000
people.

(provided by Nato troops)...to begin to build their country and
build their society, and begin the long process of
reconciliation".

LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Seven London youths were sentenced
today to 10 to 12 years imprisonment each for raping an Austrian
tourist and then trying to drown her in a canal.

"This case of rape is as horrifying and revolting as any could
be," judge Sir Lawrence Verney said before sentencing the gang
members, aged from 14 to 17.
</P>

An eighth member of the gang, the 14-year-old ring leader, will

<HEADLINE> Former Security Advisors Urge Easing of Sanctions  on Iran, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two former U.S. national
security advisors today urged the Clinton administration to ease
economic sanctions against Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
upon the occasion of an article to be published in the journal
Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft told a
news briefing that the current U.S. policy toward the two
countries "lacks strategic viability and carries a high financial
and diplomatic cost."
</P>
<P>
They said the Clinton administration was hurting long-term U.S.
interests in securing energy from Central Asia by discouraging
pipeline routes through Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should do nothing to preclude Central Asia's
eventual emergence, nor stand in the way of deals that might
facilitate it," their article said.
</P>
<P>
As regards to Iraq, the article said that if ongoing Iraqi oil
sales for food and medicine work, the United States should
consider allowing even more sales for humanitarian needs. If not,
the fraying international coalition against President Saddam
Hussein would collapse out of concern for innocent Iraqi people
who have been deprived under global economic sanctions over six
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
"America may have to consider modifying certain aspects of
Iraq's economic containment to keep its military strait-jacket
securely fastened," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The two former national security advisors suggested that the
Clinton administration adjust its policy, in consultation with
regional leaders, to give Iran and Iraq incentives to change
instead of just punishing them.
</P>
<P>
They said, however, the United States must also be ready to
take military action when necessary.

Convention, saying that a failure would put the United States "in

<P>
The Senate agreed Thursday to schedule a vote on April 24 on

<P>
Welcoming the agreement, Clinton told a press conference that
he is "encouraged by the great progress", but he warned that
"hurdles" still exist in gaining the approval of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that agreement has been reached in the Senate on
28 conditions that will be included in the treaty's resolution of
ratification, but he added that there are still "a handful of
issues on which we fundamentally disagree."
</P>
<P>
"A vote for any of these killer amendments will prevent our
participation in the treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the convention ask for amendments to the
verification provisions of the treaty and demand that the U.S. not
participate in the treaty until Russia, Iraq and Libya join it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that his country should lead in implementing the
convention. "We must lead in bringing this bipartisan treaty to
life and enforcing its rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to ratify, other countries could back out as well.
We won't be able to enforce the treaty's rules or use its tools,
and our companies will face trade sanctions aimed at countries that
refuse to join," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I urge every member of the Senate to support the convention
when it comes to a vote next week," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which bans development, production, stockpiling,
transferring and use of chemical weapons, was signed in January
1993. Ratified by more than 70 countries up to now, the treaty
will take effect on April 29.
