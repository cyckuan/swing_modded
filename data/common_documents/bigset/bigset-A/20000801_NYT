EDITORIAL OBSERVER: GHOSTS OF CONVENTIONS PAST IN PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they opened their four-day festival of benevolence in
Philadelphia, Republicans of all stripes seemed convinced that Gov.
George W. Bush's election was a sure thing in November. Yet the
best possible reminder of the perils of optimism lay only a couple
miles west of the First Union Center at an abandoned convention
hall on the other side of the Schuylkill River.
</P>
<P>
   It was there in Philadelphia's massive old Municipal Auditorium
that Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York captured the 1948 Republican
presidential nomination, with similarly high expectations. Indeed,
Meyer Berger reported in The New York Times that the delegates were
attending ``the richest, the noisiest, the most exuberant
quadrennial Republican meeting'' since losing the White House to
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a month later in the same auditorium, President
Harry Truman was given the Democratic nomination at a convention
that Berger likened to a wake. The stifling heat did more than wilt
emotions. When some ``doves of peace'' hidden inside a flowered
liberty bell were released to signal Truman's arrival, several
turned out to have died, while others menaced the delegates as
Chairman Sam Rayburn shouted over the radio, ``Get those
(expletive) pigeons out of here!'' It was considered just another
bad omen for the party.
</P>
<P>
   For 52 years, of course, every underdog presidential candidate
has compared himself to Truman, who defied expectations and won in
November. But since 1948 was the last time Philadelphia played host
to a national convention _ indeed three national conventions,
including that of the Progressive Party of Henry Wallace _ echoes
from that year seem particularly acute this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new book, ``The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman
Won the 1948 Election,'' Philadelphia was chosen as the convention
site because it sat in the center of a coaxial transmission belt
enabling television to be transmitted to 500,000 sets from Richmond
to Boston. In all, writes the author Zachary Karabell, 10 million
viewers watched the conventions in the new medium. Democrats
learned from mistakes by the Republicans and shortened their
proceedings for viewers, launching a trend culminating in both
parties tailoring their entire conventions for an audience that
still may reach 100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The substance also reflects how much, and how little, has
changed in 52 years. Dewey's capture of the Republican nomination
came at the height of the hegemony of the party's so-called liberal
Eastern establishment. By the 1960s, control of the party shifted
south, along with the Bush family. George Bush moved to Texas out
of the shadow of his father, Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut, but
he was always seen as a son of that establishment. Now Governor
Bush, like his father, proclaims himself a man of the Sunbelt, but
acts like an internationalist in the Dewey-Eisenhower tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pigeon problem, Truman went on to give a great
acceptance speech in Philadelphia that launched his historic
come-from-behind victory. What is striking about it is how little
the issues have changed. Truman outlined them as Social Security,
education, health, the minimum wage and avoiding tax cuts for the
rich in order to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman style will be hard to replicate, however. Like Vice
President Al Gore in this year's campaign, Truman bragged endlessly
on how prosperous farmers and workers had become under the
Democrats. But somehow it is hard to imagine Gore issuing Truman's
salty warning to both that ``they are the most ungrateful people in
the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of their sweltering convention, drenched and wilted
Republicans left town convinced they had a winner but feeling
somehow uninspired. Dewey, said the Nation magazine, was ``the
nominee nobody loves.'' This year, judging from the reaction of
delegates in Philadelphia, that is one thing that is strikingly
different. But of course Governor Bush is beloved most of all
because he looks like a sure winner. From the delegates'
perspective, the presumptive nominee's strategy of staging a
streamlined convention with plenty of uplifting talk and pictures
of a more diverse Republican Party looks like a winner, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in the padlocked auditorium across the river, there may be a
few ghosts who remember the lesson of 1948. Dewey regarded the
convention as the culmination of his effort, rather than as a mere
beginning, leaving himself vulnerable to a pugnacious Democrat who
refused to believe the polls. &QL;

MILLER NEEDS PLENTY OF WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's completely inappropriate to make any sort of
judgment on Dennis Miller's future as a ``Monday Night Football''
broadcaster based on one rag-tag exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   The most erratic performance: Pick 'em, the play on the field,
the rhythm in the booth or the technical work behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   But if a demanding public needs instant Miller criticism, here
it is: This is gonna take a buncha top-grade, heavy-duty sandpaper
to smooth out, because saying this broadcast has some rough edges
is a gross understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller might only be part of the reclamation project, but he'll
unfortunately get the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 49ers-Patriots Hall of Fame telecast began by milking
Miller's arrival for all it was worth, as Al Michaels introduced
the wise-cracking comedian last among the four new on-camera folk,
starting with Eric Dickerson, Dan Fouts and Melissa Stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I've been apart of 'Monday Night Football' for 14 years
and I have come to expect the unexpected . . . but this is off the
charts,'' said Michaels, as if news of the decision was made public
just yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was anyone in the stadium more pumped up than me, he
wouldn't pass the league's standardized drug test, all right,'' was
Miller's first quip, as he wore a light-blue necktie already
loosened around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my personal approach to the game, well, I know a lot
of you people are thinking I won't take this seriously, but I just
want you to know, it is a game, but it's a game many of you take
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Vatican, but then again the Pope doesn't
have to go across the middle on guys like Ronnie Lott very
frequently. I'll do my best, I'll study hard, let's tee it up and
have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, Michaels allowed Miller into the
broadcast, asking who he thought would be the successor as New
England's running back.
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller the broadcaster: ``Well, the 'X' factor there is
J.R. Redmond, Al, the rookie out of Arizona State. He's not here
tonight. He had some minor groin surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the real Miller kicked in: ``I'm not sure if there is such
a thing as minor groin surgery. Anybody has a sharp implement
around genitalia, I'm thinking it's major, but maybe that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Offended yet?
</P>
<P>
   Miller's muffs were more frequent than the success of the
one-liners he tried to pull off. He stepped on Michaels a few
times, another time on a referee's call and even referred to Fouts
as ``Don'' or ``Donnie'' before settling on ``Dano.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Miller threw out a stat that Drew Bledsoe
was ``sacked 55 times last night,'' then came back after a few
commercials to say ``by the way, he was sacked 56 times last
night.'' Midway through the second quarter, he finally cleared it
up _ he meant ``last season.''
</P>
<P>
   And that immediately exposed a problem: When he's making a
serious point, you're waiting for a punch line. When it doesn't
come, you're left trying to recall and decipher what he just said
and how it pertains to the preceding play.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller finally just started diving in at whatever moment he
saw fit like someone invited to a party specifically to liven
things up, his comments sounded more like a guest announcer at the
Rose Parade. Too often, he was left marveling at the number of
chrysanthemums it took to construct the basset hound's rear end on
the city of Arcadia float.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Miller's other riffs, though, were direct hits:
</P>
<P>
   On 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia: ``He's the Canadian league
import with the Mexican-sounding name . . . the NAFTA quarterback.
And believe me, they'll feel free to trade him if he doesn't pan
out this year.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Michaels promo for ABC's political convention coverage:
``Republicans and Democrats: There's a couple of 4-12 teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the Patriots finished off a 20-0 win with about a 1
minutes left, Miller stretched to come up with a Don Meredith-like
clincher-quip and said he wracked his brain before he came up with:
``Start blow dryin' Teddy Koppel's hair, 'cause this one's over.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Michaels laughed.
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, he probably summed up his feelings right before the
half when talking about the scrambling job by Patriots backup
quarterback Michael Bishop: ``You can see Bishop's agility, but he
must feel somewhat like I do right now _ things are coming fast and
furious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Toto, we aren't in a studio in North Hollywood anymore,
are we?'' answered Michaels, referring to the place the last few
weeks where they did practice games.
</P>
<P>
   And where they'll quickly return as soon as this morning. 'Cause
the novelty is definitely over.

RICE, LAKERS ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From San Antonio to Indiana, from the Mile-High
City to the Magic Kingdom, a cacophony of cash registers will ring,
ding and ka-ching for some of the NBA's top free agents today. But
in Miami, Glen Rice hears only the sound of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's free-agent signing season opened just after midnight
EDT. And over the next few days, Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Jalen
Rose are expected to sign multiyear, multimillion-dollar contracts
with the Spurs, Magic and Pacers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice, the Lakers' shooting specialist, is no more certain
about his future now than he was July 1, when he officially became
a free agent 11 days after winning his first NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The phone isn't ringing. The Lakers aren't calling. Rice's
patience is waning.
</P>
<P>
   Will he stay with the reigning champions? Return to Charlotte in
a rumored sign-and-trade deal? Sign with the Chicago Bulls
outright? Not even Rice can say for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from the Lakers, so I don't know what's going
on,'' Rice said Monday by phone from Miami. ``I've been through
this situation before, not knowing where I'm gonna be. It seems
like it's been that way ever since I've been with the Lakers. It's
nothing new. I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many things remain uncertain with the Lakers,
including the state of their entire front office. Executive vice
president Jerry West, expected to announce his retirement any day
now, is keeping a low profile; other Lakers officials are
consenting to interviews only on the condition that West's status
is not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they quietly work to improve a roster in desperate
need of frontcourt muscle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, who have yet to make a decision on Rice, are
also unlikely to make any immediate splash in free agency. They
have salary-cap exceptions for $2.25 million and $1.2 million
available and hope to land a starting power forward, but no deals
are imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is there will be a flurry of activity (today),''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``I think it's unlikely we'll
be involved (today), although not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, that mission could lead back to Rice. After two
sometimes-lackluster, sometimes-strained seasons with the Lakers,
Rice seems destined to change addresses once more. The latest
rumors have him signing with the Bulls or returning to the Hornets,
who dealt him to L.A. in March 1999 for Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte now reportedly is set to trade Jones and others to
Miami, in exchange for a package that includes power forward P.J.
Brown. The Hornets could in turn send Brown to the Lakers for Rice,
who would have to sign a new contract first.
</P>
<P>
   Rice simply laughed at all the speculation but said, ``I haven't
ruled out anything. It's all up to them (the Lakers), you know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a feel right now'' about what will happen. ``I'm
just chillin'. . . . I'll play wherever, as long as I'm playing
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak said the Lakers have been in contact with
representatives for Rice but said, ``I don't really have anything
concrete to pass on regarding Glen. It's something we're still
trying to figure out the best way to handle it for Glen and for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can't re-sign or sign-and-trade Rice, the Lakers are
prepared to let him walk away without their getting compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers have picked up a one-year option to retain
veteran guard Ron Harper and plan to re-sign free-agent guard Brian
Shaw. They also expect to sign second-round draft pick Cory
Hightower soon, which will bring the total number of players under
contract to 12.
</P>
<P>
   As for reinforcements in the frontcourt, Kupchak has no firm
timeline for sealing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we'd like to address our business as soon as
possible, in a timely fashion, but if it takes a week or two weeks
or a month, that's what it takes,'' he said. ``We find it's always
best to take care of our business as soon as possible.''

 McCAIN AS UBIQUITOUS AS BUNTING AT GOP CONVENTION 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Today will be Day 2 of the Sen. John McCain
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With nobody here yet to shush him _ though Laura Bush might try
_ McCain has been talking on every street corner and shaking hands
at every Philly cheese steak stand, leaving no microphone silent as
he campaigns for Most Popular Ex-Candidate at the Republicans'
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he's giving the keynote speech in prime time
after ``Judging Amy.'' Monday night, he opined on ``Larry King
Live.'' All last weekend and all week, he has been tailed by
gaggles of reporters hanging on his every word, except when the
words are ``George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush doesn't get here soon, McCain may start moving in with
Laura. He's already making big-time moves on the Republican
nomination in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, everybody here is desperate to see a presidential
candidate. On Sunday night, 600 wavering Republican delegates and
even 10 members of Congress turned out to toast the arrival of a
widely promoted third-party candidate, Captain Morgan of the
Seagram Co.'s Rum Loyalists' Party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's the only politician who outdrew McCain. However,
the Republicans may have been attracted by the unfulfilled promise
of an appearance by Playboy ``playmate'' and vice presidential
candidate Kalin Olson (Miss August 1997) of Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of playmates, McCain still attracted 70
reporters to ride along as he made his grand entrance to
Philadelphia aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus from
Arlington, Va., with three more buses in the caravan.
</P>
<P>
   He was starring on ``Face the Nation'' on Sunday. He was
autographing his book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' at the Bourse
building. He was welcoming his former delegates in a teary-eyed
televised farewell at the Hotel Sofitel.
</P>
<P>
   He even spoke at a ``shadow'' counter-convention for college-age
folks at the University of Pennsylvania. The audience of several
hundred kids, described as laden with nose rings and tattoos,
clapped and chanted his name _ turning hostile only when McCain
said Bush ``is the candidate who offers change.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he starred in an MTV special from the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I'm amazed that he wasn't at City Hall for the assembly of the
World's Largest Hoagie.
</P>
<P>
   They could have used the bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Once, McCain called Bush a ``Pat Robertson Republican'' and said
the governor's knowledge of foreign affairs consisted of trips to
the International House of Pancakes. Now, he compliments Bush's
``inclusive'' campaign, and he had better brag on Bush for at least
several sentences Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He joked to the ``New York Post'' that he was watching out for a
``grenade from Texas.'' He added, ``Seriously, I believe Governor
Bush sees this in a positive light.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush saw McCain in a positive light, the senator would be on
the ticket, not Dick Cheney. That brings to mind last week's
attempt by McCain to upstage Bush, when his friends floated the
rumor that he ``might'' accept the second spot on the ticket when
no such deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the omnipresent McCain popped up hosting a blue-ribbon
panel discussion on foreign affairs. For a discussion featuring six
former secretaries of state, reporters walked into the Philadelphia
Convention Center media room asking anxiously, ``Where's the McCain
speech?'' ``Did I miss McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single nose ring was in sight as he joked, ``Since I've
withdrawn from the campaign, my reception is getting warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this keeps up, I'm going to demand a recount.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether to take McCain seriously. Or Captain
Morgan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican Party put on its newly moderate
and disciplined face at the opening of its national convention
Monday as one of the party's most compelling figures, Colin L.
Powell, challenged delegates to rally behind Gov. George W. Bush
with a genuine commitment to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the party's last convention in San Diego four years ago,
Powell appealed for inclusiveness and spoke of his support for
affirmative action and abortion rights. On Monday night, he
repeated much of his rallying cry for inclusion _ but dropped any
reference to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must follow Governor Bush's lead and reach out to
minority communities and particularly the African-American
community _ and not just during an election-year campaign,'' Powell
said pointedly in his remarks to the convention. ``It must be a
sustained effort. It must be every day. It must be for real.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not spare the party for its record on affirmative action,
there was ``cynicism in the black community'' because ``some in our
party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative
action that helped a few thousands black kids get an education.''
But, he added, ``hardly a whimper is heard from them over
affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes
with preferences for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The address by Powell, and a warm testimonial by Bush's wife,
Laura, about education and her husband's values, formed the
centerpiece Monday night of a tightly and painstakingly
choreographed presentation by the Bush campaign and by the
Republican Party that was aimed far beyond the First Union Center.
It was intended to persuade the public at large _ particularly
women, independents and even Democrats _ that their rightful place
was in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to put blacks out front on Monday night was especially
striking, and persistent, and included everything from the lineup
of entertainers to the choice of Powell as the keynote speaker.
There was a live remote of a black preacher from a gospel church in
South Philadelphia, followed by a performance of a gospel choir on
stage in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a particularly sharp contrast with the audience
because only 4 percent of convention delegates identify themselves
as black, according to a survey by The New York Times and CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, it was not so much a matter of reaching out
for the black vote, but part of Bush's determination to portray his
party as tolerant and inclusive, in hopes of appealing to
independents and moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This image of a remade Republican Party on stage was also
unlikely given that many delegates seemed stirred by two famous
faces of the past in the audience: Bush's mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush campaign decreed there would be no searing swipes
at Democrats, Mrs. Bush, in describing her husband, confined
herself to an implict comparison with Bill Clinton and Al Gore,
whom the campaign often portrays as obsessed by bald political
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``His core principles will not change with the winds of polls or
politics or fame or fortune or misfortune,'' Mrs. Bush said of her
husband. ``I know because I've known him through big legislative
successes and a few defeats. I sat by his side during some winning
and many losing baseball seasons. But George never loses sight of
home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the testimonial to her husband of 22 years, she went on: ``He
shares credit and doesn't cast blame. He sets a tone that's
positive and constructive, a tone that is very different from the
bitterness and division that too often characterizes Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Her best received line was when she declared that people come up
to her and say, ``I want my son or daughter to respect the
president of the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, a former teacher and librarian, extolled her
husband's commitment to education and literacy. And she said he was
devoted to Head Start, a subject upon which the Republican ticket
has become suddenly vulnerable because of votes cast against it by
Dick Cheney, the vice-presidential candidate, when he was a
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As first lady, I will make early childhood development one of
my priorities,'' she said, ``and George will strengthen Head Start
to make sure it's an early reading and early learning program.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was still wending his way eastward to Philadelphia as
part of a six-day tour of swing states, he dominated the convention
on Monday. In a play on his nickname _ and an appeal to women _ the
letter ``W'' was emblazoned big and red on signs throughout the
arena. Underneath, in smaller letters, were the words, ``Stands for
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush was not entirely absent. Shortly after his wife's
speech, he paid a surprise visit to the convention via satellite,
from Westerville, Ohio, where he spoke from a classroom. Appearing
on a giant screen in the hall, he offered raves for his wife's
speech, and said, ``I can't wait to stand before you on Thursday
night and tell America how I want to use these good times for great
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he introduced Powell with a tantalizing hint that he would
appoint him to serve in a Bush administration, declaring, ``I hope
his greatest service to America still lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   While Powell has been mentioned as a possible secretary of
state, it was notable that Bush made those comments from a
classroom and that in his speech Powell talked only about domestic
issues. That may be, of course, that education was the dominant
theme Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, were far more partisan than four years ago, when he had
recently revealed that he was a Republican. When he addressed the
Republican convention four years ago, he also spoke of compassion
and people in need. But in that speech, he reminded delegates of
his support for abortion rights and while he saluted Bob Dole as a
war hero, he was much more effusive this year about Bush. People
close to Powell insisted they were not pressured into excising any
reference to abortion; they said the general felt it simply did not
fit the theme of the night: ``Opportunity With a Purpose. Leave No
Child Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush appeared before the NAACP earlier this month, Powell
said, it was not mere window dressing. He quoted Bush's declaration
that ``the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of
Lincoln.'' And he said he spoke with Bush today and that ``he wants
the Republican Party to wear that mantle again. But he knows that
it will take hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   But the effort by Powell to avoid saying anything that could
stoke unrest among the approximately 22,000 people who crammed into
the hall _ including 2,066 delegates and 2,066 alternates _
underscored the degree to which Republicans are united behind Bush
in their determination to win back the White House. The program ran
with such tight-fistedness that at one point it was 20 minutes
ahead of the minute-by-minute schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Powell focused on Bush's achievements in Texas;
he emphasized the ``compassion'' in the governor's ``compassionate
conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all Texans _
white, black, Latino, Asian, native American,'' he said. ``He has
been successful in bringing more and more minorities into the tent
by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it compassionate
conservatism. To me, it's just about caring about people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37th Republican convention opened when Erik Weihenmayer, a
blind mountain climber, led the delegates in the Pledge of
Allegiance. Throughout the day, a parade of women, blacks, Latinos
and recovered Democrats marched to the rostrum in a show that more
resembled an Up With People jamboree than a hard-driving,
calculated effort to retake the White House. Despite the
understated references to the current administration, the words
Clinton, abortion and impeachment appeared to have been banished
from the scripts today. Even Newt Gingrich was far removed from the
action; his role Monday night was as a commentator for Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   That left those tuning in on television with a buffed view of
the Republican Party _ and Bush _ far more moderate than the
delegates in the hall who voted Monday for a platform that hewed to
some fiercely conservative tenets, like the party's call for a ban
on abortion. With the usual internecine maneuvering largely absent,
and Cheney already selected as the running mate, there was little
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   That was reflected in the lack of enthusiasm in a roll call to
make Bush's nomination official _ the party's first three-day
rolling roll call _ that drew only the most perfunctory rounds of
cheers by delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said he did not believe
there was a contradiction between the moderate, inclusive message
Monday night and the fact that polls of the delegates show that
they are notably conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a gap between what Republicans believe
and what their candidate does,'' said Rove, in an interview on
``Political Points,'' The New York Times/ABC News webcast.
``Otherwise, they wouldn't have nominated him. And let me correct.
You said inclusive and moderate. What we're saying is it's
inclusive and compassionately conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the stage-managing, convention organizers had an
easy job because delegate after delegate said the party had not
been so unified since 1984, when Ronald Reagan cruised to a second
term. On the opening night of that convention, in Detroit,
Republicans bashed Walter F. Mondale relentlessly. But tonight,
party officials expressed such confidence with Mr. Bush's
positioning that they said they felt they could go easy on Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a convention that could be more
unified,'' Butch Davis, a delegate from Houston, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the party held its 37th convention here
this week, the first Republican gathering in Philadelphia since
Thomas E. Dewey won the nomination in 1948. The party this year was
determined to underscore its commitment to a state that is not
reliably Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the effort to portray Bush as a leader who could
work across party lines, his name was placed in nomination by his
lieutenant governor, Rick Perry. Perry told reporters that Bush
helped convinced him to defect from the Democratic to the
Republican party more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proudly place the name of the current governor of the great
state of Texas and the next president of the United States into
nomination, George W. Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While cable networks and web sites covered the evening's events
extenstively, coverage on the big three broadcast networks was
fleeting and confined to the 10 o'clock hour at best. Only ABC
covered any part of Mrs. Bush's address; while CBS and ABC covered
Powell's speech virtually in its entirety. NBC relegated its prime
time coverage to MSNBC, its cable sister.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking from tradition, the Republicans abandoned their
traditional one-night roll calls of states _ which officials said
has become too interminable for a single sitting of prime time
television _ and Monday night began a rolling state-by-state tally
that will be spread over three nights. The party was careful to
juggle which states cast its votes so that Bush would not be
officially nominated before Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the roll call came to Arizona, the spokesperson for the
delegation was not that state's senior senator, John McCain, Bush's
most ardent foe in the primaries, but his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father and mother strode into the hall at 8:40 p.m. Their
arrival was not announced. But as delegates began catching sight of
these most famous of Republicans, they rose to their feet and a
swell of applause came from the floor. When they were formally
announced moments later, they were greeted with a 30-second
standing ovation and chants of ``Bush! Bush! Bush!''

DISPUTES WESTERN RESOURCES AND PROTECTION ONE EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's staff is alleging that
Western Resources Inc. and its Protection One subsidiary have had
``improperly inflated'' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC staff said it was specifically concerned that some
aspects of Protection One's accounting could indicate
``manipulative intent.'' The matter was being referred to the
federal agency's enforcement division to consider further action.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, disclosed by Western Resources in a filing with
the SEC late Friday, sent the company's stock down 81 cents Monday
to $15.81. Protection One lost 25 cents, closing at $2.
</P>
<P>
   Western Resources and Protection One said the accounting methods
used were proper. They said their position is supported by their
independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to strongly disagree with the position of the
(SEC) staff,'' said Robin Lampe, a spokeswoman for Protection One
in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Protection One in a July 25 letter to the SEC requested a
meeting with more-senior members of the SEC staff to discuss the
allegations. The SEC agreed to have a meeting, but Lampe said a
date had not been set.
</P>
<P>
   There were no estimates on how past financial results could be
affected at Western and Protection One if they are changed to meet
the SEC staff's concern, although they would have a ``material
adverse effect,'' according to Western's filing with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Western owns 85 percent of Protection One, which is a
monitored-security company. Financial problems at Protection One
were a key reason for Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.'s decision in
January to terminate a merger with Western.
</P>
<P>
   Protection One had previously changed its accounting procedures
to satisfy SEC concerns over how Protection One was accounting for
acquisitions. That apparently did not fully satisfy the SEC staff.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent concerns stated by the staff was the accounting
for the acquisition of Westinghouse Security Systems in 1997,
including the valuation of Westinghouse's monitoring software.
Other SEC concerns about Protection One include the accounting for
unexpected customer attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC concerns about Protection One's accounting come as
Western Resources seeks to sell its utilities, KPL and KGE. Critics
and observers of the company say it will be important to examine
any proposed sale to ensure that Protection One's problems aren't
shouldered by Western's utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   One fear is that the utilities will be sold with more debt to
try to salvage what remains of Western Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of cross-subsidization is a concern,'' said Walker
Hendrix, counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board,
Missouri's watchdog for utility customers.

BUSH'S CONGENIALITY AND LIMITED FOCUS ARE STRENGTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George W. Bush's most valuable assets as
president could be his winning personality and ability to focus on
a specific agenda, political experts said at a seminar Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's use of those skills could be hampered by a Congress
bogged down in gridlock. As governor of Texas, Bush encountered a
far more congenial Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can export the Texas model to Washington
and have it work,'' said Dan Balz, a political reporter for The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar on Bush's governing style was sponsored by the
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a
conservative Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   With Balz on a panel were Republican Texas state Sen. Teel
Bivins; C. Boyden Gray, a longtime legal adviser to former
President Bush; Princeton University political scientist Fred
Greenstein; Republican Gov. Mike Johanns of Nebraska; and Dave
McNeely, political columnist at the Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will work to develop good relations with Congress, several
panel members said. He made a point of sitting down with 175 of the
Texas Legislature's 181 members in the weeks after he became
governor.
</P>
<P>
   McNeely recalled how Bush invited the state Supreme Court to an
early get-acquainted meeting. One justice said he had tried for
four years to get former Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, to do the
same thing. She never did.
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to like him is Bush's strong suit, Bivins said.
``Once you do that, it's a lot easier to get people to do your
bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Because bills in Texas require two-thirds support for passage,
getting along with members of the opposite party is crucial,
McNeely said. Bush also was aided by a mentor of sorts, and a
Democratic one at that _ former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a longtime
Texas political power.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush can find a similar friend among Washington
Democrats remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Bush would have been as successful in Texas if
not for that relationship with Bullock,'' Balz said.
</P>
<P>
   Also important for Bush could be his limited, but focused
agenda. So far, that agenda includes reforming Social Security,
cutting taxes and implementing a national missile-defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to go right down that list...and convince people
those are the important issues that must be addressed,'' Johanns
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Bush resembles former President Ronald Reagan,
who also found success with a finite list of issues. But Reagan had
one asset that Bush does not _ an unmatched ability to communicate
with the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man clearly is not a silver-tongued orator,'' Greenstein
said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters pointed to two other assets of the Texas
governor: A loyal staff that has stuck with him for years, and a
sense that his ego is not as tied into governing as President
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Greenstein said, ``is not as emotionally invested into
making it onto Mount Rushmore.''

DAVIS FUND RAISING NOW TOPS $21 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis has raised nearly $21.4 million
since taking office in January 1999 _ more than four times what his
GOP predecessor did in his first 18 months in office.
<P>
   From January through June 30 of this year, the Democratic
governor raked in $8.1 million in contributions _ an average of
more than $1.3 million a month, according to a campaign disclosure
statement filed yesterday with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing OK,'' said Garry South, Davis' chief political
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' relentless fund raising has been blamed by critics for
his slow pace in naming gubernatorial appointees and creating the
appearance that his administration caters to generous donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those so-called good government groups have said the same
thing before, and I'm sure they'll say it again,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is Gray Davis had more money spent against him in
the 1998 gubernatorial election than any candidate running for
office in the history of the United States of America. Believe me,
that makes an impression on you,'' said South.
</P>
<P>
   During his first 18 months in office, Pete Wilson, Davis'
Republican predecessor, raised $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had $60 million spent against him,'' said South,
referring to the amount that Davis' primary and general election
opponents spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No other elected official came close to Davis in fund raising,
although Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco,
reported raising nearly $2.3 million for the two campaign
committees he controls.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, raised nearly $1.4
million in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders of their houses, Burton and Hertzberg bear the prime
responsibility for raising money to pay for this fall's legislative
races.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest initiative fight this fall is over Proposition 38
which would give parents $4,000 in state money that can be used to
help pay for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the initiative banked nearly $1.8 million in the
first six months of this year. Of that, $1.6 million came in loans
from the Timothy Draper Living Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, is the main backer
of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by the powerful California Teachers Association,
reported raising $1.1 million. The CTA contributed $250,000 as did
the California Federation of Teachers and the California School
Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer raised $883,000 during the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   He began the year with $1.9 million in the bank. He transferred
$2.6 million to a new campaign committee called The Lockyer
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer, who regulates gambling in the state, received
contributions from Indian tribes operating casinos, card clubs and
horse racing tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Lockyer declined to accept $10,000 from an Indian
tribe that operates a casino.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe sponsored a golf fund raiser, with prices as high as
$25,000 a head. Lockyer said it was ``inappropriate'' for an Indian
tribe to sponsor an event on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would continue to accept contributions, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general's duty is to enforce the laws. Not unlike
the governor, he has responsibility for overseeing different groups
and organizations. Some of those entities make campaign
contributions, just as they do to other elected officials,'' said
Nathan Barankin, a Lockyer spokesman.

ALREADY, GANT FEELS AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It didn't take long for new Anaheim Angel Ron
Gant to feel comfortable in his new surroundings. He was laughing
and joking with his Angels teammates, getting reacquainted with old
friends and making new ones Monday afternoon in the clubhouse a few
hours before gametime.
</P>
<P>
   Gant was acquired from the Phillies on Sunday in a trade for
pitcher Kent Bottenfield. He'll serve as the designated hitter in
most games and will get an occasional start in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' Gant said of joining a new team midseason.
``Usually it happens during spring training. It's strange but a
good strange. It was nice to see guys with good attitudes, knowing
they're ready to win. As soon as I walked in, I could feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the St. Louis Cardinals, Gant played with Kent Mercker and
Mark Petkovsek. He also knows Mo Vaughn and Ken Hill well. But the
best part, Gant said, is leaving a last-place team and joining a
team in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' he said. ``I've had some experience in the
playoffs and running through pennant races. It's fun for me again.
Hopefully, some of my experience will help these guys here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gant batted seventh in the lineup Monday, with a right-hander on
the mound (Jeff Weaver) throwing. Against left-handers, Gant might
hit second. And he'll hit in the middle of the lineup when Vaughn,
Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson or Troy Glaus need days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's multidimensional,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``I don't
want to lay a direct line on where he'll hit because he can be
versatile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for a long time, I played against Ron,''
Scioscia added. ``What he'll bring to the club will be very
evident. You'll see how hard he plays the game, his skill level,
and he's also a quiet leader in the clubhouse. He's been through
the wars. He becomes one of our elder statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Big-game veteran: Besides filling the need for right-handed
power, the Angels also got a veteran with postseason experience.
Gant has played in two World Series (1991 and `92 with Atlanta) and
five National League Championship Series (`91, `92 and `93 with
Atlanta, `95 with Cincinnati and `96 with St. Louis).
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you add an experienced player, it's a good thing,''
Vaughn said. ``He's played in the World Series. The man's a winner.
He's a good man, he plays hard and he's going to help us. The man's
been places, it's not like he's a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are Gant's fifth major-league team (Braves, Reds,
Cardinals, Phillies). He has 286 career homers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Needed rest: Catcher Bengie Molina and second baseman Adam
Kennedy were not in the starting lineup Monday. Scioscia is looking
to give his regulars a little more rest here and there down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have had a tremendous workload,'' Scioscia said.
``When younger guys get deeper into the season, they're getting
battle-tested. It's something we're concerned with. You want to get
guys fresh but let them stay in a rhythm. It's tough to get a guy
out of the lineup if he's going well.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mound report: Pitchers Kent Mercker (simulated game) and
Jarrod Washburn (bullpen workout) threw Monday and felt fine.
Mercker will begin a rehab assignment Friday at Single-A Lake
Elsinore. He'll need two or three minor-league starts before he's
ready to rejoin the team, probably in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, who has a strained biceps in his left (pitching) arm,
is eligible to come off the DL on Aug. 6.

SPEED ADDED IN SWAP

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ During the past two years, most Los Angeles Dodgers
trades have been salary dumps. On Monday, just hours before the
trading deadline, it was more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time it was the Colorado Rockies, not the Dodgers,
getting out of a potentially bad contract by sending center fielder
Tom Goodwin to L.A. Goodwin, an ex-Dodger, steps into the leadoff
spot to fill a gaping hole at the top of the batting order _
perhaps for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Dodgers sent disgruntled outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth, the 1996 Rookie of the Year, and minor-leaguers
Kevin Gibbs and Randey Dorame to the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 32, signed through the 2002 season, is scheduled to
arrive this afternoon and will start in center field in at least
one game of the doubleheader today against Pittsburgh. He'll play
the majority of games in center field and bat leadoff, giving the
Dodgers the table setter they've been searching for since trading
Eric Young in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin's arrival will also leave Devon White, who's
guaranteed $5 million next season, as an expensive fourth
outfielder if the club is unable to trade him in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Dodgers' second move in a five-day span. Last week they
acquired right-hander Ismael Valdes from the Chicago Cubs for two
mino-leaguers when the Cubs decided to dump salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely better because we didn't have this kind of
base stealer, this kind of speed, and he's a plus defender in the
outfield,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who signed
White to the three-year deal after the 1998 season. ``It changes
the complexion of our club, that one guy. He puts pressure on the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin signed a three-year, $10.75 million free-agent contract
in December with the Rockies that pays him $3.25 million annually.
He received a $500,000 signing bonus and there's a $500,000 buyout
on the club option for 2003, which is $3.5 million. The Rockies
agreed to pay $300,000 of Goodwin's salary this season, baseball
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a player traded in the middle of a multiyear deal,
Goodwin can demand a trade after the season. The Dodgers have not
addressed that subject with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't ask because we didn't want to make any conditions,''
Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly said. ``I think
we want to play out this year. (Goodwin) seems to be excited coming
to the Dodgers. If he ever decides he doesn't want to be a Dodger,
then we'll trade him because I don't want anyone here that doesn't
want to be a Dodger. This isn't like we gave up 12 players to get
Jeff Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, bothered by leg problems at times this season, is
second in the National League in stolen bases with 39. The Dodgers
have 56 as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's batting .271 with four homers and 47 RBI, has a .368
on-base percentage and has scored 65 runs. The Dodgers' leadoff
spot had a .317 on-base percentage, ranking 13th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Goodwin, who played 103 games for the
Dodgers from 1991-93. ``That's the way it goes in this game. I'm
not down on the team or anything. I'm just going to go to Los
Angeles to do the best I can. I am a little cloudy. It's not that I
don't understand the move because it's a business and things like
this happen, but I am a little shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he was able to make both trades without giving up
any of the organization's best prospects, which at times severely
hampered negotiations. Hollandsworth badly wanted out of Los
Angeles, the oft-injured Gibbs missed most of the last three
seasons and while Dorame was the California League pitcher of the
year last season, the club projects him as a fourth or fifth
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, a free agent after the season, batted .259 with
eight homers and 21 RBI from the leadoff spot, but the club was
displeased with his performance while White missed 2 months because
of a shoulder injury. Hollandsworth had a .338 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they gave (Hollandsworth) enough opportunities to show
if he can play every day, and that's all you can ask for as a
player,'' Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``He had his
opportunities to play and he didn't make the most of it and they
weren't happy with the way he played. You give a different guys
chances, so they bring in a different guy and give him an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition bumps to Dodgers' payroll to $98 million since
baseball calculates payroll totals based on the entire salary of a
player. However, the Dodgers will pay out $92 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goodwin gives the Dodgers a prototypical leadoff hitter,
there's a reason the Rockies wanted to dump him. He missed two
months last season in Texas with a hip flexor, and after a great
start with the Rockies, he's been terrible lately.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin hit .123 (9 for 73) in July as his average fell to .271.
He hit .342 and scored 41 runs at Coors Field but batted .208 with
24 runs scored in 19 more at-bats on the road. His on-base
percentage was .429 and .313, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies also dropped Goodwin from the leadoff spot to No. 8
on Saturday, and benched him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think speed at the top always makes you look like you're
feeling good,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He gets on
there and starts running around, then (pitchers) are paying more
attention to him than (the batter), and he can go get them in the
outfield.''

 THE WELCOME MAT IS OUT, SINCERELY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This space under new management!
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, boss!  &UR; Mi casa es su casa,  &LR; and vice versa, I hope.
</P>
<P>
   We are not sure exactly who the new chief is, but we are sure
that he/ she is a fine, honorable human being with such a keen
sense of humor that whatever he/she says, I can't help but laughing
obsequiously.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, we are using the editorial ``we'' here because there
is safety in numbers. Surely they wouldn't fire all of us who write
this column.
</P>
<P>
   I feel a little like Robert DeNiro today. I just watched
``Ronin,'' in which De Niro and three other guys are recruited to
do some murky, dirty deed. They don't know who their boss is or why
they are doing what they are doing. They only know they will be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   I really identified with De Niro in that movie, and I want the
new boss to know that if he/she tries to take away my column, he'll
have to catch me in a wild car chase through the streets of Paris.
The chase, of course, will include the obligatory smashing into the
fruit cart. I bet it's almost impossible to get collision coverage
on a fruit cart.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else around the Newpaper, I'm hoping I don't get
downsized. I'm already shrinking. I was in a doctor's office last
week, I measured myself and found that I am one inch shorter than
last time I checked. Gravity is a bitch. Fortunately, I gained one
inch around the waist, so my volume remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   CLINT REILLY and his attorney Joe Alioto did a fine job of
throwing several shrimp on the barbie, in the form of local
newspaper officials, politicians and Department of Justice bobos.
</P>
<P>
   Those folks all learned an important lesson: You can try pulling
sneaky backroom deals, but you can't get away with it!
</P>
<P>
   You can? Oh. Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Clint and Joe were wrong in saying the merger would kill
newspaper competition in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of OSTLER01 (44584 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Ha. Wait until the new boss informs me and Rob Morse that
whichever of us arrives first at the office in the morning gets to
use the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Regan McMahon wonders, ``Will the merging of staffs be like when
Tagi and Pagong tribes merged on `Survivor'? So far only Clint
Reilly has been voted off the island.''
</P>
<P>
   BOTH NEW San Francisco newspapers are off to Concorde-like
flying starts. The Examiner was purchased by the Fang family in
back-room dealings that Judge Vaughn Walker called ``malodorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Court testimony might lead one to believe that Mayor Willie
Brown was instrumental in brokering the deal that allowed the Fangs
to ``buy'' the Examiner for minus $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   I won't say the new Examiner is likely to go out of its way to
support the mayor, but there is a rumor that the first edition
under the Fangs will carry a front-page editorial nominating Willie
for the Nobel Prize in haberdashery.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chronicle, meanwhile, also starts off under a slight
cloud. Judge Walker wrote in his ruling that George Irish,
president of Hearst's newspaper division, ``simply was not a
believable witness.''
</P>
<P>
   In follow-up news stories of the court ruling, Irish was not
available for comment. Yikes. Newspaper honcho ducks own newspaper.
Unclear on concept.
</P>
<P>
   NAW, I'M NOT worried about Irish being mad at this mention. If
we can't kid our boss, whom can we kid? Besides, if he doesn't read
personal, vital e-mail from the publisher of his corporation's own
flagship newspaper, Irish isn't going to read some other paper's
wise-guy columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, honesty is way overrated. The entire presidential
campaign will be a battle to see which guy can do the best job of
fibbing away his political and personal record.
</P>
<P>
   AS FOR THE merger of the two newspaper staffs, Chronicle and
Examiner, it will be an adventure. I expect that the new owner will
announce a series of ice-breaker intra-staff mixers, dances, teas,
keggers and golf outings to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of OSTLER01 (44584 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  I'd like to keep writing a column, but I just work here, I do
what I'm told. Me and De Niro. Just don't assign me to push the
fruit cart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll be sent off to write obits, and if ever there was a
section of the paper that could use a little lightening up with
low-brow humor and cheap shots, it's that one.
</P>
<P>
   But if I show up for work one morning and they hand me a pick
and a canary, I'm going to have to tell them about my quadruple
hernia.

L.A. MAY CLOSE STREETS DURING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anticipating thousands of demonstrators, Los
Angeles police said they plan to surrender downtown streets to
Democratic National Convention protesters as long as they obey
laws.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate protesters, Olympic Boulevard near Staples Center
and streets around Pershing Square will be closed periodically,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be times when the streets will have to be conceded
to the crowd because of the numbers and where it is not prudent to
confront the crowd, absent any other criminal behavior,'' LAPD
Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen told the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on the
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to be seen as creating a situation, as long as
people are peaceful and obey the laws. The strategy should begin
with intermittent closures.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Transportation officials said they may have to
permanently close those streets during the Aug. 14-17 event.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they do not expect other areas of downtown will
be affected because of the stipulated agreement reached last Friday
to allow the demonstrators closer to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The city also is keeping open the original protest site near the
expanded one, including portable toilets and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to keep the downtown area open,'' said Frank
Martinez, city coordinator with the Democratic National Convention
Committee. ``With the new agreement, it essentially brings people
closer to Staples and the periodic closure of Olympic was always a
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Bannerjee, Department of Transportation general manager,
said she thinks the city can manage periodic closure of Olympic
Boulevard and the area around Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a series of alternatives to deal with this and want a
chance to try those before we decide to close them off completely
during the convention,'' Bannerjee said. ``We are trying to be
flexible, and we have had a lot of experience with special
events.''
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to deploy a large force of traffic officers who
will be assigned to the same areas each day and have been trained,
said Dave Rosen, who has been developing the plans for
transportation department.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing Square has been included in the agreement so some
groups can use it as a staging area for marches through downtown
and to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty of the dispute, however, is the decision by the
city Recreation and Parks Department to cancel a number of cultural
events that had been scheduled for the park.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing Square is across from the Biltmore Regal Hotel, which
will house the Tennessee delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore planned to stay there -- because
President John F. Kennedy had done so before his nomination -- but
the Secret Service decided to move him to Century City to avoid the
demonstrations.!dlim!!end!

POWELL SAYS BUSH AN EXAMPLE OF HOW GOP CAN BUILD TRUST
AMONG  MINORITIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell, the most popular
African American in the Republican Party if not the country,
implored his party Monday night to reach out to minorities as the
GOP Convention opened with a decidedly moderate and united tone.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside his more controversial support for abortion
rights, Powell praised Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ who will accept
the party's nomination Thursday night _ as an example of how the
``party of Lincoln'' can help build trust among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must follow Governor Bush's lead and reach out to
minority communities and particularly the African-American
community,'' said Powell, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the
delegates who are overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans had hoped that Powell would have a place on the
GOP ticket, something that Powell has repeatedly said he would not
consider.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush suggested that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff might have a place in his administration. Addressing
delegates via satellite from a high school in Ohio, Bush said of
Powell: ``I hope his greatest service to America might still lie
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's speech capped a tightly scripted opening night of the
four-day GOP convention, in which the names of President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore _ usually favorite topics of GOP
ridicule _ were almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Republicans put on a multi-media extravaganza with the
chosen theme of ``Leave No Child behind'' and a line-up of speakers
included faces and themes more often associated with Democratic
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Invocations were given by a Muslim cleric and a Jewish rabbi.
Video presentations featured gospel music from a local Baptist
church and tour of the East Palo Alto's KIPP Academy for
underprivileged children. Topic included ``empowerment,'' foster
care, immigration and literacy. Performances ranged from a funky
set by R&AMP;B artist Brian McKnight, to a tribute to Kate Smith and
the ever present thumping of John Philips Souza standards.
</P>
<P>
   Without opposition, Bush's name was placed in nomination, and
delegates approved his campaign platform in a voice vote, a
document largely tailored to fit his self-description as a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice advocates not only failed to amend language that
calls for a ban on abortion with no exceptions, they could not
gather enough support to bring the issue to the convention floor
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, made her national television debut, telling
the delegates: ``You know I am completely objective when I say _
you have made a great choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to more than 10,000 delegates, party luminaries, and
journalists packed into the home of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers,
the former teacher took one of the evenings only swipes at Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``George's opponent has been visiting school lately, and
sometimes when he does, he spends the night before at the home of a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she continued, ``George spends every night with a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   In her biggest applause line, she said she hears Americans who
tell her, ``I'm counting on you ... I want my son or daughter to
respect the President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said of her husband, ``He shares credit and doesn't
cast blame. He sets a tone that's positive and constructive, a tone
that's very different from the bitterness and division that too
often characterize Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush and former first lady Barbara watched the
address from center-court seats, and were given a warm welcome from
the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners carefully held Bush and Powell's addresses
until after 10 p.m. on the East coast, when West Coast audiences
might tune in and when the 49ers-Patriots game was safely over.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike four years ago, when Republicans could hardly contain
their attacks on President Clinton, almost no mention was made of
either Clinton or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even outside the First Union Arena, dissent was hard to detect.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand advocates for the homeless disrupted traffic
but there were no major incidents in Philadelphia streets, where
blue-shirted police officers were a omnipresent force.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to arrive here Wednesday, and to accept the
nomination Thursday. ``I am on my way Philadelphia, and I am on my
way to victory in November,'' Bush said addressing delegates from
Westerville South High School in Ohio. Thousands of red, white and
blue balloons hung above the arena, ready for Bush's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Republican convention, some people booed when Powell
said, `I believe in a woman's right to choose and I strongly
support affirmative action.``
</P>
<P>
   Powell did not mention abortion last night, but he chided some
in his party for missing ``no opportunity to roundly and loudly
condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids
get an education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over
affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes
with preferences for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside race, Powell challenged Republican doctrine on spending
and class economics, saying ``The world is watching to see if all
this power and wealth is just for the well to do, the comfortable,
the privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates were clearly not enthralled by Powell's comments.
A survey of delegates by the Associated Press found that 83 percent
are white while just 3.7 percent Black.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has openly speculated that he might nominate Powell as his
Secretary of State, but aides said no such announcement was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's opening night debuted a novelty: the first of a
``rolling roll call'' of state delegate votes cast over several
nights. Cindy McCain, wife of Bush's former campaign rival Sen.
John McCain, ``enthusiastically and unanimously'' began the
process, casting all 30 Arizona delegates for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Parsky, California chair of the Bush campaign, was fired
up and nearly hoarse as he shouted the glories of California during
the roll call vote. He made sure to tout just about every vote-rich
area of the state and went into exuberant, if lengthy, detail of
the Golden State's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, California didn't even cast its ballots. GOP
leaders want Texas to have the honor of putting Bush over the top
later in the convention.

 RETIRED S.F. JUDGE APPOINTED TO SUCCEED DISGRACED QUACKENBUSH  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Hoping to restore confidence in the state
Department of Insurance, Gov. Gray Davis appointed a prominent San
Francisco retired judge Monday to succeed disgraced former
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Davis named former state appeals court Justice
Harry Low, 69, to serve out the remaining two years of
Quackenbush's term.
</P>
<P>
   By appointing Low, Davis managed to select someone more
interested in the insurance post than in running for higher office,
something that hasn't happened since the passage of Proposition 103
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice Low is a distinguished jurist, with a brilliant mind
and a balanced approach,'' Davis said. ``A man of unquestioned
integrity and absolute independence. He has dedicated his entire
life to public service, but not to political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Low Monday did not completely rule out running for the office in
2002, when the current term he will serve out ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given very much thought to that,'' he said at a
news conference Monday. ``I don't view myself as a political
person. I have great trouble raising money, and I don't like to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Low added that he has ``not ruled anything out.'' He will be
the highest-ranking Asian American in state government if his
nomination is confirmed by both houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Low, a registered Democrat, did say he would not take political
contributions, which would make it difficult to run a future
statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Elected or Appointed?
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who earlier had indicated that he was leaning toward
returning the insurance commissioner post to an appointed position,
said Monday he has not decided which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd have a nominee in 30 days and an answer about
whether I'd support a plan to make the position appointive _ I
think one out of two isn't bad,'' Davis joked.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of returning the position to an appointive one said
having someone like Low, with no apparent political ambition, in
the job is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the person has a great deal of ambition and is more
interested in a political future than regulating, then that is
where the problem occurs,'' said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the
Personal Insurance Federation of California, which represents
insurance companies. ``Appointed commissioners make better
regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   McGeorge School of Law professor Clark Kelso has been the acting
insurance commissioner since Quackenbush resigned under pressure in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush was facing almost certain impeachment by the
Legislature after department officials testified that they had
recommended that insurance companies pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in fines from claims stemming from the Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Quackenbush permitted the companies to pay $13 million
into nonprofit foundations, most of which went to commercials
featuring the commissioner and other political activities.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is now investigating the actions of
Quackenbush and other former top aides in the department.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Transition Period
</P>
<P>
   Kelso said he will stay on until Low takes over in
mid-September, and possibly even longer to help with the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge is to restore trust,'' Kelso said. ``But
morale at the department is improving. With the hearings over, it
is easier to focus on the work at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Low served as a judge for 26 years, during which time he heard a
wide array of insurance cases as a municipal and Superior Court
judge and as an appeals court justice in San Francisco before
retiring eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has worked as a mediator considering, among other
matters, insurance disputes, including disagreements over
Northridge earthquake claims. Consumer complaints about those
claims sparked the department's scandal last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Low lives in San Francisco, but said he would spend a great deal
of time in Sacramento. He said he will resign as president of the
San Francisco Human Rights Commission as well as from his job as an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Praise From Both Houses
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, and Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, offered praise for
Low Monday, and easy confirmation is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Judge Low as a person of unquestioned honesty and
intelligence, and that is exactly what we need for the position,''
said Hertzberg, who went to school with Low's son.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has known Low since the judge worked on the campaign of
his brother, Philip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry's a fine, decent guy,'' Burton said. ``He's doing this
as a public service _ it's going to cost him money.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Some Concerns
</P>
<P>
   But praise was not universal for Low.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Rosenfield, a consumer advocate who was especially
critical of Quackenbush, said Low's record as an arbitrator must be
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role as an arbitrator concerns us greatly,'' said
Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights. ``You can't be splitting the difference in this position _
it's either for consumers or against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunmoyer, who represents insurance companies, said Low seems to
have the most insurance law knowledge of any commissioner since the
position became elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that he is very knowledgeable on all aspects of
the law,'' Dunmoyer said. ``But he has never been a regulator.
That's a question mark for us. It's too early to know how he will
handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield criticized Davis for not making a bolder selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor is completely afraid of controversy,'' he
said. ``He is going to go down in the history books as a mediocre
governor if this kind of thing continues.''

VALDES WASHED OUT IN DEBUT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Right-hander Ismael Valdes' return to the Los
Angeles Dodgers was washed away after 11 pitches and two
baserunners in Pittsburgh as rain forced the cancellation of
Monday's series opener against the Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader today
beginning at 2:05 p.m. Dodgers Lefty Carlos Perez will pitch the
first game against Pittsburgh lefty Jimmy Anderson. Valdes will
start the second game and oppose right-hander Bronson Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ismael said he'd be all right, so he'll throw the second
game,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson. ``I won't be able to get as
much out of him but hopefully four or five innings. The other
option would have been to bring (Darren) Dreifort back on three.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh starter Jose Silva retired Devon White, Mark
Grudzielanek and Gary Sheffield in order in the top of the first,
but Valdes was in trouble to begin the bottom of the inning. He
walked Warren Morris to lead off and Jason Kendall singled to
right.
</P>
<P>
   However, heavy rains and thunderstorms stopped the game, and
after one hour, 45 minutes, the game was called. It's the first day
the Dodgers had off since the All-Star break, but it sets up a
grueling 24 hours with Wednesday's afternoon game.

WHITE COULD BE NEXT TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Devon White rehabbed his injured left shoulder for
more than two months to get back his starting center-field spot,
and now he's likely a fourth outfielder after the Los Angeles
Dodgers acquired center fielder and leadoff hitter Tom Goodwin from
the Colorado Rockies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And with another year left on his contract, and guaranteed at $5
million, White's long-term future with the Dodgers is murky. A team
source said the Dodgers will try to trade White during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a chance the Dodgers could trade the 37-year-old
switch-hitter before the end of the season if he clears waivers,
which a baseball official said could happen given White's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 32, is signed through 2002 with a club option for 2003.
He was obtained for outfielder Todd Hollandsworth and two
minor-leaguers _ outfielder Kevin Gibbs and left-handed pitcher
Randey Dorame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects me as a leadoff hitter and a center fielder, but if
it's a good situation for the team that Goodwin does come here and
gets the team over the hump, then it's a great trade,'' White said.
``But the bottom line is I can't worry about anything else but to
see what becomes of this. Bottom line, I could have been in a deal.
I'm not a fool. I'm sure there were rumors about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Goodwin's going to come here and do the job that they've
been asking for all year, a leadoff guy that gets on base and all
of that stuff, then great. I'll be along for the ride, providing
I'm still here. I don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried dealing White at the trading deadline last
season, but he was in the first year of a three-year, $12.6 million
contract and there weren't any takers.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training the club tried to light a fire under
White by saying the center-field competition was wide open. White
responded with a strong spring, easily staving off Todd
Hollandsworth's attempt to win the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what management has in store,'' White said. ``The
bottom line is my ego is not that big to tell you I can't be a
fourth or fifth outfielder, but it would be respectable if it's
brought to my attention and told me what my job is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   White injured his shoulder diving for a ball May 2 against
Atlanta, partially tearing his left rotator cuff. Surgery wasn't
needed, and White returned to the lineup last Monday in Colorado.
He's batting .283 with three homers and 10 RBI, but he's 2 for 7 in
stolen base attempts and has a .327 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson hasn't stated Goodwin is the
every-day center fielder, but Goodwin is expected to get the bulk
of the playing time. However, Johnson did say there would be
instances when he starts both outfielders and gives either left
fielder Gary Sheffield or right fielder Shawn Green a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like in the last three or four years I haven't won a
Gold Glove, but I feel that I'm still a very good outfielder,''
said White, who's won seven Gold Gloves. ``You might ask some of my
peers around the league who are the very good outfielders, and my
name will still be in there. . . . I wouldn't object to playing any
other positions, but I haven't been told anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: William P. Schweppe, who worked for the
Dodgers for 41 year and was the club's vice president, minor-league
operations from 1968-87, died at Anaheim Memorial Hospital on
Monday. He was 86. Schweppe began working for the Dodgers in 1946
as the business manager of the Newport News, Va., minor-league
affiliate. In 1958, he moved to Los Angeles as the secretary of
minor-league operations. . . . Goodwin will wear No. 28 with the
Dodgers, the number Hollandsworth wore. Goodwin wore No. 24 in
Colorado, but that number is retired by the Dodgers in honor of
Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston. . . . With the scheduled
doubleheader today, Johnson will rest some of his regulars. ``It
won't be Sheffield,'' Johnson said. ``If he can go, he's going to
post.''

L.A. AREA HAS 21 of 50 TOP_GROWTH FIRMS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty-one 101 Corridor companies are among the
finalists in Deloitte and Touche's annual survey of the 50
fastest-growing firms in Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which covers a region stretching from Santa Barbara
to Riverside County, is dominated by companies along the Ventura
Freeway from Woodland Hills to Camarillo, suggesting the enduring
strength of the corridor's mainstays, said Rohit Shukla, president
and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Regional Technology
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the overall list, there is no region that is
more dominant on that list than the 101 Corridor. Not even close,''
said Shukla.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte and Touche will honor the 2000 Los Angeles Technology
Fast 50 companies and rank them by revenue growth over the past
five years at an awards presentation Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, technology companies need to have been in business
for at least five years, had revenues exceeding $50,000 in 1995 and
$1 million or more in 1999. The professional services firm will
release specific data about each company's growth at the awards
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight Corp., Franklin Telecommunications Corp. and
QualityLogic Inc. are new in Deloitte and Touche's seventh annual
survey. Last year Dental Medical Diagnostic Systems of Woodland
Hills was designated as a jump-starter business, less than 5 years
old but growing rapidly. This year, it rated as a Fast 50 company
in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lee, executive vice president of development at Franklin
Telecommunications, said it was no surprise ``to see a lot of
neighbors on the list,'' referring to the myriad telecommunications
and broadband companies along the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually surprising that we haven't grown more. That's
something we expect to take place in the next six to nine months,''
said Lee, whose company develops voice communications using
Internet protocol for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the list for the first time since 1995 is Thousand
Oaks-based biotech titan Amgen Inc., which reported $3.04 billion
in sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always pleased to be recognized for our financial
performance, as well as our discovering and introducing important
new drugs,'' spokesman David Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 21 of the top 50 businesses were 101 Corridor
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable tribute to the strength of the area,'' said
Shukla, who co-authored a report released last week concerning the
corridor's future. ``These are companies that have grown through an
era of incredible change, and they still maintained growth rates in
excess of 500 percent.''

</P>
<P>
   GOP-ASSESS-NYT _ A political analysis by R.W. Apple Jr. on the
modern convention and how it got there. Ronald Reagan used to
preach what he called the 11th Commandment: Speak no evil of other
Republicans. But now his party, and the other one, too, have gone
him one better, appropriating the physician's Hippocratic oath as
the unspoken guiding principle for their quadrennial gatherings:
First, do no harm. It is that thought, more than anything, that has
drained all of the drama and much of the meaning from modern
political conventions.

Bush at the convention, Republicans in Congress are relegated to a

   ISRAEL-PERES (Jerusalem) _ At the moment Monday when the
announcement of the first of the two Knesset votes for Israel's
next president made it all but certain that he had lost the last
major battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Noble
laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring
standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained proudly, though
unobtrusively, in character. The result, with 60 votes for Moshe
Katsav, 57 votes for Peres, and three blank ballots, brought
groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among parliamentarians
backing Peres' bid to become Israel's eighth president. To those
who know him well, the 76-year-old statesman appeared ashen, but in
the simplicity of his manner and words he did nothing, despite the
moment's pain, to bely his reputation for courtliness and courage.

   DNA-VOLUNTEERS (Undated) _ A California startup company called
DNA Sciences is starting a Web site on Tuesday to recruit people to
donate their DNA to help find genes that cause disease. The
company, which has DNA double helix discoverer James D. Watson as a
director and Netscape founder James H. Clark as an investor, hopes
to get 50,000 to 100,000 people to contribute by appealing to their
altruism. The new effort reflects a major change taking place in
genetics: With the unraveling of the human genome, studies to link
genes to disease are starting to be done on an unprecedented scale,
involving far more people than ever before. In the past, scientists
usually found disease-causing genes by studying a few families or
some isolated village with a high prevalence of the particular
disease. Now, they need to survey many more patients and controls
to find statistical correlations between genes and disease or
between genes and drug effectiveness. By Andrew Pollack.

   GOLDMAN-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ When Goldman Sachs led a buyout

image that has suffered as the company has racked up losses and its
stock price has sunk to 75 cents a share. By Patrick McGeehan.

there myriad utilities and upstart energy companies to choose from,
but countless permutations of ways to contract for electricity,
including buying it on the Web. By Claudia H. Deutsch.

<P>
   LAW-FIRMS-STUDENTS (Undated) _ It seems like an odd recruiting
strategy in a tight labor market: Tell prospective employees that
they can expect to work longer hours and receive fewer perks than
they would at rival companies. But that is precisely what a large
Washington law firm is planning to do as it attempts to redefine
the summer-associate program that virtually all firms use to woo

   POP-LYRICS (Undated) _ In the 1980s and early '90s major music
labels held themselves up as free-speech champions as they fought
against pressure groups attacking specific songs. But today, as the
record-buying audience grows even younger, political pressures
persist, and the music business continues to consolidate as well as
fight battles on the Internet front, those free-speech claims have
decreased and an array of song-lyric review and editing procedures
have become routine. Artists are routinely asked to re-sing lyrics,
edit out particular words and even excise entire songs from albums.
Changes made to songs for radio play are often far more extensive

while forming what scientists believe could be the biggest ant
colony in the world, stretching over 600 miles from San Diego to
San Francisco. The ants in this so-called supercolony are nearly

SPIEZIO'S BLAST WINS FOR ANGELS IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Scott Spiezio figured to be one of the Anaheim
Angels' bench players to lose at-bats to newly acquired Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   But Spiezio made his one at-bat count Monday night, smacking an
0-1 pitch from Detroit Tigers closer Todd Jones over the fence in
right field for a three-run homer, giving the Angels a dramatic 5-4
win before 16,797 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio's homer capped a four-run rally in the ninth inning,
spoiling the performance of Tigers starter Jeff Weaver, a former
Simi Valley High standout, who had a career-high 12 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's 12th strikeout, though, came at a cost. With Mo Vaughn
fouling off eight pitches, it took Weaver 10 pitches before finally
getting the strikeout to end the eighth. It brought his pitch count
up to 120, spelling the end of the night for him.
</P>
<P>
   In came Jones to pitch the ninth, and the Angels took advantage.
Tim Salmon led off the inning with his fourth hit of the night, a
solo homer that cut the Tigers' lead to 4-2. Garret Anderson
followed with a walk and Troy Glaus struck out. Gant, who finished
the night 0 for 3, walked, but Matt Walbeck hit into a force play
for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson on third and pinch-runner Edgard Clemente on
first, Spiezio ripped a fastball from Jones into the first row of
seats above the scoreboard fence for the homer, the first pinch-hit
homer for the Angels this season.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Angels had only three RBI from their pinch
hitters all season before Spiezio's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic turn of events after the way Weaver quieted
the crowd and the Angels' bats for eight innings. Weaver gave up
one run, five hits and walked only one.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five hits off Weaver were singles by Salmon,
including an RBI single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, acquired from the Phillies for pitcher Kent Bottenfield on
Sunday, got a chance to make an immediate impact. After flying out
in his first at-bat, Gant came to the plate in the fourth inning
with the bases loaded and two out in a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver made quick work of Gant, striking him out on three
pitches, including blowing a fastball past him for strike-three.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tigers kept plugging away and finally got through
against Angels' starter Scott Schoeneweis (5-6). Schoeneweis, who
hasn't won since May 25, through three scoreless innings before
Juan Gonzalez led off the fourth with a home run. In the fifth,
Juan Encarnacion led off with a double and took third and Shane
Halter's fly ball to right. Salmon made a strong throw from right,
but it deflected off Encarnacion and got past Schoeneweis backing
up the play. The ball went into the photographers' well, allowing
Encarnacion to score.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion got to Schoeneweis again in the seventh with a
two-run homer, giving the Tigers a 4-1 lead.

LATE TRADE FOR MARTIN WON'T HAUNT MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No Jason Kendall? No Johnny Damon?
</P>
<P>
   No Travis Fryman? No David Segui? No John Vander Wal? No B.J.
Surhoff? No Jeromy Burnitz? No Matt Lawton? No Juan Gonzalez?
</P>
<P>
   No way!
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the Mariners fanned the flames of
anticipation, milking the tantalizing trek to the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we're taking phone calls. Yes, we're here to prove we can
run with the big dogs. Yes, we want to show Alex Rodriguez and
anyone else who matters _ if there is such a category _ that we
mean business.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry list of candidates who could come in and push the
American League West leaders to the postseason and beyond (the
great hope) became an endless roll call of tradeable commodities
from all over the baseball map.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone the Mariners didn't consider trading for?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you listened to sports radio or your buddies at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, to Mickey the softball coach at Gold's Gym on
Aurora:
</P>
<P>
   I know you wanted Damon. Tough luck, huh? You said you'd settle
for Vander Wal, because he was the best pinch hitter available, but
he went and signed a two-year extension in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the clock ran out on general manager Pat Gillick and the
Mariners. In the end _ and we do mean the end, since the deal was
not completed until a half-hour before the deadline _ the Mariners
settled for outfielder Al Martin in a minor deal with the Padres.
The Mariners bid farewell to utility man John Mabry and
minor-league pitcher Tom Davey.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost the big-splash contest to the White Sox, who
snagged catcher Charles Johnson and Harold Baines; the Yankees, who
loaded up on Denny Neagle, David Justice and Glenallen Hill; the
Mets, who raked in Mike Bordick, Rick White and Bubba Trammell
without giving up much; the A's, who snared setup man Jim Mecir;
and the Indians, who plucked Segui for duty at first base and DH
and also obtained outfielder Wil Cordero, starters Jason Bere and
Steve Woodard and reliever Bob Wickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still willing to overpay for the right player,'' Gillick
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners did not have to overpay because the right
player did not fall to them, especially after Tigers owner Mike
Ilitch pulled Gonzalez off the market on Sunday after the Mariners
had a deal they liked and were ready to make.
</P>
<P>
   Martin? Along with his speed and left-handed bat, he arrives
with baggage, although the Mariners front office and players swear
that, aside from charges of bigamy and domestic unrest that led to
police intervention this spring, Martin is a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   What else can they say? It's not every day you trade for an
accused bigamist with legal baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger point to be made about Martin is not his personal
woes, which in this baseball-crazed town will be overlooked if he
does a good job on the field and keeps his nose clean.
</P>
<P>
   How will Martin serve as a role player for the Mariners? Pretty
well, if you listen to Lou Piniella, who basically only wanted a
role player all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have carriers. We have stars who can carry this team. What
we needed was more of a supporting cast. This move improves the
club. Martin is very capable. He has good speed. Good bat. This
will allow me to keep this team nice and fresh,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will play in left, spelling Rickey Henderson occasionally
_ a situation Henderson can live with, or so he said Monday upon
hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to this point in your career, it's about winning,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners may not have done enough at the trading deadline to
make them a legitimate World Series contender. In a little more
than two months, everyone will know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that along the way, the Mariners provide as much
drama as they've supplied during the first four months of the
season when, through pitching and defense _ especially at home _
they have earned the AL West lead.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate verdict on this deadline deal helps take the sting
out of the fact that it was not the big-bang trade everyone was
anticipating:
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did not make a deal that is going to come back to
haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, with the Red Sox in town, you could look out at
Safeco Field and see Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe, two players who
have become major pieces in the Boston organization since coming
over from the Mariners at the trading deadline in 1997 in exchange
for Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence helps one recall that age-old baseball phrase:
The best trades are the ones never made. For citizens of
Marinerville who thought Gillick should give up the farm _ and the
future _ for Damon; for anyone who figured Gonzalez was the big
bopper to come in and light up the Seattle sky, it is time to sit
back, relax, and take this team as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to have the third-best record in baseball. Loaded
with pitching _ the lowest ERA at home in all of baseball. Defense
that continues to make Oakland jealous. And now the Mariners have
an extra bat, and added speed to win more of those one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a waiver-wire miracle, it's going to have to be good
enough.

AL CONTENDERS RETOOL FOR STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sammy Sosa didn't get traded. Neither did Juan
Gonzalez. But it seems like they were just about the only players
who weren't during a trading period as hectic as an Al Martin
family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the David Justice trade between the New York
Yankees and Cleveland at the end of June and ending with the final
frenzied deals Monday afternoon, more than 100 major and minor
league players were traded, including, apparently, everyone in
Baltimore not named Cal Ripken Jr. The Orioles made five trades
involving 21 players, shipping out seven and adding 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many trades made I can't even keep up,''
Mariners general manager Pat Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gillick had trouble keeping up, consider poor Ricky Ledee,
who was traded twice in four weeks, moving down the ladder from the
Yankees to Cleveland to last-place Texas. By the time his mail
catches up to him, Ledee could be with the Wisconsin Timber
Rattlers. Or retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees getting Denny Neagle was a pretty big boost for
them,'' Gillick said when asked which teams he thought did well.
``And I like Jim Mecir, who Oakland got.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were the big winners and the poor losers? We'll have a
better idea after the season, but in the meantime, here's a quick
look at the deals made by Seattle and its fellow American League
contenders, and how they may affect this season's races.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)NEW YORK: The Yankees wrapped up their shopping early,
dealing for Justice, Neagle and Glenallen Hill (and also picking up
Dwight Gooden) in advance of the deadline. Neagle is a huge boost,
giving the Yankees the dependable winner they needed with David
Cone possibly nearing the end of his career and Orlando Hernandez
aching.
</P>
<P>
   Justice (27 home runs, 77 RBIs) and Hill won't help defensively,
but they are productive hitters. Justice has six homers since the
trade and Hill already has helped the Yankees at the plate _ he hit
a game-winning grand slam Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)CLEVELAND: After much debate as to whether it was wiser
to trade Manny Ramirez and spend the autumn watching the ``Drew
Carey Show'' or fight for their sixth consecutive postseason, the
Indians chose the latter, pulling off three significant deals last
Friday that vaulted them back into the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Having gained Ledee for Justice at the end of June, the Indians
traded him to Texas for former Mariners first baseman David Segui.
They traded Alex Ramirez and Enrique Wilson to Pittsburgh for
outfielder Wil Cordero, then traded Richie Sexson and Paul Rigdon
to Milwaukee for starting pitchers Jason Bere and Steve Wood-ard,
plus reliever Bob Wickman.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Segui, who is having an excellent season, gives Cleveland
perhaps the league's best infield defense, while Bere and Woodward
greatly help a staff that has used a club-record 29 pitchers. If
the Indians can stay healthy, they could find themselves where they
usually are in October _ Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)TORONTO: The Blue Jays, who desperately needed pitching,
added it by trading for Esteban Loaiza, Steve Trachsel and Mark
Guthrie. Trachsel and Loaiza should help, but they might not be
enough for the Blue Jays, who have a 5.45 staff ERA.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)CHICAGO: The White Sox already had the best record in
the league, then improved themselves by trading for Charles
Johnson, one of the game's best catchers, as well as designated
hitter Harold Baines, in exchange for catcher Brook Fordyce. With
Cal Eldred hurting, Chicago might need to add a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)SEATTLE: Acquired for what appears to be the relatively
minor cost of John Mabry and minor league pitcher Tom Davey, Al
Martin gives the Mariners the left-handed bat they wanted, adds
some speed to the roster and gives manager Lou Piniella some
flexibility in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better with him,'' Gillick said. ``Al Martin is going to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Martin is a poor fielder and drove in only 27 runs
for San Diego. After an arrest this spring, he also brings more
baggage than United Airlines could misplace in a year.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)OAKLAND: The Athletics gave up a top prospect, Jesus
Colome, but strengthened their bullpen in the short term by adding
the underrated Jim Mecir. He is a bit wild, but allowed only 35
hits in 49.2 innings for Tampa Bay. Is it enough to catch Seattle?
No. Is it enough to stay ahead in the wild-card race? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)BOSTON: The Red Sox had used 10 starters this season,
but unfortunately only one is named Pedro Martinez. Of the others,
only Tim Wakefield has an ERA under 5.00. That prompted a
seven-player trade that sent Jeff Frye and others to Colorado for
Rolando Arrojo as well as Mike Lansing (who has a $6.25 million
contract for next year). Arrojo, however, had a 6.04 ERA for the
Rockies and gave up five runs in 6.1 innings in his Boston debut
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Red Sox have the league's best ERA, but are 11th
in runs. Swapping Lansing for Frye and picking up Ed Sprague
doesn't adequately address that concern.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET)ANAHEIM: The Angels needed starting pitching, so
naturally they traded Kent Bottenfield (7-8, 5.71) for Ron Gant,
who has driven in himself more times (20) than his teammates (18).
If they don't re-sign Gant this winter, the Angels will have Adam
Kennedy to show for Jim Edmonds.

   Versatile Lima boosts Astros
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When last seen, Jose Lima was helping the grounds crew
get the field ready for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not really. But Lima did just about everything else in the
Astros' 4-2 victory over the Florida Marlins Monday night at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima wasn't as sharp as I've ever seen him, but he did
everything that he needed to do to win,'' manager Larry Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching?
</P>
<P>
   Lima held the Marlins to two runs in 6 innings, winning his
third consecutive decision after losing 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding?
</P>
<P>
   He started two double plays, including a barehanded dandy
earmarked for ESPN's Plays of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Offense?
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first double in almost two years and scored what
proved to be the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   It was an all-around good day for the Astros' resident showman,
who tipped his hat to the sparse crowd of 8,044 that booed him as
he left the game in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (booing) is not going to upset me,'' Lima said. ``I'm a
showman when I'm out there. I like to entertain the fans. I like it
when they boo; all that does is fire me up.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to everything he's been doing between the lines,
Lima is doubling as somewhat of a psychic off the field. He vowed
not to lose another game the rest of the season _ and is making
good on that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people are saying, `There goes Lima talking trash
again,''' Lima said. ``But I said I was going to win 15 games in
1998, and I won 16. I said I was going to win 20 games last year
and I won 21. It's still Lima Time, no matter what. I can still
finish with 11 or 12 wins, and I'd be a happy camper.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio drove in three of the Astros' four runs, while
relievers Marc Valdes and Octavio Dotel each pitched 1 scoreless
innings to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel, who struck out three of the four batters he faced, earned
his third save and extended his scoreless innings streak to 10 in
his 10th relief appearance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins took an early lead on Preston Wilson's RBI single in
the first but Lima shut them out over the next five innings, with a
little help from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Richard Hidalgo took away three runs from the
Marlins in the fourth inning alone. He gunned down Mike Lowell, who
ill-advisedly tried to score from second on Andy Fox's single.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo then chased down Ramon Castro's blast to center, which
almost certainly would have scored two runners, who could only
watch in amazement as Hidalgo ended the inning with a flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is a big part of the game,'' Hidalgo said. ``On the
first play, I was surprised he tried to score. I was playing in a
little, I got to the ball quickly and made a good throw. On the
other play, I just ran as hard as I could to catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's eighth home run _ a solo shot over the left-center
field wall _ tied the score in the third. The home run snapped a
0-for-11 drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swung the bat well in Atlanta but I didn't have anything to
show for,'' Biggio said. ``Hitting is all confidence. You just try
to get to a point where you feel comfortable, and you go from
there. I've felt better over the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins starter A.J. Burnett retired eight of the 10 batters he
faced after Biggio's home run before creating trouble for himself
by walking Lance Berkman and Moises Alou to lead off the sixth.
That was enough to get Marlins manager John Boles out of the dugout
and reliever Ricky Bones into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bones retired all three batters he faced in the sixth, but
Berkman was able to score on Tony Eusebio's ground ball to
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Further proving it was his day, Lima doubled to lead off the
seventh and scored on Biggio's sacrifice fly. It's was Lima's fifth
hit in 40 at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added an insurance run in the ninth when Glen Barker
drew a one-out walk, stole second, advanced to third on a grounder
and scored on Biggio's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave Dotel a margin of error, but he didn't need it,''
Dierker said. ``Barker was a big part of our team last year doing
just that. He helped us win a lot of games with his speed.''

   Deadline brings trading frenzy
</P>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder B.J. Surhoff and first baseman Will Clark were the
biggest names switching teams on Monday as baseball's contenders
raced to the 3 p.m. trading deadline with a final flurry of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Ten trades were made in all, with the Atlanta Braves pulling off
perhaps the most significant acquisition by obtaining Surhoff, a
widely respected veteran and a first-rate lefthanded hitter, from
the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals also made an impact move by obtaining
Clark from the Orioles in a deal that suggests Mark McGwire's knee
injury may keep him sidelined indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders Rondell White, Tom Goodwin, Todd Hollandsworth and
Henry Rodriguez were among the other players who changed teams
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams can still make trades despite the passing of the deadline,
but only players who have cleared waivers can be moved. Some
general managers routinely file waiver claims on players to block
deals in the final weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some years, when the trade deadline passes with almost no
one of significance changing teams, the week leading up to this
summer's deadline was one of the busiest in history as contenders
loaded up for a run at a championship and losers cut their payrolls
to prepare for next season.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Yankees, Braves, Diamondbacks and Mariners _
four first-place teams _ appear to have helped themselves the most.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were in contention for Surhoff right up until
Orioles owner Peter Angelos ordered his baseball staff to do
nothing to help Yankees owner George Steinbrenner win a third
straight World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had already done their work, acquiring David
Justice and Glenallen Hill for their offense, Jose Vizcaino for
their infield defense and Denny Neagle for the rotation in the four
weeks before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very volatile market,'' Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman said. ``It's not easy trying to line up matches with
people, whether it's payroll, talent or a whole lot of other
issues. Some big names got floated out there. But it's not easy to
get to `yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the team we have. That's why we were able
to walk away and say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got the best available pitcher by acquiring
Curt Schilling from the Phillies, and the Mariners got the
lefthanded bat they need by getting outfielder Al Martin from the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every other contender made at least one move, but some
blockbuster deals that had been discussed never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hours of conversation involving several teams, the
Tigers were unable to trade Juan Gonzalez, and the Cubs still have
Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff believed he had survived the trading deadline until
learning that the Orioles had sent him to the Braves minutes before
the deadline. One of the most respected players in the game,
Surhoff tearfully said goodbye to the Orioles as he prepared to
leave for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles dismantled a losing team in a stunning 72-hour
period by trading reliever Mike Timlin and Clark to the Cardinals
in separate deals, designated hitter Harold Baines and catcher
Charles Johnson to the White Sox, shortstop Mike Bordick to the
Mets, and, finally, Surhoff and reliever Gabe Molina to Atlanta for
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard and two minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff's work ethic and professionalism should be a good fit in
an Atlanta clubhouse that has several other players like him. He
was hitting .293 at the time of the trade with 13 home runs and 57
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He also has played in 427 consecutive games, the longest active
iron-man streak.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite a trade that moved him from a fourth-place team
to one that's on its way to a ninth straight division championship,
Surhoff, 35, found it hard to say goodbye to Baltimore, where he
was finishing his fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wouldn't have expected it to happen the way it
happened,'' he said. ``It's not that I don't want to play in
Atlanta. I'm sure I'm going into a great situation, and I know it's
going to work out. I just thought I was going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Braves manager Bobby Cox: ``He's really team-oriented. He's
high-quality and a still-good ballplayer at his age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles sent Clark to the Cardinals for third base prospect
Jose Leon. Clark will play first base in place of McGwire, who has
been on the disabled list since July 6 with pain in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals still lead the National League Central by four
games, but they have lost 13 of 21 since McGwire left the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some uncertainty about Mark,'' Cardinals manager Tony
La Russa said. ``We think he's got a chance to come back, but in
the meantime, Will Clark's a winning type of veteran. He should
help us. That's a heck of a coup for us. I hope Mark comes back,
and then we can work them both in there together. But right now, it
really helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark no longer hits with power, but he was batting .301 with
nine home runs and 28 RBIs in 79 games.
</P>
<P>
   In other Monday deals, the Toronto Blue Jays acquired pitchers
Steve Trachsel and Mark Guthrie from Tampa Bay for prospects; the
Los Angeles Dodgers got Goodwin from the Colorado Rockies for
Hollandsworth; and the Cubs continued to shuffle their deck by
getting White from Montreal for pitcher Scott Downs and sending
Rodriguez to the Florida Marlins for two minor-leaguers.

MILLER FLOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maven of rant imbecility and barnyard humor savored by
IQ-challenged persons with Howard Stern scriptures lodged in their
vacuous heads, Dennis Miller made his much-ballyhooed sportscasting
debut Monday night during the San Francisco-New England telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Ho hum!
</P>
<P>
   Or better yet, humbug!
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Dennis Mill- er, reigning Pinup Boy for the
dumbing down of America and alleged comedian who holds the unique
distinction of never having induced a laugh out of me.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd rather do an investigative piece on the social
significance of Dennis Rodman's tattoos, or put together a
photographic montage of Georgia Frontiere's Top 10 fa &QL; 
- celifts than I would watching a 49er-Patriot exhibition match.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, please, I have more important things to do with my
Monday evenings than to waste them listening to some
nepotistic-enhanced brother of a bigshot Hollywood agent bore me
into somnolence with his mindless musings, or watching a gridiron
exercise so meaningless that the teams' starters aren't allowed to
play beyond a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And, anyway, I find it difficult enough now to pay attention to
the NFL when the games are played for real, much less in the middle
of the summer when they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   The scandalous absurdity of the sprawling Southern California
basin, with the second largest city in America, Los Angeles, within
its confines, being without an NFL franchise continues to leave me
angered, saddened and increasingly indifferent to professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   How could we here in L.A., a sun-splashed metropolis of
millions, indisputably the entertainment capital of the planet, a
proven athletic mecca, one of the world's great tourist
destinations, enter a new millennium without representation in the
NFL?
</P>
<P>
   How could we here in L.A., with so many wealthy hustlers whose
vanities are larger than their net worth, with two teams in major
league baseball, the NHL, the NBA and even the NFL as recently as
1994, still not have an NFL franchise in its midst?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the NFL, an acronym for National Football League, has
become a shameless misnomer.
</P>
<P>
   How could this confederation of money-obsessed owners be
considered a national alignment without the presence of L.A. in it?
</P>
<P>
   It can't, of course, and, as every year passes without an NFL
franchise here, I find myself drifting farther away from the
league, not caring remotely as much about the games and the players
as I once did when the Rams and Raiders were in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I'll fork over $150 again to take DirectTV's NFL Ticket, but
that's only because my job forces me to pay at least peripheral
attention to a sport that still gets far higher TV ratings than any
other in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But I, like I'm sure a lot of other Southern Californians, find
my interest in the NFL waning ever more ominously, as it continues
to shut this venue out of its cozy little group for no other
discernible reason than appalling greed.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s only immediate hope?
</P>
<P>
   Natch, Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't laugh, or launch into a monologue of obscenities,
but the Raiders' owner deeply regrets his decision to return to
Oakland, even is going to trial next February against the city to
try to get out of the long-term stadium lease he signed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Will Al Davis win?
</P>
<P>
   He does have a lengthy history of jurisprudence success, and
it's known the Oakland mayor, Jerry Brown, not exactly a passionate
athletic patron, would gladly settle and let the Raiders depart if
he thought the team was headed for a court room victory that could
result in even more money being drained from the deplet &QL; 
- ed Oakland city coffers.
</P>
<P>
   I'd certainly welcome Al Davis and the Raiders back warmly,
inasmuch as the only professional football we have now in L.A. is a
club-level team that plays at the Staples Center and always scores
more points than Shaquille O'Neal and another new entry that soon
will perform at the Coliseum in a league created by wrestling
impresario Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is a shrewd guy with a vivid imagination, but you know
anything he's involved with will have about as much legitimacy as
Dennis Miller's football knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Davis is ever to bring his Raiders back to L.A.,
he will have to be given some sort of guarantee that a new stadium
will be erected for him and that he won't have to keep his team
indefinitely in that outmoded dump known as the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Pharaohs were able to build their pyramids faster than it takes
for L.A. to build a foot &QL; 
- ball stadium, and, even if Davis wins his latest legal suit,
there is no guarantee he will bring his team back to a city that
broke promises with him for 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee any NFL team soon will be ensconced in
L.A., even though a year ago at this time fellows named Ed Roski,
Eli Broad, Ron Burkle and Michael Ovitz were loudly assuring us
that an NFL expansion team was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that a $700 million bid by Houston's Bob McNair
reduced these L.A. blowhards to silence, which perhaps was the only
nice development that came out of the NFL's decision last October
to keep L.A. from its privileged domain.

MARINERS PICK UP MARTIN FROM SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the end, the Mariners didn't get the breakout deal
they'd been looking for.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Seattle didn't break the bank to pick up
left-handed hitting outfielder Al Martin from the San Diego Padres.
Martin, who will join the Mariners for Tuesday night's game against
Boston, came at the cost of outfielder/third baseman John Mabry and
minor league pitcher Tom Davey.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, hitting .306 with 11 home runs and 27 RBIs, is a good
addition to the Mariner mix, in that he's an experienced
left-handed hitter with above-average speed. Mabry was hitting .243
with one home run and seven RBIs; Davey was 8-6 with a 4.61 ERA for
Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Martin joins an outfield that is seriously overcrowded. He will
start some in left field in place of Rickey Henderson and in right
field in place of Jay Buhner. Of course, Stan Javier already does
that, so there are four men for two spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been resting our outfielders all along, and this move
adds to our ability to do that,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   How much rest is enough? Henderson, for one, wasn't sure. He's
played about five days out of seven since coming to the Mariners
from the Mets in May, and he's been productive despite a .254
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is good or bad,'' Henderson said. ``I
know Al Martin is a good, little contact hitter. I don't know how
much rest I need. I don't make those decisions. I used to complain,
but nowadays I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, the man who does make those decisions, said he hasn't
come to any resolution about how he's going to handle his surplus
of outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be plenty of playing time for everybody,''
Piniella said, a statement that could be challenged by some of the
players involved. On the other hand, as Javier said before the
trade was finalized, ``You want to play, but you also want to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners entered their game against Boston Monday night with
a 61-43 record and four-game lead in the AL West. So while they may
have coveted Juan Gonzalez or Manny Ramirez _ trades that would
have taken at least a couple of front-line players _ the Mariners
put together a less high-level deal that kept from tearing at the
fabric of their 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had been an object of desire for the Mariners all the way
back in spring training. At the time, he was with Pittsburgh, but
he wanted to be closer to his Scottsdale, Ariz., home. The Pirates
entertained an offer from the Mariners, but traded Martin to San
Diego instead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trade that Martin wanted, but it came just before the
low point of his career and personal life, which wound up being
splashed across front pages and featured in news broadcasts in
March and April. In March, Martin was charged with assault,
physical injury and threatening or intimidating. His wife, Shawn
Haggerty-Martin, was charged with assault and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that Haggerty-Martin was Martin's second wife,
the couple having been married in 1998 in Las Vegas. Martin and his
first wife, Cathy, have remained together. Mariners general manager
Pat Gillick first talked to Cathy Martin, not Al, when he called
the Martin household Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem happy,'' Gillick said. ``She said they were both
excited about the move.''
</P>
<P>
   And the general manager said they'd checked on ``what kind of
person he is'' before agreeing to the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some issues there,'' Gillick said. ``But we think
this (the battery charges) will be cleared up in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin's playing future, it's tied to the Mariners
through 2001. When the Padres acquired him, one condition of the
trade was that his contract option for 2001 at $5 million would be
picked up immediately, and it was. At the same time, an option for
2002 was eliminated. He's making $1.75 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality player, a hard-nosed player,'' Gillick said.
``He gives us an added dimension on the field, and I think he'll
fit in well.''

SONICS' HANDS TIED UNTIL LEWIS RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a long July, the Sonics hope the first week of
August is a short one.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of signing free agents, which begins today, will
largely depend on small forward Rashard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old's return to Seattle is a formality, based on his
verbal commitment to the team last week. However, the deal Lewis
settles on has not yet been ironed out Either way, Lewis contract
will have a direct affect on how the Sonics proceed in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has the option of signing a contract extending two or more
seasons that starts at about $3.9 million, or he can sign a
one-year deal for the Sonics' mid-level exception ($2.25 million).
Using the mid-level exception is the only way for Lewis to secure a
two-year deal with an opt-out clause. The major benefit for Lewis
taking the $2.25 million is that he can make himself eligible for a
maximum contract after next season.
</P>
<P>
   If he does that, the Sonics would have only a $1.2 million
exception to lure a free-agent post player.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   That would describe how several prospects feel, because the
Sonics have had only preliminary talks with free agents. Who they
bring in, and that player's contract terms, can be decided only
after Lewis signs his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has said he will return to Seattle sometime this week to
sign. It is believed that he is leaning toward accepting at least a
two-year deal, worth about $8.2 million. Such a deal, which could
be struck as soon as today, would make Lewis eligible for a ``Larry
Bird'' contract in 2002: a maximum seven-year pact starting at $9
million per year. The Sonics, operating over the $35.5 million
salary cap, can use their mid-level and $1.2 million exceptions to
bolster the frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lay out all of the options to him when he gets here,''
Sonics president Wally Walker said last week. ``Then, he'll just
have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Walker has had discussion with representatives for
free-agent forwards and centers, he hasn't been able to promise the
mid-level exception. The situation is not terribly alarming for the
Sonics, considering the quality of free agents available.
</P>
<P>
   After the first tier (Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady) and
second level (Lewis, Eddie Jones), there is a significant drop-off.
The Sonics will dangle money, hoping to entice the likes of Danny
Fortson (Boston), Brad Miller (Charlotte), Jahidi White
(Washington), Corie Blount (Phoenix), and Ben Wallace and Chucky
Atkins (Orlando).
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Oliver Miller (Phoenix), Kurt Thomas (New York), Sam
Perkins (Indiana) and Danny Manning (Milwaukee) also are available.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been in contact with Perkins and Manning. Perkins, a
former Sonic, likely will re-sign with Indiana for more than the
$2.25 million exception. There is mild interest in Manning, whose
agent phoned the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has more interest in Fortson, a strong, 6-foot-8
rebounder who the Sonics tried to trade for last season. The Sonics
like White, a 6-9 banger and restricted free agent, meaning the
Wizards have the right to match offers.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a significant trade, dont expect the Sonics to make much
of a splash in the free-agent waters.
</P>
<P>
   Their No. 1 priority is re-signing Lewis. It is unlikely that
the team will look to move disappointing forward Vin Baker, who has
impressed the coaching staff with his summer workouts. Forget trade
rumors involving Gary Payton, who is guaranteed to return. Walker
said recently that there is ``nothing on the front burner'' in
terms of trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are still considering trade options; there just won't
be any deals of consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Lewis, Walker's in-house business concerns center
Jelani McCoy and guard Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy became a free agent when he exercised an opt-out clause in
June, but the Sonics are expected to re-sign the second-year player
to a deal starting at $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's status is uncertain. Walker contacted Maxwells agent,
Dwight Manley, and told him of the team's intent to explore all
options. While the Sonics mull trading Maxwell, whose relationship
with Payton and coach Paul Westphal became rocky last season,
neither side has ruled out his return.

   AFC South best for Houston's new franchise
</P>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the hard part is over. We're back in the NFL, and
everything from here on out is gravy. Just the same, considering
the kind of bucks Bob McNair had to spend to accomplish this on the
city's behalf, his voice deserves to be heard on the matter of
realignment and Houston's place in it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we've got our cake. And now we want to eat it, too. Is
that so bad?
</P>
<P>
   If McNair were king, his NFL team would play in a division
consisting of the Titans, the Cowboys and, for comic relief, the
Saints. But although he's a fine fellow and possesses a regal
carriage, Bob isn't king. Hence, such an alignment is a no-go.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas shall forever remain an NFC East team, and there is no
room in the inn there for us. We can accept this, as long as the
new scheduling scheme that's being bandied about ensures regular
collisions between Texas' teams.
</P>
<P>
   An acceptable second choice, however, absolutely, positively
must guarantee twice-annual bloodlettings against the Titans, for
reasons that hardly need explaining. Of course, the league might
then also feel compelled to keep together the new Browns and the
Ravens nee Browns on the same grounds, and that's where things
start getting complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston and Tennessee could, in fact,
constitute a perfectly suitable division if the NFL weren't trying
to reorganize itself along loose geographic lines (save for
800-pound gorillas Dallas and Miami) and name its eight foursomes
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But a solution is simply arrived at. Stick the Browns and Ravens
in the AFC Central with the Steelers and Bengals, never mind how
the Browns organization apparently has zero interest in stoking a
rivalry with Cleveland's vagabond exes. Or that Ravens owner Art
Modell won't push for it either. The bounty on his head in
Cleveland makes returning for games an unpleasant proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Houston's choices are these: (1) join Cincinnati,
Pittsburgh and Cleveland in a retro AFC Central, (2) team with
Indianapolis, Jacksonville and Tennessee in the AFC South, or (3)
join Jacksonville, Tennessee and Baltimore in a less geographically
challenged AFC South.
</P>
<P>
   McNair says he much prefers No. 1, citing all those wonderful
old rivalries from bygone Oilers days, but we suspect his reasoning
is more pragmatic than sentimental. If you're playing the
percentages, and horseman Bob is wont to, Houston's chances of
fast-tracking to competitiveness are definitely greater against the
tired old AFC Central faces, none of which save for Cleveland
figures to be particularly inclined to pursue excellence
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers remain doggedly old-school under Dan Rooney, and
the Bengals will always be second-class cats unless Mike Brown
suddenly changes his cheapskate spots, er, stripes. The Browns,
meanwhile, will have just a three-season head start on Houston's
fledgling franchise, but Carmen Policy is a proven master of
finessing the salary cap and courting free agents. He dearly loves
spending the boss' money.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, for his part, is expected to have loose purse strings,
so general manager Charley Casserly wouldn't need to fear Carmen's
extravagant policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first aforementioned AFC South, Bob and Charley would
have to burn bundles of cash to catch up with everyone. As long as
Bud Adams keeps selling out his Nashville digs, his bottom-line
reputation of yore won't be apropos, and both the Colts and Jaguars
are young and immensely gifted.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee-Jacksonville already generates genuine hateful
feelings between the teams and the not-dissimilar upstart cities
they represent, and Tennessee-Indianapolis is intense stuff, too,
because of Peyton Manning's storied college tenure as a Vol in the
Volunteer State. Tennessee-Houston will be at least as heated a
matchup, once Houston gains a measure of equal footing in terms of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, in turn, feels no special affinity, good or bad, for
either Cleveland or Cincinnati despite the 27 years of AFC Central
competition. There were occasional isolated big games amid
countless forgettable ones. Even Pittsburgh-Houston was truly
special only during the Luv Ya Blue-Steel Curtain era. We never
came to hate Pittsburghers, or they us.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the AFC South _ preferably the Indy version because of
Manning's star power _ seems the more demanding option at the
outset, but the gratification gleaned from butting helmets with
that crowd will enhance Houston's encore NFL experience from the
get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Bob. Forget the past. Well, except the Oilers. Let's
bring them back to Houston every year, even if they're disguised as
Titans.

   Miller hits, misses with barbs in `Monday Night Football' debut
</P>
<P>
   By DAVID BARRON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   For Don Meredith, it was, ``Turn out the lights; the party's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dennis Miller on Monday night, it was, ``Start blow-drying
Teddy Koppel's hair, 'cause this one's done.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus ended the first Monday Night Football broadcast of the
Miller regime.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian's debut as a network football announcer came in an
otherwise forgettable 20-0 NFL exhibition game won by the New
England Patriots over the San Francisco 49ers _ who were so bad,
Miller noted, that they should be called the 47ers _ at Canton,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ABC doesn't expect blockbuster ratings for the game, since it
began at 4 p.m. on the West Coast. It served primarily as a
shakedown cruise for Miller and his new stablemates _ longtime MNF
host Al Michaels and Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts in the
booth, and Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson and reporter
Melissa Stark on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss, Don Ohlmeyer, the one-time MNF producer who was
brought in by ABC Sports president Howard Katz to overhaul the show
after five years of declining ratings, was pleased with his crew's
first performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some rough spots, but overall it was a good start,''
Ohlmeyer said. ``I was really pleased with the announcers for the
first game. I thought Eric and Melissa had a nice debut, and the
trio in the booth has the chance to be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's performance, as might be expected of a broadcast
rookie, was somewhere between the Patriots' 20 and the 49ers' zero.
</P>
<P>
   He did show a few flashes of the ``nerd's knowledge'' he
professes to have of football. Perhaps the most extreme example
came after Patriots quarterback Michael Bishop ran the option for a
touchdown. Miller brought up the name of Jack Mildren, the former
Abilene Cooper quarterback who later became Oklahoma's master of
the wishbone.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller also mixed in so many one-liners that ABC might need
to bring in Jenna Elfman, who played drums with Bob Dylan on an
episode of Dharma and Greg, to provide rim shots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them worked. When 49ers rookie receiver Eric Chew
fumbled, Miller said simply, ``Chew regurgitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them didn't. In a painfully strained reference to the
site of the game, he said, ``You know, you can't get any good
Cantonese food in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were in between. In an effort to assure viewers that ABC,
the company that is paying him millions, is actually a cheapskate,
he said, ``Believe me, the people on (the CBS reality show)
Survivor have a more generous per diem than we do. I had to buy a
BLT with fur pelts.''
</P>
<P>
   When the regular season begins, Monday Night Football will
dovetail into local news followed by Nightline _ thus the reference
to Koppel, the latter show's host. This week, however, ABC asked
the NFL to move the kickoff of the Patriots-49ers game to 6 p.m.
CDT so it could be followed by coverage of the Republican National
Convention from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP convention under way, Miller couldn't resist a
couple of political one-liners. ``Now there's a couple of 4-12
teams,'' he said after a promo for ABC's convention coverage. Of
Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, he
said, ``I don't want to say that Gore lacks charisma, but his
personalized license plate is a random series of numbers and
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also plunged full-bore into the obscure references that
are so much a part of his comedy act. Examples included Italian
film director Sergio Leone, the NAFTA treaty, actor Jack Lord,
first baseman Bill Buckner, Lot the nephew of Abraham (as part of a
twisted reference to Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott), Fox
Sports News anchor Keith Olbermann, and, near the end of the
broadcast, the Big Giant Head of sports television critics, Rudy
Martzke of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   However, Miller never uttered the word golly, which, as he has
told viewers on HBO and NBC in recent weeks, is shorthand for a
four-letter word you can't use on broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   He was only mildly scatological, noting ABC's use of a new
camera attached to the cap of the field umpire and saying, ``I
think that's the new cup cam they've brought in. That's our next
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And while sarcastic, Miller certainly wasn't cynical. He
referred several times to the stadium noise and the intensity of
the hitting on the field that can't be grasped by a fan watching
the game on television, and he sounded positively giddy as the game
came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this so much fun?'' he said with a giggle. ``I can't
believe I'm here.''
</P>

   LOS ANGELES _ She won't be marching in the streets. She won't be
calling for the overthrow of capitalism and of corporate control of
the global economy (although she might be sorely tempted).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if anyone is going to shake the over-rehearsed
stiltedness out of this summer's American political conventions and
capture the imagination of those for whom the whole circus is
supposedly intended _ the voters _ then surely Arianna Huffington
is the woman for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Peppy, witty, shamelessly contrary and eternally combative,
Arianna is the driving force behind the Shadow Conventions that
will stalk the mainstream politicians, both in Philadelphia where
the Republicans will officially anoint George W. Bush as their
presidential candidate next week, and in Los Angeles where the
Democrats are gathering in mid-August for the coronation of Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Count on her to keep things lively (the title of her latest
book: ``How to Overthrow The Government''). Count on her to keep
the celebrity count high (among the speakers she has attracted,
Gore Vidal, Warren Beatty and Bush's erstwhile challenger, the
populist Senator John McCain).
</P>
<P>
   And, above all, count on her to stir the pot by focusing on
issues she believes the two big parties would rather the electorate
never got to hear about: the growing disparity between rich and
poor and the myths of America's much-touted ``prosperity''; the
corruption of the present system of political campaign financing
which enables corporations to subvert the public interest through
money; and the moral and political bankruptcy of the so-called War
on Drugs, whereby small-time addicts are criminalized and public
funds are squandered on prison-building rather than education and
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know how to define Arianna, as she is universally
known (the Huffington comes from a husband she is no longer married
to, and her maiden name, Stassinopoulos, is an overripe mouthful
people like to avoid).
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper columnist, political salon-keeper, television
personality _ none of them really do justice to her
larger-than-life presence.
</P>
<P>
   What she does have, in spades, is attitude, a spikiness
reinforced by the Greek accent she never quite learned to lose.
</P>
<P>
   She has been many things to many people in her long and colorful
career: president of the Cambridge Union, trenchant anti-feminist,
best-selling biographer of Picasso, and (in her least convincing
role) dutiful political wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was considered Republican until she made clear she had no
respect for any political party, considered a conservative until
the Shadow Conventions filled her with a radical zeal reminiscent
of the counterculture of the Vietnam War era, considered a
shameless elitist until she unexpectedly became an eloquent
advocate for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   If it was her husband Michael who introduced her to politics, it
was his spectacular, and spectacularly expensive, failure to win
one of California's Senate seats for the Republican Party in 1994
that gave her the liberating push she needed to take center stage
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years she was divorced (among other problems, Michael
came out of the closet) and developing a reputation for her
political coziness with Newt Gingrich, then Speaker of the House
and chief architect of the Republicans' radical ``Contract with
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Already during the last presidential election season, it was
clear Arianna was no blue-rinse conservative: she appeared on a
political chat show in her nightie, discussing the hot issues of
the day in bed with a pyjama-clad left-winger. (The program segment
was called ``Strange Bedfellows.'')
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine described her as the Republican Party's
very own Spice Girl.
</P>
<P>
   When Newt Gingrich began to become an embarrassment to his own
supporters, she had the courage to drop her allegiance to him and
began her astonishing drift _ by now a full-speed surge _ to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   And as she threatens to upstage the mainstream parties, plenty
of politicians are quaking ever so slightly at the thought of her. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The days when father's word was law have
disappeared, with children as young as eight now having a big say
in many British households.
</P>
<P>
   Research published Monday shows the Victorian approach to
child-rearing, where children were seen and not heard, has
collapsed over the past 30 years with the birth of the new
``democratic family.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of 950 families shows that 78 percent of British
parents consult their offspring on important decisions such as
moving house or where to go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the family is becoming more democratic,''
said Tim Harrison, of Abbey National, which commissioned the study.
``Children have greater power and influence than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 children dictate the choice of the evening meal
at home, and 65 percent help to choose the family's vacation
destination. Weekend and leisure plans were also joint decisions
with 84 percent of families deciding what to do and where to go
together.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to moving house, 42 percent of parents talk to
their children about it before agreeing to put the house on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Willmott, of the Future Foundation, who conducted the
study, said: ``It seems parents not only see involving children in
decisions from the outset as a route to family harmony but
recognize that their children can actually add value to big family
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the parents interviewed said the increased
communication had led to more open and honest relationships with
their children then they enjoyed with their own parents.
</P>
<P>
   Mary MacLeod, chief executive of the National Family and
Parenting Institute, which advises the Government on family policy,
said: ``Overall it is a good thing for young people as it enables
them to take more responsibility and be included. It also makes
them more mature and can really boost their confidence and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult when big decisions have to be made, like who
to live with when parents separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions like this can be too much emotional responsibility
for many young people and parents should then take the
responsibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But family psychologists sounded a cautious note. They said that
although it could be beneficial for children to play a part in
decisions at home, making them more mature and teaching them how to
be good citizens, family democracy was a ``double-edged sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Lewis, professor of psychology at Lancaster University,
said: ``Children should be included in the discussions but there
are times when they need their parents to take responsibility for
big decisions which affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that including the kids in decisions makes
for happy families but that is not necessarily the result for all
members of the household.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary findings from research being done by Professor Lewis
on family decision-making shows that some parents find involving
their children very difficult as they lose both power and authority
within the household.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, children and adolescents find some decisions
too stressful and expect their parents to take responsibility for
their welfare. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ Everyone expected the United Nations to move its
peacekeeping army down to the Lebanese border _ not to go mad.
</P>
<P>
   But urgent orders in the early hours of Friday morning to
dispatch Irish and Ghanaian U.N. troops from their bases in
southern Lebanon through the Israeli frontier to positions on the
other side of the Israeli-Lebanese fence do raise serious questions
about the sanity of the peacekeeping army.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officers were astounded by the extraordinary order. ``It
totally discredits the U.N. here,'' one remarked angrily. ``I
suppose Rode-Larsen is trying to get the Nobel Peace Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Rode-Larsen is Terje Rode-Larsen, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's special envoy to the Middle East and one of the architects
of the doomed and _ in Arab eyes _ hopelessly unfair 1993 Oslo
agreement between Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, he has been trying to persuade the Lebanese
government to allow the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) to deploy down to the Israeli frontier after Israel's
unilateral withdrawal in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese had complained that Israel was still infringing on
Lebanese territory in at least seven locations. The sixty U.N.
troops have been sent to two of these locations _ on the other side
of the Israeli-built fence.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, UNIFIL _ the ``interim'' in its title long ago
ceased to be a joke _ has been holding an area of southern Lebanon
between the Golan Heights and the Mediterranean but prevented by
Israel for 22 years from fulfilling its mandate of moving to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Rode-Larsen, who has several times been accused by the Lebanese
authorities of adjudicating frontier disputes in Israel's favor,
has been desperate to send U.N. soldiers south now that the
Israelis have left. The Lebanese refused to give permission until
the alleged infringements were rectified.
</P>
<P>
   So at 2:30 Friday morning, Irish and Ghanaian troops were
suddenly ordered to send platoons to the Israeli border crossing on
the sea coast at Rosh Haniqra.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish U.N. battalion sent 38 men and three armored personnel
carriers along with a party of Polish U.N. engineers and
earth-moving equipment and were allowed by the Israelis to pass
through to Yaroun south of Bent Jbeil. The Ghanaians sent their
contingent to Manara, close to an Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   They are _ in theory at least _ demarcating the U.N.'s own
``blue line'' frontier between Israel and Lebanon, a border marked
on the 1923 maps between Palestine and Lebanon from which the
Israeli frontier wire deviates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israel appears to accept the line at Yaroun and Manara,
its fence still stands to the north of the U.N. positions.
</P>
<P>
   And at Manara, a road used by Israeli vehicles to reach the
nearby Israeli settlement apparently passes through the Ghanaian
unit's position.
</P>
<P>
   Is the United Nations now to allow Israeli cars along a road
which the Lebanese government regards as theirs? Will the Lebanese
anyway accept this Gilbert and Sullivan deployment?
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Lebanese military officers were en route to
the border in a U.N. helicopter to survey the area, noting that the
``blue line'' _ now physically painted blue on rocks around the new
U.N. positions _ is ``manned'' by U.N. troops, albeit cheek by jowl
with Israeli soldiers and at least 900 feet south of the supposedly
abandoned fence.
</P>
<P>
   Other apparent frontier violations, near Shebaa and Alma Shaab,
have not yet received the U.N.'s attention.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for the U.N.'s deployment _ as militarily absurd as it is
politically dangerous in the eyes of experienced U.N. officers in
the area _ were given by the U.N.'s force commander, Major General
Seth Kofi Obeng, presumably on the instructions of the U.N.
Secretary General in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Annan is assumed to have sent his orders on the advice
of his colleague, Rode-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   We live, as the Lebanese say, in interesting times. But without
any peace prizes. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ When the world's media _ and more than a few diplomats
_ predicted violence in the aftermath of the failure of the Camp
David talks, it was a sign of just how out of touch they all were.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators on the Middle East waffled on about the ``dangerous
vacuum'' that existed after Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak returned
home last week.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli officer turned up on CNN to talk about the very same
``vacuum'' and the need to take tough measures against
``terrorism'' (for which read Arabs). But our reaction was really
about our own arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Why should either side in the Arab-Israeli struggle suddenly
turn to violence now? Why should the Arabs react in this way?
</P>
<P>
   After all, they have realized for years _ as we have not _ that
the Oslo agreement was doomed, that its deviation from the U.N.
Security Council resolutions upon which it was supposedly founded
has gone so far that there is no chance of a satisfactory outcome
to the four issues that finally paralyzed Arafat and Barak at Camp
David: Jerusalem, settlements, the Palestinian right of return and
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Only journalists and governments pretended that Camp David could
succeed. We supposed that the Arabs would only realize the collapse
of Oslo when we did.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, television reporters expressed surprise when Arafat
was given a hero's welcome back in Gaza and Barak a cold shoulder
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we have grown so used to Arafat giving away
yet more ``concessions'' and the Israelis taking more from the
Palestinians that, when the opposite happened, we failed to
understand the perfectly natural reaction of the people who live in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   For once _ uniquely _ the old Palestinian chairman had not
returned with another capitulation. He had stood up to the United
States and Israel. He who once called the late King Hussein of
Jordan a ``Saladin'' was elevated to the role of ``Saladin of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all sorry stuff, of course. This Saladin is not going to
gallop into Jerusalem. He's not going to stop the Jewish settlement
building. Mere mention of the ``right of return'' had long ago
assumed _ in the West, at least _ the aspect of an unmentionable
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Palestinian scholar Edward Said has pointed out,
anyone who suggested that the right of return of Palestinian
families to their original homes in what is now Israel should be
debated was treated with scorn; merely raising the issue could
``upset the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the ``return'' is already changing its nature. In
Lebanon, for example, the United Nations claims that there are up
to 250,000 Palestinian refugees. The Lebanese suggest the figure
might be as high as 350,000.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
estimates that there may be only 133,000 Palestinians _ at most _
left in Lebanon. The rest, they calculate, have been resettled
abroad: in Denmark, Norway, France, the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   At least one State Department official has suggested in a
private paper that half a million Palestinians or more might be
given residence in the U.S. And who could blame a Palestinian for
seizing such an offer if it rescued him from the feces-encrusted
streets of the Sabra, Chatila and Ein el-Helwe camps?
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised, however, if Arafat _ who made his
``peace of the brave'' with Israel on the basis of trust rather
than written guarantees _ has a few more betrayals up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   If he goes on demanding sovereignty over east Jerusalem (and
thus refuses to ``compromise'' over Israel's illegal annexation of
the city) and insists on a state in September, his millions of
dollars from the U.S. will be abruptly halted. So too, no doubt,
the EU's aid.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat needs this money to enrich his ministers and followers,
to pay his bodyguards and jailers and prison torturers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Barak, we managed to get him wrong too.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected with such a massive personal vote, CNN told
us that he now had a mandate to make peace. It forgot to point out
that his party lost seats in the Knesset and that his government
would therefore be inherently unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the democratically elected Israeli prime minister
return from Camp David last week to face the scorn of his people
while the ruler of ``Palestine'' received a dictator's reception.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly predictable, the Arabs and Israelis might have told you.
But as usual, we knew best. &QL;

   Thus did the democratically elected Israeli prime minister
return from Camp David last week to face the scorn of his people
while the ruler of ``Palestine'' received a dictator's reception.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly predictable, the Arabs and Israelis might have told you.
But as usual, we knew best. &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Just after Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of
State, made the commencement address at the University of
California at Berkeley in June, a Palestinian student medallist,
who had been invited to respond to the address, put aside the
speech that she had prepared _ a speech that had already been
officially approved by the university _ and decided, in her own
words, to ``talk from my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Fadia Rafeedie is a courageous lady. In just a few short,
eloquent paragraphs, she accused Albright _ introduced to the
audience as ``the greatest woman of our times'' _ of lying by
omission, of responsibility via U.N. sanctions for the deaths of
tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians, of failing to tell
her audience that it was an American company that had supplied
Saddam Hussein with his chemical weapons and the CIA that had
earlier funded him.
</P>
<P>
   To the horror of the university authorities, who thought they
had control of her address, Fadia Rafeedie even mentioned the
unmentionable: that U.S.-made depleted uranium munitions fired by
the Americans in the 1991 Gulf War may be destroying the lives of
thousands more Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, on the other side of the U.S., a former
Israeli soldier, James Ron, was baring his soul in the normally
very pro-Israeli pages of the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a supposedly ``elite'' Israeli paratroop unit
operating in Lebanon in 1986, he wrote, he dragged a blindfolded
middle-aged man into an alley and put him through a mock execution.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to ransack and pillage a Lebanese village. He watched
his comrade kick a cup of scalding tea into the face of an old man.
Then he put his rifle against the head of a 10-year-old Lebanese
boy and put him, too, through a mock execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me begin,'' he wrote, ``by asking forgiveness from the
10-year-old whose name I never knew and from the village I no
longer remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Two brave voices in a conformist land _ one Palestinian, one
Israeli _ demonstrate that even in the U.S., it's sometimes
possible to hear the unvarnished truth about the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   I've railed against America's sheep-like subservience to the
``moderate,'' pro-Israeli rules laid down by the State Department
and CNN so often that I could scarcely believe what I was reading
when Rafeedie's address and Ron's article arrived in Beirut. And
you won't have read their words anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Real news is no longer news in the West, where only the cliched
peace-process-v.s.-terrorist-fanatics version of the Arab-Israeli
conflict finds its way into print.
</P>
<P>
   So it's worth studying these two astonishing contributions to
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In Rafeedie's case, her words were an act of faith. Several of
her student colleagues _ protesting Albright's claim that U.N.
sanctions against Iraq were necessary _ had been hauled from the
lecture theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (those) protesters were protesting,'' Rafeedie told the
students listening to her, ``it's not because they wanted to pick a
fight with the woman whom you guys all happen _ well, many of you _
happen to love. She was introduced as the `greatest woman of our
times.' Now see, to me that's an insult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman is doing horrible things. She's allowing innocent
people to suffer and to die. Iraq used to be the country in the
Arab world that had the best medical services for its people, and
now look at it. It's being obliterated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp lady that she is, Rafeedie spotted the need to
disassociate herself from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brutal dictator and I agree with her (Albright), and I
agree with many of you. We need to see who's responsible for how
strong Saddam has gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was gassing the Kurds, he was gassing them using
chemical weapons that were manufactured in Rochester, N.Y. And when
he was fighting a long and protracted war with Iran, where one
million people died, it was the CIA that was funding him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafeedie was talking to people who would never have agreed with
her. ``I'm speaking to a crowd that gave a standing ovation to the
woman who typifies everything against which I stand... and I think
that if I achieve nothing else, if this makes you think a little
bit about Iraq, think a little bit about U.S. policy, I've
succeeded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hope. But Rafeedie ended her extraordinary speech with an
Arab slogan: ``Fear not the path of the truth because of the lack
of people walking on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Israeli soldier Ron was making a somewhat different
point: that Israel will have to do more than just withdraw its
soldiers from southern Lebanon if it is to be forgiven for what it
did there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Such as the 10-year-old boy. ``We forced his family into the
kitchen and dragged him to a nearby orchard,'' he wrote. ``My
lieutenant pressed the child's face into the dirt while I jammed my
rifle against his skull. Although the officer threatened to shoot
his head off, the boy did not respond, even after we threatened to
throw him from the roof of his three-story home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ron expressed ``reservations'' about this _ a somewhat mild
word under the circumstances _ he was ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casual brutality was not limited to lower-income (Israeli)
recruits,'' he said. ``Omri, child of an intelligence officer,
liked to fire bursts towards villagers peeking through doorways.
Rafi, son of a liberal parliamentarian, kicked a cup of hot tea
into an elderly man's face.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ron recalled the civilian fatalities of Israel's invasions of
Lebanon _ almost 20,000 _ and asked why Israel could not compensate
those it had harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israel will not do so on its own, the international
community should pressure it to do so. If other countries can face
up to their unpleasant pasts'' _ Ron mentioned El Salvador and
South Africa _ ``why not Israel?''
</P>
<P>
   Brave voices, as I said. Have no doubts _ these are the voices
of decent, genuinely moral people.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it has to be said that Rafeedie was a bit braver than
Ron. Her chances of academic progress are not going to be improved
by her outburst at Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Ron, I should add, is an Israeli, an assistant professor of
sociology at Johns Hopkins University and a human-rights
investigator. No one is going to disturb his academic tenure. And
14 years is, frankly, a long time to wait before spilling the
beans.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the real question is much simpler: why aren't non-Jewish
and non-Arab Americans saying these things?
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't ``ordinary'' Americans _ i.e., those without a stake
in the Middle East _ asking these questions?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the Boston Globe's own journalists had reported what
Ron told the paper's readers, their dispatches would have remained
unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   Rafeedie and Ron should take a bow: a Palestinian and an Israeli
didn't worry that they were the only people walking down the path
of truth.
</P>
<P>
   But why does it take such courage in America to tell the truth
about the Middle East? &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The deposed Fijian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry,
fears that 300,000 Indo-Fijians _ the majority of the ethnic Indian
population _ will leave the country in the wake of the armed
nationalist coup led by George Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Sydney Monday after meeting Australian Prime
Minister John Howard, Chaudhry said that he understood the despair
of fellow Indo-Fijians, who have faced a wave of racially motivated
violence since the coup in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of Indian origin feel shattered and insecure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was held hostage by Speight's gunmen for 56 days,
is visiting Australia at the start of an overseas tour to drum up
support for the restoration of democracy in Fiji. He goes to New
Zealand Wednesday and to Europe next week.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Howard, Chaudhry looked every inch the visiting
statesman. He said that he still regarded himself as Fiji's
legitimate prime minister and would like his democratically elected
government to be reinstated _ but he accepted that there was no
realistic prospect of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   In Suva, Fijian authorities began charging hundreds of Speight's
supporters with unlawful assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels appeared in the capital's main courthouse amid tight
security and were processed in batches of ten. They were detained
during a military crackdown last week in which Speight was arrested
on suspicion of treason.
</P>
<P>
   The army regained control of a barracks in the northern town of
Labasa, where 40 soldiers had been held hostage for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry said that Speight, now incarcerated on a remote
offshore island, had been the front man for an alliance of
opposition politicians and businessmen opposed to his
Indian-dominated Labor government.
</P>
<P>
   A destabilization campaign had begun as soon as he was elected,
he said, and police failed to pass on warnings that a coup was in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speight came out of the blue,'' he said. ``He had never
featured in political life.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fiji now ruled by an interim government committed to
rewriting the constitution to exclude ethnic Indians from power,
Chaudhry is considering forming a government-in-exile _ either in
western Fiji, his support base, or in Australia. ``We can't just
close shop and leave it to the new regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister looked tired and thin; he has had
difficulty sleeping since he and members of his Cabinet were
released three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was beaten up in captivity, said: ``We were
intimidated, threatened and humiliated. I am getting over it,
slowly. But the memories of it will stay with me for the rest of my
life.'' &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ The deposed Fijian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry,
fears that 300,000 Indo-Fijians _ the majority of the ethnic Indian
population _ will leave the country in the wake of the armed
nationalist coup led by George Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Sydney Monday after meeting Australian Prime
Minister John Howard, Chaudhry said that he understood the despair
of fellow Indo-Fijians, who have faced a wave of racially motivated
violence since the coup in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of Indian origin feel shattered and insecure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was held hostage by Speight's gunmen for 56 days,
is visiting Australia at the start of an overseas tour to drum up
support for the restoration of democracy in Fiji. He goes to New
Zealand Wednesday and to Europe next week.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Howard, Chaudhry looked every inch the visiting
statesman. He said that he still regarded himself as Fiji's
legitimate prime minister and would like his democratically elected
government to be reinstated _ but he accepted that there was no
realistic prospect of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   In Suva, Fijian authorities began charging hundreds of Speight's
supporters with unlawful assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels appeared in the capital's main courthouse amid tight
security and were processed in batches of ten. They were detained
during a military crackdown last week in which Speight was arrested
on suspicion of treason.
</P>
<P>
   The army regained control of a barracks in the northern town of
Labasa, where 40 soldiers had been held hostage for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry said that Speight, now incarcerated on a remote
offshore island, had been the front man for an alliance of
opposition politicians and businessmen opposed to his
Indian-dominated Labor government.
</P>
<P>
   A destabilization campaign had begun as soon as he was elected,
he said, and police failed to pass on warnings that a coup was in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speight came out of the blue,'' he said. ``He had never
featured in political life.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fiji now ruled by an interim government committed to
rewriting the constitution to exclude ethnic Indians from power,
Chaudhry is considering forming a government-in-exile _ either in
western Fiji, his support base, or in Australia. ``We can't just
close shop and leave it to the new regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister looked tired and thin; he has had
difficulty sleeping since he and members of his Cabinet were
released three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was beaten up in captivity, said: ``We were
intimidated, threatened and humiliated. I am getting over it,
slowly. But the memories of it will stay with me for the rest of my
life.'' &QL;

<P>
   With the Republican National Convention beckoning next week in
Philadelphia, George W. Bush has his first real chance to convince
American voters that he is ``ready'' to lead the country. For the
past four months, the supposedly lightweight Bush has dominated the
presidential campaign. He is currently slightly ahead in the polls,
and unless something terrible happens at what promises to be a
heavily overscripted convention, he can expect to increase his lead
still. But no matter how endearing Bush seems at the podium next
Thursday night, his appeal will not truly be tested until his
televised contests with Al Gore in October. &QL;

   Locked in a comfortless marriage, Israelis and Palestinians can

was not able _ in pressure-cooker conditions _ to get Ehud Barak
and Yasser Arafat to compromise their positions, it probably means
that those positions, at least in the short term, are
irreconcilable. Yet history dictates that there can be no divorce. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ For all the fickleness of Japan's stop-and-go
economic performance over the last ten years, the economy has had
one reliable feature: falling property prices. Since 1990, the
value of Japanese real estate has plunged by over 60 percent. In
Tokyo, commercial property has shed more than three-quarters of its
value. This deflationary wrecking ball is still hard at work. At
last, though, a glimmer of light is intruding on the gloom.
Refreshingly, it does not come from the usual quick fixes that are
favored by the government. Rather, Japan is aiming its new reforms
squarely at the market's more deep-seated financial problems. &QL;

Telekom wants VoiceStream in part to win an America license for the
next generation of wireless services, known as 3G, which will carry
broadband data as well as voice. This is a looming disaster for
America's mobile-phone industry. The problem is that it has run out

   (UNDATED) _ For all the fickleness of Japan's stop-and-go
economic performance over the last ten years, the economy has had
one reliable feature: falling property prices. Since 1990, the
value of Japanese real estate has plunged by over 60 percent. In
Tokyo, commercial property has shed more than three-quarters of its
value. This deflationary wrecking ball is still hard at work. At
last, though, a glimmer of light is intruding on the gloom.
Refreshingly, it does not come from the usual quick fixes that are
favored by the government. Rather, Japan is aiming its new reforms
squarely at the market's more deep-seated financial problems. &QL;

BUSH GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHOW HE'S `READY' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   This has been something of a rollercoaster year for George W.
Bush. Last autumn, his nomination as the Republican presidential
candidate seemed inevitable: the governor of Texas boasted a decent
record, a likeable character, a well-known name, a new slogan
(''compassionate conservatism'') and the most formidable money
machine modern politics has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the McCain insurgency; by February Bush had quashed
the turbulent senator, but only by spending virtually all his
$70-million treasure trove and losing a good deal of both his
likeability and his moderateness. A snarling right-winger, he won
his party's nomination, but had apparently handed the November
election to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Republican convention beckoning next week in
Philadelphia, Bush has repainted himself once again. The
likeability is back; so is much of the moderation; and he has added
considerably more depth to the portrait.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, the supposedly lightweight Bush has
dominated the presidential campaign, unfurling policy after policy
and surrounding himself with serious-looking advisers; meanwhile,
Gore, the supposed policy wonk, has seemed stuck in a series of
tired relaunches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is slightly ahead in the polls; and unless something
terrible happens at what promises to be a heavily overscripted
convention, he can expect to increase his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Bush? In with a real chance. Of course,
Gore will get his own post-nomination bounce in the polls after the
Democratic convention later in August. When it matters, in
November, the vice president may have the edge: Gore has the
incumbent's benefit of a remarkably strong economy (so far) and he
is an impressively brutal debater, whereas Bush's showing against
McCain was dismal.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how endearing Bush seems at the podium next Thursday
night, the appeal of his new self-portrait will not really be
tested until his televised contests with Gore in October.
</P>
<P>
   With that caveat, there is still plenty to be said _ much of it
good _ about the Bush who comes to Philadelphia. Those who worry
about him tend to bring up two charges. They are the ones that
dogged the rise to the presidency of another western conservative
governor, Ronald Reagan. Bush is said to be too extreme and lacking
the intellectual capacity to be president. Those charges ring
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   On some counts, Bush does seem too conservative. He has been a
strong opponent of gun control, something that will deservedly do
him few favors with women voters. Texas also has a poor
environmental record, which Gore will blame, not altogether
unfairly, on Bush's ties to the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the popularity of the death penalty in the United
States, Bush's record as a serial executioner may come back to
haunt him, particularly if it becomes clear that some innocent
people have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   Probably none of these issues will cost Bush the election. The
previous Republican candidate, Bob Dole, lost his way with
independent voters, the ``soccer moms'' of lore, by seeming
socially illiberal yet fiscally profligate. On the key social issue
of abortion, Bush may have done just enough to win himself a pass.
Officially, he has stuck to the anti-abortion record of the
Christian right; but there have been enough nods and winks to guess
that Bush, like his father, would not strive hard to outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on taxes, the economy is helping. Like Dole, Bush put
forward a big tax cut. The new predictions for future budget
surpluses have not only made that seem a bit less reckless;
crucially, they have encouraged Gore to offer a big cut of his own.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Bush can claim to be a genuine reformer in
the vital matter of education. It would be better if he openly
campaigned for vouchers; but he is a far keener proponent of
structural reform in the public-school system than Gore, who is
firmly on the side of the teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been much braver about Social Security: Unlike
Gore, he would allow people to invest some of their public pension
in the stockmarket. Compassionate conservatism also introduces
fresh ideas about making more use of the private sector and
churches in helping America's poor.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, too, Bush deserves some credit. He has been
more solid than Gore on free trade. There are question marks about
his grip of the missile-defense debate, and more generally of basic
facts about the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who once called Greeks ``Grecians'' has tried to
bone up on the issues and to provide himself with competent
advisers. A Bush administration with Richard Cheney as vice
president and perhaps Colin Powell as secretary of state would be a
force to be reckoned with abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Take these policies, add Bush's long record of working together
with the Democrats in Texas and his Reaganesque record of picking
good advisers, and he surely has a plausible candidacy. Of course,
one can wish for more _ much more.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McCain, Bush will not shake up Washington's lamentable
system of money politics. On the other hand, there is precious
little hope of Gore doing so either. Bush may not be the perfect
candidate; but now his challenge is merely to prove he is a better
one than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Purely in terms of the policies, Bush is certainly ready for
that comparison. But the next three months will probably be even
more about character: not just intellect, but temperament. The
American people, most of whom have paid scant attention to the
events so far, will have to get used to Bush, and to trust him.
</P>
<P>
   This was the part of the test that that other supposedly
ignorant western governor, Reagan, passed so triumphantly 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans may decide whether Bush is ``ready'' in this
sense only when they come to pull the lever on Nov. 7. Philadelphia
offers his first real chance to convince them that he is.

CHENEY ADDS LITTLE TO THE TICKET AND DETRACTS LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Commentary Editors - This is ``Lexington'' column)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 From The Economist magazine

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When George W. Bush first described the running mate he wanted,
he said his choice would be ``electrifying.'' It ``would make your
eyes light up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when his campaign wanted a bright new face _ someone
who would reshape the political landscape and epitomize the
generational change by moving the Republican Party away from those
ghastly people in Congress. Evidently Bush has now had second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is a rock-solid candidate, with all the charisma of
that inorganic substance. He fulfills the Hippocratic requirements
of a vice president (''First, do no harm''). He will not
contradict, embarrass or outshine Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents are sometimes required to be the campaign's
attack dog. Cheney is easy-going, civil and patient, more like a
guide dog for the blind than the Hound of the Baskervilles.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, those may prove useful qualities. Cheney has
managed to play influential roles in Washington for a quarter of a
century _ most recently as defense secretary for Bush's father and
before that as No.2 in the Republican Party's hierarchy in the
House _ without making too many enemies in his own party (both
wings of which applauded this week's choice) or even among
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In picking his running mate, it was the cautious side of Bush's
personality that came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Caution has limitations as well as merits. One of Cheney's
advantages is that he seems to be no slash-and-burn Republican, no
Newt Gingrich. But note how he comes by this reputation: as a
leader of the generation that preceded the Republican revolution of
1994, not the one still recovering from it. When Cheney left
Congress to join President Bush's cabinet, the man who stepped into
his job as House minority whip was none other than the gentleman
from Georgia, Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney finally ends the Gingrich revolution. He brings the party
full circle. Personifying the status quo ante, he backs up Bush's
claim to be a new kind of Republican only if you think that going
back a political generation counts as going forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney does fulfill the two other requirements Bush made
when he drew up the vice-presidential job specifications: that he
could step into the president's shoes if need be, and that he
should get along well with Bush personally. Even here, though, he
does so in ways that have a downside.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Cheney is qualified to take over the presidency is
putting it mildly. In terms of executive experience, he is probably
the running mate best qualified to be president in modern times. He
was in the Oval Office at a daunting time in recent White House
history _ when Gerald Ford set about rebuilding the executive
branch of government after the disasters of Watergate (Ford picked
Cheney to be his White House chief of staff at the ripe age of 34).
More recently, he actually served as defense secretary during a
war: the one in the Gulf, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has borrowed this splendid curriculum vitae to provide
himself with some surrogate gravitas and instant credibility in
foreign affairs. This is widely seen in America as a smart campaign
move. For the rest of the world it could prove more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself brings _ how to put this politely? _ no great
burden of preconception about the world's affairs. His
foreign-policy advisers do not lack for experience; but they also
include more than the normal ration of people who want to make some
radical changes in foreign and military policy (step forward
Richard Perle, Ronald Reagan's Soviet-squashing ``prince of
darkness''). Having a relatively cautious old buffer around to wag
a wary paw is obviously an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the president himself is relying partly on the
foreign-policy judgments of others, Cheney's prudence and rather
mainstream hawkishness may not be enough. Especially when dealing
with new strategic threats, America may need a vice president who
can stand up and shove Bush in one direction or another _ and it is
not clear that Cheney would do that. This is one area where you
might want the vice president to bark more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the other quality that got Cheney
picked: loyalty. Even by the paranoid standards of American
politics, Bush insists on and inspires undivided allegiance. He
said a big reason for picking Cheney was his confidence that he
could work well with him, a judgment based partly on Cheney's
service with Bush's father. The younger Bush was disgusted by the
people who abandoned the elder one in the latter days of that
troubled presidency. Loyalty, argues the governor of Texas, is the
glue that keeps his campaign staff a successful unit.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, loyalty has much to commend it. Bush's team remained
remarkably undivided even during the dark days (for them) of the
McCain insurgency. But so much is loyalty prized in this circle
that there is a real danger that Bush will shut himself off from
the variety and richness of views that comes from getting
conflicting advice.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower, the modern president with the greatest
organizational experience, once said: ``I know of only one way in
which you can be sure you have done your best to make a wise
decision. You must get courageous men of strong views, and let them
debate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the Bush style. He surrounds himself with
long-serving allies. Many of them are no doubt highly capable
people. But there is a danger that they are too similar for Bush's
own good. Cheney, who until this week was the chief executive of
Halliburton, is even an oilman too.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the Bush campaign, even more than most, will
rise and fall on the candidate's own qualities. Cheney's lack of a
dowry in the form of votes from his home state expresses this
nicely (most of his political career was in Wyoming, which has a
grand total of three electoral-college votes, and where Democrats
are anyway on the endangered-species list).
</P>
<P>
   He adds little to the ticket and detracts less. The real lesson
from the Cheney nomination concerns Bush's growing self-confidence.
The name at the head of the ticket is the only one that matters.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, the choice of Cheney says that the
governor of Texas thinks he can win this li'l election all on his
own.

POST-SUMMIT TALK MORE CONDUCIVE TO GUNFIRE THAN NEGOTIATION

<P>
   Their return from Camp David was markedly different. Yasser
Arafat came home a hero, absorbing praise for not having buckled to
Israeli and American pressure. Ehud Barak came back to a crumbled
government, angrily blaming the collapse of the 15-day summit on
Arafat. The Palestinian, he said, had failed to make the ``historic
decisions necessary to end the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's reply is simple. ``The Arab leader has not been born
who would give up Jerusalem,'' he reportedly told Bill Clinton
during a heated exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jerusalem that unravelled the negotiations, though the
Palestinians say there were also no firm agreements on the right of
return of the Palestinian refugees, or where the borders of a
future Palestinian state would lie.
</P>
<P>
   The news blackout that persisted through the summit has turned
into storytelling. The Palestinians say Barak was offering them
sovereignty over several districts on the edge of Jerusalem's
municipal borders _ Israeli sources say these included Beit Hanina,
Kalandia and Shuafatin _ in return for Israel annexing three large
Jewish settlements, Maale Edumim, Gush Etzion and Givat Zeev, and
making them part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old City and areas adjacent to it, the offer was
apparently ``broad civilian and administrative autonomy'' over
Palestinian neighborhoods, including the Muslim and Christian
quarters within the Old City, and ``signs of sovereignty'' at the
Dome of the Rock. Israel would retain ``residual sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   By Israeli standards, these are far-reaching concessions. Barak
described on July 25 how he had offered Arafat a redrawn, and in
effect divided, Jerusalem. Clinton went out of his way to praise
him for his ``very bold decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is barely any Arab leader who could have countenanced
these new arrangements, let alone Arafat. Apart from its numerous
Muslim and Christian shrines, the Old City is home to 37,000
Palestinians, against 3,000 Jews. And like the rest of East
Jerusalem, in international law it is occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   The depressing thing is that since the talks did not lead to a
deal, all the positions taken at Camp David are now ``null and
void.'' Although they broke important taboos, they will not, at
least in theory, be the point of departure for future talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, like Barak, put his name to a statement reasserting that
negotiations based on United Nations resolutions were the only way
to reach an agreement, and committing the two sides to avoid
unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of talks.
</P>
<P>
   This was a signal to Israel to ease up on settlement
construction. But mainly it was a message to Arafat about his
declared intention, endorsed by the PLO's Central Council earlier
this month, to announce a state by Sept. 13, the deadline both
sides have accepted for reaching a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Alive to the consequences of a unilateral declaration _ Barak
has said Israel would respond with unilateral steps of its own,
possibly annexing settlements, and America's Congress is preparing
laws to stop all aid _ Arafat is anxious to find some way out.
Doing nothing is probably not an option.
</P>
<P>
   But if negotiations on an interim deal could restart, Arafat
might be able to fudge the statehood declaration in exchange for
Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state in principle, and
another swathe of West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``third redeployment'' that is still owed the
Palestinians under the Oslo accords, Arafat, who now controls only
40 percent of the West Bank, has asked for another 45 percent.
Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was Israel's prime minister, offered 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to negotiations could be grim. Israeli
intelligence experts believe that with the West Bank and Gaza now
convolutedly carved up between the Palestinian Authority and the
Israeli army and settlers, a declaration of independence by Arafat
would trigger widespread and violent demonstrations that could
quickly grow into wholesale military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   If his armed policemen side with the demonstrators, as they have
done in isolated incidents in the past, Arafat would have a hard
job quelling the clashes even if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army issued machineguns and sniper rifles to
settlers in the northern West Bank this week, and urged them to
help with fencing and fortification work around their settlements.
The chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, gave warning that if a
body of Palestinian civilians marched on any settlement, the army
would regard this as a mortal danger to Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of talk in the air, the post-summit atmosphere in
Israel is hardly conducive to reopening negotiations. Barak, in a
somber address to ``the citizens of Israel'' from Frederick, Md.,
on Tuesday, seemed to anticipate violent times ahead. We will know
how to unite, he said, as we have so many times in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak urgently needs to shore up his ragged government. He
prefers to do so with parties of the center, or even the right,
rather than try to rule with a minority leftist coalition dependent
on the votes of the Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
   But if peace talks with the Palestinians continue to dominate
the government's agenda, the parties that abandoned him before Camp
David _ Shas, the National Religious Party, and the Russian
immigrant party Yisrael B'Aliyah _ are unlikely to agree to return.
Even more damning, in the eyes of these parties, is the gradual
emergence of Barak's position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Key members of the Likud, the main opposition party, said they
would rather leave the party than participate in a Labour-Likud
coalition under Barak. Wednesday, the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon,
promised publicly that he would not enter into such an arrangement
_ although several of his colleagues maintain that he would if
Barak asked him.
</P>
<P>
   On the prime minister's left, the Meretz Party, and possibly
some members of his own Labor Party, would turn against him if he
struck a deal with the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Peaceniks in Israel are trying to find consolation in the fact
that Israel's decades-long, dogmatic insistence that Jerusalem is
non-negotiable has now been irrevocably punctured. Barak spoke
approvingly of the debate that the summit has generated inside
Israeli society over what parts of the area that Israel arbitrarily
defined as Jerusalem in 1967 are in fact of overwhelming national
importance to the Jewish state and Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Palestinian state, too, can have its capital
in parts of Jerusalem has been put on the table. Clinton says it
needs time for the idea to percolate among both nations. But the
clock, as Clinton also noted, is ticking against us all.

ECONOMIC SUMMITS PROMISE MUCH AND DELIVER NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Maybe they should take tips from the leaders of millennial
cults. They aren't yet predicting the apocalypse, but the heads of
government who gather each year at the G8 summit do tend to make
startling pledges.
</P>
<P>
   As the most powerful people in the world (the leaders of the
seven big industrial democracies plus Russia, together with the
president of the European Commission), they promise every summer to
tackle some of its worst troubles: poverty, disease, warfare, crime
and pollution, to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year on, they face the occupational hazard of humbler
soothsayers everywhere: how to explain to their followers why
nothing much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's summit in Okinawa between July 21 and July 23,
they found an answer: say it all again with feeling, plus Internet
initiatives. But respect tradition as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is presumably why their communique was laced as usual with
the anesthetizing gunk of globocratese _ ``partnership among
stakeholders,'' ``step changes,'' ``cultural diversity,'' even
``deeper peace of mind.''.
</P>
<P>
   On a more concrete level _ what had actually been done since
last year _ there was less to say. The leaders could only
``reaffirm'' last year's big idea: to speed up the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) scheme, meant to cut the debts of 41 of the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   When they met in Cologne a year ago, the G8 set as a target that
25 of these countries should receive debt relief by the end of this
year. So far only nine have qualified, and of those, only one _
Uganda _ has reached ``completion point,'' making it eligible for
cancellation of some of its debt. The others have reached
``decision point,'' allowing them partial relief.
</P>
<P>
   The delays can partly be blamed on the poor countries' own
corruption or war-mongering. But some, such as Tanzania, one of the
nine qualifiers, complain that last year's decision to make HIPC
``broader, deeper and faster'' actually increased the number of
hoops they have to jump through.
</P>
<P>
   This year's new idea, meriting its own ``Okinawa Charter,'' is
that something must be done about the ``digital divide'' caused by
unequal access to information technology. The leaders agreed to
establish a ``Digital Opportunity Taskforce'' _ yes, ``dotforce'' _
to help spread the wonders of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to worry about the potential for technology to
widen the gulf between rich and poor. But it is hard to dispel the
impression that the main thing was to give the summiteers something
new to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   In more measurable promises, of more immediate import to the
world's poorest people, the leaders endorsed specific targets and
timetables for the spread of primary education (to be universal by
2015) and the eradication of diseases (deaths from TB, for
instance, to be cut by half, and HIV/AIDS-infection among young
people to be reduced by 25 percent by 2010). It would be wonderful
if these could be met. A number of global initiatives are in the
works. Progress reports next year!
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible not to mock when governments skirt politically
difficult issues such as trade liberalization in favor of bland
generalities. Or when they fearlessly proclaim unpopular truths
such as: ``Every child deserves a good education''; or ``Health is
key to prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   They even addressed aging _ oddly failing to pledge that they
would wipe it out by 2020, and instead plunging further into
controversy by promising to ``promote a culture that values the
experience and knowledge that comes with age.'' That was brave.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they would keep in touch (by e-mail, of course)
between now and the 2001 summit in Genoa. It is the least they can
do now that ``a new era dawns''; it is probably also the most they
will do.
</P>
<P>
   How about using this exciting new channel of communication to
concentrate next year's agenda on action, not self-indulgent
blather? Alternatively, how about abandoning this sorry exercise
altogether?

FORMER CIA WHISTLEBLOWER IN CUBA DOT-COM VENTURE

<P>
   The forbidden fruit always tastes the best _ or so Philip Agee,
a former CIA whistleblower, is hoping. He has set up a
joint-venture dot.com company with Fidel Castro's government to
encourage Americans to defy their government by holidaying on the
forbidden island.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to soften
the travel ban to Cuba, the prospect of their actually making the
trip seems less implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Agee's Web site, called Cubalinda.com and designed for the
American market, offers travellers an ``unforgettable adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrill, he assured potential clients ahead of next week's
Havana carnival, would be provided by the exotic dancers and
festival floats, rather than the firm hand of an immigration
official on the shoulder when visitors returned to the United
States after breaking the travel ban against the island.
</P>
<P>
   Agee has been a thorn in the Americans' side ever since he left
the CIA at the end of the 1960s to write books denouncing the
United States for dirty wars across Latin America. Now he wants to
further a rebellion against the American embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see people ignore the law,'' he says. ``That's
what happened in the 1920s with prohibition; all our grandfathers
were making bathtub gin.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, American law bans the spending of any money in
Cuba, rather than visits outright. Exceptions are made for
academics, students, musicians and others who can get special
permits. Some institutions, like Harvard University, have general
licenses allowing any member to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could join a photo club in Maine online, which has a
general license,'' explains Agee, ``and then legally come to take
pictures of the carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans say that more than 160,000 American citizens visited
the island last year, many of them legally.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the response to his Web site so far, there is plenty
of potential interest. Agee says he got more than 600,000 clicks
during its first three months. Not all the messages were friendly,
however, particularly those from exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Americans have begun to hint at an easing of the
sanctions that have been in place for the last 38 years, it may be
that adventurous American sorts will feel readier to take the risk
right away.
</P>
<P>
   Cubalinda insists that even now there is no real risk for
American visitors. ``To our knowledge, no one has ever been
prosecuted for simply visiting Cuba,'' it declares. ``It is simply
a law designed to intimidate, but it is not enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Agee himself, he makes no apologies for advocating a
breaking of the travel ban. ``I stayed away from the United States
for 17 years on legal advice,'' he says. ``If I find I can't go
back now, it will not bother me in the least.''

TELECOM TYCOON AIMS TO WIN POWER IN THAILAND  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is too soon to write off Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecom
tycoon who wants to rule Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   His new party suffered a blow last Sunday, when Bangkok's voters
turned out in droves to choose a new governor. His candidate
managed to push the man from the ruling Democrat Party into third
place. But she lost heavily to Samak Sundaravej, a veteran
conservative whom most people seemed to think could get something
done about the capital's many problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thaksin is hoping that the parliamentary elections, which
must be called later this year, will be a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   They may be. Since forming the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998,
Thaksin has emerged as the main threat to Chuan Leekpai and the
ruling Democrats. Chuan became prime minister in November 1997 and
has done well to last this long, given the notoriously short
lifespan of Thai governments and the unwieldy seven-party coalition
with which he started.
</P>
<P>
   But a spate of no-confidence motions, a walkout by a large
number of opposition MPs last month in an attempt to force an
earlier general election and some controversial reforms leave his
government vulnerable to opposition attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thaksin, who stands on a pro-business platform, has been
sharpening his knives.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the governor's election in Bangkok would have been the
ideal start. In any event, Samak's toughness and previous
experience in government won the day. But his party is a local
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Thaksin has good reason to be more optimistic about the national
elections, where the advantages of incumbency and mass campaigning
benefit big parties. To compete better with the Democrats, Thaksin
has convinced more than 100 MPs from smaller parties to defect to
his Thai Rak Thai party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these faces from the past may undermine his fresh,
reforming image. So, too, might widespread accusations that he is
paying MPs to change sides. Nevertheless, he is betting that their
political connections in the upcoming election will be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   The poll will be the first national one to be held under the new
1997 constitution and monitored by a new electoral commission. In
theory this should make it easier for unknown candidates to win
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission showed some toughness in Thailand's
first-ever Senate elections in March, when it disqualified several
candidates for campaign violations such as vote-buying, and ordered
many reruns. But the commission may not dare to act as bravely
during a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Sunai Phasuk, an academic with the Asian Network for Free
Elections, says a tough electoral commission will be essential for
an honest and free poll, but he does not expect it to bare its
teeth and eliminate cheating candidates entirely. He points out
that around a quarter of the 200 new senators who were elected were
disqualified in one of the earlier rounds, but nevertheless
eventually prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   If Thailand's voters do reject incumbent politicians in favor of
fresh faces, it will mark a genuine break with the past. But unless
that happens it looks as if the Democrats and Thai Rak Thai will
emerge as the two main forces in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   That would open the door for a frantic scramble to gain the
support of smaller parties. This being Thailand, there are bound to
be plenty of scandals along the way.

IS JAPAN'S REAL ESTATE MARKET AT LAST NEARING A BOTTOM?  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For all the fickleness of Japan's stop-and-go economic
performance over the last ten years, the economy has had one
reliable feature: falling property prices. Since 1990, the value of
Japanese real estate has plunged by over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, commercial property has shed more than three-quarters
of its value. This deflationary wrecking ball is still hard at
work. Leading a nasty selloff of Japanese shares this week were the
same companies that have haunted the market ever since the property
bubble burst: construction firms, property developers and the banks
that financed their now-crumbling empires.
</P>
<P>
   At last, though, a glimmer of light is intruding on the gloom.
Refreshingly, it does not come from the usual quick fixes that are
favored by the government _ public land purchases, accounting
tricks and bail-outs. Rather, Japan is aiming its new reforms
squarely at the market's more deep-seated financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans finance almost all Japanese property purchases. The
poor health of their customers and the sorry state of their own
finances have, however, put banks off property loans. So developers
have no money for new investments. Japan hopes to break this
gridlock with new financial tools, imported from America's
sophisticated capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   One much-trumpeted development is the arrival of commercial
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), bonds serviced out of the
proceeds of property loans, and secured on the value of commercial
property and the rent that it produces.
</P>
<P>
   For lenders, these bonds have one big advantage over ordinary
property loans. They are traded in a secondary market, which
attracts pension funds and other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers, meanwhile, can finance their property development
``off balance sheet'': beneficial ownership of a building and the
debt that financed it are transferred to a separate company
specially set up for the purpose. In this way, they can tidy up
their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in part, the attraction in Japan, where big, heavily
indebted property developers such as Sumitomo Realty have started
using the CMBS market to trim their borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Moodys, an American credit-rating agency, expects new CMBS
issues this year of as much as 700 billion yen ($6.4 billion), more
than four times the amount sold last year, when the first CMBS
issue appeared.
</P>
<P>
   CMBS issues can be backed not just by healthy mortgages but also
by pools of non-performing property loans, of which there is no
shortage in Japan. Pioneering this part of the market are American
investors such as Cerberus, Lonestar, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs, which have been quietly buying deeply discounted portfolios
of non-performing loans from the banks. Industry sources say these
foreigners have invested $7 billion to $10 billion in such loans.
</P>
<P>
   Provoking even louder cheers is the pending introduction of
real-estate investment trusts (REITs), perhaps early next year. A
REIT is a specialized property investor. Like CMBS issues, REITs
offer holders of their securities the comfort of secondary trading:
their shares are listed on the stockmarket.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of official enthusiasm for REITs in Japan is the
unusual speed with which the required legal and tax arrangements
are being put in place. Sensing, perhaps, the government's resolve
to make the market work, property developers and investors have
announced their own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura, a securities firm, has teamed up with Mitsui Fudosan, a
big property company, to develop REITs. Mitsubishi Estate, another
big property developer, plans a REIT with Tokio Marine &AMP; Fire and
Dai-Ichi Mutual, two insurers. Sumitomo Life, Mitsubishi Trust and
Mitsui Fudosan, meanwhile, are putting together a property index
that will help the markets new investors to track their
performance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One unanswered question, however, is why Japan needs REITs at
all. Unlike America, all the big property companies are listed on
the stock market. Investors wanting to trade in the property market
can deal in the shares of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   As Etsusuke Masuda of HSBC, a British bank, points out, the
result will be that REITs will compete for investors with existing
property companies, with REITs holding several important
advantages. These will include: exemption from corporate taxes,
provided they pay most of their earnings out in dividends; balance
sheets that do not groan under mountainous debts; and no nagging
fears of hidden losses tucked away in dummy companies.
</P>
<P>
   The existing property companies are the most aggressive
promoters of Japanese REITs, so there will inevitably be some
conflicts of interest. If the property companies transfer some
existing assets into REITs, their own balance sheets are likely to
weaken further. This is because the market will probably demand
that REITs invest only in prime property, at least at first,
leaving the property companies with all the rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Even if REITs invest only in new property development, they are
likely to attract investors who would otherwise have bought
property-company shares. Either way, REITs will hurt property
companies' share prices, suggesting that the latter have not yet
thought through their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, says Masuda, is ahead of them. After a
REIT-inspired rally earlier this year, their share prices have
collapsed again.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is timing. In America, REITS flourished only
after the CMBS market had taken off. Investors first acquired a
taste for low-risk bonds; only then did they start making racier
equity investments in property.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese CMBS market, however, is in its infancy.
Mortgage-backed bond issues require a sophisticated appreciation of
credit risk. Every issue is sliced up into several tranches, with
each one carefully priced according to the likelihood that
investors will get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan deadbeat borrowers pay little more interest than
the best credits.
</P>
<P>
   Also lacking is the catalytic role that America's Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) played in creating the CMBS market, by
repackaging large volumes of bad loans for sale at market-clearing
prices. Japan's version of the RTC, the Resolution and Collection
Corporation (RCC), has no such plans. It fears a public outcry
should it start selling discounted loans. Most would be bought by
foreigners, who would then seem to benefit at the expense of the
Japanese taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   More important, discounted sales would require more public money
for the RCC, which Japan's politicians would resist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet without such fire sales, investors may have no confidence
that prices have cleared properly. ING Barings, an investment bank,
guesses that as much as 19-trillion-yen-worth of property is still
hanging over the market _ tied up in bad loans or hidden as
security behind banks bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Until this hits the market, all the effort that Japan is putting
into developing mortgage-backed securities, REITs and other foreign
exotica, welcome as they are, will seem rather beside the point.

REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS MIGHT HAVE GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There must be something to this
compassionate-conservatism business. It claims it can help even the
most disadvantaged. And there is evidence to support this.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of the stupidest, most self-destructive groups in
America has started to improve its behavior. We refer, of course,
to the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The majority party in Congress usually sticks to the same
script. It works itself into a lather, demands vast tax cuts, fails
to agree on its spending proposals in an orderly fashion, and then
stages a big confrontation with the president over the final
make-up of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president wins that battle, largely because the
public does not much care about the tax cut on which Congress has
lavished so much care.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. For the first time in living memory, the House of
Representatives may pass every one of the 13 bills that make up the
budget before it breaks for a recess at the end of July. The Senate
is only a little behind that cracking pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever remember there being this sort of turbocharged
activity in July,'' says Bob Reischauer, a former head of the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Republicans dumped all their tax cuts into one
basket _ a proposed income-tax reduction of $792 billion. This
year, they have parcelled out the cuts into bite-sized chunks.
</P>
<P>
   They have passed a bill to end the ``marriage penalty,'' the
extra tax that married couples pay above two people who file their
taxes separately (this would be worth some $290 billion over ten
years); and they propose to scale back the ``death tax'' on
inherited property ($100 billion). Both measures command widespread
support, which makes them harder for the president to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been costs. Republicans who came into
office in 1994 as fiscal lions have abandoned their budget
principles and are going out like lambs. Unless there is a
last-minute change, Congress is likely to spend at least 7 percent
more than the limit it had previously promised to stick to.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore of the libertarian Cato Institute reckons the
106th Congress (1999-2000) is likely to boost spending in all by 11
percent, making it the most profligate since the 95th (1977-78),
when Jimmy Carter was president.
</P>
<P>
   This splurge has involved ignoring all sorts of self-imposed
restrictions on spending. For example, tax cuts are supposed to be
offset by equal amounts of spending cuts. Congress has ignored that
rule and dipped into the surplus _ which is also formally
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Special ``caps'' are supposed to prevent spending above pre-set
limits. These caps have been routinely ignored, were raised in
1997, and are now being ignored again. Obviously, the increase in
tax revenues and the forecast expansion of the budget surplus make
all this possible. But those forecasts assume spending restraint
that Congress is not showing.
</P>
<P>
   There is not even any guarantee that the Republicans will end up
with an amicable settlement with the president this year. Clinton
has promised to veto the Republicans' tax cuts unless Congress
agrees to his version of a bill to improve medical coverage. He has
separately threatened to veto some of the spending proposals
(because they are too small).
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with the last few years, the Republicans in
Congress have been clever. They have passed tax cuts people have
liked. They are not cutting popular government agencies. They have
their answer ready to the deadly charge of being a ``do-nothing
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   To politicians in an election year, that is pretty much all that
matters.

LIMITING CAMP DAVID'S DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attention: Commentary editors)
 &HT;    
 From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Locked in a comfortless marriage, Israelis and Palestinians can
manage neither reconciliation nor divorce. The collapse of the
15-day marathon at Camp David showed that even the most zealous
marriage-guidance counselor couldn't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton was not able, in pressure-cooker conditions, to
get Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat to compromise their positions, it
probably means that those positions, at least in the short term,
are irreconcilable. Yet history dictates that there can be no
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant partners have to find some less-than-perfect way
of coexisting on their patch of land. The statement released by the
White House as the summit broke up without agreement Tuesday said
that the two understood ``the importance of avoiding unilateral
actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, both Arafat and Barak are anxious to avoid the
direct, and probably bloody, clash that would follow if the
Palestinians go ahead and declare themselves an independent state
without Israel's agreement, and if Israel in return annexes bits of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Their good intentions may melt in the heat of the summit's
post-mortems. Arafat, who is returning a hero, having resisted an
equivocal Israeli offer on East Jerusalem, short of the sovereignty
that his people see as their right, can afford to be more generous
in his assessment than Barak, who is returning to a messy domestic
scene, and is therefore blaming Arafat squarely for his obstinacy
in refusing the best offer the Palestinians are likely to get.
</P>
<P>
   Only a little more diplomatically, the Americans are also
blaming Arafat, which confirms Arab suspicions that, despite
Clinton's heroic dedication to deadlock-breaking, America's
pro-Israeli bias lives on.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, there seems little point in continuing the
search for a solution on Jerusalem _ though it is important in the
meantime that Israel does not make a bad situation worse by
unilaterally building more Jewish settlements in the Arab parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   So far as one can tell, the two leaders did fairly well on the
other big questions, including the borders of a Palestinian state.
The debate, airing taboo subjects, was useful in itself. But the
domestic vulnerability of both Barak and Arafat led them to insist
that the concessions they have made be kept secret _ which means
that they can now be spun into something rather different.
</P>
<P>
   As the Syrians and Israelis have already discovered, when
nothing is down on paper, it is difficult for new talks to start
from where the old ones broke off.
</P>
<P>
   The aim now has to be damage control. Above all, there must be
interim arrangements to preserve a sense of momentum, and soften
the coming confrontation over statehood. It is not possible to
leave things as they are.
</P>
<P>
   In the belief that it would help Barak to be elected, Arafat
broke an earlier pledge to announce statehood unilaterally. Without
considerable help, he will not be able to break, or modify, his
second pledge to declare it by Sept. 13, the date by which a final
agreement should have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Palestinian statehood is no big deal. The Israelis now
accept that it would be part of any final agreement. The
Palestinians currently control only about 40 percent of the West
Bank and Gaza, in non-contiguous chunks. Palestinian independence,
say the Palestinians themselves, would, at this stage, be
sovereignty over ``statelets in Israel's belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for that matter, is Israel's threat to annex further
territory the menace it is made out to be. So long as Barak remains
in charge, he is likely to annex only the Jewish settlements that
he is anyhow determined to keep.
</P>
<P>
   However, if either action is performed in a deliberately
provocative way, the results could be tragic.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the line are in fiery mood, angry both
with each other, and with their own government. Right-wing Israeli
settlers believe Barak to be giving away the store; Palestinians
are sick to their hearts with the unending frustrations of their
trapped existence. Even this week, radical Palestinians have been
demonstrating in Gaza, calling for a resumption of the intifada,
the youthful uprising of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Israeli army solemnly warns its government, a new
uprising would not be stone-throwing boys versus Israel's rubber
bullets. The West Bank and Gaza are now rich in weaponry. And if
things get out of hand, the swollen Palestinian police could join
the battle, rather than prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   How to avert this clash? Perhaps by incorporating discussion of
Palestinian statehood in a new set of interim negotiations. Going
back to the interim business is a sad, boring comedown after the
high expectations of a full agreement, but it may now, after the
collapse of the summit, be the most useful approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Oslo calendar, Israel still owes the
Palestinians another withdrawal, and should be releasing more
political prisoners. A generous interpretation of both measures
might recapture some of the goodwill that has been forfeited at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   And Palestinian statehood, a threat only if Israel perceives it
as such, would not change the reality on the ground, if carried out
on agreed terms. Nor would it make life better for most
Palestinians, let alone bring a permanent settlement closer.
</P>
<P>
   But if it stopped this sad, bad marriage from going up in
flames, that, for the moment, might be blessing enough.

<P>
   There are lots of reasons to question Deutsche Telekom's
$46.5-billion bid for VoiceStream, ranging from political
objections to its steep valuation of the American firm's customers.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most serious has hardly been mentioned. Deutsche
Telekom wants VoiceStream in part to win an American license for
the next generation of wireless services, known as 3G, which will
carry broadband data as well as voice.
</P>
<P>
   Those licenses are due to be auctioned this September; the bid
registration deadline is next week. But most of the licenses may be
virtually worthless for some time _ and with them any hope for 3G
spreading through America anywhere near as quickly as it takes hold
in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This is a looming disaster for America's mobile-phone industry.
The problem is that it has run out of room to grow: many of the
frequencies most appropriate for new voice and data services are
already being used by anybody from military-communications to
security-alarm firms, a legacy of America's over-generous spectrum
allocation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetest band of all, that in the 700 megahertz range, where
signals can travel easily through buildings, is occupied by UHF TV
channels that are used by about 100 stations scattered around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plans to auction off
this band to mobile-phone firms for 3G networks and any other
advanced services that winners may dream up. Among the firms
expected to register next week as bidders are AT&AMP;T, WorldCom, SBC
and VoiceStream, along with such giants from the computer and media
world as Microsoft, AOL-TimeWarner and maybe even Cisco. Total
bidding could reach $50 billion, exceeding even the record $35.5
billion raised by the British government's auction in March.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike previous auctions, the winning bidders will not be
free to roll out services as soon as they can build the networks.
The FCC is selling the spectrum ``encumbered,'' which is to say
already occupied by television stations in most regions.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the winning bidders somehow to coax the
stations to give up their valuable frequencies; but most stations
have refused to budge, since this would usually mean going off the
air entirely.
</P>
<P>
   If the stations do not give way, the wireless licenses will, in
effect, be useless. Although the stations are due to give the
spectrum back in 2006, when they switch to digital broadcasting on
different frequencies, they will not have do so if fewer than 85
percent of viewers have switched to digital receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Since it took 22 years for color TV to reach 85 percent of
Americans, and 16 years for video recorders, broadcasters could
squat on this valuable spectrum for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   This is a horrifying prospect for America's mobile-phone
operators. After falling far behind Europe and Asia, they have over
the last few years raced back, with a huge investment in digital
networks. The bet is that wireless networks will be the next
Internet; after dominating the technology industry for so long,
American firms are determined not to let it now slip from their
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But their main obstacle is a chronic shortage of spectrum across
the board, of which the encumbered UHF band is merely the most
immediate example.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most European countries, America's airwaves are
impossibly cluttered, thanks to its having been an early adopter of
commercial wireless services of all sorts (early radio technology
was far ``leakier'' than today's, and so had to use broader
frequency bands to avoid interfering with other services). Its
local spectrum-allocation policy has also left a crazy patchwork of
available slots in different bands.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hundt, a former FCC commissioner, estimates that by 2005
the wireless services now in use or planned will require 350-460
megahertz of spectrum, two to three times what is currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, European countries, which have been stingier over
doling out spectrum, are in better shape. Britain, for instance,
has more than 340 megahertz available, nearly twice the American
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis that could cost hundreds of billions of
dollars,'' Hundt told a conference on Tuesday. ``I'm calling on
everyone here to wake up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this problem will not be fully felt until a new
generation of wireless services beyond those now planned arises, 3G
will be the first big battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Asia will start deploying 3G networks over the next
two years. As they do so, their American rivals may find they are
unable to budge, blocked from using the licenses that have cost
them so much.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent congressional hearing on the problem, telecom
executives were raising the alarm. ``Selling off such severely
encumbered spectrum makes no sense. It's simply unusable,''
complained Dennis Strigl, chief executive of Verizon Wireless, a
joint venture between Vodafone and Verizon, which was created by a
merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Several potential bidders have asked the FCC to delay the
auctions until a solution to the dilemma is found. Given the
pressure, the FCC may be forced to push the auction back until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   How can a few small TV stations cause such trouble? Blame
Congress. In 1996 it passed a law designed to encourage the
broadcasting industry to move to digital television. In a sweep it
gave each station, in UHF and the other bands, a huge new chunk of
spectrum for digital services; it also allowed them to keep their
old analogue spectrum during the transition from one to the other.
</P>
<P>
   This was controversial for a number of reasons. First, it gave
away spectrum that could have been worth billions of dollars had it
been auctioned. Worse, it gave it to broadcasters, not the most
innovative of firms.
</P>
<P>
   And by not making them give back their old frequencies for a
decade or more, it locked up even more valuable spectrum for the
most pedestrian of uses, analogue TV broadcasting to a small and
shrinking market: viewers who still use basic aerials.
</P>
<P>
   If the UHF-broadcast market is as poor as that, why are the
stations so reluctant to give it up? Because the act of sending out
a television signal _ even if not a single person is receiving it _
brings with it a golden reward: a free channel on the local cable
network, thanks to the FCC's ``must carry'' provisions that ensure
that cable viewers can see all local stations.
</P>
<P>
   The moment a broadcaster stops transmitting a signal, it loses
its cable channel. And, since more than 65 percent of Americans now
get their television on cable, that means losing most viewers too.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters claim that they too are in a bind. Although the
same law requires them to start broadcasting a digital signal, a
bungled standard-setting process for receivers means that nobody is
watching. There are almost no digital TV receivers in America
today, and if the standards mess continues there will not be any
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has sweetened the pot by offering ``must carry'' rights
on digital cable systems for digital broadcasters, but these
represent a small fraction of cable subscribers today. Even if it
were to extend that to analogue cable, too, this would still
exclude the nearly 100 million Americans who do not subscribe to
cable.
</P>
<P>
   In similar situations in the past, the FCC has marched in and
seized spectrum, moving its occupants to other frequencies with
minimal compensation. But those tended to be niche industrial
users, such as microwave transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Television, on the other hand, is America's passion and is not
so easily pushed around. No wonder Congress voted to spare couch
potatoes any interruption of their favourite soaps, rather than
bring in unknown new services from what was, in 1996, a relatively
sleepy wireless industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is discovering the price of that decision. If the
spectrum-auction winners have to pay the TV stations to leave early
(or to switch channels with stations in other bands that are
willing to sell their space), the cost could exceed even that of
the auctions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broadcasters can hold the wireless industry to ransom,''
warns one telecom executive.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could change the law, of course, but that would mean
defeating the broadcasting lobby, which would be neither easy nor
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the controversy will hold up 3G telephony for years,
which will carry its own costs, both in the services available to
consumers and in the clout of America's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   European technology firms are used to envying their American
rivals, even to paying over the odds for them. But as the
mobile-phone gap widens, those days may be numbered.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hippy dreams have a habit of ending _ particularly
when they clash with the money-making instincts of the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the suits seemed to win another battle against peace,
love and happiness, when they were awarded a court injunction
effectively closing down Napster, a company whose software allows
its commune of users to trade songs for free.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, most of the signs are that free music may
win, man.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software allows users to exchange songs directly,
matching them up by maintaining a central who's-got-which-song
database. This directory has been closed. But only for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal is planned by Napster's legal team (which is headed by
the lawyer who led the antitrust team against Microsoft). And other
communal software devices will prove much harder targets to
vanquish through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Song-trading software programs such as Gnutella have no central
bits vulnerable to legal attack. Instead, users find songs by
linking one to the other, forming a sort of network akin to the
Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America has only itself to
blame. Music lovers wanting to collect songs on their computers _
hardly an unreasonable request _ have little choice but to do so
with Napster and its like.
</P>
<P>
   True, the industry's own Secure Digital Music Initiative is
creeping along, but it is about two years too late.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the very notion of secure music may be an illusion: a
song needs to be decrypted to be played, at which point it can be
digitized and traded. Already the betting is that the RIAA and
Napster will strike a deal, averting an expensive court case. More
generally some sort of compromise about online music is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this week author Stephen King released to the Web
the first chapter of his latest serialized horror story. Users can
download it for free, but are then supposed to send $1 per chapter.
So far most have. Though such a trust-based system will not work
for all artists, it might work with some.
</P>
<P>
   Another pointer is the fact that the music industry has cried
wolf before; the first time the enemy was cassette tapes, which
also seemed to portend the end of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, tapes did little damage: most fans were willing to
pay for the real thing, to get the colorful insert and other
accompanying miscellany.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that, if the music labels can put their songs
online in a format that is more organized and more appealing than
their illegal competitors can, fans would be willing to pay
something for that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Internet music, like rock and roll, is here to stay.
Hey, hey. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Audiences didn't know what to make of (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when it first popped up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of (beginitalic)E.T. (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost Ark(enditalic), here was a dark,
claustrophobic movie made on a tiny budget, with no big names in
the cast. The film's creators were two rookies: Joel and Ethan
Coen. The ``star'' was character actor M. Emmet Walsh, backed up by
an unknown actress named Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Every
time you thought you felt solid ground, a plot twist knocked you
off your feet. The whole thing just smacked of originality.
</P>
<P>
   But the style only seemed new. (beginitalic)Blood
Simple(enditalic), which was being re-released as a ``director's
cut'' in theaters Friday, was actually an homage to film noir, a
term coined by the French to describe American films released near
the end and in the aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of film noir is its sense of people trapped,''
Robert Sklar writes in (beginitalic)Movie-Made America,
(enditalic)''trapped in webs of paranoia and fear, unable to tell
guilt from innocence, true identity from false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its villains are attractive and sympathetic, masking greed,
misanthropy, malevolence. Its heroes and heroines are weak,
confused, susceptible to false impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Steven Spielberg, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles are familiar: (beginitalic)The
Killers(enditalic) (1946), (beginitalic)Double Indemnity
(enditalic)(1944), (beginitalic)Out of the Past (enditalic)(1947).
They are gritty, atmospheric films with reluctant heroes, scheming
females and ambiguous endings. They were underproduced, perhaps as
Hollywood's reaction to its own excesses.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which touches all the
bases, gained a cult following through video rentals and gradually
became known as a classic. After the now-famous Coens opened the
door, Hollywood walked through it, cranking out more noir-type
movies, such as (beginitalic)The Last Seduction, Red Rock West
(enditalic)and the popular (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Some were faithful to the noir style, while others
were simply made to look like noir while copping out in the end. So
as you watch (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), here's a
checklist of what makes good noir:
</P>
<P>
   1) Low production values - These are not high-budget
productions, at least in terms of lighting and sets. For the
perfect template, take a look at (beginitalic)Detour
(enditalic)(1945), about a hitchhiker who takes a fatal wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   2) The anti-hero - The main characters have to be slow on the
uptake (Burt Lancaster in (beginitalic)The Killers(enditalic)) or
at least disillusioned (Robert Mitchum in (beginitalic)Out of the
Past(enditalic)). They're not motivated by honor or duty, but by
greed or simply self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   3) The femme fatale - Here's where (beginitalic)L.A.
Confidential (enditalic)loses it, with Kim Basinger as the hooker
with the heart of gold. Noir women are almost universally evil,
from the vicious Peggy Cummins in (beginitalic)Gun Crazy
(enditalic)to the diabolical Linda Fiorentino in (beginitalic)The
Last Seduction(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   4) Plenty of double-crosses - You can't trust anybody in a noir
film, especially the people you're sleeping with. Just ask Fred
MacMurray, who was charmed by Barbara Stanwyck's anklet in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   5) A strong crime element - Most of the best noir movies involve
private detectives or cops. There are some ((beginitalic)Sunset
Blvd., Lost Weekend(enditalic)) that stray more toward the
psychological, but trench coats and guns really help set the mood.
</P>
<P>
   6) No happy ending - The hero doesn't live, or at least doesn't
escape jail. Despite Hollywood's penchant for pat endings, the noir
hero rarely survives the film, either because he doesn't tumble to
the bushwhack or he turns out to be a stand-up guy after all.
</P>
<P>
   7) Snappy dialogue - Edward G. Robinson to MacMurray in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic): ``Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. So head for the video store, and then
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), and you'll know your noir for
sure.

surprise that he consented to be publicly honored Tuesday at the

will hold a reception for him. He'll also address the convention on
foreign policy - but there may be controversy. The word is at least
a dozen of the Texas delegates are planning a silent walkout to

 &HT;    PFEIFFER SOAKS UP UNUSUAL ROLE IN ``WHAT LIES BENEATH''(a)

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS -- Michelle Pfeiffer's biggest problem making the
psychological thriller (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)wasn't learning her lines or even holding her own with
co-star Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   It was her buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to weigh me down because I kept floating up,'' says
Pfeiffer, whose character has a long, crucial scene in a bathtub.
``And my robe kept billowing, and so I had weights holding my robe
down and then I had this sandbag they would put on my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a member of the crew had to climb in the water with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this big guy - they called him Moose - and he would
hold me down during the scene,'' Pfeiffer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose and I became very close,'' she adds with a mischievous
grin.
</P>
<P>
   The tub sequence took two weeks to shoot, and Pfeiffer says she
was wet most of the time. But her character also played the cello,
so the actress had to find time to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how pitiful (it was),'' she says. ``I'd be in my
trailer, soaking wet with my robe on, with my wet nightgown
underneath, with my cello, with my soaked fingers, practicing my
cello like a drowned rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unglamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   The dunking aside, Pfeiffer, 43, says (beginitalic)What Lies
Beneath (enditalic)was a reach for her, especially since she had
never done a horror movie. She has always had range, playing roles
from a sultry singer in (beginitalic)The Fabulous Baker Boys
(enditalic)to a drug dealer's moll in (beginitalic)Scarface
(enditalic)to the seductive villainess Catwoman in
(beginitalic)Batman Returns(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who has twice been nominated for Oscars, made her film
debut in the teenage comedy (beginitalic)The Hollywood
Knights(enditalic), starred in (beginitalic)Grease 2 (enditalic)and
made a big splash in (beginitalic)Dangerous Liaisons(enditalic)
opposite John Malkovich and Glenn Close.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer became interested in (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)after learning that Robert Zemeckis
((beginitalic)Forrest Gump, Back to the Future(enditalic)) was
directing and that Ford had decided to star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would not have done it had it not been Bob
Zemeckis,'' she says, ``because I think these movies, the reason
they don't make so many of them is that they're hard to do, which
is why they always just resort to cutting people up when they want
to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zemeckis was happy to have Pfeiffer. He describes
her as a great actress with screen presence, a combination found
only in a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just gifted with this thing that you can't take your
eyes off them,'' Zemeckis says. ``They have power that just comes
off that screen, plus they have all this talent.''
</P>
<P>
   About Pfeiffer, Zemeckis added, ``You can't stop watching her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Pfeiffer's character, Claire, is married to Norman
Spencer (Ford), a respected researcher with a dark secret. The
truth starts to seep out as Claire begins to see the ghostly form
of a young woman and hears mysterious sounds around her house.
</P>
<P>
   Claire grows more paranoid and frightened as the supernatural
events escalate. She slowly transforms from a happy wife to a
suspicious woman to, ultimately, a frightened victim.
</P>
<P>
   Though it didn't dawn on her during filming, Pfeiffer later
realized that she was on screen in almost every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly started to think that it's just me walking around a
house for hours. It's going to be boring {hellip} but the other
character that is always with me is the camera,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Pfeiffer says, she's never experienced a
supernatural occurrence like those in the film, but she's open to
the possibility that such things exist:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have, and they're people that I really
respect {hellip} they're not crazy. So I would have to lean toward
being a believer.''

 &HT;    GOP DELEGATES CONSIDER BOYCOTT OF KOLBE SPEECH(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHILADELPHIA) - This isn't at all what Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
had in mind, not on his big night at the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe, the only openly-gay Republican in Congress, just wanted
to deliver a businesslike speech tonight on international trade, a
subject he probably knows more about than anybody in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But word filtered out Monday that a contingent in the Texas
delegation is considering a silent walkout during Kolbe's address
to protest the selection of a gay man delivering a prime-time GOP
convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, Kolbe said in an interview Monday, that he doesn't
plan to discuss gay issues in his speech, or even refer to his
sexual orientation. In fact, some gay-rights groups have wished
Kolbe would adopt a higher profile regarding their concerns in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never denied my sexual orientation. I just don't make a
point of it. It isn't what I do,'' Kolbe said. ``Clearly, I'm known
for the work I've done on trade and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe was silent for a moment when an (beginitalic)Arizona
Republic (enditalic)reporter asked him if he had heard that some in
the Texas delegation thought that his delivering tonight's speech
posed a moral issue, and that a protest was being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. And then: ``I have no comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Carlson, chairwoman of the Tarrant County Republican Party,
said many of the Texas delegates have told her they want to send a
message to Gov. George W. Bush in a ``quiet way'' and have
discussed walking out, according to (beginitalic)the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram(enditalic)'s online edition.
</P>
<P>
   She told the newspaper she was disappointed that Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, selected Kolbe to address
free trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (a silent protest) is appropriate if we get a
speaker like that, who is not representative of most of the
delegates' beliefs,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas delegate Cathy McConn of Houston told (beginitalic)The
Republic(enditalic), ``There was concern that he (Kolbe) was chosen
because he was openly gay - kind of like a quota'' But McConn said
she had not taken a position herself.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mary Cheney, 31, one of GOP vice presidential
nominee Dick Cheney's daughters, is openly gay, and plans to
actively campaign for her father.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe arguably will become the most prominent openly-gay
Republican to address a GOP convention, according to the Gay and
Lesbian Victory Fund and other advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that as of
early Monday evening, there hadn't been any communication about
Kolbe's speech between the Texas governor and Carlson or the other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and believe that the delegates will be respectful of
all the speakers. Congressman Kolbe is speaking because of his
expertise and leadership on the issue of free trade,'' Sullivan
said
</P>
<P>
   A Texas walkout would be certain to provoke a spirited defense
of Kolbe by Arizona's lawmakers and other delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republicans strongly supported Kolbe when he disclosed
his sexual orientation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response to him was very brief,'' Rep. John Shadegg,
R-Ariz., recalled the following year. ``I said, `Jim, it doesn't
make a difference to me whatsoever. I could care less.' ``
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mike Hellon, the Republican National Committeeman
from Arizona, said, ``It (a walkout) would be a black mark on an
inclusive, positive convention. For Gov. Bush's own delegation to
do that, it would be mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kolbe, first elected to the House in 1984, declined
to confirm or deny rumors that he was a homosexual. He finally
disclosed it rather than be ``outed'' on the Internet by activists
angry with his vote in favor of a Republican-sponsored bill to deny
federal sanction of same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   After he came out, Kolbe told (beginitalic)The
Republic(enditalic), ``I would rather be known as `Jim Kolbe, the
trade expert in Congress who happens to be gay,' rather than `Jim
Kolbe, gay congressman from Arizona.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan Wiesen, spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund,
said Monday, ``My sense is that most openly gay and lesbian elected
officials have to overcome attempts to pigeonhole them based on
their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe has quietly been an active member of the Log Cabin
Republicans, a gay political group that plans to honor him here at
a reception before the speech. He has consistently supported
legislation to ban employment discrimination against gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund,
said of a possible protest against Kolbe: ``I couldn't think of a
meaner thing that could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's organization, as well as other gay and lesbian
rights groups, have criticized the Republican platform as
antagonistic for, among other reasons, declaring that homosexuality
is ``incompatible'' with military service.

HARVARD ALUMS LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; News flash: Harvard MBAs love to throw money behind other
Harvard MBAs.
</P>
<P>
   As if they weren't already one of the tightest cliques on the
planet, a few alums decided at their recent five-year B-School
reunion that they wanted to make it even easier for their
entrepreneurial colleagues to raise funds from wealthy grads.
</P>
<P>
   Three Harvard guys last January started UniversityAngels.com, an
angel site to link individual investors with promising business
plans. The reason, says Rick Sasner, chief strategy officer for the
New York-based start-up: ``At one end of the room were people
looking for capital. At the other were people at financial
institutions looking for good deals to invest in.''
</P>
<P>
   So they jumped into the busy realm of matchmaking. Angel sites,
incubators, accelerators, and new venture groups are springing up
everywhere, in hopes of making a buck helping new companies get off
the ground. And the Harvard connection was, of course,
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a comfort level when a Crimson alum is looking at a
Crimson MBA's business plan,'' Sasner said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, along with its rival across the river, MIT, attracts
venture capitalists' attention at a startling clip. During school
months, Battery Ventures' Todd Dagres literally roams the halls at
MIT and lectures there. Polaris Venture Partners' Jon Flint and his
partners spend time with professors at both schools. They check in
regularly with the licensing offices at both to find out about new
technologies and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard and MIT really are spectacular incubators for
talent,'' says Flint, who attended Hobart and University of
Virginia Law. ``They have a history of success that breeds
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, more than 25 of the 100 business plans submitted to the
annual entrepreneur contest at Harvard won venture backing,
spokesman Jim Aisner says. Those are highly unusual odds. Most
venture firms say they look at thousands of plans every year and
fund only a few dozen, tops.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that every young buck at Harvard
who's gunning to win the business plan contest has a brilliant
idea. Flint points out that the firm looks at business plans from
graduates of many less famous schools. Indeed, he notes, along with
Harvard's talent comes plenty of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a level of arrogance there that's off the
charts,'' Flint says. ``Simply having a Harvard or MIT pedigree
does not ensure success.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the founders of UniversityAngels concede as much. They
decided to expand their initial concept of a Harvard-only site
(CrimsonAngels.com) to a network of sites that target alumni of 45
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 20 percent of the posted deals on the site still come
from Harvard. But the other 80 percent come from other schools
across the country. And not all plans make it through the company's
screens to the site. Of about 2,500 plans submitted to date, Sasner
says, 100 have been posted for review by angels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best feature of the site: Alumni get the first shot
at investing in their fellow alums. If you went to Brown and none
of your fellow grads invest in your business, after two weeks the
rest of the network gets to see your idea. More money potential for
the start-ups, a bigger talent pool for the investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sasner and his cofounders, James Marcus and Charles Sanford,
have completed one deal so far through the site. Galileo Designs of
Atlanta raised $135,000 in about a month for its
business-to-business software product _ and then went on to raise
more money outside the network afterward.
</P>
<P>
   What's perhaps most interesting about the angel site, Sasner
notes, is that it's not all about tapping 20-something brains. Lots
of entrepreneurs filing plans there have been out of school for
many years but are still interested in connecting with investors
who were educated as they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very mature, seasoned professionals looking for
opportunities,'' Sasner says. Only 5 percent of the plans come from
undergrads. About 15 percent come from fresh MBAs, while the other
80 percent come from people who've been out in the world for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   For Sasner and Co., this business is a way to cash in on both
their Harvard stripes and the hip playground of the new economy and
venture capital, where the latest Harvard grads are heading after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the UniversityAngels founders graduated,
investment banking and consulting were still hotter careers than
venture capital. Observes Sasner: ``Everything they taught us in
1994 was useless.''

MICROSOFT: CASTING A BROAD .NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: .Net is cq thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest software company on earth has launched its largest
new-product initiative ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Microsoft.NET, and though technology companies have
a bad habit of abusing capital letters, this time the odd spelling
makes sense. .NET is big _ perhaps as big as the antitrust ruling
that could dismantle Microsoft in a year or two. The company says
it'll spend $4.4 billion in research and development on the project
in this fiscal year alone. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates calls it
``a bet-the-company thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best evidence of .NET's massive scope is the
fact that it's so difficult to describe. .NET isn't one thing _ a
new operating system or a new programming language. It's nothing
less than a complete rethink of Microsoft's basic business model.
</P>
<P>
   A company grown fat on selling separate chunks of software to
users of desktop computers has come to realize that this won't work
any more. Computers now come in all shapes and sizes, from laptops
to palmtops. More important, they're all learning how to talk to
each other, using the free, open communications standards found on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of smart networked devices, almost every part of
Microsoft's business has to change. The .NET program is Microsoft's
remodeling blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjay Parthasarathy, a software development vice president at
Microsoft, used to manage Microsoft's corporate Web site, one of
the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running Microsoft.com, I had a kind of epiphany,''
he says. On a browser, ``what you see are pictures of information.
You don't have the real information.''
</P>
<P>
   You can cut and paste text from a Web page to a word processor
or spreadsheet on your own machine. But users would have a lot more
power if they could work directly on the data in the Web page
itself.
</P>
<P>
   .NET aims to make this possible by means of ``Web services,''
chunks of active code running on remote Internet servers but
available to people all over the network. A financial Web site
could use a service that would cause customer financial data to
appear inside a full-featured spreadsheet program. The customer
would be able to enter new data, run what-if financial scenarios,
and even save the results to the hard drive of his own machine.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about the idea of having a program running
remotely, but .NET aims to make the process seamless and nearly
invisible to the user. For instance, the spreadsheet wouldn't pop
up in a separate window, but would be built right into the
financial company's Web page, a concept that Microsoft calls the
``universal canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the system work, Microsoft has been forced to abandon,
at least in part, its traditional affection for ``secret sauce'' _
fancy features based on private Microsoft technology that can't be
emulated by other companies. The world's computer networks are
built around openly published software standards; to be taken
seriously, Microsoft.NET has to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   So the system relies on XML, a network language that's much more
powerful than the HTML language that's generally used to create Web
pages. XML is an international open standard, controlled by the
World Wide Web Consortium in Cambridge. Microsoft can use it, but
it can't control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart and soul of .Net . . . is XML,'' says Parthasarathy.
``If you cut us around here, these days, we bleed XML.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is vital because it makes it easy to separate the
content of a document from the form in which a computer displays
it. That means that the same XML-coded information can be displayed
easily on many different types of electronic devices. Nowadays, Web
pages must be painstakingly modified to fit on pocket-size Web
phones. But in a .NET world, XML-based sites will automatically
format themselves to fit a PC, a cell phone, or any other viewing
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft developed a new communications protocol
called SOAP that allows its new Web services to work. But in a
break from Microsoft tradition, the company has released SOAP as an
open standard, allowing any software developer or Web designer to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   With XML, SOAP and Microsoft's universal canvas, Web designers
will be able to add powerful new features to their sites simply by
subscribing to them. Microsoft itself plans to offer a number of
Web services that it expects will be especially popular.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company already has a service called Passport
that lets you log into multiple Microsoft Web sites by entering a
password just once. Your personal information is then made
available to all other Passport sites, eliminating the need to sign
up for each one separately.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft figures there'll be considerable demand for such
services. It will offer a Web-identity service that will identify
users instantly to any site they choose. Other Web services will
include search engines, a calendar, and online data storage. A Web
site designer would simply subscribe to these services, and they'd
appear as integral parts of his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   And they won't have to buy from Microsoft. Using .NET
programming tools, other companies can create their own Web
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables a whole new level of competition on the Web,'' says
William Zachmann, vice president of the Meta Group, an industry
analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
   Web services won't just be relatively lightweight applications.
Microsoft is going to deliver its entire office software suite this
way, in a service called Office.NET. Rather than buy Office
outright and install it on a home computer, a subscriber will be
able to pay a monthly fee for the right to use, say, the Excel
spreadsheet as a Web service.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft isn't just counting on software rental revenues to
turn a profit on the .NET initiative. If it's successful, the
company stands to sell lots of .NET-enabled versions of its Windows
operating system. Even if other companies embrace the .NET approach
and make their products compatible with it, Microsoft could give
itself a headstart so large that rivals could never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The .NET strategy is also a direct assault on one of Microsoft's
most bitter rivals, Sun Microsystems Inc. Sun has garnered an
international following for its Java computer language. Programmers
like Java because the same piece of code written in Java can run on
many different kinds of computers with minimal changes. Instead of
writing software that'll only run on Microsoft's dominant Windows
platform, Java programmers know that their code can run on many
other kinds of computers as well.
</P>
<P>
   But only if you write in the Java language. That means throwing
away billions of lines of programming code already written, not to
mention the challenge of learning a new language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says .NET offers a better way. The company will offer
new software development tools that'll make traditional computer
languages work more like Java. Already it's introduced C(NU), a new
version of the venerable C operating system that's intended to be
more Java-like. And the company is working to .NET-enable other
computer languages as well. The idea is for Microsoft to sell lots
of software development products, but also to encourage the fastest
possible rollout of .NET-compatible services.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Software Engineering Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
makes a computer language called Eiffel that's used by banks and
financial institutions. The company has worked with Microsoft to
.NET-enable Eiffel by adding a feature called a ``common language
runtime,'' which is similar to the ``virtual machine'' that lets
Java programs run on many different kinds of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Meyer, the company's president, says that with common
language runtime, .NET programmers will be able to write in any
language they like _ Visual Basic, C, COBOL, or Eiffel _ and get
the same kind of versatility now offered by Java. For example, five
programmers working on a large project might each write in a
different language, but their finished code would interact without
a hitch. ``It is in very much contrast to the Sun approach which
says, `Use Java or you are lost,' '' says Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Lowe, a programmer at ARINC Inc., an aerospace software
company in South Carolina, says the Microsoft approach is
well-suited to the way he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common language runtime on the .NET platform . . . makes
our lives easier because we can now use one language to write
components, program SQL Server (a popular database program), and
develop Web pages.''
</P>
<P>
   But Java boosters are less than awed by Microsoft's approach.
Sun spokesman David Harrah says that the common runtime would only
work for people using a forthcoming new version of the Windows
operating system, Windows.NET, which is due out next year. Besides,
he notes that unlike .NET, Java has something of a track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's five years old and it has a great deal of substance to
it, and 2 1/2 to 3 million developers,'' says Harrah.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ross, president of the Java Lobby, an organization of Java
programmers, is even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for me to believe that C(NU) and .NET isn't
just another way to dress the wolf up,'' Ross says. ``Just a
different color of sheep's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Microsoft's reputation for harsh tactics used against
rivals and business partners alike, many a developer may hesitate
to stake his company's survival on the future of .NET. But
Microsoft has already done just that.

WHERE YOUR ENEMY ALSO IS YOUR FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ With enemies like Jim Clark, who needs
friends?
</P>
<P>
   Clark has become the talk of Silicon Valley this past week after
disclosing that he recently purchased 1 million shares of Microsoft
Corp., despite having helped the federal government in its
antitrust case against the software company.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks know the erstwhile Microsoft basher as one of the
founders of Netscape Communications, the firm whose Web browser
went toe to toe with Microsoft's Internet Explorer product and
lost. Clark got his revenge when he played a key role in the US
Department of Justice's successful bid to nail Microsoft for trying
to put Netscape out of business.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Shortly after a federal judge ruled in favor of
the government and ordered the breakup of Microsoft, Clark quietly
bought the company's stock, which at the time traded between $65
and $73 a share. Microsoft shares inched up 31.25 cents Friday to
$69.6875 on the Nasdaq exchange. At around the same time, Clark
sold about 95 percent of his shares in America Online, the company
that purchased Netscape last year.
</P>
<P>
   Why the switch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to diversify,'' Clark quipped to an incredulous
audience who gathered here last week to hear him speak. Clark also
disclosed that he has started using Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is rich gossip for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But is it shocking? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   There's a notion in the technology industry called
``coopetition.'' It's a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to doing
business, where companies can be ferocious competitors in one
market and cheerful partners in another.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, who started Netscape with Clark and once
referred to Microsoft as ``Godzilla,'' agreed weeks ago to do
business with his former foe. Loudcloud, Andreessen's new Silicon
Valley venture, will team up with the Redmond, Wash., giant to
jointly market, sell, and license software.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. are brutal
competitors in the market for Internet switches and routers, but
the two are working together to come up with the Web's
next-generation infrastructure in a project called Internet2.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Corp. and EMC Corp. compete in the market for
data storage devices. But when it comes to developing the software
to connect EMC machines with Hewlett-Packard's, the two companies
closely collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Corp. in Redwood Shores, Calif., and SAP AG in Frankfurt,
Germany, try to clobber each other when it comes to the database
software market. Both, however, work together to sell Oracle
hardware coupled with SAP software. Larry Ellison, Oracle's CEO,
recently acknowledged that SAP is ``both a competitor and a
supplier. We see no conflict there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strange bedfellows are Apple Computer Corp. and Microsoft,
whose operating systems are direct competitors. Nevermind that
Microsoft is an investor in Apple and one of the biggest developers
of software for Apple's Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One the one hand, Microsoft is in a zero-sum game with
Macintosh,'' in selling operating systems, said Guy Kawasaki,
former chief evangelist for Apple and now chief executive of
Garage.com, an investor in early-stage start-ups. ``On the other
hand, Microsoft makes some of the best software for Macintosh. It
really gets complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Or mercenary.
</P>
<P>
   John Doerr, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist with
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, recently contrasted
``missionaries'' and ``mercenaries'' in the Valley, using Clark as
an example of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with a mercenary approach. Many
companies simply look at it as survival. ``If you have to get in
with an enemy, well, that's life,'' said Judith Hurwitz, CEO of the
Hurwitz Group in Boston. ``That's how this industry has grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clark, the entrepreneur's relationship with his old
nemesis, Microsoft, has another twist. When Clark, who founded
medical Web site Healtheon, found out Microsoft would be investing
in rival WebMD, he decided to join Microsoft _ literally _ by
merging Healtheon with WebMD. Microsoft subsequently invested $250
million in Clark's company.
</P>
<P>
   What's Clark learned from his dealings with Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got overwhelming power,'' Clark told his audience of
800 last week. ``It's good to be in alliance with them . . . unless
they're in the same exact business you're in.''

TELECOM: OUTWARD BOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hotter trends in telecommunications today is unified
messaging, with dozens of firms offering new services to collect
all your voice mails, e-mails, and faxes in one digital mailbox to
save you time and hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the action is beginning to heat up on the flip side of
unified messaging _ ``outbound'' services that let you create a
message that is delivered simultaneously to dozens or hundreds of
people as an e-mail, a message on a cell phone or pager, a fax, and
even as a synthesized voice call.
</P>
<P>
   EnvoyWorldWide, known for its MessageBlaster service, is
introducing a new service with Bidder's Edge, a Web Burlington,
Mass. site that collects information about 170 Internet auction
sites and notifies subscribers when new bids have come in or
auctions are about to close.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Bidder's Edge is using MessageBlaster to power a
service called PingMe that lets people track auctions and get a
message in any format they want.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chaining yourself to the computer to follow the
auction for that 1969 Phil Esposito hockey card you're dying to
get, you can arrange to have any type of message sent to you
whenever there is a development in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   In one version of the Bidder's Edge service, you could arrange
to get a phone call from a speech synthesizer that would tell you
of a development in a bid, then let you use your phone keypad to
dial in a new bid.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a new market for EnvoyWorldWide, a
Billerica, Mass. company whose system has been purchased by
businesses that want to be sure they get crucial information to
employees and executives through whatever communications device
they might be using.
</P>
<P>
   One recent client is Myteam.com, which uses MessageBlaster to
inform soccer-league parents and coaches when a game has been
canceled or a practice rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy president Alain Daste said he sees a host of potential
markets, including trucking businesses wanting to get job
information to drivers and corporations wanting to alert employees
when the latest virus begins infecting e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susie in San Francisco might be delighted to get a long voice
mail from you, but before you pick up the phone to call Schatzie in
Stuttgart you might want to send a fax instead.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion comes from a survey by Pitney Bowes of Stamford,
Conn., which looked at the messaging preferences of people in North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, while 97 percent of white-collar workers in the United
States say they use voice mail several times a week or daily, only
35 percent in Germany do, and less than 75 percent in France and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Germany ranked highest in frequent usage of faxes, at 93
percent, ahead of the United States at 80 percent. And perhaps
reflecting the more laid-back approach to work on the Continent, 5
percent or fewer of British, French, and German workers carry
pagers _ compared to 25 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Study author Meredith Fischer, a Pitney Bowes vice president,
said people should be aware of ``marked cultural tendencies.''
While many Americans are fine with trading voice mails, Europeans
find long voice mails ``irritating and somewhat of a personal
imposition,'' and Germans and French workers greatly prefer
traditional paper communication, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, the Atlanta Internet service provider, has added
Boston to markets where it is offering a self-installation plan for
getting high-speed digital subscriber line Net access. Verizon
Communications offers a similar plan, but it can sometimes be hard
to find stores that sell its DSL modems.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink's service does not completely eliminate waiting to get
DSL. You have to call EarthLink to order the service; then the
company tells you when you can expect to have your DSL line
activated and ships you the necessary modem, filter, and software
to plug in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   For now, EarthLink only promises to reduce installation times by
up to 50 percent _ which may mean waiting two weeks instead of
four, but saves you waiting around the house for an installation
guy to show up. Genuity of Burlington, the former GTE
Internetworking, is partnering with EarthLink to offer the service.

PICTURETEL FUTURE HANGS IN BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PictureTel Corp.'s new president, Lewis Jaffe, says he can make
the troubled videoconferencing company profitable by next year with
new products that allow faster data transmission, giving users the
ability to butt into conversations.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel has suffered losses and layoffs since 1997 as the
market for its equipment has stalled and competitors have gained
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But PictureTel hopes its fortunes will change as it rolls out
new products that process audio and video signals so quickly that
users will be able to interrupt each other when speaking on
videoconferences.
</P>
<P>
   The question of manners aside, most conference-calling equipment
to date has lacked the capability of interruption. The feature
makes video-based conversations seem more natural, and PictureTel
hopes it will also lead to more orders from corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exhausting if you need to sit and wait until you
know someone's done speaking,'' Jaffe said. ``It adds tension to
the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel won't divulge sales targets for its equipment, known
as the 900 Series. But the Andover, Mass. company needs a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock is down about 90 percent from its 1995 high of
$43.125. It already warned it won't meet expectations in its
second-quarter earnings, due out Aug. 1. And, in April, its
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, warned of ``substantial
doubt'' about PictureTel's ``ability to continue as a going
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 900 Series has been much anticipated in the
videoconferencing industry. And despite the earnings problems, the
company this month received investments totaling $22 million from
Intel Corp. and the State of Wisconsin, and arranged a $35 million
credit line.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think the reception of the 900 series could make or
break the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really need this,'' said analyst Andy Nilssen of
Wainhouse Research LLC. ``From what I've seen, it's either a
breakthrough or at least a really nice step forward. The bad news
is, they've lost a lot of market share while they've been getting
it ready.''
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel has already delayed the rollout of the 900 Series by
several months, meaning it will have more ground to make up against
competitors such as VTel Corp. of Austin, Texas, and Polycom Inc.
of Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The 900 Series devices are based on an Intel-backed PC software
standard known as `iPower,'' rather than the proprietary systems
PictureTel previously sold. The interruption capability stems from
audio software that processes signals with delays of just 200
microseconds, half the previous norm.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature allows 900 Series users to display paper
documents to each other in a separate on-screen window that will
display typeface fonts as small as 8 points, compared with the
previous minimum of 24-point typefaces. Prices will start around
$10,000, a third of some of PictureTel's current offerings.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel has also begun an Internet-based subsidiary to
arrange video-conference calls, but the bulk of its 1,100 employees
still work on hardware. Before layoffs, employment peaked at 1,500
in 1996, mostly in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   But PictureTel stumbled as competitors offered cheaper products
with some of the same features, such as the ability to support
conferences from several locations at once. Last year, the company
lost $84.5 million on revenue of $323.3 million, and earlier this
month said it would report a wider-than-expected loss for the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel turned out its previous chairman and chief executive,
Bruce R. Bond, last year after 20 months with the company following
hardware and software bugs in its products, which prompted some
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The top titles have since reverted to cofounder Norman Gaut.
Jaffe was named president and chief operating officer on June 21. A
consultant who headed the restructuring practice at Arthur Andersen
LLP's Boston office, Jaffe had already begun working with
PictureTel when he was hired full time.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe said more layoffs are still possible unless revenues
increase. He has also saved $5 million by canceling leases for
space near Andover where PictureTel once expected to employ nearly
2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Jaffe insisted the 900 series is ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 900 is later than anticipated because of rigorous
testing,'' he said. Referring to the product recalls, he said:
``The company knows it can't go throught that experience again.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a video link from another room in PictureTel's
headquarters, Jaffe's conversation seemed as direct as the words of
Captain Kirk appearing on-screen on the Starship Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether the technology will be enough to
breath new life into the company. One reseller of PictureTel
equipment, Jim Brown of Pittsburgh-based RoData Inc., praised the
900 Series but said it may be difficult for PictureTel to win back
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have the market-leading piece of gear, but to
leverage old accounts who may have just invested in competitors'
technology is going to be their challenge,'' Brown said.

WALL-TO-WALL WIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Coming soon to a housing development near
you: wall-to-wall Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Touting it as the best invention since indoor plumbing, Cisco
Systems Inc. and real estate developer Playa Vista have teamed up
to introduce the next-generation, ultra-wired homes.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having instant, high-speed Internet access from any
phone jack in the house. Refrigerators, televisions, ovens, lights,
alarm systems would all be connected to the Web. That, of course,
means being able to control these appliances from any Internet
browser in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Playa Vista is building 14,000 of these high-wired homes in West
Los Angeles using Cisco's ``gateway'' technology to provide
ubiquitous Internet connections. The first of these ``smart homes''
is scheduled to be completed in April.
</P>
<P>
   What new capabilities will they offer?
</P>
<P>
   Residents will be able to preheat their oven on their way home
from work from a personal digital assistant that is connected to
the Internet. They can turn on the home security system from their
cell phone at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   When they're away from the house, they can monitor their
children through a Web cam. Defective appliances theoretically have
the ability to automatically self-diagnose and send an e-mail to
the manufacturer to dispatch a repair crew.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is already available in bits and pieces. Many
personal computers now have high-speed Internet connections. And
with some effort, consumers can network several devices together to
share Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   What's new, Cisco executives say, is the ability for all devices
in the home to easily share a single Internet connection through
its gateway, a notebook-size black box that distributes Internet
access throughout a house. To get access, consumers would only need
to plug a device into any phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will become a utility, like water and
electricity,'' said A. Jared Headley, consumer solutions manager
for Cisco, which opened a model ``home'' on its corporate campus in
San Jose last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco plans to sell its gateway devices to housing developers
across the country, but also seeks to reach consumers who are
looking to wire existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The devices, expected to be on the market in about six months,
will cost $500 each. That would not include the monthly fee charged
for the Internet service itself. Nor would it include the cost of
installing high-speed wires, which would add another $1,500 for an
existing home. Adding custom appliances, home entertainment
systems, and security devices could jack up the price tag by
$50,000 to $100,000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Each Cheney upside has a downside
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you think about it, and whatever you think of it, it is a
distinctly odd ticket that Republicans have convened in
Philadelphia to hosanna and to launch into the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was either, in the cliche, thinking outside the
box or not thinking at all when he picked Dick Cheney as his
running mate. Either way, no candidate before ever thought of going
to the voters in a tandem of two big oil guys from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This a balancing act akin to a one-arm high wire artiste.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the announcement gave Bush a nice boost, taking W. from
a statistical dead heat with Al Gore in most polls to a 10 or more
point lead. Until its durability is tested, it's anybody's guess
whether the bump is because the choice is wildly popular or just
because, with few voters paying attention to either campaign so
far, prime time attention for anything better than a loitering bust
is a boon.
</P>
<P>
   The political accounting is mixed but would seem to lean to the
deficit side.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney certainly brings assets. As Bush said, he is a serious
man of proven public ability and completely credible as an
emergency president if it should come to that. He adds, if no
notable zing, the virtues of experience, calm counsel and
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as well, is canny in the ways of Washington, a former
congressman who, as a cabinet officer, served Bush the First well.
</P>
<P>
   But each of those points has a downside. It is at least awkward
for Bush that there should be a sensed need to bolster him with
companion gravity, as if he were not weighty enough on his own.
Cheney's selection adds to the impression -- already strong from
the many holdovers in the campaign _ that the proposed, new Bush
administration will be pretty much a revival of the first, with a
younger stand-in playing the real George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Is George W. his own man or just poppy's boy?
</P>
<P>
   It is clear enough who Cheney is. His congressional record met
every right-wing litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   He voted against Head Start and all gun control, including
regulations on armor-piercing bullets and a ban on plastic handguns
that can evade airport X-rays. He voted to cut AIDS research. He
opposed sanctions against South African apartheid and even a
resolution urging that Nelson Mandela be freed from prison. He
consistently fought environmental protection, even voting against
renewal of the Clean Air Act. He is an anti-abortion absolutist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is betting Cheney's record will validate his candidacy with
the party's ever-restive right but that his mild manner and
civility will make Democratic efforts to exploit that record seem
alarmist. Cheney refuses to foam at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. First Bush chipped a few of the pricklier burrs off the
hard right Republican Party platform, to make a little room for the
compassion part of his compassionate conservatism. Then he turns
around and names a man of the hard right to serve, he promises, as
one of his chief counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is it to be, really?

 &HT;    Roll out the Maytag and let the fun begin
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELEE ISLAND, Ont. _ ``Okay, girls,'' Robin hollers, ``let's get
to it. Time to roll out the Maytag.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a relative newcomer to the island, and to octogenarian
Robin's sisterhood of gentlewomen of a certain age, I think she's
talking about some kind of dance _ maybe to the tune of Beer Barrel
Polka. I couldn't be more wrong. She's talking about laundry. It's
time to tear it up, clean it up, and wash everything that can't
outrun us _ in a 40-year-old wringer washer.
</P>
<P>
   Robin, in cut-offs and a pink terry tube top, directs the action
as she rolls the Maytag out of the storeroom and into the back
yard. My job is to haul hot water from the kitchen sink while
Sharon and Pat fill two galvanized rinse
</P>
<P>
   tubs with the garden hose. Right away I start in whining. ``Why
can't I have a cushy job like theirs?'' Robin says I can, just as
soon as I finish hauling the water and wiping off the clotheslines.
</P>
<P>
   If I thought playing Gunga Din in my nightshirt was a pain,
navigating the backyard to get to the clotheslines is even worse.
Recent heavy rains have turned it into a veritable swamp, and even
though I give the terrain a quick once-over before setting out, I'm
still into it over my sneaker tops. Clutching a wet rag, and
swearing under my breath, I slosh on, thinking once I reach higher
ground I'll be fine. Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the black flies and mosquitoes take over. Obviously,
I'm the lead item on their breakfast menu. Instinct tells me to
drop the rag and run for cover, but I hate looking like a sissy. So
instead, I dance my way up one
</P>
<P>
   clothesline and down the other, slapping and wiping, and calling
my attackers names that would curl their mothers' wings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I've beaten my way back through the bog, the old
Maytag is whooshing around a load of sheets. Pat, is rinsing a
clothes basket with the hose, and Sharon is poking around in the
washer with the non-business end of a
</P>
<P>
   long-handled squeegee.
</P>
<P>
   Robin flips a lever on top of the wringer to position it between
the washer and the first tub of rinse water as she explains to me
the quick-release mechanism on the top. ``If you get anything
caught in the wringer,'' she says
</P>
<P>
   with a sly grin, ``hit this red thing and it'll let it go.'' I
resist the obvious comment.
</P>
<P>
   It's rinse time now. Robin slides the agitator gear shift handle
into neutral and the wash stops splashing. Then she checks to be
sure the rollers are headed in the right direction before she feeds
the first sheet through.
</P>
<P>
   My job is simple. All I have to do is be sure the stuff coming
through the wringer doesn't roll around and get all tangled up and
cause an assembly line shut-down. So far, according to Pat and
Sharon who have somehow been promoted to on-site supervisory
status, things are going well.
</P>
<P>
   Then... ``It's got my rubber glove!'' Robin hollers, holding up
one bare hand as digital proof. I check. Sure enough, here comes
this yellow thing with bloated fingers squishing through the
wringer. Just before it clears, one
</P>
<P>
   finger explodes. I remind her not to lean into her work.
</P>
<P>
   Two gloves later, we've rinsed and are ready to hang. My
nightshirt is dripping wet, and we have four more loads to go. Pat
and Sharon are on clothespin detail. ``Hang the underwear on the
middle line where it won't show,'' Robin calls after them. They
argue that since the lines are 50 yards from the road it won't
matter. Robin insists. ``I don't want a bunch of tourists walking
by and looking at my drawers.''
</P>
<P>
   By three in the afternoon, we've earned our cocktail hour.
Everything is dried, folded, and put away _ except for a few damp
pieces draped over porch chairs.
</P>
<P>
   It's been fun _ and a learning experience. But once is enough.
As soon as I get home I'm heading for the basement to give my
23-year-old automatic a hug of newly-found appreciation. So much
for the good old days.

 &HT;    GOP won't repeat 1992 debacle if it's smart
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a contrast in conventions. The last time the
Republicans convened to nominate a George Bush, the Monday-night
headline was that Pat Buchanan had declared a culture war _ we
begin bombing in 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This time? Laura Bush comes before the nation with the
press-stopper: Literacy good. Illiteracy bad.
</P>
<P>
   You might say, in other words, that no news from Night 1 is very
good news for the Republican Party. Or from Night 2, or Night 3.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush was paying attention behind the scenes during
the 1992 convention in Houston's Astrodome, he was learning how not
to win a nation's heart.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win it by repeating the phrase ``family values'' every
other sentence, as speaker after speaker after speaker did in the
Astro-drone. They so cheapened an already two-bit phrase that when
all was said and drummed it couldn't have been weighty to an ear
mite.
</P>
<P>
   What did ``family values'' mean? Was it chastity and bottomless
wells of virtue? The opposite of Bill Clinton with his personal
flaws? One will say that with subsequent events that would cripple
Clinton's administration this litany was fair warning. Yes. And it
was unfortunate that people applauding in the Dome in '92, people
like Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingstone, Dan Burton, Henry Hyde and Bob
Bahr, later would have the rhetoric come back and bite them where
it hurts, in ye olde private parts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, with George W.'s own playboy past as inferential fodder
we can put this type of piety aside and consider issues of
governance.
</P>
<P>
   In '92 with Buchanan setting the tone with his bellicose assault
on foreigners and homosexuals, with anti-abortion protesters trying
to shut down Houston women's clinics, the convention was as mean as
it was ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   (It's said that the Houston Astros vacated the Dome this year
because of economic issues. Another theory is that they couldn't
shake the bad vibes left by the GOP convention.)
</P>
<P>
   With the pronounced attempt to portray the party as ``family
values'' incarnate, as America most pure, the most remarkable
moment in '92 may have come when Mary Fisher, a former aide to
Gerald Ford, a mother infected with HIV, stepped to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I am female and contracted this disease in marriage, I
am one with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickering candle from
the cold wind of his family's rejection,'' she said, to a bare
smattering of applause. Or was it jewelry rattling?
</P>
<P>
   That was a singular pause in a gathering that, in rhetorical
texture, couldn't have been more divisive. Bush doesn't want that,
and certainly doesn't need it. His mission this week is to modulate
a media event that will try to put a fuzz-focus on his party's
dagger edges. He has succeeded in helping tone things down already
by removing from the GOP platform a call for an
English-as-official-language law and the denial of automatic
citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will seek to avoid entirely the abortion issue, although he
can't dodge it forever, witnessed by the unremittingly anti-choice
voting record of his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will seek to win the presidency as a voice of moderation.
In some ways, therefore, the toughest crowd he faces this week is
not the one in the nation's living rooms but the one inside
Philadelphia's First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be addressing a body that is heavily seasoned with the
hard-right elements that Buchanan was serenading with his ``culture
war'' speech. The Texas delegation, for instance, is teeming with
religious conservatives to whom moderation is no virtue.
</P>
<P>
   And so now, everybody in unison, one, two, three: Literacy good
. . .

 &HT;    Social Security site offers a way to figure benefits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal government has come up with yet another
way to show millions of American workers exactly how much Social
Security is worth to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any worker over age 25 can go to the Social Security
Administration's Web site _ www.ssa.gov/retire _ and figure out the
retirement benefit he or she can expect.
</P>
<P>
   For an individual struggling to take charge of his financial
future, this can be a tremendous help.
</P>
<P>
   For a government agency surrounded by congressmen and campaign
promises, this is a way to show the agency's true worth to its
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to improve customer service,'' said William A.
Halter, the No. 2 man in the agency. ``With the explosion of the
Internet and our customers saying they want to do things
electronically, we're moving very swiftly into those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is certainly a big issue. A recent survey by the
Pew Research Center showed that Social Security is one of the top
issues Americans want to hear about from political candidates. Less
pressing issues included taxes, foreign policy, crime and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about Social Security reform already are fierce. The
system will be in financial trouble some years from now, as baby
boomers retire and as life spans continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Some factions argue that an appropriate fix is to let the system
invest in the stock market. Others believe individuals should be
able to reduce their contributions to the system and invest the
difference for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration says it has been trying to
encourage an active and informed debate. ``We have a great
opportunity to work on long-range problems,'' Halter said during a
recent visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement planning Web site, with its appeal to
self-interest, is part of that effort. Halter and others answered
some basic questions about the new, online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's new about the Internet retirement planner?
</P>
<P>
   A: Workers 25 and older already get an annual statement showing
how much their monthly retirement benefit will be at age 62, at
full retirement age, and at 70. About 125 million Americans get the
individual statement through the mail, usually about three months
before their birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   The three calculators at the Web site are much more versatile.
You can get a quick-and-dirty estimate or you can customize the
report by changing your retirement age or other variables. ``You'll
see how the Social Security benefit varies with those changes,''
Halter said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't workers eligible for full benefits at age 65? A: Not
any more. The table shows how the threshold has changed. For
example, the oldest baby boomers will have to work until age 66 or
accept reduced benefits. People in the 1943-1954 bracket would get
about 75 percent of full benefits if they retired at age 62,
according to the American Academy of Actuaries. That's the earliest
age at which you can receive retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For intensely detailed information, go to
www.ssa.gov/retire/agereduction.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are estimates from the online calculators guaranteed?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. They are based on assumptions, including your future
earnings and the rate of inflation in future years. You get
estimates, not promises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the calculators work?
</P>
<P>
   A: With the quick calculator, you type in your age and how much
money you will make this year. You get an instant but ``very
rough'' estimate, according to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
   The online version requires you to type in your complete
earnings history, using information from your annual statement. You
can try out other scenarios by changing your retirement age and
future earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed calculator must be downloaded to your own computer.
You can change the expected inflation rate as well as retirement
age and future earnings. It requires more thought but is presumably
the most accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Note that online and detailed calculators are available only for
PC users. A version for Mac users is expected in about 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I still talk to a real person?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSA is testing a system that will connect Internet users
to a customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, you can e-mail a question. Go to the home page,
www.ssa.gov, and click on Questions. ``The response may give the
text of an answer or refer you to a Web site where the answer is,''
Halter said.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can call 1-800-772-1213 to talk to a real person.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can future retirees count on Social Security to survive long
into the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Absolutely,'' argues Halter. ``Social Security is the
single most effective anti-poverty program in U.S. history. Public
support will ensure that elected representatives focus on necessary
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Renn, a certified financial planner in Midtown, sees it
differently. ``If you are in your late 50s, I would count on it,''
he said. ``But certainly if you are in your mid-30s to early 40s, I
would discount it heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that demographic pressures will force cutbacks.
Policy-makers could raise retirement ages even more or could reduce
the level of benefits. But Renn believes that a third alternative _
cutting back or eliminating payments to higher-income families _ is
the most likely fix.
</P>
<P>
   Then the question would be who gets tossed out. Should the
income limit be at $30,000, for example, or at $50,000 or even
higher?

 &HT;    Social Security site offers a way to figure benefits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal government has come up with yet another
way to show millions of American workers exactly how much Social
Security is worth to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any worker over age 25 can go to the Social Security
Administration's Web site _ www.ssa.gov/retire _ and figure out the
retirement benefit he or she can expect.
</P>
<P>
   For an individual struggling to take charge of his financial
future, this can be a tremendous help.
</P>
<P>
   For a government agency surrounded by congressmen and campaign
promises, this is a way to show the agency's true worth to its
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to improve customer service,'' said William A.
Halter, the No. 2 man in the agency. ``With the explosion of the
Internet and our customers saying they want to do things
electronically, we're moving very swiftly into those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is certainly a big issue. A recent survey by the
Pew Research Center showed that Social Security is one of the top
issues Americans want to hear about from political candidates. Less
pressing issues included taxes, foreign policy, crime and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about Social Security reform already are fierce. The
system will be in financial trouble some years from now, as baby
boomers retire and as life spans continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Some factions argue that an appropriate fix is to let the system
invest in the stock market. Others believe individuals should be
able to reduce their contributions to the system and invest the
difference for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration says it has been trying to
encourage an active and informed debate. ``We have a great
opportunity to work on long-range problems,'' Halter said during a
recent visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement planning Web site, with its appeal to
self-interest, is part of that effort. Halter and others answered
some basic questions about the new, online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's new about the Internet retirement planner?
</P>
<P>
   A: Workers 25 and older already get an annual statement showing
how much their monthly retirement benefit will be at age 62, at
full retirement age, and at 70. About 125 million Americans get the
individual statement through the mail, usually about three months
before their birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   The three calculators at the Web site are much more versatile.
You can get a quick-and-dirty estimate or you can customize the
report by changing your retirement age or other variables. ``You'll
see how the Social Security benefit varies with those changes,''
Halter said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't workers eligible for full benefits at age 65? A: Not
any more. The table shows how the threshold has changed. For
example, the oldest baby boomers will have to work until age 66 or
accept reduced benefits. People in the 1943-1954 bracket would get
about 75 percent of full benefits if they retired at age 62,
according to the American Academy of Actuaries. That's the earliest
age at which you can receive retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For intensely detailed information, go to
www.ssa.gov/retire/agereduction.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are estimates from the online calculators guaranteed?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. They are based on assumptions, including your future
earnings and the rate of inflation in future years. You get
estimates, not promises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the calculators work?
</P>
<P>
   A: With the quick calculator, you type in your age and how much
money you will make this year. You get an instant but ``very
rough'' estimate, according to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
   The online version requires you to type in your complete
earnings history, using information from your annual statement. You
can try out other scenarios by changing your retirement age and
future earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed calculator must be downloaded to your own computer.
You can change the expected inflation rate as well as retirement
age and future earnings. It requires more thought but is presumably
the most accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Note that online and detailed calculators are available only for

 &HT;    Passage offered to grieving parents
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. LeCrone: ``Several years ago I lost a child and found
the following passage to be of great help. Please pass this on to
your readers. It was written by Vickie Tushingham and titled ``Just
for Today For Bereaved Parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will try to live through the next 24 hours and
not expect to get over my child's death, but instead learn to live
with it just one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will remember my child's life, not his death,
and bask in the comfort of all those treasured days and moments we
shared.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will forgive all the family and friends who
didn't help or comfort me the way I needed them to. They truly did
not know how.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will smile no matter how much I hurt on the
inside, for maybe if I smile a little, my heart will soften and I
will begin to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will reach out to comfort a relative or friend
of my child, for they are hurting too, and perhaps we can comfort
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will free myself from my self-inflicted burden
of guilt, for deep in my heart I know if there was anything in this
world I could have done to save my child from death, I would have
done it.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will honor my child's memory by doing something
with another child because I know that would have made my own child
proud.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will offer my hand in friendship to another
bereaved parent, for I do know how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today when my heart feels like breaking, I will stop
and remember that grief is the piece we pay for loving, and the
only reason I hurt is because I had the privilege of loving so
much.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will not compare myself with others. I am
fortunate to be who I am and to have had my child for as long as I
did.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will allow myself to be happy, for I know that
I am not deserting my child by living on.
</P>
<P>
   Just for today I will accept that I did not die when my child
did, my life did go on, and I am the only one who can make that
life worthwhile once more.

<P>
   EDITORIAL-DEATHPENALTY _ Ruling by 11th Circuit panel in Alabama
death-row appeal is unsupportable. When judge writing for the
majority concedes the case against the condemned man is less than
overwhelming, the accused's attorney should have presented evidence
in mitigation during sentencing phase. Since he didn't, the
sentence of death should not stand. (The Atlanta Constitution). 10.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ George W. Bush was either, in the cliche,
thinking outside the box or not thinking at all when he picked Dick
Cheney as his running mate. Either way, no candidate before ever
thought of going to the voters in a tandem of two big oil guys from
Texas. This a balancing act akin to a one-arm high wire artiste.
(Teepen, Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While much attention recently has been paid
the demands for return of art treasures looted by the Nazis, and
while Greece continues to insist Great Britain give back the Elgin
Marbles looted from the Parthenon two centuries ago, a court ruling
in Virginia late last month has turned this type of reclamation
into a tizzy. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ PELEE ISLAND, Ont. _ Robin, in cut-offs and a
pink terry tube top, directs the action as she rolls a 40-year-old
wringer washer out of the storeroom and into the back yard. My job
is to haul hot water from the kitchen sink while Sharon and Pat
fill two galvanized rinse tubs with the garden hose. Right away I
start in whining. ``Why can't I have a cushy job like theirs?''
Robin says I can, just as soon as I finish hauling the water and
wiping off the clotheslines. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ If George W. Bush was paying attention behind the
scenes during the 1992 convention in Houston's Astrodome, he was
learning how not to win a nation's heart. You don't win it by
repeating the phrase ``family values'' every other sentence, as
speaker after speaker after speaker did in the Astro-drone. They so
cheapened an already two-bit phrase that when all was said and
drummed it couldn't have been weighty to an ear mite. (Young, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED

   EDITORIAL-DEATHPENALTY _ Ruling by 11th Circuit panel in Alabama
death-row appeal is unsupportable. When judge writing for the
majority concedes the case against the condemned man is less than
overwhelming, the accused's attorney should have presented evidence
in mitigation during sentencing phase. Since he didn't, the
sentence of death should not stand. (The Atlanta Constitution). 10.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ George W. Bush was either, in the cliche,
thinking outside the box or not thinking at all when he picked Dick
Cheney as his running mate. Either way, no candidate before ever
thought of going to the voters in a tandem of two big oil guys from
Texas. This a balancing act akin to a one-arm high wire artiste.
(Teepen, Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While much attention recently has been paid
the demands for return of art treasures looted by the Nazis, and
while Greece continues to insist Great Britain give back the Elgin
Marbles looted from the Parthenon two centuries ago, a court ruling
in Virginia late last month has turned this type of reclamation
into a tizzy. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ PELEE ISLAND, Ont. _ Robin, in cut-offs and a
pink terry tube top, directs the action as she rolls a 40-year-old
wringer washer out of the storeroom and into the back yard. My job
is to haul hot water from the kitchen sink while Sharon and Pat
fill two galvanized rinse tubs with the garden hose. Right away I
start in whining. ``Why can't I have a cushy job like theirs?''
Robin says I can, just as soon as I finish hauling the water and
wiping off the clotheslines. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ If George W. Bush was paying attention behind the
scenes during the 1992 convention in Houston's Astrodome, he was
learning how not to win a nation's heart. You don't win it by
repeating the phrase ``family values'' every other sentence, as
speaker after speaker after speaker did in the Astro-drone. They so
cheapened an already two-bit phrase that when all was said and
drummed it couldn't have been weighty to an ear mite. (Young, Waco

GLIMPSES OF A MORE VIVID ENTERTAINMENT FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Fred Tepper grew increasingly voluble as he
described the wonders of Project: Messiah, the character animation
software that he was promoting at Siggraph, the leading annual
conclave for specialists in computer graphics, virtual reality and
interactive technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the beginning of time in computer animation, people have
been looking for more realistic characters,'' Tepper said. ``And
we're finally getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first convention for the company behind Project:
Messiah, pmG _ basically a bunch of friends and colleagues with
backgrounds in computer animation. And here they were at Siggraph,
with their own booth, their own line of products _ right in there
with the big guys .
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a company headquarters yet,'' Tepper
said. ``Basically, at the moment, we're kind of all working out of
our houses.''
</P>
<P>
   As computer graphics become increasingly important in the
production and distribution of popular entertainment in America _
whether it's three-dimensional animation or photo-realistic special
effects _ an argument can be made that the best way to see into the
culture's future is not to take in the latest Off Broadway
sensation or study the works of the current darling of the Iowa
Writers' Workshop, but to stroll around at Siggraph, ground zero in
the digital entertainment explosion.
</P>
<P>
   What would rapidly become apparent on such a stroll is that
several converging forces are at work that in the very near future
are likely to result in more plentiful, vivid and immersive
entertainment, whether it's in a movie theater, in front of a
computer screen or seated at a video game console.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving into a period of what I call lean-forward
entertainment, as oppose to lean-back entertainment,'' said Fred
Angelopoulos, chief executive of Pulse Entertainment. ``I am
talking about entertainment that doesn't allow you to sit back,
that pulls you right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Using software that has just arrived on the market, animators
will be able to work more quickly and much, much more cheaply. Home
hobbyists and aspiring filmmakers will be able to create, on
personal computers no more powerful than the ones they probably
already have in their homes, special effects and animations of
astonishing sophistication. In addition, new methods in what is
called image-based rendering are emerging to make it easier to
create animation from photographs and other digital images scanned
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   On the World Wide Web, three-dimensional animation will become
increasingly the norm, for shopping, for gaming, for attracting
people to Internet sites and keeping them there. New affiliations
like those just announced between Intel and Macromedia and between
Real Networks and Pulse Entertainment indicate that the science of
compressing huge volumes of data may finally make it possible to
stream complex three-dimensional images into personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies like haptics, which makes virtual objects on a
computer or game screen ``feel'' as though they are real by adding
tension and vibrations to a mouse or joystick, will intensify the
online experience. And with a new generation of powerful video-game
machines like Sony's Power Station 2 and Microsoft's X-box, the
richness and realism of game animations will take a quantum leap
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference we will see in the coming months is in
the realism,'' said Roger D. Chandler, product marketing manager
for Intel's Internet Media Initiative. ``For a long time, we
weren't getting that realism because the processing power wasn't
there on people's desktops. But now the hardware is there. And the
software is becoming available to utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Siggraph was founded by the Association for Computer Machinery
and stands for Special Interest Group _ Graphics, a name given to
the show three decades ago, when the field was dominated by those
providing computer-enhanced applications for the military and
industry. Gradually, those innovations made their way into
commercial use and then into popular entertainment. Now, Hollywood
and computer games are the dominant flavor at the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The trade floor, where the latest high-tech gizmos are unveiled,
is as big as the deck of an aircraft carrier, a labyrinthine grid
of blinking lights, overhead screens, twirling logos and
cacophonous pitches. Many companies use the event to introduce
their latest products, like Sony's Gscube, a video graphics
equalizer that allows animators to create complex scenes in real
time. (Until recently, animators had to punch in volumes of
computer code _ for characters, for textures, for movements _ and
then let it process for hours, or even overnight, before seeing how
the result looked.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Hollywood has become so central to the computer graphics
industry, Siggraph is held every other year in Los Angeles, where
it has attracted around 45,000 people in recent years. In the
alternate years, the conclave shifts to places like Orlando,
Washington and, this year, New Orleans, and the crowds are
generally smaller, around 25,000 to 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the largest get-together of the year for those
involved in the field, a time when college friendships are renewed
and resumes are passed around with zeal. Job seekers formed long
lines to apply to the leading animation companies _ Disney, Pixar
Animation (creators of ``Toy Story''), Pacific Data Images
(``Antz''), Sony Imageworks (``Stuart Little''), Blue Sky
Productions (making the forthcoming ``Ice Age''), Square Films
(making ``Final Fantasy'') _ and the top effects houses, like
Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain, Mantex and Rhythm and
Hues.
</P>
<P>
   It is a young field, and the bulk of those attending the event
are also young _ certainly under 40, many of them fresh out of
college. And, as might be expected when so many young people are
gathered together, there is a certain party atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin boards set up around the convention center were
festooned with graffiti (``I Love New Orleans!'') promoting parties
and Web sites and all-night raves. Each evening offered an array of
company-sponsored parties at French Quarter nightclubs and uptown
mansions, many of which lasted until near dawn and brought a
certain bleary aspect to the early morning reading of technical
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Siggraph also has a high-art component, a digital art gallery,
at which serious artists can display work built upon
computer-created images or effects. The results this year ranged
from the eerily beautiful to the perplexing and the whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Free Range Appliances,'' a corral full of toasters,
eggbeaters and other small household items, all mounted on wheels,
would spring to life when flashlights were shined on them.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece called ``Nosce Te Ipsum'' by a University of Michigan
artist named Tiffany Holmes, viewers were asked to walk along a
path toward a screen displaying a collage of images. As the viewer
got closer to the screen, pieces of it were torn away, to the
amplified sound of ripping paper, until finally a video image of
the viewer appeared on the screen, gaping back at himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby room called the Studio, visitors could create their
own paintings and sculptures using the kind of high-end equipment
and software most of them never have a chance to use. And upstairs
in the convention center, in dozens of meetings room, classes in
computer techniques and theory ran throughout the five-day
gathering. Four auditoriums showed a rotating program of 135 pieces
of computer animation, chosen from more than 600 submitted from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere, the talk was about breaking through
boundaries to make the entertainment experience more vivid, and
about how inexpensive the whole field is becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Project: Messiah began as a plug-in to one of the dominant
animation packages, a common first step for animation software. A
studio will equip its staff with an animation package _ Maya,
Softimage and Houdini are among the bigger names _ and then buy
individual plug-ins that enhance a particular feature. Such a
plug-in might, for example, offer heightened facial animation
capabilities or a range of arcane textures.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of the plug-in companies move beyond that stage
and offer a stand-alone version, a soup-to-nuts animation package,
which is what Messiah was doing this year. The first Project:
Messiah stand-alone was selling for $395 at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge home hobby thing going on right now,'' Tepper
said. ``I can remember when I was in high school and wanted to make
movies, I got a Super-8 camera. Well, this is sort of the Super-8
camera of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   And Messiah was far from alone; more than a dozen software
companies were offering animation packages and plug-ins that cost
well under $1,000 and promised sophisticated results, even on a
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Riley, the vice president for marketing and business
development at Face2Face, said that his company's software, which
turns flat images into three-dimensional ones, is aimed at creating
more sophisticated facial animation. At the moment, the company is
offering the product to animation studios, estimating it will save
25 percent in time and costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we are hoping to move into animation in the
house,'' he said. ``Maybe creating the next generation of greeting
cards, where people can scan images of themselves into their
computer and then create animated versions of themselves to send
over the Internet as Christmas or birthday cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The savings were not limited to at-home animation. Scott Ross,
chairman of Digital Domain, said he had seen the cost of equipping
one of his company's effects animators plummet from his early days
in the business, when he created effects for films like ``The
Abyss'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to geek out on you,'' he said, ``but back in 1986 a
standard work station cost $65,000, plus $34,000 for the software.
So you were looking at a cost of about $100,000 per seat. Now, you
can get 10 times the power in a $7,000 computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the convention's technical areas, where academic researchers
offered technical papers on the latest developments in the field,
much of the talk was about moving beyond the current vogue in
ultra-realistic animation.
</P>
<P>
   David Salesin, a University of Washington professor who won the
convention's top prize for technical achievement, has written
extensively on ways to create watercolorlike effects on the
computer and to imitate the brushstrokes and the feel of
impressionist paintings, moving computer animation away from the
kind of rock-hard accuracy that sometimes made it feel cold and
emotionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a good job with photo-realism,'' Salesin said.
``Now is the time to look at more expressive forms of drawing.''

   SWEET DEAL? MICROSOFT PRICES OPTIONS BELOW 70, by Adam Lashinsky
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from past policy, Microsoft priced its most
recent grant of stock options to employees on Monday, July 31. That
means that employees got options on tens of millions of shares at
69 13/16, Monday's closing stock price. That's a huge relief to the
Microsofties, who have seen the stock a lot higher recently.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO CONSIDERS SEIZING DRUG BUYERS' CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by a recent state court ruling, San
Francisco Supervisor Amos Brown has resurrected a controversial
plan to confiscate cars allegedly used in San Francisco to solicit
drugs or prostitutes, even if their owners are never convicted of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful that this ordinance will help alleviate the drug
and prostitution problems,'' which continue to plague many of our
poorer neighborhoods, said Brown, who floated an identical measure
a year ago that went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the offenders come from outside the affected
areas, and residents and merchants are tired of watching their
neighborhoods deteriorate because of them.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the law would do nothing to get to the
root of the problems _ poverty, hopelessness and addiction _ which
lead to drug and prostitution trade.
</P>
<P>
   Brown first proposed the law on behalf of Mayor Willie Brown
last year, but backed off when he could not muster support on the
board. At the same time, a similar law in Oakland was challenged in
court by the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   But after the California 1st District Court of Appeal ruled
unanimously that Oakland's 2-and-1/2-year-old vehicle seizure law
doesn't conflict with state law, which allows a car to be seized
only after its owner is convicted of using the vehicle during a
crime, Supervisor Brown reintroduced the ordinance. More than 300
cars have been seized in Oakland since the city enacted its law.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU intends to appeal the ruling to the California Supreme
Court, and will challenge San Francisco's law when _ and if _ it
becomes law, said attorney Alan Schlosser.
</P>
<P>
   He said Supervisor Brown's proposal is unconstitutional, because
it penalizes people who haven't been convicted, and excessive,
because the fine _ the loss of a car _ may not match the severity
of the alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent people, he said, may lose their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, cops and prosecutors can seize a car and
sell it at auction if they believe a crime has been committed;
there is no requirement for conviction. And the car's owner doesn't
have to be involved: They chance losing their car if they lend it
to a relative or a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale of confiscated vehicles are split between
police and prosecutors - the same people who decide whether the
cars should be taken in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most extreme and harsh forfeiture law I have ever
seen,'' Schlosser said of Brown's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said a conviction is not necessary to know when an
alleged perpetrator is up to no good. The cops see them driving
around town looking for sex and drugs, and they should be stopped,
even if it takes drastic measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the people who have been raising hell in our
community,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The offenders, he said, ``are causing pain, death, misery,
suffering,'' and the city must intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car seizures have no place in San Francisco,'' Newsom said.
The proposed law, he said, is akin to ``taking away our civil
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsom has asked the city attorney to draft alternatives to car
seizures, such as boosting fines for drugs and prostitution in the
most troubled neighborhoods, and stepping up enforcement of those
vice laws.
</P>
<P>
   He said seizure laws disproportionately affect poor minorities
who are unable to hire attorneys to fight for the return of their
cars. At the same time, he said, the laws do nothing to get to the
core of the drug problem, which he said should be addressed with
treatment services.

&HT;     OAK DEATHS CAUSED BY FUNGUS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JANE KAY   
 &HT;     c. 2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Sudden Oak Death'' syndrome, which has killed
thousands of Central California's coastal oak trees over the past
five years, is being caused by a newly discovered fungus akin to
the one that caused the Irish potato famine, University of
California scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just recently found that the potential underlying cause of
the disease is a new fungus, and species related to it have caused
major epidemics around the world, including the Irish potato
famine,'' said David Rizzo, an assistant professor of plant
pathology at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus targets the bark of tanoak, black oak and coast live
oak.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo identified the fungus in June and believes it poses an
emergency threat to healthy oak trees that stretch from Santa
Barbara to southern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the disease has killed thousands of
trees from Big Sur to Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties _ already
under siege from rampant development of vineyards and housing
developments. Santa Cruz and Marin have been hit especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are black oaks that grow north to the Cascades, over to
the Sierra on the floor of Yosemite Valley and on foothills toward
Lake Tahoe, and in the Central Valley. Also at risk are coast live
oaks, which grow south to Baja California, and the tanoaks, which
stretch to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo urged people to help stop the fungus' spread by not
carrying firewood from the counties where it has been identified to
the Sierra. Also, property owners should not move wood from
infected trees off their land, Rizzo said. Instead, they should
call their county Agricultural Cooperative Extension Service for
advice on treatment or disposal of dead branches or trees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people who hike or camp, or even drive through oak
woodlands in the counties that have the oak fungus, should clean
their tires, pets and shoes before going into clean areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is carried by a microscopic two-tailed, swimming
fungus that first attacks bark in trunks and branches, scientists
believe. The fungus moves around by spores in soils, wind, water
and perhaps via insects, and is most active during the rainy
season. It's a member of the genus Phytophthora, and the species
hasn't been named or fully described yet.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus is related to the organisms that caused the Irish
potato famine of 1845-50 and the modern deaths of Port Orford cedar
trees in Northern California and southern Oregon, eucalyptus
forests in Australia and oak forests in Mexico, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't know whether the fungal species is native or
if it has been introduced in the past few years. The pathogen isn't
related to the oak wilt fungus, which attacks Eastern U.S. oaks,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fungus was isolated five weeks ago, ``Sudden Oak
Death'' syndrome has been around for at least five years.
Scientists suspected that some sort of fungi were killing stressed
trees.
</P>
<P>
   When Marin County started worrying about the fire, safety,
economic and environmental effects of acres of dying oak trees, the
University of California formed a multidisciplinary committee to
study the disease six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the symptoms in test plots, they suspected that the
first sign of the fungal attack was a seeping or bleeding from
cankers, said Brice McPherson, a researcher in the Division of
Insect Biology at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The disease dissolved the bark and entered the wood, leaving the
tree vulnerable to bark beetles. The beetles bored into the tree,
sometimes killing it within a month, inspiring the name ``Sudden
Oak Death.``
</P>
<P>
   Native oaks, including those being attacked by the fungi, grow
on about 11 million acres, about 11 percent of the state's land.
There, oak watersheds filter water, prevent erosion and provide
habitat for a wide variety of habitat, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the California Oak Foundation, an Oakland
nonprofit, has been trying to get the state Department of Forestry
to protect the oak and pay attention to the diseases that attack
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the state requested cities and counties to
pass ordinances to protect oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some did and some didn't. There may be some places where they
are mandatory, but generally they are voluntary,`` said Gerald
Ahlstrom, the agency's chief of forest practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of acres have disappeared to bulldozing and
clear-cutting for growing grapes and commercial conifers and other
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's landscape is represented by the golden grasslands
and the oak woodlands. Their beauty has inspired poets and writers,
and each of us,`` said Janet Cobb, who founded the California Oak
Foundation in 1988. ``But they are so much more than being a
beautiful tree. We have taken this entire ecosystem for granted.
Most people have grown up around oaks, and it's not until their
neighbor cuts one down or the bulldozers turn on in the morning in
Sonoma County that people become totally alarmed.``

KIDS, PARENTS SHOW TRUE COLORS ON NEW FOX SERIES
</HEADLINE>
  With AMHIGH-REVIEW 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who needs rat dinners, ruthless tribal alliances and sand in
your shorts when you've got high school?
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; ` &LR; Survivor' is like a joke in comparison,'' observes Robby
Nathan, high school graduate and one of the subjects in
documentarian R.J. Cutler's new series ``American High,'' examining
a year in the life of 14 teen-agers at a suburban Chicago high
school. Without having to contrive goofy immunity challenges or
melodramatically extinguish a single torch, Cutler's series
artfully captures the angst, joy and sheer confusion of coming of
age in America today.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler  &UR; _ &LR;  an Oscar nominee for ``The War Room'' and an Emmy
nominee for ``The Perfect Candidate''  &UR; _ &LR;  and his team approached
the generically named Highland Park outside of Chicago, discussed
the project with students, teachers and parents and even taught a
media course during the school year. Once taping wrapped  &UR; _ &LR;  with
the seniors' graduation
 &UR; _ &LR;  the school was given the cameras and an editing bay.
</P>
<P>
   Students didn't audition for the series per se, but they did
apply for the video-diary course set up by Cutler's team. ``From
the pool of kids which were selected for the independent study
class, which was about 20, 25 people, we then selected the kids who
we focused on,'' Cutler explains. The resulting 13 half-hour
episodes were culled from 2,800 hours of footage, 800 of it from
the students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to keep it as real as possible so they didn't
interrupt our normal living, I mean, except when you went to the
mall and people were, like, 'What's the camera crew doing,
following you around?' '' says Morgan Moss, depicted in the series
as a troubled and rebellious student suffering from and acting out
because of attention deficit disorder, who seems to find a calling
when he teaches gymnastics to disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were struck right away by the fact that these guys became
acclimated more quickly than we had ever imagined,'' Cutler says.
``We thought at the beginning people would be jumping up and down
and waving their arms in the camera, which of course becomes very
tiring to do after two or three days, then it would go away. But we
didn't experience that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch the show, it's kind of like, 'Whoa  &UR; _ &LR;  my
life!' '' says Sarah Mages, who will be a senior at the school this
upcoming year. ``All the things we say are obviously true because
we said it, but it's definitely a shock, you know, to watch your
life on TV. Of course, I'm not embarrassed of my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to be embarrassed of your own life,'' offers
Nathan, who, as the series begins, is dating Mages and fending off
her fears about their relationship when he leaves for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I just opened up,'' Nathan recalls. ``And I
think it was just because I was so pissed off at school, adults,
everything involved (in what) people just don't understand in kids,
their bossing us around and telling us what to do. And I think
that's why I just opened up, because I want things to, like,
change, for people to realize that we might be 17 or 18, but, like,
we've got a lot going on in our head, more so than anyone thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss admits, ``My first reaction when I saw the episode was,
'Oh, great, I'm the bad-ass.' But other people were like, 'I can't
believe you went there. It was so good. What you said was amazing.'
And I was embarrassed at first, but when I got to see my peers'
reactions, it turned out that it was all worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a new breed, I guess, of person,'' Moss adds of his
depiction in the series. ``Because there's the me that goes off and
lights off fireworks and stuff and goes and does whatever he feels
would be fun. And then there's the sensitive side of me that, you
know, loves working with disabled kids. Like, that's my passion in
life. There's a little chunk of every emotion or side of me in (the
show). I couldn't just sit and break myself down.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss' father, Alan, who appears in episodes as a calm, wry
presence who occasionally can lose his temper with his son, says
the show is a fair representation of his son and their family. He
says he and his wife gave their son freedom and privacy to create
his video diaries as he wished. Seeing it now, he says, ``(My wife
and I) can look at each other and kind of nod and say, 'Yeah, I
suspected that was in there,' or 'I knew that was going to come out
at some point,' and seeing that he was honest enough with that
camera where he was not revealing to his parents, necessarily, but
revealing to everybody who might see this that this is the person
that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wonderful thing for Morgan for his senior year
because my contention has always been, 'If we can just get this kid
to survive high school, he's going to become who he needs to be,'
'' Moss' father adds drolly. ``And particularly for a kid who has
what you could kindly call an alternative learning method. There
are very few things he could do that would surprise us, in terms of
doing something that's totally off the edge because he's been
pushing the envelope since he was in daycare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American High'' is the series that proves that the ``reality
TV'' moniker doesn't truly apply to ``Survivor'' or ``Big
Brother,'' the students agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 'The Real World,' `Survivor' and all those reality-based
shows, we're the closest one you can get to reality,'' Moss
observes. ``With 'Survivor,' yeah, it's reality, it's real people
and stuff, but it's all set up. They're on an island, they have to
survive, they're getting paid at the end. With `Big Brother,'
you're put in a house, you have to live with these people and vote
people out. With 'Real World,' same thing. We're living in our real
houses, this is the way our life is, we talk about what we're
really feeling, not like (mimicking a whiny 'Big Brother'
houseguest), `I feel bad that Timmy today was all weird,' or
something like that, you know?'' &QL;

NEW FOX `REALITY' SERIES PRESENTS TEENS UNCENSORED

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American High'' opens with a noisy eruption of attitude from
what appears to be an obnoxious, slightly sociopathic kid who
flails away arrhythmically at a drum kit and declares he has no
time for school; boys just want to have fun. Sit patiently through
this outburst _ a pretty obvious bid to grab the MTV demographic _
and soon enough, the social context becomes apparent. And not long
thereafter, you'll be utterly absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Though this 13-episode series _ from respected documentarian
R.J. Cutler _ has the bad luck to come out during and get lumped in
with the current reality-TV trend, ``American High'' more closely
resembles the amazing 1994 documentary ``Hoop Dreams'' in its
sensitive, detail-oriented, multistory approach to examining issues
confronting teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Following a core of 14 kids at a middle-class, Chicago-area high
school, the show, in concise thumbnail sketches, vividly essays
their aspirations and fears, their triumphs and setbacks _ and how
their family lives and the school itself contribute to their
general sense of self in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That loud, seemingly simple-minded kid at the beginning, Morgan,
quickly becomes perhaps the series' most complex subject. He
berates his younger brother for doing homework and says he can
learn for himself what is and isn't dangerous _ his response to a
possible accident would be, he suggests, ``Now that I only have one
arm, I realize not to do that again.'' He's funny, he's defiant,
he's a dope.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, it's learned that Morgan suffers from attention
deficit disorder and hates his medicine, that he saves wrappers
from candy bars his girlfriend bought him and that he has an
affinity for teaching gymnastics to disabled kids. Add his largely
sympathetic but long-suffering family, and his story becomes
surprisingly moving.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan's just part of the equation. In the first four
episodes, you'll also meet Robby and Sarah, a senior and junior who
are certain they're made for one another, which only adds to
Sarah's apprehension at Robby's going away to college the following
year. There's also Kiwi, a football place-kicker who uses his fear
of failure to pump him up and is oblivious to the fact that his
pretty pal Anna has a crush on him; he cluelessly approaches her
for advice on how to deal with an awkward dating situation.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women have problems as compelling as Morgan's. Suzy is
obsessed about her weight and pleasing her father, who, in a video
diary, jokes that he hasn't been able to hold his daughter on his
shoulders since she was 3 weeks old. The way her face falls is both
comic and crushing. Meanwhile, Allie understands her no-win
position in the complex dynamic of her parents' recent divorce, but
that hasn't stopped her from imperiling her grades with an epic
trail of truancies. (Most parents, it should be said, largely come
off as fairly empathetic here.)
</P>
<P>
   Brad, a young man who recently announced that he's gay, and
Kaytee, an aspiring coffee house singer of silly ditties, are also
introduced; more students will be introduced in later episodes.
</P>
<P>
   There's no artificial pressure-cooker clamped on these kids as
in ``Big Brother'' or ``Survivor''; the drama is real and therefore
far more riveting. Teens will enjoy watching themselves as they
truly are; parents should watch it to get a clue as to what their
kids are about these days. And anyone who's a fan of good, smart
television should tune in, too. &QL;

&HT;     WONDER BREAD MAKER LOSES BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The baking giant that makes Wonder Bread must
pay 21 current and former employees $11 million _ and may have to
pay much more _ after a San Francisco jury determined that the
company discriminated against its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which reached its verdict earlier this week, also
found that Interstate Bakeries Corp., based in Kansas City, Mo.,
had acted with malice against the workers, which could lead to
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Alioto, attorney for the 18 of the plaintiffs, started
bear-hugging her clients after the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too cool, too cool,'' she said outside of court. ``Such a
great San Francisco jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Interstate Bakeries said the case was far from
over. The company released a statement pledging to get the jury
verdict thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will appeal the decision,'' the statement read. ``We
believe that substantial legal errors were committed in this trial
and fully expect to be exonerated on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the workers claimed to have experienced discrimination in
Interstate Bakeries' San Francisco or Santa Clara facilities,
including racial slurs and being passed up for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate Bakeries is the nation's largest wholesale baking
company, with 67 bread and cake bakeries located in strategic
markets from coast to coast. The company also makes Twinkies, Snow
Balls and other Hostess products.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty phase of trial, in which jurors will hear even more
evidence to determine how much Interstate Bakeries will pay in
punitive damages, started late Monday afternoon and will continue
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict Monday was for ``actual'' damages, including money
to compensate workers for lost pay and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Dunhams, a 38-year-old shipping clerk who was awarded
$174,800, said he would train white workers at the San Francisco
Wonder Bread plant, knowing they would be promoted over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're training someone, and you know in a few weeks they're
going to be your boss,'' he said. ``I've got two kids. I don't want
them to go through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs had been claiming discrimination at the plants
for up to 30 years. Interstate Bakeries took over the San Francisco
plant in 1995, after it was owned by Ralston/Purina, said IBC
attorney Kathleen Maylin.
</P>
<P>
   Maylin said the company was not responsible for acts that
happened when Interstate Bakeries was not running the plant, and
that the damages award could be altered accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came after more than two months of trial and nine
days of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto, a former San Francisco supervisor and daughter of former
mayor Joseph Alioto, said her clients received more than $8.5
million of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The rest went to the three clients of attorney Waukeen McCoy, a
former member of Alioto's firm who is now in the middle of a legal
dispute with Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the plaintiffs first filed the suit in June 1998, and
six joined later.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed that the Bay Area Wonder Bread facilities no longer
hired black employees and did not promote the existing 31 black
employees beyond entry-level positions. Only one black employee had
obtained a foreman position, a job they claim no one else wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In their filing, they claimed that they were subjected to racial
and of degrading slurs. One worker was referred to as ``boy'' while
others were allegedly called ``too lazy'' by one supervisor,
according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The employees were allegedly told not to congregate as a group,
for fear they'd form a gang.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees claimed that they were ignored or punished when
they complained to management. The black employees were so
disheartened that they referred to the bakery as the ``White
House.``
</P>
<P>
   Interstate Bakeries denied the allegations, even after the trial
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBC has a very hard-working and diverse work force at our San
Francisco bakery,'' Interstate Bakeries said in the statement.
``More than two-thirds of the work force are members of various
minority groups. Over the part 10 years minority promotional
advancement at this bakery has been proportional to this
representation.``
</P>
<P>
   Wonder Bread employs almost 700 workers at its bakery in San
Francisco and distribution plants in Oakland and San Jose.

NOMINEE PACES HIMSELF FOR LATE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ When George W. Bush gives his acceptance speech
at the Republican convention on Thursday, it will mark the most
important moment in his political life.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be past his bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly trivial coincidence has become a source of
concern for the Bush entourage, who know well that the candidate's
sometimes awkward speech can become even more tangled when he has
not had enough sleep. Bush aides, well aware of the importance of
the moment and the needs of the candidate, are in fact to schedule
Bush for an afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Aides deny that they have been purposely keeping the Texas
governor on a lighter schedule in recent days in order to give him
rest. Although Bush held only one public event on Sunday and two
Monday, communications director Karen Hughes said that, outside of
public view, he had ``a pretty busy schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity surrounding the campaign has lessened
significantly since Bush named Dick Cheney his running mate last
week, and it appeared from the public schedule during the past few
days that he was pacing himself, much as he did in the early days
of the Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after staging one rally and rehearsing his 38-minute
speech in a friend's living room, Bush was the first to excuse
himself from dinner in order to retire to bed around 9 p.m. Under
normal circumstances, Bush is asleep around 9:30 p.m., Hughes said.
His convention speech will begin after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up the pace somewhat Monday, holding one rally in
Dayton, Ohio, and another in Columbus. He also stayed up to watch
his wife kick off the Republican convention at 10:15 p.m., and to
make a few short remarks himself.
</P>
<P>
   But with all eyes on Thursday night _ when Bush will make the
most important speech of his career to the largest audience ever to
tune him in _ the candidate is limiting his daily calendar to a few
large events carefully staged for television. And his aides aren't
taking any chances. Asked whether she was concerned that the timing
of Thursday's speech might be hard on Bush, Hughes said: ``We hope
he'll have time for a nap Thursday afternoon. It's a late night,
but he's been looking forward to this moment and he intends to make
the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At two events Monday, Bush drew sizable and enthusiastic crowds,
delivering his usual stump speech with minor adjustments that
hinted at what his convention speech might sound like. He also
attracted his first real counterdemonstrations by Gore supporters.
At least two dozen _ most of them union workers _ shouted loudly
during a speech in Dayton, and about 50 Gore supporters chanted and
cheered on the sidewalk outside his event at the State House in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared not to notice, however, and aides seemed pleased
at the size of the crowds, especially given that it was the first
day of campaigning in a swing district. Although he claimed to be
on a ``battleground tour'' of key states, Bush has confined most of
his recent campaigning to mainly conservative areas since embarking
on his Philadelphia-bound journey last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday afternoon, Bush had practiced his convention speech
four times, twice using a teleprompter. During the rehearsal Sunday
_ which took place in front of a dozen close friends, including
former business partner William O. DeWitt; his wife, Kathie;
fund-raiser Mercer Reynolds III; and his wife, Gaby _ several of
the attendees cheered, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very reassuring,'' Hughes said. ``I know what the
applause lines are supposed to be. They didn't, and they
applauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the content of the speech is only one part of the effort
to bring his convention appearance to perfection. Bush also has
been testing a more exuberant style, which he may bring out in full
during the Thursday appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the matter of his sleep. Bush has long
treasured his private time, reserving time to go running and
avoiding events that run late at night. He faced criticism while
campaigning during the New Hampshire primary from voters who felt
he was too laid-back; yet when he did hit the trail hard,
campaigning for more than 14 hours on one particular day, Bush made
one of his most memorable verbal missteps.
</P>
<P>
   At an appearance in Iowa on Jan. 21, Bush told the audience:
``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and we knew
exactly who the `they' were. It was us versus them. And it was
clear who `them' was. Today, we're not so sure who the `they' are.
But we know they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hughes's explanation at the time was one she does not seem
eager to repeat: ``That's how we talk in Texas when we're tired.''

ESTONIA'S `UNPRESIDENT' SETS PERFECTIONIST GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROHUNEEME, Estonia _ Returning home from abroad several years
ago, President Lennart Meri stormed past reporters and aides into
the Tallinn airport's grimy public restroom. There, amid the stench
wafting from the fungus-caked urinals, Meri announced he was
holding a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   As baffled reporters crowded in, Meri declared that if Estonians
were ever going to be taken seriously by the world, they needed to
clean up their act, literally. Soviet-era squalor, like the airport
restroom, would have to become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tallinn's airport and its restrooms are as clean and
efficient as any in the United States. The incident speaks volumes
about Meri and his governing style, at times stern and impulsive,
at others wise and kindly. Tiny Estonia _ roughly the size of
Vermont and New Hampshire combined _ must ``strive to be perfect,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The professorial Meri, with his wispy white hair, thick glasses,
sharp wit and quirky manners, is approaching his final year in
office. The only president Estonia has known since it regained its
independence from Russia in 1991, Meri remains one of Eastern
Europe's most popular leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of prepackaged and overmanaged politicians, Meri, 71,
is the unpresident. He is impulsive and sometimes undiplomatic. He
doesn't talk in sound bites. What he does is speak his mind in a
way that makes John McCain's Straight Talk Express look like
politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Meri disdains pomp. He often shocks world leaders, and his own
people, with what many consider impolitic comments and behavior at
state functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to violate official protocol,'' Meri said, smiling,
during an interview at his home.
</P>
<P>
   And violate protocol he does. He once chastised former president
Bush, saying he lacked a coherent Baltic policy. In an Estonian
independence day speech, Meri broke the celebratory mood by urging
Estonians to vote out corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will gather this scum with a ladle and throw it in a slop
pail,'' he told the nation. ``We will do it until there is no more
scum left to gather.''
</P>
<P>
   Meri's personal diplomacy has been credited with winning Estonia
a coveted invitation to begin negotiations to join the European
Union. He also has lobbied relentlessly for membership in NATO,
saying that when it comes to security for his country, which has
been invaded by Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, half
measures are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is like virginity,'' he said. ``Either you are a
virgin or you're not. You either have security or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Informal almost to a fault, Meri is more comfortable in a
sweater and blue jeans planting apple trees in his garden than
attending an official function decked out in a suit. In the early
days of his presidency, aides said, he always carried a Swiss Army
knife with him and was constantly making repairs on doors and light
fixtures in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with the ornate and stuffy atmosphere of the palace,
Meri moved to the seaside town of Rohuneeme, where he designed and
helped build a less formal residence last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, I wanted my teenage daughter to have a normal
life. Her friends were intimidated by the palace and were afraid to
visit her there,'' Meri said.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around the grounds, Meri smoothly turns the conversation
from horticulture to European history, from the Internet to
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his native Estonian, Meri speaks five languages
fluently: English, French, German, Russian, and Finnish. He has
translated authors as varied as Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Graham
Greene into Estonian.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a diplomat, Meri was a filmmaker, writer, and
anthropologist before he was elected president. In Meri's youth,
his family was briefly exiled to Siberia. He later traveled
extensively in the Soviet Far East, writing and making
documentaries about the Finno-Ugric peoples there, who speak a
language similar to Estonian.
</P>
<P>
   When the Baltic independence movement took hold in the late
1980s, Meri quickly took a leading role. After Estonia won its
independence. he served briefly as foreign minister and as
ambassador to Finland. In 1992, he was elected president. He was
reelected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a country gets the leader it deserves, you could say that
Meri is even better than Estonia, or most countries for that
matter, deserves,'' said Michael Tarm, editor of City Paper, an
English-language newsmagazine based in Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his presidency, Meri was criticized for his blunt
style. He infuriated prime ministers and Parliament by meddling in
the country's day-to-day governance. But his popularity has
steadily increased and now hovers between 70 percent and 80
percent. As he prepares to leave office, he leaves a perplexed
nation, said Merle Kutt, a travel agent in Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard,'' Kutt said, ``to imagine anybody else as our
president.''

THAT THING YOU SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month's prize for language trend-spotting goes to Lee
Schlesinger, who recently wrote to ask which was the right word in
the expression, ``If that's what she thinks, she has another
think/thing coming.'' Schlesinger had seen it both ways in print,
he said, so newspapers were no help.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing coming? You've got to be kidding, I thought. Maybe
a few typos, even a few misapprehensions, had made it into print.
But surely most people had heard _ on Nickelodeon, if not in life _
the stern warning, ``If you think you're going out dressed like
that, young lady, you've got another think coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, did I have another think coming. As it turns out,
confusion reigns in the media about this phrase. Over the past 25
years, it's appeared in newpapers and magazines as another thing
coming about one time in three. That's far too high a proportion to
blame on typos and mishearings; it means there's a sizable group of
writers and editors who really think it's thing.
</P>
<P>
   What swamp did this thing crawl out of? It predates Judas
Priest, the heavy metal band, so we can't blame them _ but they
helped the neologism along by calling a 1983 tune ``You've Got
Another Thing Comin'.'' And an odd musical coincidence suggests
that the early '80s may have been the tipping point for
think/thing: Only a couple of years before Judas Priest's hit, Bill
Holland wrote and performed a song called ``You've Got Another
Think Comin'.'' Holland, now Washington bureau chief of Billboard,
calls his creation ``a 4/4 medium tempo finger-snapper'' that
``owes a lot to Mose Allison.'' But the thing was already
encroaching: The Washington Post reviewer who caught Holland's act
transcribed his title as ``Another Thing Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origin, another thing coming is well entrenched,
especially among writers too young to have been told they had
another think coming. When readers tried to enlighten Laurie
Notaro, an Arizona Republic columnist, about the correct usage, she
didn't even bother to check it out _ she just told them they were
wrong, citing Judas Priest as her authority. (To be fair, this
doesn't mean she's a total idiot; her column is intended to get a
rise out of readers, and it does.)
</P>
<P>
   But metalhead etymology, in this case, is off by a century.
Think, though primarily a verb, is also colloquially used as a
noun; the first citation in the Oxford English Dictionary is dated
1834. In a late-19th-century example, an unnamed character proposes
``a cigar and a quiet think.'' This conscious appropriation of a
verb for noun use is nothing out of the ordinary; the same process
gives us ``a nice little lie-down'' (mainly English) and ``give it
a good leaving alone.'' To have another think coming comes along in
1937, as an American synonym for ``be mistaken,'' but it may have
been used decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, though, the meaning apparently faded. Is this because
parents stopped putting their feet down? Do we blame the boomers?
No matter: Once you have enough listeners who don't understand the
original phrase, it's easy to see how another think becomes another
thing. When the k in think butts up against the k sound in coming,
something's got to give, phonologically. Unless you're an annoyed
parent, enunciating carefully, the two k sounds will merge into
thin(g)koming.
</P>
<P>
   That's a normal process when consonants collide _ we pronounce
rank order as rangkorder and last temptation as lass temptation _
but the change can mislead a listener who doesn't know the words.
When Notaro told her readers, ``It's not `You have another think
coming,' unless you're watching reruns of `Hogan's Heroes,' '' she
was probably hearing think with the final k stressed _ sounding
like a sitcom German accent (or a very fed-up mom). But we don't
ordinarily pronounce that k. We're just supposed to know it's
there, if we're literate.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it doesn't pay to get exercised about the evolution
of language. We all use expressions that our ancestors called
barbaric, and many of our bugbears will someday be standard. But
another thing coming is a real test of tolerance; ``You've got
another think coming'' is so clearly superior to the nonsense
variant nipping at its heels. So let's put aside, for the moment,
the correct use of graduate and the true meaning of beg the
question, and concentrate on propping up this time-honored idiom.
If you think the job will be easy, you've got another think coming.

YOU CAN NEVER SPEND ENOUGH TIME IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLYING TO NAIROBI _ Snow-bonneted Mount Kenya lies below like a
gigantic rhino, seemingly intent on piercing the skin of the
single-engine Cessna with at least one of its triple horns
extending. But Stuart Hutchis, the Air Kenya pilot, has managed to
miss the majestic 17,058-foot landmark countless times, and,
thankfully, this is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kwa heri, Mount Kenya. Goodbye,'' says my friend, Aurelio,
showing off her Swahili. ``It's a wrench to leave. To leave Kenya.
To leave Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. This wondrous, troubled continent yet tops my visitation
list after eight excursions, sampling a dozen countries. Not
enough. Never enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane moves toward Nairobi, the departure point for
London, then Boston, so many memories crowd the neural mush. Most
of them terrific. Some apprehensive: concerns about the wildlife,
and more so about the friendly people of Zimbabwe, being led deeper
by the tyrant Robert Mugabe into the abyss of AIDS, unemployment,
inflation, corruption, shortages, and despair.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful country it would be if the president were as
concerned about his compatriots (other than his cronies), reform,
and the general welfare as he is about his own power and wealth. Of
course, sadly, that could be said about numerous leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys, like Mugabe,'' said an official at the US embassy,
``are scared of the people and what might happen to them if they
don't keep tight control. They've had bloody examples. They were
chilled by the beating Clinton took in the impeachment _ and that
was in a real democracy. It could go worse for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe put on a benign, welcoming face for American consumption
when Zimbabwe entertained the US Davis Cup team, knowing that he
would unleash the scripted terror when the tourists departed.
Though Zimbabwe is rife with attractions, an important source of
revenue, Mugabeism is likely to repel travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Falls is prime, one of those unique sites, like the Taj
Mahal, that exceeds expectations. ``You know it'll be very good,''
says Aurelio, ``and then you find the falls is even more
spectacular than its reputation. What about that double rainbow in
the mist on the Zambian side?
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Victoria Falls Hotel _ continuing in its Victorian
elegance _ is such a treat. The immaculate rooms, corridors, and
gardens . . . the view, from the magnificently tiled and landscaped
swimming pool _ the panorama of the falls foaming in the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the nearby crocodile farm, the residents could use
orthodontists for their overbites, but won't find many volunteers.
You prowl catwalks just above a mob of them and shiver peering into
the stony eyes of these killers frequenting the local Zambezi
River.
</P>
<P>
   A guide named Jackson said, ``They look lazy, but fall in and
you'll get a response. There,'' he said, pointing out a star of the
pack, a 17-footer, ``that chap is 66 years old and keeps 17
females.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a dirty old croc,'' said Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   As Hutchis, our pilot, approaches Nanyuki, Kenya, I think again
of Harare and the gifted artists like Daniel Baradza at the
Chapungu Sculpture Gardens. Their studio is the outdoors where they
work in rain, sun, whatever weather, creating beguiling pieces out
of several shades of basalt. Roy Guthrie, the director, provides
stone for sculptors too poor to buy it. You wonder how they'll make
out if tourists are frightened away.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from them is another man in an al-fresco studio, the
engaging, bearded Don Black, who teaches tennis on his superb
backyard grass courts. He's a bargain at $8 an hour. Because this
Black is white, are he and his lush property endangered? He hopes
not. Since he has sired three world- class players _ Byron, Wayne,
and Cara Black _ who have brought acclaim to Zimbabwe, chances are
they're safe. But who knows with Mugabe?
</P>
<P>
   Hutchis descends to pick up more passengers, saying, ``We don't
land on the first pass. Have to look around to make sure the runway
is clear of animals.'' A week before, an elephant meandering on the
strip at Kariba had priority. That plane on which we rode circled,
waiting him out.
</P>
<P>
   The equator crosses Kenya at Nanyuki, a town that toes that
line. There, much earlier, we had encountered the enterprising,
self-anointed PhD in physics, Patrick Mutua. For five bucks, he
will demonstrate the scientific mysteries of water flowing
perversely on either side of the Big E. At no extra charge, he
threw in a certificate testifying that the possessor has, indeed,
straddled the earth's belt.
</P>
<P>
   Producing a pitcher of water, two bowls with drain holes, and
match sticks to float in the opposing currents, Mutua poured.
``Note the swirling water spinning the match sticks,'' he directed.
``On the north side of the equator the water moves clockwise, and
goes down the drain that way, as in your Boston. But on the south _
counterclockwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Awesome. At the least a Nobel Prize demonstration. I
told him it would be more dramatic (and profitable) if he used two
tubs, occupied by bathing beauties.
</P>
<P>
   From Nanyuki we had plunged into the Kenyan bush on safari,
getting the real African feel: bum-busting jaunts over cratered
make-believe roads and would-be tracks. ``We rent from Hurts,''
said one of the skilled drivers, Paul Mundati, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only hurts when you close your eyes,'' said Kim Edmunds, an
Ohio refugee now a professional guide, one of four such accredited
women. She meant that the countryside and its animal inhabitants
are so compelling they divert your mind from the jouncing.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of escape from so-called civilization can be
addicting, as Kim, never intending to stay, discovered. She
cherishes the spot where she was married. Anyone would. Her hilltop
on the Lewa Downs reserve with a basalt slab as altar and Mount
Kenya as witness, offers a forever vista of untamed grandeur. A
rugged climb, and worth it. Many of the guests appeared in formal
black-and-white garb: herds of zebra seeming as fond of the remote
sanctuary as Kim.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish writer Isak Dinesen (a.k.a. Meryl Streep in ``Out of
Africa'') captured the essence of bush wandering well, often in
letters to relatives: ``There is something about safari life that
makes you forget all your sorrows, and feel the whole time as if
you had drunk half a bottle of champagne _ bubbling over with
heartfelt gratitude for being alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One only feels free when one can go in whatever direction one
pleases . . . pitch one's camp with the knowledge that one can fall
asleep beneath other trees with another view before one the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent four weeks in the happy hunting grounds, and have
just emerged from the depths of great wide open spaces, from the
life of pre-historic times, today just as it was a thousand years
ago, from meeting with the great beasts of prey, which enthrall
one, which obsess one so that one feels the lions are all that one
lives for _ strengthened by the air of the high mountain region . .
. filled with its wild, free, magnificent beauty in heat dazzling
days, in clear moonlit nights.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite so prehistoric as in her day. Our plane cruises
above land increasingly under cultivation and burgeoning villages,
indications that the bush is being squeezed constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the incomparable safari experience remains, as
dealt by those faithful to preservation, like Will and Emma Craig,
proprietors of Lewa Downs, the vast conservation territory in the
Central Highlands, and their chief guide, Phil West. And by Ron
Beaton, the savvy ex-hunter who operates Rekero Camp in the Masai
Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Indelible is the wonder and elation of trudging and driving the
wilds with them. They still have a great hand to play, shuffling a
deck of brilliant wild cards _ lions, giraffes, elephants,
buffaloes, rhinos, hippos, leopards _ as well as a supporting cast
of zebras, wildebeests, hyenas, warthogs, a stunning variety of
antelopes, and more different birds than you could shake an
Audubonian tome at.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingwayesque, but Hemingway himself might not have liked it as
much since hunting has been banned in Kenya for several years. Not
that walking the neighborhood is always a stroll in the park.
That's why chaperones West and Beaton carry high-powered rifles.
One of Beaton's men, Salaton Kileya, will, on request, proudly show
you his scarred backside, barely retrieved from a lion. ``
`Half-ass Salaton,' we call him,'' says a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   My thoughts also go back to the 335 wonderful barefoot kids at
Ntugi Primary School, near Lewa Downs. Classrooms, dirt-floored
sheds of sheet metal and planking with no electricity or running
water, are nonetheless rare and lucky places filled with eagerness
to learn, and dedicated teachers working with primitive equipment
(bottle caps are used to teach counting).
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is the Key to Success,'' says the prominent sign put
up by the tireless headmaster, John Ngeera. He attended this school
himself not long after its founding in 1969, and was taught by
jovial Katherine Kathurima, who remains as a guiding force.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewa supports this and three other area schools, they
aren't sufficient. Most rural kids don't make it to school at all.
Will Craig said, ``We do what we can, and hope to do more. We'll
take any help we can get from anywhere.'' (Lewa Wildlife
Conservancy, Private Bag, Isiolo, Kenya.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We lack the basic tools, but we have spirit,'' said Ngeera,
and that was clear as he took us around.
</P>
<P>
   One helping hand is that of the Zoological Society of
Milwaukee's Foundation for Wildlife Conservation. Their current
project, said director Gil Boese (10005 West Bluemound Road,
Milwaukee, WI 53226) is building a pipeline from a reservoir to
Ntugi so that the school will have water for drinking and planting
a garden, and the kids won't have to schlep it, as now, five miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``An important subject in these schools is conservation,'' said
Boese. ``It's vital that the future community leaders, these kids,
learn the importance of preserving the wildlife, a great resource
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   You look into these young faces and pray they'll be part of
helping turn their country and continent onto a better path. They
stay with you, along with their cheery, hopeful response to life:
``Hakuna matata'' _ no problem.

&HT;     BAY AREA HOSPITAL WORKERS POISED TO STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than than 3,000 workers at seven Bay Area
hospitals are poised to strike Wednesday for the second time in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file health care workers represented by Local 250 of
the Service Employees International Union plan a two-day strike in
an escalating campaign for new contracts with Sutter Health and
Catholic Healthcare West.
</P>
<P>
   The union conducted a one-day strike on July 6, and management
spokesmen for both hospital chains say that they'll be better
prepared to cope with the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to put our patients at risk again,'' said
Carolyn Kemp, spokeswoman for Sutter Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to bring in replacement workers if need be.
We're not going to transfer patients as before . . . We are working
with some agencies to bring in temporary staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Polzoni, vice president for marketing of Catholic
Healthcare West, said, ``We've been ramping down the number of
patients in the hospital. Our (registered) nurses aren't striking,
and that will let us take care of patients. The emergency room will
stay open. We're confident that we can provide care to everyone who
needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Local 250, which has 50,000 members statewide, insists that the
principal issue impeding contract settlement is patient care _ that
management refuses to give workers an effective voice in staffing
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and Polzoni said their hospitals had committees in which
rank-and-file workers had a voice in all patient care issues, but
that the committees never meetS _ in large part because the union
members show no interest in their agendas.
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Covington, a dietary aide and shop steward at
Sutter's Summit Medical Center in Oakland, said the problem was
that the committees ``look good on paper but they don't function.
When you get with these committees, we make no progress, and the
issues just lie there... We want the right to bring in neutral
parties to look at issues and then decide. They (management) don't
want us to have that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wages are not an issue at the Sutter Health hospitals, but
retirement is. ``We have a very crappy retirement program,''
Covington said. ``One of my co-workers just retired, and right away
she had to go looking for work because she didn't have enough to
live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wages are an issue at Catholic Healthcare West's St. Francis
Memorial Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco
and Seton Medical Center in Daly City, both sides agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholic Healthcare West pays the lowest salaries in the Bay
Area,'' said Local 250 spokeswoman Christy Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Healthcare West has offered the union's workers a 12
percent salary increase spread over the next four years. The union
is asking for ``more than we can afford,'' Polzoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 250 represents housekeepers, respiratory therapists,
licensed vocational nurses, clerks and a variety of technicians.
Nurses at the hospitals about to be struck are members of the
California Nurses Association, and whether they'll cross the picket
lines is a decision to be made by the individual RNs.

SPRUCED-UP WASHINGTON MONUMENT REOPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, Katie Dallman, 11, and her 12-year-old
sister, Natalie, have been fascinated with the Washington Monument
_ building paper models, watching television specials, and studying
its history.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a recent school project on the 112-year-old obelisk
that helped make the Dallman family the first visitors inside the
monument since it was closed 18 months ago to repair damage caused
by weather and time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got tickets on the Internet when Katie and Natalie were
researching the monument,'' said Steve Dallman, the girls' father
and vice president of a chemical company. ``When the confirmation
came back, it said 9 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9 Monday, rangers with the National Park Service
escorted the first batch of visitors to the 555-foot monument,
which now features a less-obstructed view from the observation
deck, a graffiti-free interior, and a repaired marble exterior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting a new car,'' said Ernie Price, a ranger with
the park service. ``It's new and fresh and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Lines for tickets, which designated a day and time to enter the
monument, started forming before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A line is not unusual, but normally half the size is
considered long,'' said Price, who estimated that about 1,000
people would visit the monument Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the six-member Dallman family, of Chesterfield, Mo.,
took the 70-second elevator ride to the top of the monument, a line
of about 300 people was moving along concrete paths leading to the
booth that was handing out a limited number of free tickets. Some
tickets are available in advance through a commercial agency for a
small fee.
</P>
<P>
   For Robert and Roberta Murray, of Auburn, Calif., the
hour-and-a-half wait in line is worth the nostalgia, as well as the
eagle's eye view of the White House, Lincoln Memorial, and Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to wait,'' Roberta Murray said. ``It's just a
very special site. It's very important for our liberty and knowing
who it's honoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Monument, which attracts 1.2 million people
annually, is not the only Washington edifice getting a makeover _
the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol, and the Jefferson Memorial are
undergoing repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the work on the city's tallest structure took on special
prominence because of the artistic aluminum-and-nylon scaffolding
that surrounded the monument during the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the less-obvious refurbishments to the Washington
Monument were inside and included replacing the heating,
electrical, and air conditioning systems; patching chips in the
walls, cracks and water spots; and preserving the 193 commemorative
stones.
</P>
<P>
   The observation desk now features educational exhibits and
showcases two replicas of artifacts _ the aluminum cap on top of
the monument and a donation box that raised funds for the
marble-and-granite structure, which was built in 1884 and opened in
1888.
</P>
<P>
   Security also has been improved. Now visitors must pass through
a metal detector, and bags are searched by hand. Concrete barriers
prevent vehicles from getting near the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the monument reopened Monday, the renovations are
not finished. It will close again in December for two months so
workers can replace the elevator with one that has glass panels.
This will allow better viewing of the commemorative stones,
including a solid jade representing Alaska that is worth millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million cost of the face lift, which started in late
1997, was funded by a partnership of public and private entities.
It was the first major repair project on the towering Washington
figure since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Besides unusually long lines, there was nothing extraordinary
about the reopening of the monument, no fanfare or ceremonies. But
for the Dallman family, the trip would be something they will never
forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just glad to be a part of it, and it really made (the
trip) special,'' said Steve Dallman, who then pointed to his
children. ``It's something they can tell their grandchildren
about.''

&HT;     FORMER LIVERMORE DIRECTOR DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Roger Batzel, the soft-spoken and respected
scientist who served as director of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory from 1971 to 1988, the longest tenure for a leader
there, died Saturday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batzel shepherded the lab through a time of great growth and
transition from a ``defense and nuclear facility to a multi-program
institution dedicated to solving the important scientific issues of
our time,`` said current lab Director Bruce Tartar in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But most important to Mr. Batzel, who studied under Glenn
Seaborg while earning a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry at UC-Berkeley,
was bolstering national security, associates said. He was a key
advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a scientist, and he believed very deeply in the
building up and the strength of the United States'' in the decades
following World War II and the attack on Pearl Harbor, said Duane
Sewell, who served as deputy lab director in 1971-78.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batzel had the confidence of lab scientists as well as the
U.S. Congress ``because he was such a quiet, kind, good
individual,'' Sewell said. ``Everyone respected him for that. And
he had a solid scientific foundation, and they respected him for
that. He was not what I would call a flamboyant or dynamic leader.
But things got done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batzel, a native of Idaho, was an Air Force navigator in
World War II before studying chemical engineering at the University
of Idaho and then moving on to UC-Berkeley, where he got his Ph.D.
in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Livermore Lab in 1953, two years after its birth,
as an assistant division leader in chemistry. In the next 18 years,
Mr. Batzel led the chemistry, nuclear testing, space reactors and
biomedical research directorates. He succeeded Herb York as the
lab's sixth director.
</P>
<P>
   During Mr. Batzel's tenure, the lab grew from 5,400 employees
and a $128 million budget to 8,000 employees - plus 2,000
additional contract workers - and an annual budget of $815 million
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batzel was an expert at recruiting top scientists and
program leaders, understood all research areas and could balance
divergent interests, said Dennis Fisher, an associate director in
the late 1980s who is now associate deputy director for operations
at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was just an outstanding personality,'' Fisher said. ``He
was a person you could talk to and always had a nice 'Hello' and
was interested in what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mr. Batzel still visited the lab from one to
three times a week, operating from a desk in the director's office.
``It was very clear the lab was an important thing to him, and he
took pride in it,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Batzel was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the
American Association for the Advancement of Science and received
the esteemed Distinguished Associate Award from the Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of nearly 54 years, Edwina, of
Danville; two daughters, Stella and Stacy; a son, Roger; and two
grandsons, Chris and Sam. Private funeral arrangements are pending,
and a memorial service will be held at a later date.

HARVARD-AFFILIATED GENE STUDIES IN CHINA FACE FEDERAL INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For researchers hunting the genetic causes of disease, the 1.2
billion residents of China offer choice targets. Not only are they
numerous, but many have lived in isolated villages for generations,
making genetic defects easier to spot.
</P>
<P>
   However, human research in China is also a minefield: Getting
true consent from those rural villagers who are illiterate and
traditionally bow to authority is extremely difficult. And the
communist government's eugenics policies could put individuals with
genetically linked diseases at risk of sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three Harvard-affiliated institutions are caught in this
bind. The federal government is investigating research initiatives
at the Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, and the Massachusetts Mental Health Research
Corp. following a complaint from a former colleague about their
research practices and whether they put citizens at risk of genetic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-affiliated institutions _ which are researching
potential genetic links to conditions ranging from obesity to
schizophrenia _ say they have adhered to the same rules they use in
the United States to protect study participants. But ethicists
caution that human research in China requires special vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all tied up in knots about the ethics of conducting
cross-national research, particularly between rich and poor
countries and those with poor human rights records,'' said Ruth
Faden, executive director of the bioethics institute at Johns
Hopkins University. ``Our current set of regulations governing
research on human subjects is inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   A national commission is developing comprehensive rules for
international human genetics research. The effort grows out of
fears about exploitation arising as scientists scour nations from
Iceland to India to collect genetic samples and medical records.
Doctors and ethicists have raised questions about forced
participation, privacy violations, and profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, genetic research in China is booming.
China has been developing its own genetics industry, with numerous
labs, gene sequencing centers, and a gene bank of about 50 ethnic
groups. It also has built sometimes-rocky collaborations with
foreign scientists and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Chinese officials temporarily shut down a collaborative
project on longevity with Duke University and a German research
center after a Chinese worker questioned the consent process and
others accused researchers of robbing the country's genetic legacy.
The genetic sampling of 4,100 elderly Chinese, partly supported by
the US National Institute on Aging, was resumed when researchers
and the government stipulated that none of the samples would leave
the country and evidence was offered that the blood samples were
given voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   No Chinese have joined in the recent complaint against Harvard,
but there was an outcry in 1996 following a bad translation of an
article about a new collaboration between six Chinese medical
centers and the Harvard Program for Population Genetics in an area
where about 200 million Chinese live.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences decried the
foreigners' efforts, saying they were exploiting China's genetic
resources, and one Harvard scientist was temporarily blocked from
exporting genetic samples. China subsequently imposed rules
requiring all foreigners to get approval before exporting genetic
material and to share scientific or financial proceeds with the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Two Chinese scientists at the Academy, who declined to be
identified, said last week that they remained concerned about
foreign violation of their intellectual property rights. They said
they were unaware of any problems with the current Harvard studies
or any complaints about forced participation in such research.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwendolyn Zahner, a psychiatric epidemiologist, formerly an
assistant professor at Harvard's public health school, said that
Harvard researchers did not comply with US rules and that they took
advantage of the social and political situation in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper, larger, and faster genetics studies are possible in
China only because the country has not yet established the legal,
environmental, workplace, and medical protections afforded to
American citizens,'' wrote Zahner, who filed the confidential
complaint against Harvard with the federal Office for Protection
from Research Risks, which was recently reconfigured into the
Office for Human Research Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-page complaint, obtained by the Globe, concerns nearly a
dozen studies recently concluded or still under way in China that
are overseen by Dr. Ming T. Tsuang of the Massachusetts Mental
Health Research Corp. and Harvard Medical School or Dr. Xiping Xu
of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Program for Population
Genetics at the Harvard School of Public Health. One study with no
genetic component included in the complaint was conducted by Dr.
David Christiani of the public health school.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which together involved thousands of Chinese
participants, were seeking genetic and other causes for ailments,
including asthma, obesity, miscarriage, and schizophrenia, and in
all but four cases included collection of blood samples for DNA
analysis. None of the studies involved potential treatment. In each
case, the Harvard researchers worked with Chinese collaborators,
who carried out much of the work. Two studies were funded by
Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., and the remainder
by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Zahner questions whether participants, some of whom were
illiterate, willingly and knowingly consented or whether they were
coerced by the involvement of local health officials or small
payments offered as reimbursement for missed work. She asks whether
DNA samples might have slipped into the hands of local officials,
which could put participants at risk of discrimination or forced
sterilization. She asks whether participants might have been harmed
by the use of unsterilized needles to draw blood and whether the
review boards at the Massachusetts institutions provided proper
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence to support the allegations, she cites published
studies, knowledge gained while helping review studies at Harvard,
and trips to China after she left Harvard in 1998 when her contract
was not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers and institutes rebutted the complaint item by
item and vociferously defended their research practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time that any research is done anywhere in the world
sanctioned by the Harvard School of Public Health, it must meet the
standards that apply to research in the United States,'' said James
Ware, dean for academic affairs, in comments that were echoed by
representatives of the other institutions. ``No research was done
without obtaining informed consent, and no people were put in
harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the government is still reviewing the institutions'
responses, months after they were submitted. And ethicists say the
conditions in China may result in even the most protective measures
being applied unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham officials acknowledge that the hospital's oversight
committee could have benefited from more knowledge of China and
delegated too much authority early on to a parallel committee in
China, which allowed work to begin before US approval. The Johns
Hopkins ethicist, Faden, while not familiar with the Harvard case,
said that in the United States ``most local institutional review
boards are not well equipped'' to oversee international research.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is growing knowledge and acceptance of Western
notions of consent among prominent researchers in China, the
concept is still foreign to average citizens in a nation where
collective decision-making is the norm and coercive policies are
common. ``It's a particular problem when you're dealing with
illiterate populations and particularly complicated science, like
genetics,'' said Sophia Gruskin, an assistant professor of health
and human rights at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Potential discrimination against individuals based on genetic
testing is both Zahner's and ethicists' greatest concern. Some
provinces in China have policies requiring sterilization of
individuals with certain genetic conditions, and a national law
widely seen in the West as a eugenics policy is on the books,
although reportedly it is not being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard researchers say they have been careful to use
numerical codes, rather than names, to link genetic information
with medical records and to limit access to the key codes. They say
no one in the Chinese government has asked for access to those
codes, although local public health officials and public
universities are involved in some of the research.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University medical ethicist George Annas said there is
always a potential risk unless the code linking names to samples
has been destroyed. ``It's hard to believe there's a firewall
between public universities and the government,'' he said. ``If
there's a code that someone can break, it's a problem. China does
not have the best human rights record.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in May, President Jiang Zemin of China told Science
magazine that ``the prevention of gene-based discrimination'' and
``the protection of privacy'' were ``issues of concern.'' He also
said collaborations with Harvard were proceeding smoothly.

COLLEGES CUT RACE'S ROLE IN ADMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an upcoming courtroom showdown and a presidential election
raising the stakes, affirmative action at state universities across
the nation has reached a turning point, as a growing number of
colleges gut or abolish boosts given to minority applicants,
particularly blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since affirmative action became widespread,
freshmen planning to attend the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst and the University of Virginia this fall were not admitted
under policies that college officials acknowledge heavily benefited
some minority students with mediocre grades or test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools have sharply reduced the role that race plays in
admissions, officials said. But because of aggressive recruiting
and revised admissions criteria, neither expect sharp dropoffs in
minority numbers this fall. Yet academic disparities among students
remain: For example, among the middle 50 percent of University of
Virginia incoming freshmen, black students' Scholastic Assessment
Test scores were about 200 points lower than those of white
students.
</P>
<P>
   UMass's previous policy helped spur a 13 percent increase in the
number of minorities at Amherst from 1995-99. The number of whites
enrolled fell by 9.3 percent _ or nearly 1,400 students _ during
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Blaustein, UMass-Amherst's director of institutional
research, attributed the falling white enrollments to aggressive
diversity policies and changing demographics statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trend we were expecting or hoping for, given the
commitment to diversity,'' Blaustein said. ``That was the direction
we were hoping to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Florida's 10 public universities officially stopped
using preferences in admissions. Instead, they are taking all
applicants ranked in the top 20 percent of state high schools _ a
policy that relies on schools that are largely black or Hispanic to
guarantee pools of minority students. For example, for a mainly
Hispanic high school with 200 seniors, the top 20 percent policy
would guarantee admission to 40 students, many of whom would
probably be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials at many selective universities acknowledge
that some minority students have weaker academic records than some
white students who were rejected, they say the need for diversity
justifies the school policies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, preference policies have also been watered down because
of legal threats such as one that rocked the University of Georgia
recently, when a federal judge declared its affirmative action
policy unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In language that reverberated throughout higher education, US
District Judge B. Avant Edenfield overruled a 22-year-old legal
precedent used by the college to defend affirmative action. The
desire for campus diversity, he said, was not important enough to
justify favoring minority students because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``To base racial preferences upon an amorphous, unquantifiable,
and temporally unlimited goal is to engage in naked racial
balancing,'' Edenfield wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other rulings, particularly one by a federal appeals court in a
University of Texas case, have limited when state colleges can
favor members of one race over others. Most elite private colleges,
citing their independent status, still factor in race when
admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   Also driving the changes were the election of governors in
California, Virginia, Texas, and Florida who opposed affirmative
action programs. From that political environment emerged new
college trustees who saw racial preferences as discriminatory
against white students, and changed the policies in spite of campus
protests. Meanwhile, some voters have voiced their opposition to
affirmative action, with California banning the policy in 1996 and
Washington State approving a similar ban in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of affirmative action on campus, many agree, will
sooner or later be in the hands of the US Supreme Court. Partisans
on both sides of the issue see the election of the next president
as critical: the appointment of new justices could sway whether
race matters when future college admissions are decided.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial politics is a factor at the University of Georgia, as
officials mull an appeal of the ruling. Some are concerned that
eventually a majority of Supreme Court justices will find holes in
Georgia's admissions policy and rule sweepingly, ending affirmative
action at all colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the court to take one of the affirmative action
cases in the next several years,'' said Theodore M. Shaw,
associate-director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which
worked on the Georgia case. Because the law is now unclear, he
added, ``other institutions have panicked and cut and run from
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   One that hasn't is the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor,
which is slated to go to trial in September over how it weighs race
when admitting undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Bollinger, the university's president, said many college
leaders believe diversity is essential. But he is spending millions
of dollars to convince a federal court _ and the public _ that an
enriched college education requires a critical mass of minority
students on campus _ even if some have lower test scores or grades
than white applicants, who are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   On the Michigan campus, a majority of freshmen arrive from
all-white or all-black high schools, some never having analyzed a
novel or researched a history project with a member of another
race. ``The universities of this country have performed an
important role in our society _ helping youth see the world through
different eyes,'' Bollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But at what price? Judy Hample, the executive vice chancellor at
the State University System of Florida, said resentments stirred by
what some see as playing favorites with applicants come at a high
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an inherent unfairness in looking at race or gender
preferences in admissions,'' Hample said. ``The only time that's
justified is when you have current effects of some past
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials recently sent letters guaranteeing admission
to Florida students who graduated in the top 20 percent of their
high school class. About 13 percent of them are black and 14
percent are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells students,'' Hample said, ``is you're not going
to be admitted because of the color of your skin. You're going to
get in because you're able to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   But students like Seth Avakian at UMass-Amherst say that racial
preferences ensure that colleges can create the learning
environment they think is essential. Such an environment influenced
him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Concord-Carlisle (Mass.) High School, Avakian said, he never
really noticed that the resources, education, and family incomes
were substantial, but the diversity was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   His years in the dormitories at UMass-Amherst changed that. Some
students were once foster children. Some were financially on their
own. And the mix of ethnicities was jarring: He had grown up mainly
with white youths, except for some minority classmates who made it
to town from Boston via Metco, a racial desegregation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Concord bubble was burst,'' Avakian said. ``I realized
there was a real need for social justice, and that involved
creating greater equality among the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Having earned a bachelor's degree from UMass-Amherst a year ago
and now a graduate student there, Avakian said he sometimes wishes
his school took the stand that the University of Michigan did. But
as a student trustee as well, he thinks the financial risks would
have been too great.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of affirmative action say the Georgia ruling and the
steps taken by UMass and others are a sign of things to come: A
recognition nationwide that colleges decide the future of some
students on the basis of race _ and that the courts and voters will
continue to say: no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chickens are coming home to roost,'' said Terry Pell, a
lawyer for the Center for Individual Rights, which brought the case
against Michigan. ``When you peel away the rhetoric about diversity
and look at what schools are actually doing, they're engaging in
racial mixing to get a certain group of students. And you can't
just gerrymander to get that mix.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in death, former schoolteachers Agnes and Margaret
O'Donnell are offering lessons: Live your life. Spend wisely.
Invest well. Remember to love.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the messages reverberating in the wake of their
absence as townsfolk marvel over what the two humble Northampton,
Mass. women left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Besides good memories, the O'Donnell sisters left money _ $2.4
million of it _ to 10 groups, including their church, schools they
attended, and a Boy Scout troop that served them some good pancakes
at Sunday morning fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters began plans to disburse the money 10 years ago, says
their lawyer, Robert Carey. The lucky beneficiaries learned about
their unexpected windfall in late July, after the sisters' estate
was finally settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just shocked,'' said Michael Pasternak, scout master of
Boy Scout Troop No. 103. ``It was impressive that someone who
didn't have any firm connection with the troop would leave a
donation for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But how in the world did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Between the two of them, the sisters spent nearly 100 years
teaching elementary students in and around Florence, the
Northampton village where they were born. The younger of the two,
Agnes, died in 1997 at age 94. Margaret died last year at 100.
</P>
<P>
   When they retired in their 70s they were making around $8,500
per year, says Kathleen Sheehan, a close friend and former
principal of Leeds Elementary School, where Agnes taught for 49
years and Margaret taught for a few.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the women lived modestly _ drove midsize
American cars, kept their childhood home, squeezed every year they
could out of their classic clothing _ they were not penny-pinchers
by any means.
</P>
<P>
   So, many are wondering, how did they amass $2.4 million on such
limited incomes?
</P>
<P>
   ``How could two schoolteachers, especially in their day,
accumulate this?'' asked the Rev. Roy Duquette of Annunciation
Roman Catholic Church, where the two sisters were parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Wise investments, most people guess.
</P>
<P>
   And they are right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 20 years of their lives, there was no need to
spend a lot of money. They were consummate savers. They lived in
the house they grew up in. And Margaret had some good investments,
which grew over time,'' said Bob Wolanske, Margaret's broker, who
is vice president of investments for A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes and Margaret O'Donnell's father owned a grocery store on
Main Street. He died when the women were in their teens, and their
mother died six months later. They and a now-deceased brother then
went to live with their uncle and aunt in the house they eventually
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes, the more outgoing of the two sisters, cooked the meals.
It was the more serious Margaret who had a keen sense for making
money, say friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret enjoyed stocks,'' said Wolanske, recalling that the
first time she walked up two flights of stairs to his office, she
was in her 80s, but looked about 75.
</P>
<P>
   She walked in, ``threw three papers on my desk, and said, `What
should I do with these dogs?,' '' referring to stocks that had not
done well, Wolanske said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Margaret didn't even have a will, Wolanske said,
and only a few stocks. But over time her portfolio bloomed to
include a collection of blue-chip stocks like General Electric,
tax-exempt bonds, and utility stocks, including some telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   She rarely touched any of the earnings, Wolanske said. But when
Agnes' health began to fail near the end of her life, Margaret
moved her to an assisted living facility and moved in with her.
(After her sister's death, Margaret moved right back to the house
the unmarried sisters grew up in.)
</P>
<P>
   Anytime Wolanske suggested some ways to spend some of the
earnings, Margaret would respond, ``I've done it all,'' Wolanske
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sisters did not sit around saving foil or gift-wrap
paper to stretch a buck, notes friend and local historian Jim
Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they had a 19-inch black and white TV. And Margaret, known
for her heavy foot, drove a white Buick. Agnes, whom kids
affectionately called ``hot rod Aggie'' because you could barely
see her petite body behind the steering wheel, last drove a gray
Chevrolet sedan. The two ate out with friends often. Margaret
frequently flew to Europe, while Agnes, who hated to fly, drove
cross-country several times.
</P>
<P>
   But even as she indulged herself, Margaret also was practical.
Parsons recalls stories of her bringing back figurines from her
travels to sell to friends.
</P>
<P>
   While Agnes loved teaching, her sister always was one to take on
a second job, said Sheehan, including working as a hostess at a
local restaurant and building machinery at a Springfield, Mass.
armory during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although people are surprised by the amount the two left, they
are not surprised by the act. In death, say friends, the O'Donnells
are doing just what they did in life: giving.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations they left money to underscore what they loved
in life: education, young people, and helping the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes is remembered as a woman who dedicated herself to visiting
sick friends. And Margaret's name is etched on a plaque at Cooley
Dickinson Hospital in Northampton. As a volunteer from 1969 to
1995, she worked 10,619 hours in the hospital's gift and coffee
shops. Only eight others have volunteered 10,000 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gift shop manager Sharon Masters recalled a blizzard that
dropped at least a foot of snow and kept most people home. But
around 4 p.m., said Masters, ``in walked Margaret, and she was in
her 90s then. I said, `Margaret, how did you get here?' She said,
`Well, I drove, how do you think?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Masters asked the natural follow-up question: ``But
how did you get out of the driveway?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Margaret: ``I shoveled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Masters said, ``was typical Margaret.''

   HONEST-TEA (Undated) _ It hardly seems the stuff consumer
thrills are made of: a weak, watery tea, brewed the old-fashioned
way, with hardly any sugar and even less caffeine. Marketing? There
is almost none. Television ads and celebrity endorsements? Zero.
Still, when Barry Nalebuff, a professor of game theory at the Yale
School of Management, and Seth Goldman, a former student started
Honest Tea two years ago, they were well aware that they would be
competing against teas made and marketed by the Coca-Colas,
Pepsi-Colas and Snapples of the world. But they also saw their
product as distinct enough from the brands of those giants to
attract a different customer. For Nalebuff, the development of
Honest Tea has been an eye-opening foray into the real world of
supply and demand, a world few academics get to experience day in

FOR THE HOLLOW CREATURES, IT HELPS TO BE INVISIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ From ``The Invisible Man'' in the 1950s to
this summer's ``Hollow Man,'' it has been a widespread fantasy and
a subject of literary and cinematic storytelling: the idea of
becoming completely transparent, able to observe anything and
anyone without the risks of being seen.
</P>
<P>
   For humans, it's just a daydream. But in the ocean it is not
just a fantasy but a fact of life; In fact, it is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to make a count of creatures that you
can't see, it is quite possible that invisible swimming creatures
are, in fact, more numerous than any of the animals on this planet
that can be seen. Transparent beings may be the dominant form of
life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two or three decades ago, nobody knew most of
these gelatinous sea creatures even existed. Some, such as
jellyfish, were well known; others had been seen in fragments
hauled up in fishing nets, but because they are so fragile and
incapable of surviving or holding their shape in air, and because
they quickly turn opaque when they die, their nature remained a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new species of such beings are turning up with increasing
frequency, and scientists are learning just how crucial their role
in marine ecosystems is. They include a dizzying variety of
different types of animals, including jellyfish, squid, worms,
crustaceans, snails and exotic types unlike any of the familiar
denizens of the deep; what they all have in common is transparent
bodies, usually made possible by gelatinous body parts and
specially designed skin and internal organs. They inhabit the vast
region of the oceans far offshore, from just below the surface to
just above the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, they are known as gelatinous zooplankton. Although
plankton are usually thought of as tiny creatures too small to see,
the term actually encompasses all marine animals that can't swim
strongly enough to control where they go.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their physical weakness, much of the life that exists
down below on the ocean floor may depend on them. They help to
transport food sources from the ocean surface to the bottom in part
by digesting it and concentrating nutrients in their waste. They
also serve as an abundant food source for predators.
</P>
<P>
   But they can also cause ecological harm: Fisheries in the Black
Sea have collapsed because of the introduction of a type of
jellyfish-like transparent marine organism called a ctenophore _
probably brought there accidentally in a ship's ballast _ that has
no natural predators there. Meanwhile, Georges Bank has suffered
from a bloom of a kind of jellyfish larvae, called hydroids, that
kills juvenile codfish, whose numbers are already severely reduced
from years of over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get to know these evanescent will-o-the-wisps of
life is to join them, by diving or using robotic or piloted
submersibles far out in the open ocean. That's what Sonke Johnsen
and Laurence Madin of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
a handful of other researchers have been doing to learn about these
hidden beings that may dominate our biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Only by going out into the open ocean, Madin explained, was it
possible to begin ``looking at these organisms where they live,
instead of as dead stuff in the bottom of a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   Open ocean diving is not for the faint of heart. There are no
points of reference, no way to gauge size or distance, and most
frightening of all, no place to hide. Just a vast, featureless and
disorienting expanse of open water. And that's the key to the
lifestyle of the sneaky majority of animals that inhabit this
region, which, collectively, account for more than 99 percent of
this planet's habitable space.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not used to being in an environment that's totally
exposed,'' Johnsen said in an interview last week. ``When you dive,
it's an unnerving feeling: Anything that wants to see you probably
can.''
</P>
<P>
   On these open ocean dives, the scientists typically use scuba
gear to dive about 80 feet down while attached to a long tether
from the surface. ``We look like we're bait on a long fishing
line,'' quips Johnsen.
</P>
<P>
   If there's nothing to hide behind, the only way to avoid being
eaten is to be very fierce (think sharks), very toxic (think
pufferfish), or very hard to find. For what may be the vast
majority of the ocean's population, being hard to find seems to be
the preferred strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brutal hide-and-seek game out there,'' Johnsen said.
``It's an arms race between those that want to find things and
those that want to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly little is known about just how these animals
manage to be so invisible. That's the task that Johnsen has set for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems impossible: How could living flesh
possibly be as transparent as a windowpane? But, in fact, the proof
that it can be done is right in front of our faces. In front of our
eyes, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   The perfectly transparent cornea of the human eye is made of
essentially the same material as the opaque white of the eye that
surrounds it. The difference between the two is surprisingly
subtle. It comes down to packaging, a slight difference in the way
molecules are grouped and arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Johnsen has found, is for the molecules to be packaged
in bunches whose size and spacing is about half the wavelength of
light or less, or about 200 nanometers (about 8 millionths of an
inch). That enables light to pass without being either reflected or
absorbed on the way.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of other strategies used by the invisible
creatures in the ocean. Some have specially textured skin that
blurs the reflective boundary between the creature and the
surrounding water. And most are largely made up of a transparent
gelatinous substance that is mostly water and is inherently
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things that are very hard to hide. The
retinas of the eyes, for example, work by absorbing light, and that
necessarily makes them appear dark. And the contents of stomachs,
filled with freshly-eaten plant or animal life, are usually plainly
visible. Some such animals that feed on luminous organisms have
opaque stomachs to keep their contents from glowing like a beacon.
</P>
<P>
   The various strategies for achieving invisiblity work amazingly
well. ``Some are so transparent, they can be inches in front of
your face, and you wouldn't know it,'' Johnsen said. When trying to
collect a sample of one of these beings, he said, sometimes he
would get a glimpse of something when it catches the light just
right, and then he would ``reach down for the jar, and look up and
I can't find it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, these creatures range from the size of a thumb to a
basketball, but a few can be much larger. Some form long chains of
individuals that can reach 100 feet or more. Others are large but
almost as tenuous as tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   On a cruise south of Nantucket in June, the Woods Hole
scientists saw one jellyfish _ a recently discovered type called
Deepstaria, named for a submersible called Deep Star _ just outside
the window of their submersible. It was three feet across and two
feet high and looked ``like a clear upside-down Hefty bag, with a
drawstring at the bottom, slowly pulsating,'' said Johnsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just mesmerizing, a remarkable animal'' he said. But
because it is so large and so delicate, nobody has yet succeeded in
bringing one to the surface for study.
</P>
<P>
   But even more familiar organisms, especially in their larval
form, can share the transparency of these exotic species. For
example, the larvae of some kinds of lobsters are about the size of
a silver dollar, but as thin as paper, and so invisible that they
could be right in front of your face without being noticed, Johnsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to estimate the numbers of these gelatinous animals
in the oceans. For one thing, their distribution is very patchy,
for reasons that are not yet well understood. And they can also go
through sudden blooms in which an area of thousands of square miles
can be overrun with billions of a particular species within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They periodically just balloon and grow like mad,'' said
Johnsen. ``When they do, they clear out everything else in the
water column,'' devouring everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened when a species of comb jellies, which
resemble jellyfish but belong to a different group, invaded the
Black Sea, devastating the local fish populations. And now, ``that
same species has moved into the Caspian Sea, and something similar
may happen there,'' Madin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take a heavy toll on other animals,'' he said. ``They
can have a real effect on what the rest of the ecological community
is like.''
</P>
<P>
   But these explosions of gelatinous life might also play an
important role in helping to stave off global warming by absorbing
heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It turns out,
Madin said, that many of these animals eat tiny plant-like
organisms floating near the surface that use carbon dioxide from
the air. By eating them and concentrating them into pellets of
waste that drift down to the sea floor, these creatures are
actually making sure that the carbon doesn't just return to the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they may be an important ``sink'' for carbon dioxide that
is added to the air by human activities such as burning fuel. It
remains to be seen how significant this effect may be.
</P>
<P>
   So, it now seems clear that, in the vast stretches of the open
ocean, what you can't see really can hurt you. But it may also help
you.

THE MAGDALENS: INTRIGUING ISLES IN ATLANTIC CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walking along a beach, with sand whispering under my feet, red
cliffs hovering nearby, and the sounds of both English and French
blending in the background, I realized that I had gotten my wish: I
had come to Canada's Magdalen Islands in search of something
different, and I had surely found it.
</P>
<P>
   The Magdalen Islands _ or, in French, Les Iles de la Madeleine _
are a new destination for many Americans, and one not quite like
any other. They are part of the province of Quebec, but are another
kind of Quebec, located in the heart of Atlantic Canada, some 780
miles from Montreal. And although they have a couple of
topographical similarities to nearby Prince Edward Island, their
look is largely different.
</P>
<P>
   That look is lovely, with low and rolling green hills, red
sandstone cliffs, fields sprinkled with wildflowers, and 200 miles
of beaches with sands that are white or golden, and occasionally
have a touch of pink. Dotted throughout are cafes, bistros, and
homes, many of them painted in vibrant blues and greens and
oranges.
</P>
<P>
   These islands overflow with opportunities for outdoor activities
and adventures: sailing, canoeing and kayaking, windsurfing,
horseback riding, biking, hiking, birdwatching, and cave
exploration by land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   They are friendly, filled with people whose love and, in many
cases, livelihood is the sea that surrounds them. The 14,000
islanders are mostly of Acadian heritage, and the sound of the
fiddle is the background music of their lives. They are fishermen
(and, in two cases, fisherwomen), farmers, artisans, and
shopkeepers, who celebrate the summer with frequent festivals _ and
who see no need to lock their car doors.
</P>
<P>
   And the islands are unique. On most of them, the spoken language
is French, but a softer French than you hear on mainland Quebec.
Yet because of the vagaries of geography and history, on two
islands the language is English. Thus you can experience the
phenomenon of driving a little way from an island where virtually
everyone is speaking French to a connected island where everyone is
chatting in English.
</P>
<P>
   Les Iles (or the Magdalens, or the Maggies, as they are
nicknamed) are a 65-mile-long, fishhook-shaped archipelago in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. There are a dozen islands, seven of them
inhabited and all but one of those seven connected by long, thin
(and largely paved) sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   The most common ways of reaching Les Iles are by plane, or by
taking the ferry from PEI, some 65 miles away. It is becoming more
usual, in fact, to combine a stay on PEI, with its British Isles
heritage and its own brand of beauty, with one on Les Iles, thus
experiencing what feels like a multi-nation vacation with a minimum
of travel.
</P>
<P>
   As I boarded the ferry CTMA Traversier, I was reluctant, as
always, to leave the color, charm, and conviviality of PEI. But at
the same time I was excited at the prospect of a new and different
place. And the joyous sound of French songs drifting from a lounge
aboard the ferry helped ease the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Since I would be staying on the southernmost island, Ile du
Havre Aubert, the idea was to explore from south to northeast, and
although I did some back-and-forthing, I largely stuck to that
plan. I would quickly learn that each isle has its own look,
personality, and even accent. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Ile du Havre Aubert (Amherst Island, or Aubert Harbor Island).
The view from Havre sur Mer, the pleasant bed-and-breakfast where I
stayed, encompassed much of what I would see all over the islands:
the surf, the cliffs, fishing boats, a lighthouse, and the flag of
Quebec flying proudly.
</P>
<P>
   This island is known for its natural harbor, populated by both
pleasure boats and fishing boats. Here I watched lobstermen hauling
in the tasty crustaceans by the hundreds. Lobster is one of the
chief catches in the Magdalens, along with mackerel, herring,
scallops, and snow crab.
</P>
<P>
   A popular area is the historic site La Grave, which in addition
to being a favorite meeting spot is the site of the small but
complete Aquarium des Iles, with its shellfish, mollusks, and
seals. When I was there, a young employee began speaking to me in
French. When I indicated difficulty understanding, as would happen
occasionally during my stay, he switched to English to tell me the
seals were about to be fed. Thus I got the chance to watch Beke and
Bobo, the resident harp seals, chow down. La Grave has a cultural
center with a costumed historical musical, as well as a theater,
plus arts and crafts shops such as Les Artisans du Sable with its
intricate sand sculptures. There, too, are cafes and shops, some of
them in converted fishing sheds.
</P>
<P>
   Havre Aubert is also the home of the Musee de la Mer (Museum of
the Sea), which provides a good introduction to island life and
history, including information about the shipwrecks _ some say as
many as 700 _ off the island.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the island has the closest thing you're going to
find to a theme park in the Magdalens _ Le Site d'Autrefois, a
village that depicts island life and history through miniature and
full-sized displays, with everything from a tiny church and
graveyard, to a house of the 1930s that you can enter, to a shanty
made from an overturned boat that houses a real pig named Peggy.
The creator and enthusiastic host is Claude Bourgeois. After being
badly injured in a fishing accident, he decided to tell the story
of his islands by creating the village. To do so, he worked 70-80
hours a week for three years. And although he speaks no English, as
he points out displays, the message of joy in his creation comes
through clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Ile d'Entree (Entry Island). East of Havre Aubert, Ile d'Entree
is unusual in many ways. For one thing, it is the only inhabited
island with no land link to the rest of the others (it is about an
hour's ride by ferryboat or, in summer, tour boat). For another,
its 175 residents speak English. Although I didn't get a chance to
visit, those who have say it's like spending a day in the British
Isles, complete with Old World accents. The island is splendid for
hiking and offers grand views. Big Hill, the highest point in Les
Iles at 575 feet, is also here.
</P>
<P>
   Ile du Cap aux Meules (Grindstone Island). This is the
commercial center of Les Iles, and the municipality of
Cap-aux-Meules is where ferry riders arrive and get their first
view of the Magdalens. That is probably the least scenic view
they'll get, what with the cluster of businesses and services. But
soon you're surrounded by nature again. For my first, and one of
the best, views of the rich, red sandstone cliffs, I headed for the
Fatima region and Belle-Anse, which appropriately means ``Beautiful
Cove.'' That it was, with cliffs stretching far and waves washing
against them. Wherever there are cliffs, though, there is the
possibility that their edges have been weakened by erosion, and
there have been accidents, so keep back from them. Besides, a
distance from the edge, You will find sea parsley. I picked a piece
and found the taste refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   This island is fine for hiking and biking _ a network of trails
stretches to the other end of the connected islands. For strolling
and sunsets, there is the fishing port of L'Etang-du-Nord and the
enclave known as La Cote, with its shops, boutiques, restaurants,
cabarets, and festivals virtually every summer weekend. Over a
smoked mackerel sandwich with focaccia at Cafe la Cote, I watched a
sunset dye the sky red and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Ile du Havre aux Maisons (House Harbor Island). Beauty is
commonplace on this isle, with its winding roads, little gabled
homes, beaches, and caves that can be explored at low tide. A
scenic route leads to La Pointe, where you can see Cap-aux-Meules
across the water and sometimes watch blue herons fishing for lunch.
And speaking of lunch, one of mine was at Au Vieux Couvent, a
former convent of the Sisters of Notre Dame, where I sampled the
blue mussels that are ``farmed'' here as well as a seafood
pot-en-pot, a kind of shepherd's pie.
</P>
<P>
   Three attractions on this isle drew my interest. One is La
Meduse, a studio and boutique, where you can watch glassblowers at
work and buy, or just look at, exquisite examples of their art _
little houses within globes, sheep, fish, flowers. Prices range
from about $10 to $300 US.
</P>
<P>
   A very different place is Fumoir d'Antan, a herring smokehouse
where you can watch some of the drying-salting-and-smoking process
and sample the herring. I found it enjoyable to watch the reaction
of the samplers: This is a food that you like or don't.
</P>
<P>
   Havre aux Maisons is also home to a cheese factory, Fromagerie
du Pied-de-vent, where you can see, sample, and, not surprisingly,
buy.

   Ile aux-Loups (Wolf Island). The scenery gets sandier, with more
dunes, as you head to the eastern part of the connected isles. Ile
aux-Loups is the smallest of the main islands, where you can see
clam diggers and sometimes buy the mollusks at roadside stands. The
Craft Cooperative has items for sale, and the Maison du Heron
presents an exhibit of fossils, walrus teeth, shells, and other
artifacts from thousands of years ago when aboriginal peoples
visited the islands. And although the name of this island
translates to Island of Wolves, the biggest wild creature you're
likely to see anywhere on Les Iles is a red fox. The ``wolf'' name
probably originated from the local name for seals: sea wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Grosse-Ile (Big Island). Suddenly the language is English again;
residents are largely fishermen of Scottish descent and their
families. Old Harry _ and I never did find out who he was _ is a
pretty area, with its big beach, wharf, boats, and cliffs. You
might want to stop in at the Holy Trinity Anglican church, as I
did, to see the stained-glass window that depicts Christ as a
fisherman, complete with bulky sweater, jeans, and boots.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harry is also where you can hear a haunting, foghorn sound
rising regularly from the caves. Some like to think that sound is
the moaning of the ghost of a man who fell from the cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   From Grosse-Ile, it's a 30-minute Zodiac ride to Ile Brion,
which, with Bird Rock beyond it, is a haven for birdwatchers, who
find Atlantic puffins, murre, great cormorants, and snowy owls
among the 240 species that have been observed. Although not in this
concentration, birds can also be found throughout Les Iles.
</P>
<P>
   One other point of interest appears near the entrance to
Grosse-Ile: a salt mine, where tons of salt are extracted and sent
to the mainland for de-icing roads. The long, low plant, which you
cannot visit but can't miss, employs about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ile de la Grande-Entree (Grand Entry Island). You're in
French-speaking territory again. You're also in the lobster capital
of Quebec _ 100 lobster boats unload more than half the islands'
catch here. Appropriately, there is an annual lobster festival,
complete with celebrants in lobster suits. (I took advantage of
lobster-eating opportunities whenever I could, and one of the most
memorable dishes was lobster over pasta with vanilla sauce at Le
Table des Roy in Ile du Cap aux Meules. Another highly rated
restaurant is La Maree Haute on Havre Aubert. But for those seeking
just good lobster and other seafood dishes at relatively low
prices, one place to go is La Factrie, a restaurant, fish store,
and canning plant on the isle of Cap aux Meules.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides boats and beauty (and blue mussel farming),
Grande-Entree has the Seal Interpretation Center, which tells the
story of the harp and hooded seals who migrate from Greenland to
give birth in March on the ice surrounding the Magdalens. The seals
have come as close as 30 miles from the islands, and helicopter
tours are available. This, in fact, is the only place in the world
where the seals can be observed that way _ and observed by the
hundreds. The interpretation center does not ignore the controversy
over the clubbing to death of baby harp seals for their fur.
</P>
<P>
   On Grande-Entree, a unique adventure tour takes you into the
isle's red caves, with participants wearing wet suits and flotation
jackets. You don't even have to know how to swim.
</P>
<P>
   And here, as throughout the islands, you will see kites flying _
brightly colored kites in a variety of shapes, some of them being
flown from dune buggies. Because the island has few trees (most
were cut down by the early settlers for home-building and heat),
there are constant breezes, or sometimes winds, making conditions
ideal for the activity. People have even been known to meet their
future spouses while flying kites.
</P>
<P>

THE BIG TOMORROW 
Hollywood and the Politics of the American Way 
By Lary(cq) May 
University of Chicago Press, 339 pp., $32.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the most exhilarating work of revisionist film history
since Pauline Kael's ``Citizen Kane'' book. In a day when the mass
media more than ever seem designed to keep people stupid and
scattered, Lary May's ``The Big Tomorrow'' reminds us that the
first half of the 20th century was a lot more alive with populism
and activism than the second half. Far from teaching Depression-era
America to face the music and dance (even though what we mostly
remember is screenful after screenful of escapist fare set in
penthouses with white pianos), the period teemed with movies
questioning the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers, hazily remembered today as a kindly, folksy
comedian, is recalled as the half-Cherokee populist he was,
dispensing sharp-edged political comment and calling for the
redistribution of wealth. Starting with the rich, double-edged
title of his book, resonating as it does with idealism and noir
sensibility, May argues that the Depression was actually a
liberating influence on the American mind, freeing it from blind
subservience to the establishment, which obviously didn't have all
the answers, encouraging artists to junk European models and invent
new ones, allowing hitherto marginalized voices to be heard in the
new _ and to some, shocking _ gangster movies, working-girl
comedies, and snappy musicals. New archetypes appeared, from
two-fisted working-class protagonists (Cagney, Gable, Stanwyck,
Davis) to sophisticated iconoclasts such as William Powell and
Myrna Loy in ``The Thin Man.''
</P>
<P>
   May describes how films began to dissolve the boundaries between
what Americans saw at the movies and what they read in their
newspapers and heard on their radios. Today's rap culture, he makes
clear, recalls the social role of '30s gangster films, with their
implied revolts against class exclusion. Hollywood even went on the
attack against stifling gentility in its comedies, ranging from W.
C. Fields and the Marx Brothers to screwball comedy. Vernacular
entered the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   From the openly populist films of Frank Capra to ``The Wizard of
Oz'' (based on L. Frank Baum's novel arising from a farmers' revolt
of the 1890s) to ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' films began advancing the
idea that people born poor are not inferior and can achieve common
goals; they also began replacing Anglo-Saxon Americanism with an
alternative pluralistic vision. Debunking the idea that moviegoing
collapsed in the years of economic hardship, May asserts that
moviegoing in fact doubled during the '30s. And people went to the
movies for more than escape.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to the restless populism of those years? World
War II. With a new national demand for patriotic consensus, dissent
and questioning receded. The call for unity silenced radicals. A
shift occurred. The conversion narrative, with power stemming from
the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, was replaced by one of
supremacy once again flowing from the top down _ a change
crystallized in ``Casablanca,'' when Rick must shed his individual
independence for hierarchical values.
</P>
<P>
   Having regained the upper hand, May says, the establishment knew
how to keep it. American individualism was diverted into the
private realm of consumerism in the postwar world, and themes
linking art and social renewal declined. America developed a split
personality _ handily charted, May argues, in the Bob Hope-Bing
Crosby road comedies, which he sees as an American quest for
wholeness sublimated to the vision of an escapist fairyland. Hope,
the id, is forever being tamed and literally crooned into
subservience by Crosby, the superego; May sees this as a replay of
the traditional minstrel show, where blacks represented the
pleasure principle threatening to turn white (civilized) men black.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the postwar ideal of consumerism and domesticity
offered an entirely satisfying alternative. The anxiety resulting
from the stifling postwar imperative to conform gave rise to film
noir, May argues, with its outsider sensibility lurking in the
shadows. (He might have added the films of Douglas Sirk, that
master portrayer of postwar American domestic and social
entrapment.) May genuflects to Billy Wilder (``Double Indemnity'')
and John Huston (``The Asphalt Jungle'') for their subversive
criticism of repressive postwar roles, and he notes the
criminalization of desire that set the stage for the counterculture
_ a revolt that was prefigured in the rebellious archetypes of
Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the reams and reams that have been written about Monroe,
May emphasizes the linkage between her refusal to feel guilty about
sex and the social liberation this view represented, both in her
own films and in ``Some Like It Hot,'' in a supporting role as a
singer who refuses to get hung up on gender-stretching and sexual
identity confusion. In May's view, Monroe completed the rejection
of traditional confining domesticity that the spunky tough cookies
of the '30s began, and she thus became a profound threat: a
celluloid sex goddess who turned out to be the real thing,
outgrowing the limits of the persona manufactured for her by a
patriarchal power structure.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since the world of film has received as
invigoratingly coherent an overview as May's. His take on what
movies once were (energizing, as opposed to enervating), and hence
can become again, is enough to get you believing in them again as
one of the regenerative forces America so sorely needs, and not
just a herd of bloated cash cows.

BRENDA BLETHYN'S BLOOMIN' CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, Brenda Blethyn has been asked a certain question so
often one might confuse her with a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' the inquiry goes, ``have you, you know, ever tried, uh,
you know, marijuana?''
</P>
<P>
   In these scandal-happy times, such queries are usually posed to
politicians, not two-time Academy Award-nominated actresses. But
Blethyn politely smiles, and recites the story she has already told
dozens of times, and will probably tell a dozen times more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nonsmoker, so I haven't smoked. But I have had a
confection of sorts, like a cake with (marijuana) baked inside,''
she said with a giggle. ``Everyone was laughing, but I didn't know.
It was really nice so I had another one, and it completely laid me
out. I slept like a baby. It was better than a hot chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of answers Blethyn has had to consider while
promoting her latest movie, ``Saving Grace.'' The film, which opens
Friday, stars Blethyn as Grace Trevethan, a proper English widow
who, in cash-strapped desperation, turns her considerable
horticultural skills to growing marijuana. The film, which plays
like Cheech and Chong directed by Preston Sturges, also stars Craig
Ferguson, Valerie Edmond, Martin Clunes, and Tcheky Karyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a delightful film. I'm so proud of it,'' said
Blethyn, dressed in a smart navy pantsuit, as she relaxed in a
Boston hotel conference room. ``I just thought it was very funny
the route this woman takes to find some money, and solve her
problems.'
</P>
<P>
   For most of her years, Grace Trevethan has lived a satisfying,
conventional life in an English village. She's been in a stable, if
unexciting marriage, and is content spending her days tending her
plants in her greenhouse. But when her husband dies unexpectedly
(and, truth be told, comically), Grace learns her life and marriage
were built on secrets and lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a woman who's comfortably well-off and thinks she's
kind of happy. She knows her husband has had some liaison with a
woman, but he stayed with her so it's not too much of a problem.
She lives in a lovely home, in a nice community, and she tells
herself everything is OK,'' Blethyn said. ``Suddenly, he's a goner,
and she's left in the most horrendous debt. He's hocked everything,
he's not the man she thought he was, and this other woman meant a
lot more than she realized. So she's left with nothing; she doesn't
even have memories to hold onto. Everything she'd experienced was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When her caretaker, Matthew (Ferguson, who also wrote the
script), asks Grace to look after some ``sick plants,'' _ his own
homegrown marijuana _ he convinces her that there is much money to
be made growing and selling marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace is the most unlikely person, the most law-abiding
citizen. She doesn't know much about marijuana except how to grow
it,'' Blethyn said. ``She's a good, ordinary person. I know a lot
of people like her, and I think that's why audiences can relate to
her. They know people like her, or have found themselves in similar
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the film features more blunts and pot references than
a Dr. Dre video, some might perceive the reefer madness of ``Saving
Grace'' as an endorsement of marijuana. For her part, Blethyn
believes marijuana should be legalized, but doesn't believe the
film promotes or condones its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an ordinary woman in the face of extreme odds struggling
to solve her problem and finding herself in the process,'' Blethyn
said. ``As far as the marijuana is concerned, I think in
desperation if you're really up a blind alley, the survival
instinct kicks in. The film makes people consider how, far, in the
same situation, any of us would go, if you know you're not going to
hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own desperation, Blethyn said she has worked a few
regrettable jobs over the years, though nothing illegal. But jobs
such as cleaning hotel toilets are long in the past for Blethyn,
54, who has been one of the most acclaimed actresses in recent
years. Though she worked for decades on the English stage and in
British television, she was first recognized stateside in 1996 when
she played a downtrodden woman unexpectedly reunited with the
biracial daughter she gave up for adoption in ``Secrets and Lies.''
For that film, only her third, Blethyn was nominated for an Oscar
as best actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time around I couldn't believe it,'' she said. ``I
had absolutely no expectations because I found it absurd I even was
there.'' She lost to Frances McDormand (``Fargo''), but was
nominated again in 1999 for her supporting role as a bullying
harridan of a mother in ``Little Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time I knew what the procedure was, and I knew I
wasn't going to win _ and everybody I spoke to agreed with me,''
said Blethyn, who lost to Dame Judi Dench in ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' ``So I could just relax and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the accolades, the films came with one drawback _
Hollywood stereotyping. After ``Secrets and Lies,'' Blethyn said,
she was offered lots of scripts about ``unfortunate women who cried
a lot.'' And after ``Little Voice,'' there were ``lots of scripts
about ferocious women who shouted a lot.'' (It was that image that
landed Blethyn her role as fabled pit bull gossip columnist Louella
Parsons in the HBO movie ``RKO 821.'')
</P>
<P>
   Petite and attractive, Blethyn misses the variety of parts she's
played on her beloved English stage _ ``glamorous-type roles, you
know, happy people'' _ but she isn't scoffing at her
still-burgeoning film career. She'll soon be seen in Billy Bob
Thornton's ``Daddy and Them,'' and is mulling several other roles _
perhaps even one which may allow her to wear ``a nice frock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an overnight success after 25 years, but it's all been
very nice. At my age you don't expect these things to happen,'' she
said with a laugh. ``It's the same thing with the nominations. It's
wonderful to have the whole movie industry talking about you, and
mentioning your name among people who are wonderful actors. You
don't lose, really. Getting the nomination is a win, especially if
you're an old-fashioned English girl from Ramsgate, Kent, in
England, d'you know what I mean?''

WANT RESPECT? DRESS UP BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to get better service, and maybe a little more respect,
while traveling? Then shed that garish T-shirt and the jeans with
the holes in the knees and dress up a little.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to a survey commissioned by Fodor's Travel
Publications, is the secret to snagging that extra bag of peanuts
or full can of Coke, that desired upgrade, or that extra bit of
attention from hotel staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 600 American travelers, conducted by National
Family Opinion Research Group, found that 77 percent of men and 68
percent of women who dress well when traveling for business or
leisure do so because they get better service that way. Among other
reasons for eschewing sloppy garb:
</P>
<P>
   --The possibility of meeting someone interesting. Twenty-eight
percent of the women and 18 percent of the men surveyed gave that
reason for dressing up.
</P>
<P>
   --Concern about losing their nice clothes with their luggage.
Twelve percent of women and 9 percent of men listed that reason.
</P>
<P>
   So put on that sport coat or silk scarf. It just might enhance
your travel experience, and in any event you'll be helping to
beautify the environment. &QL;

   In response to our description of the $5,600-a-night luxury
suite at the Churchill Inter-Continental in London, Thom McCabe of
Westborough writes about his room at the Bali Inter-Continental:
``I was brought into . . . a suite which I later measured at 66
feet long and 44 feet wide including a 10 x 66 foot balcony
overlooking the ocean and Bali's spectacular sunsets.'' The cost of
this magnificent suite: $225 US per night.

   MAKING-MAYONNAISE (Undated) _ Though most of America still
depends on the stiff, oily cream in jars, to serious cooks making

   DISPOSABLE-PAPER-PANS (Undted0 _ It's a wonder no one ever
thought of it before. For years commercial bakers have baked their
pies and tarts, their pannetones and sweet breads in disposable
paper pans. That saves them thousands of miles of shelving that
would otherwise be crammed with aluminum foil pans. Now these paper
pans are becoming more available to home bakers, who have even
tighter space constraints. Made of specially treated paper, the
pans come in all shapes, including Bundt, are inexpensive and are
actually rather attractive, with gold and silver designs embossed
on a brown background. By Marian Burros.

`THE SHAKERS' PRIVATE ART' IS ON DISPLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first major museum exhibition to explore the spiritual
meaning and social context of Shaker gift drawings is on view at
Hancock Shaker Museum in Pittsfield, Mass. through April 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seen and Received: The Shakers' Private Art'' is notable for
the 25 inspired and little-understood body of drawings on view,
largely created by women, that in the mid-19th century captured on
paper a fervent outpouring of Shaker religious belief. The exhibit
is in Hancock Shaker Village's new $2.5 million Center for Shaker
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The village, a living history museum on 1,200 acres in the
Berkshires, houses the largest collection of artifacts at an
original Shaker site. The Shakers are known for their simplicity in
life, music, and folk art.
</P>
<P>
   The community was active from 1783 to 1960, and visitors will
see not only some 20 historic buildings but also examples of
furniture, textiles, and tools. They will also learn of the life
and faith of the Shaker community through demonstrations, music,
and talks.

dine, and seek out the bargains that annually benefit Grace Cottage
Hospital. It's a hometown festival like none other, complete with a
birthday parade (all the marchers were born at the hospital) led by
a 6-foot ``stork,'' also known at Dr. Tim Shafer, and the most
recent mother and child. (On one occasion the child was just four
hours old.) The day _ rain or shine _ includes free pony rides, an
art show, music and entertainment for all ages, an auction, a
sunset brass band concert, and a hole-in-one contest. Food ranges
from Belgian waffles and bisonburgers to a chicken barbecue.
Townsend is 17 miles northwest of Brattleboro, an easy 2 1/2-hour

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do you know the difference between a traditional opera and a
Madame Mao opera?'' Anchee Min, addressing an audience packed into
the reading room at Boston bookstore, proceeds to demonstrate.
While singing the traditional Chinese opera, she stands still at
the lectern, smiling gently, her voice preternaturally high.
</P>
<P>
   Then she shifts gears, donning a military cap, a remnant of the
Shanghai native's Chinese film studio days. Min's petite body comes
alive as she launches into propaganda-spewing action. Her face
glows, her arms freeze in a variety of heroic poses, her voice
deepens as she determinedly sings:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I fight for victory/
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't stop fighting until all my wishes come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance is Min's unique way of promoting her new book of
historical fiction, ``Becoming Madame Mao.'' The novel, which has
been popping up on bestseller lists in San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and Boston, tells the tale of Jiang Ching, the wife of Chinese
communist leader Mao Tze-tung.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which The New York Times Book Review praised as
``compelling and penetrating,'' is an intriguing profile of a
second-rate actress who molded herself into different characters to
please each of her four husbands (Mao was her last). Jiang finally
created her idealized self during the Cultural Revolution of
1966-76: a strong female protagonist who starred in the ballets and
operas she herself developed.
</P>
<P>
   After Mao's death in 1976, Jiang was imprisoned. Blamed for the
nation's suffering during the Cultural Revolution _ a topsy-turvy
time when intellectuals were vilified, traditional values were
attacked, and hundreds of thousands of people were killed _ Jiang
was denounced as a ``white-boned demon,'' a character from Chinese
history fingered for destroying powerful men.
</P>
<P>
   Although Min never met Jiang, the latter had Min plucked from a
labor camp to star in a film about Jiang's life. Before the
director had even shot a scene, Jiang was thrown in jail and Min
was denounced for her association with the fallen leader.
</P>
<P>
   In her best-selling 1994 memoir, ``Red Azalea,'' Min recounted
her journey from a Chinese film studio to a Chicago art school
(aided by her friend actress/director Joan Chen). With ``Becoming
Madame Mao,'' Min offers a revisionist view of the complicated
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Mao's the god, Madame Mao is the demon,'' says
Min during an interview at a Boston hotel. ``Here you start to see
the complexity of this woman, an early feminist caught up in Mao's
personal political will.''
</P>
<P>
   To paint this new portrait, Min jumps from first person to third
person, separating historical fact from the fictitious tales woven
both by Jiang and by the Chinese government that sought to vilify
her. She humanizes Jiang by packing the tale with enough sex,
betrayal, and political intrigue that it could double as a
bodice-ripper.
</P>
<P>
   Min includes a reference list of 19 biographies about Jiang,
Mao, and their associates. ``She just wanted to make clear that
this book had stuck to the facts,'' explains the book's editor,
Anton Mueller of Houghton Mifflin. ``And that there were more
accurate psychological and sociological ways of looking at Madame
Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   Min's strong opinions in ``Madame Mao'' and ``Red Azalea'' have
angered many of her countrymen. When she appeared on a
Chinese-language talk show in the United States recently, callers
complained: You are not the only one who suffered during the
Cultural Revolution, one said. Who gave you the right to shame
China by telling your and Madame Mao's story?, another asked.
</P>
<P>
   The response to Min doesn't surprise Ross Terrill, an expert on
China who's written biographies about Mao and Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Min is a ``resolute and passionate and maybe somewhat
egotistical person, the way she told her story of growing up and
suffering in the Shanghai area,'' says Terrill, who reviewed ``Red
Azalea'' but hasn't read ``Madame Mao.'' ``She is like Jiang Ching
in that controversy and strong opinions would attach to her like
iron filings to a magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has only helped make Min stronger than a Madame
Mao opera heroine. ``I'm not like Dr. Li (Zhi-Sui),'' says Min,
referring to Mao's personal doctor, who wrote the 1994 biography
``The Private Life of Chairman Man.'' ``He got criticized,
denounced by his country, (had a) heart attack, died _ paid his
life for it. They're not gonna kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Min says this, her wide-set eyes are fiery, her voice is
raised for emphasis. Her skin is the color of golden wheat, and she
mentions several times that she doesn't have the porcelain
complexion and almond-shaped eyes that pass for Chinese beauty
these days. ``I'm really considered ugly today,'' she says in
English that wavers between fluid and fractured.
</P>
<P>
   When Min gets excited or nervous, her native language suddenly
fills her head, she says, and her English falters. It's something
her 8-year-old daughter, Lauryann, teases her about, along with
Min's knack for getting lost on the highways of Los Angeles, where
she now lives with her second husband, Lloyd Lofthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Min credits Jiang for providing the women of her generation with
strong female role models, for helping them see that they weren't
blades of grass meant to be stepped on _ as Min's Madame Mao was
told growing up. But Min doesn't shirk from showing the negative
side of a desperate woman who fought for Mao's waning attention
through murder and deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to feel sorry for her,'' says Min, ``but I
demand an understanding so I can set the historical record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comprehension is necessary, Min believes, because many
Chinese are still living in denial when it comes to the Cultural
Revolution. Autobiography after autobiography has emerged, written
by people who blame Madame Mao for their woes. They ``don't have
the guts to say, `OK, I am a part of this criminal act,' '' says
Min. `` `I am guilty.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me eight years to reform myself, to say, `I am
responsible,' '' continues Min, who credits active ``Oprah''
watching while learning to speak English for helping her evolve.
``And I think we need that to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Min was 7 when the Cultural Revolution started. To evade the
beatings by neighborhood bullies that she received regularly
growing up in what she calls a ``middle lower class family'' _ both
her parents were teachers _ she embraced the ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to survive, you want to be the most powerful,'' Min
explains. ``To gain power is to be an ardent Maoist.''
</P>
<P>
   Min learned Mao's poems and won a district competition for her
efforts. Suddenly ``no one wants to beat me anymore,'' she says.
``Of course I chose society over my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Min's mother constantly shamed Min for her choices. ``She
would beat me until I passed out to set me right,'' says Min.
</P>
<P>
   The punishments didn't deter Min from causing great pain to
friends in the name of the Cultural Revolution. As a schoolgirl,
she denounced her teacher, causing the woman's exile.
</P>
<P>
   Min then volunteered to go to a labor camp in the distant
Chinese countryside, where hunger was a daily ordeal and the
bathroom was a maggot-filled outdoor pit. For Min the camp will
always be the place where she discovered the body of her friend,
Little Green, who had drowned. It is an experience she still speaks
of in a tremulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   Min says she and others had encountered the girl having sex with
her boyfriend at a time when relationships between men and women
were discouraged. The boyfriend was executed; Little Green, who
under political pressure had accused him of rape, went mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living with the guilt all the time,'' says Min quietly.
``We were responsible for her death. There's no way you can repair
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about such shattering experiences now help Min earn a
comfortable living in her adopted country. She does so with a
writing style that melds buttoned-down English with what her editor
Mueller describes as ``the flavor, some of the humor, and a lot of
the poetry of Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   One ``Madame Mao'' passage reads: ``She describes herself as a
radish pickled in the sauce of misery.'' Another goes, ``I am not
afraid of death if I know my spirit will live through the tip of
your fountain pen to the lips of the people, generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But before writing her way into this sunny final chapter, Min
spent several dark years in Chicago with her first husband, a
Shanghai native. The family lived in a neighborhood where white
teenagers crudely propositioned Min and a black man threw a rock at
her husband. The couple ultimately divorced because of her
husband's Taoist religious views.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes so deep that he thinks that to be born is a
tragedy,'' says Min, who yearned for a more positive life for
herself and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now ensconced in a suburban home writing full time, Min is
living her version of the American dream with Lofthouse, a Vietnam
veteran who works as a high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identify with Lloyd because he qualifies to be a communist,
he's so devoted,'' says Min warmly. ``I said, `Gee, you find this
American who suffered through war and . . . still has this idealism
and dreams of a better life, better society.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Min uses her pen to achieve her own idealistic dream of writing
Chinese history from a woman's point of view. A memoir about her
teenage years will soon be published. Then comes another historical
novel, this time about the empress dowager, another strong woman
whose 50-year rule in the 19th century has been maligned by some
historians who say she brought opium to China and murdered her
husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, says Min. And she'll prove it by using historical
documents, just as she did to re-tell Madame Mao's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found there was no other way to do it as a woman,'' says
Min, leaning forward intently. ``I would be known as the
white-boned demon . . . if I did not have the documents backing me
up.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After projecting an image Monday evening of a
political party that welcomes women, minority groups and
immigrants, the Republicans were poised Tuesday to present a more
familiar focus at their convention, that of the party that embraces
and promotes military strength.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Asian-American, African-American and female
speakers were featured; on Tuesday evening, the podium will be
dominated by war heroes like retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
former Sen. Bob Dole and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying message is the same: the Republican Party
under Gov. George W. Bush is united behind a single message and is
relentlessly disciplined and focused on taking the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The star attraction Tuesday evening will be McCain, who gave
Bush a strong run in the primaries. McCain faded after a few
initial victories, as Bush won over the party's base of
conservative voters. Still, McCain's maverick campaign captured the
attention of independent voters as he railed against moneyed
interests and pork barrel politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been so relentlessly touting Bush's candidacy this
week that most observers expect him to hew to his announced theme
of military readiness and strength. McCain is expected to talk
about his grandfather, a World War II commander, linking his
service to the wartime service of former President George Bush,
Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   The convention has been so closely scripted that even the
mavericks have adhered to the party's message.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, retired Gen. Colin Powell spoke of his support
for abortion rights. But when he addressed the convention on
Monday, he dropped all references to abortion. He still spoke of
his support for affirmative action, although in the context of
praising Bush's attempts to find new ways to promote diversity in
higher education and Bush's decision to address the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People last month.
</P>
<P>
   That position put Powell at odds with most of the delegates and
alternates in the hall, a conservative group that opposes
affirmative action in education and hiring.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative delegates cheered throughout Powell's
speech Monday, even as he took them to task for their opposition to
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On shuttle buses to and from the convention hall, some delegates
grumbled privately about attacks on the Confederate flag, a
cease-fire in the war to eliminate the Department of Education and
other attempts to moderate the party's image. But most appeared
enthusiastic about Powell, even if they did not agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton criticized the Republicans for what he
characterized as an attempt to change their party's packaging while
leaving the same product underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping if they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open
it before Christmas,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has ignored much Democratic criticism over the
last few days, on Tuesday he lashed back at the president. Bush
said Clinton was the one who was just playing politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome President Clinton's criticism,'' Bush said Tuesday
from Charleston, W.Va. ``He is so desperate to have his legacy

   Although Monday's convention featured the most women and
minority speakers of the week, the Republicans are being careful to
continue showing a diverse face throughout the convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, Condoleezza Rice, Bush's foreign policy
adviser, will speak. Elizabeth Dole, a former rival of Bush's for
the Republican nomination, is also scheduled to speak, as is Rep.
Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay Republican in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's events will also include a tribute to past

THE MAKING OF A MAN-EATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   As if we needed further evidence
that scientists are trying to kill us, a new robot has been
invented that runs on meat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps because the name Dracula was already taken, the robot is
called Chew Chew. Whether this will be a source of comfort when the
thing begins gnawing on your leg remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by Stuart Wilkinson of the University of South Florida,
Chew Chew looks more like a train of toy wagons than a heartless
man-eater, but looks can be deceiving as anyone who has seen the
movie ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' can attest. Right now,
Chew Chew runs on sugar cubes, but it could just as easily run on
haunch of humor columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, who has the sense of humor one normally associates
with morticians, said he is reluctant to give robots a taste for
meat because ``they'll notice there's an awful lot of humans
running around and try to eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   In the journal New Scientist, Wilkinson said robots that are
powered by food are superior to those that run on batteries because
they don't have to be recharged. For example, a lawn-mowing robot
could power itself by eating grass clippings. (It could power
itself even more effectively by mowing over your dog, but let's not
get irresponsibly alarmist about this thing until it's absolutely
necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   I would not be overly concerned about this if it weren't for the
fact that robots are basically taking over the world. A 1998 report
by the United Nations Economic Commission said there are 720,000
robots in the world doing the work of 2 million people. Most robots
today are in factories, but as robots become more numerous in the
coming years, they will branch out into more people-oriented jobs
like nursing, elderly care and housecleaning, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   This might be bad news for the medical profession where, too
often, ``bedside manner'' consists of little more than jabbing a
needle in someone's arm and handing him a large bill. Robots could
(theoretically) be programmed to have pleasant personalities or, at
the very least, personalities somewhat warmer than Nurse Ratched's
in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the warm, fuzzy glow that a patient receives from a
compassionate caregiver would be diminished somewhat if the
robot-nurse suddenly began gnawing on the patient's arm, but I am
willing to believe that `bugs` like this can be worked out, given
enough time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, home of Godzilla and, more importantly, Mecha-Godzilla,
is even more gaga about robots than we are. Last year, Sony came
out with a $2,500 robot dog called Aibo that looks and acts just
like a real dog assuming your idea of a real dog is something with
titanium skin and an antenna sticking out of its butt.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, my idea of a real dog is something that sleeps 21
hours a day and barks insanely at TV doorbells, so I am probably
not a good judge either.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Honda came out with a human-shaped robot with
the rather prosaic name of P3. (This would be a better name for a
robot dog, especially if it wasn't housebroken.) P3 walks on two
legs and can perform simple tasks with its two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those simple tasks include dragging home unsuspecting
but well-marbled humans for dinner, I cannot say.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is if you see a train of three toy wagons staring
hungrily at that tender region just beneath your ribs, you may want
to walk quickly away.

NO RED SOX DEALS _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The trading deadline may have passed Monday without
another peep from Yawkey Way (was it only a month ago that the
headlines were screaming Sammy Sosa's name?), but anyone who has
watched Dan Duquette operate knows that the Red Sox roster
shuffling is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker, Rod Beck, Pete Schourek, Eric Gunderson, Dwayne
Hosey, plus the Matt Murrays, Jack Voigts, Greg Pirkls, and Chris
Snopeks of the world have all been August acquisitions made by
Duquette, who takes full advantage of that post-deadline window
known as the waiver deal to tinker further with his team.
</P>
<P>
   And this month promises to be no exception. First baseman Rico
Brogna, the Turners Falls (Mass.) native and Watertown (Conn.)
freshman basketball coach, could still wind up in a Boston uniform,
even though trade talks with the Phillies fell apart Monday when
the Sox balked at every prospect Philadelphia asked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rico's extremely disappointed,'' Pat Gibbons, the player's New
York-based agent, said Monday. ``This morning, I would have said it
was 80-20 that the deal would get done. I was shocked that it
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the players weren't enough for the Phillies to pull
the trigger. It would have been a perfect fit for all three
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who have phenom Pat Burrell and just picked up
another first baseman/outfielder, Travis Lee, from Arizona in the
Curt Schilling deal, have no place for Brogna, who is a free agent
at the end of the year. They want to move him. Brogna would like to
come here and the Sox would like to have him, and Duquette may
figure he can get him dirt cheap if the Phillies opt to place
Brogna on waivers and no one claims him before Boston does.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman's troublesome left knee landed him on the 15-day
disabled list Monday, which would seem to make Brogna even more
desirable. But for now, at least, the Sox are content to go with
Brian Daubach at first. Second base was manned Monday night by Mike
Lansing, to whom the Sox owe a minimum of $7.25 million over the
next 18 months, a sum that may have given the Sox some pause about
Brogna, except as a rental.
</P>
<P>
   One source familiar with the Brogna talks said the sides never
really came close in the end but dismissed the suggestion that the
Sox had any concerns about the lingering effects of the fractured
forearm Brogna sustained back in May.
</P>
<P>
   The top hitters _ David Justice, Rondell White, B.J. Surhoff,
David Segui _ went elsewhere. Sammy stayed put. So did Juan
Gonzalez, though the Mariners came very close over the weekend to
swinging a deal for the Detroit slugger, one that reportedly was
quashed in the end by Tigers owner Mike Ilitch.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitchers _ Denny Neagle, Curt Schilling, Andy Ashby _
all wound up elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (Neagle, Justice, Glenallen Hill, Jose Vizcaino)
loaded up in the last month, as did the White Sox, who traded for
an All-Star-caliber catcher in Charles Johnson and a
still-dangerous bat off the bench in Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays added a starting pitcher, Steve Trachsel, who beat
both Pedro and El Duque by 1-0 scores in less than a month's time,
and another veteran in Esteban Loiaza from the Rangers. The A's
made a modest move, acquiring Jim Mecir, who briefly belonged to
the Red Sox, but he is a respected setup man who solidifies their
pen. Mecir, few will recall, was the player to be named later in
1997 for Duquette's first deal for Mike Stanley, then was claimed
by Tampa in the expansion draft six weeks later and never pitched
for the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians turned over 20 percent of their roster, but their
inability to land Schilling may outweigh everything else John Hart
did this summer, even as he replenished a pitching staff decimated
by injuries with Bob Wickman, Steve Woodard, and Jason Bere, none
of whom is likely to strike fear in the league's elite.
</P>
<P>
   And Mo's Angels, still lurking despite a paste-and-staple
starting rotation, picked up a veteran bat in Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox? Their big deal was Rolando Arrojo, the Cuban
righthander whose big-game pedigree dates back to when he was still
pitching for Fidel. Bret Saberhagen? ``We can't count on
Saberhagen,'' said Pedro Martinez, speaking the truth last week. At
best, he may give the Sox another five-inning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette is confident that the resurgence of Troy O'Leary,
combined with Saturday's return of the suspended Carl Everett, will
compensate for the inability to land another hitter (yet), though
with Offerman first slumping and now hobbled, the team has been
functioning without an impact leadoff hitter all season.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, by the way, the Sox finally placed Stanley on waivers
after ignoring his request to be given an immediate release to give
him a better chance to land a job. Stanley, who won't clear waivers
until Wednessday, is taking swings with his son back in a batting
cage in Florida while teams in need of hitters have been looking
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully something will happen,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was ripped by Nomar Garciaparra and especially Jeff
Frye, among others, for letting Stanley go. But Stanley dismisses
the idea that Frye was shipped out for speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that deal had to have been in the works for a
while,'' Stanley said of the trade that sent Frye to the Rockies as
part of the Arrojo/Lansing exchange. ``I don't think this was a
`We'll get you type of thing,' not when they sent him to a place
where every hitter dreams of going.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some revisionist history going on, by the way, which
suggests that it was Jimy Williams, not Duquette, who wanted to
dump Stanley, and that it was Williams who politicked for Izzy
Alcantara's promotion before deciding not to play him.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley isn't buying it. Yes, he said, he agreed to go on the
disabled list even though there was nothing wrong with him because
Williams thought the two-week break might be good for him. And he
did so much hitting in the cages during that time that he strained
an abdominal muscle, which is why he didn't insist he be activated
immediately when the 15 days were up.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Williams) looked me in the eye and said he wanted me to be
part of the team,'' Stanley said. ``So if that's true, then what
Jimy told me face to face doesn't hold water.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I trust Jimy Williams to believe him when he looks you in
the eye. But in 14 years in this league, I've learned that there
are a lot of things that are out of a manager's control.''

 MILLER HAD NO COSTLY FUMBLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not in recent memory has there been more hype surrounding a
broadcaster than the ado about Dennis Miller, who debuted as a
commentator on ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Boston Channel 5's 6 p.m. newscast, Mike Lynch teased the
Hall of Fame Game between the 49ers and Patriots by suggesting that
while all eyes would be on Drew Bledsoe, ``all ears will be on
Dennis Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   Even venerable ABC sportscaster Al Michaels got into the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to expect the unexpected, but this is off the
charts,'' Michaels said before introducing Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was true to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone in this stadium is more pumped up than me, they
won't be able to pass the league's standardized drug test,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he was excited.
</P>
<P>
   Funny? Well . . .
</P>
<P>
   He did use the word ``genitalia'' on national television. He was
talking about J.R. Redmond's groin injury, but who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Miller was able to mention drugs and sex within the first five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a little nervous at first. He said that Bledsoe was
sacked 55 times ``last night.'' Oops. That should have been ``last
year.'' Then Miller said a booming punt was a good example of the
``mile-high altitude here.'' Well, not exactly. The game was played
in Canton, Ohio, not Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is an acquired taste, and while executive producer Don
Ohlmeyer explained that he was not hired to be the court jester,
comedy is Miller's strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   As is star appeal. Tell the truth: You listened to every word
just to make sure you didn't miss a joke.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawyer Milloy roughed up the 49ers' punter, Michaels
wondered why Milloy was playing on the special teams in July.
Miller cracked, ``You know lawyers _ they get paid by the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his jokes fell flat. He said that Patriots coach Bill
Belichick was wrapped ``tighter than an expectant father's watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Miller needs a cable network to express himself more
freely.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, ABC is banking on the new Monday night crew to boost
sagging ratings. The opening promotional ad for the new lineup was
not subtle. It showed an old man, apparently near death, in a
hospital bed. A doctor placed headphones on the patient blaring the
theme song from ``Monday Night Football.'' All of a sudden, the
patient comes alive.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the once-popular showcase program is in need of
a resurrection. No one expects the new crew to erase the memory of
Frank Gifford, Don Meredith, and Howard Cosell; the television
industry has changed tremendously since their heyday in the '70s.
The emergence of cable, and the popularity in professional
wrestling _ as well as shows such as ``Ally McBeal'' and
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' _ have cost ``Monday Night Football''
precious ratings points. The show earned its lowest rating in
history last year, generating a 13.8 average, or nearly 14 million
households. It lost nearly 20 percent of its male viewers between
ages 18 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are still good in comparison to other Monday night
prime-time programming but far off the show's glory days; for
instance, it generated an average rating of 21.7 _ or about 21
million households _ in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Monday's debut, Miller will be able to hold his own. He
was able to publicly articulate what many fans have thought in
private. In the first quarter, Miller questioned whether
quarterbacks actually make three, four, or even five ``reads''
before attempting a pass. Analyst Dan Fouts, the overlooked new
member of the crew, explained that when he played quarterback, he
usually counted ``one, four'' before releasing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Football is, after all, entertainment, and for an exhibition
game _ one in which Bledsoe played only one series _ the new Monday
night crew made it fun. They were, for the most part, loose,
relaxed, and, well, entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Also making his debut was Belichick, who, when asked about
Miller, correctly answered, ``I got plenty else on my plate to
worry about.''

   For most of July, he whispered NBA sweet talk into the ears of
players who usually don't hear it. Rick Pitino found himself saying
incredibly nice things to and about Tariq Abdul-Wahad, Randy Brown,
and Bimbo Coles. Those guys hadn't heard themselves described so
kindly since their last family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has spent this summer _ his fourth in Boston _ trying to
reshape the Celtics. If this were interior decorating, the team's
president and head coach wouldn't have the resources for Crate &AMP;
Barrel. More likely, he'd be scouring neighborhoods for salvageable
throwaway furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 48 hours, Pitino will receive a few more reminders
of how tough his job is. The Orlando Magic will sign Grant Hill,
Tracy McGrady, and, possibly, Maurice Taylor. The Celtics will be
pleased if backup point guards Coles or Brown ask them to dance.
Asked Monday if he found such a disparity frustrating, Pitino said
that he didn't. General manager Chris Wallace agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In a small way, I can see what they mean. Jerry Krause, for
example, spent July standing in front of a $19 million pile and
asking the NBA, ``Who wants to be a millionaire?'' All the Chicago
Bulls general manager heard were echoes. Even though Krause put the
Bulls in position to be $19 million under the salary cap, he
quickly discovered that his derisive nickname (courtesy of Michael
Jordan) matched his record of drawing free agents: Crumbs. It's one
thing not to spend because you don't have money; not being able to
spend because no one wants your money is pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   So at least the Celtics were not Kraused in July. Abdul-Wahad
wanted to play here. Coles or Brown may wind up here. Ron Mercer
left here seething, thinking that the Celtics erroneously told him
that Denver was going to sign him to a $71 million contract, but he
would like to play here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of players who were
excited about the Boston Celtics,'' Pitino said. ``At times, I felt
like I was back at Kentucky recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Pitino usually got the players he wanted
at Kentucky. If Abdul-Wahad and Coles were high school seniors and
Pitino were still in Lexington, Ky., he wouldn't think about
recruiting them. Now, for his 37-win team to get better, he needs
them. There is nothing else he can do. If the Celtics are going to
make the playoffs, this is the team that's going to take them
there. Antoine Walker, Paul Pierce, Vitaly Potapenko, and, maybe,
Randy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Although he probably wouldn't mind trading Walker at this point,
Pitino can't do it in good conscience. There are two other teams in
the league, Miami and Indiana, that believe Walker could be an
All-Star with them. The problem is that when they talk trade with
the Celtics, they don't offer a fair return. The Pacers would have
loved to OK the swap of Austin Croshere _ believed to be on the
verge of a $50 million contract _ for Walker. But Croshere wouldn't
have consented to the deal, and neither would the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Walker will be here. If he made $6 million per
season rather than $12 million, he'd be gone by now. You don't have
to ask Pitino if he is concerned about Walker. It's obvious. It was
obvious to 500 teenagers in Pittsburgh last month at a Five-Star
basketball camp at Robert Morris College. Pitino was speaking to
campers and their coaches when he riffed into a Walker anecdote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a guy on my team by the name of Antoine Walker who has
the ability to be one of the five best players in the NBA. But he
isn't, because he has never developed his skill level. He plays
basketball 24 hours a day and will run full-court games every
chance he gets, but it doesn't help him improve because he has no
routine. You have to develop a routine and work hard on improving
your skill level.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen hoopers probably didn't expect an Antoine Rip to be a
part of their camp package, but it truly wasn't about them. The
coach has Walker on the brain. Pitino's legacy in Boston will be
determined by the 24-year-old forward. Pitino also knows that there
will be playoff vacancies in the Eastern Conference this season.
Detroit, missing Hill, will be a CBA team. Toronto and Charlotte
may slip out of the playoffs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is for him to get back where he was my first year
here,'' Pitino said of Walker's lone All-Star year, 1998. ``We need
him to be in the best shape of his life. This year, we can't be in
good shape. We have to be in great shape. It's important for us to
get back to our athleticism. That's why we drafted (Jerome)
Moiso.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegedly, Paul Gaston gave Pitino and Wallace a directive. He
said he wanted them to be aggressive in July (although I wonder how
the owner expected them to be aggressive when he was not willing to
spend far over the cap). This gave some fans the impression that
there would be a major green-and-white reconstruction. But this is
the reality: The aggression will have to come from, essentially,
the same characters.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said Tony Battie will have to be a defensive presence, as
will Pierce. Walker will have to be better. Someone is going to
have to rebound if Danny Fortson leaves. Someone _ Mark Blount? _
will have to become a shot-blocker.
</P>
<P>
   A major trade? Unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the most calls about Pierce and (Adrian) Griffin,''
Pitino said. ``One reason is that teams love their contracts.''
But, the coach said, ``I don't want to trade either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Pitino is trying to stock his team with the right
type of players. I still can't believe Brown (whom I love as a
backup) is only 6-2 because, as Wallace says, ``If there was ever a
guy who's a `big' 6-2, he's it.'' Griffin played hurt last year and
never used it as an excuse. Pierce can be one of the league's best
swingmen.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 1, the opening of the NBA's signing frenzy, look at
the players the Celtics add. Now look at their competition. Pitino
and Wallace say they aren't frustrated by this contrast. I have a
hard time believing them.

MARKET'S DROP ISN'T RATTLING MOST TECH INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might think last week's 10.5 percent drop in the Nasdaq
Composite Index would rattle technology investors, especially since
it came just a few months after the scary 37 percent drop in the
Nasdaq last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But you would be wrong. Tech fans are a hardy lot. Like bungee
jumpers, they expect some steep falls, but they have supreme
confidence that the downs will be followed by equally exhilarating
climbs.
</P>
<P>
   For them, last week was no big whoop. ``This is just the nature
of the beast,'' said Brian Grove, a portfolio manager with Vaughan
Nelson in Houston. ``Last week was just part of the normal
corrective process,'' agreed Marc Klee, comanager of John Hancock's
Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Nasdaq rose 103.95, or 2.84 percent, to close at
3766.95.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with less steely nerves might have found reason to be
nervous about last week's events. On the economic front, the
government announced that the Gross Domestic Product expanded at a
5.2 percent clip in the second quarter. That was considerably
faster than expected, and raised the possibility that the Federal
Reserve might need to hike interest rates again in August. The fear
of higher rates touched off the tech slide in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Within the technology world, Nokia, the cell phone giant, warned
of disappointing earnings in the upcoming quarter because customers
are holding off purchases until the next generation of phones
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   The Nokia news came on the heels of reports that personal
computer purchases were weak in the second quarter. Once the
mainstay of the technology business, personal computers are looking
more and more like a mature, old economy-type product.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the issue of valuation. Even after last week's
carnage, many of the leading tech stocks still sell at
stratospheric price/earnings ratios, according to Ned Riley, chief
investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Cisco
Systems and EMC Corp. have price/earnings ratios of 120 and 110,
compared to the market average of about 25.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of tech investors to all these developments: So
what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything fundamentally has changed,'' said Jon
Hickman, a money manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles, an Oakland, Calif.,
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish case for tech stocks goes something like this: Yes,
the economy is growing rapidly, but if you look more closely at the
numbers there is no reason to be worried. Consumer spending slowed
in the second quarter _ just what the Fed wants _ and business
spending on technology grew at a 20 percent pace. That investment
sets the stage for future productivity growth, say the bulls, which
in turn, keeps inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   And the earnings warnings by Nokia and others? ``Second-quarter
earnings were terrific,'' said Richard Skaggs, manager of the
Loomis Sayles Large Cap Growth Fund. ``Most companies met or
exceeded expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs and others view the warnings from Nokia and some of its
competitors as a temporary problem. Demand for wireless technology
remains powerful, they insist, and as such, the raft of companies
that make chips, parts, and software for wireless products don't
have much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs said personal computers have become more of a seasonal
buy, and he looks for purchases to ramp on as we move toward the
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   A number of managers we spoke to Monday said they used last
week's dip as an opportunity to load up on the tech stocks they
like. Several bought semiconductor stocks, which have been badly
beaten up over the past month. Others increased their exposure to
wireless suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grove of Vaughan Nelson put money into Lucent
Technologies, a telecom stock that has lost 40 percent of its value
since March. Lucent has some bona fide competitive problems, but as
Grove put it, ``I am looking for opportunities where the odds are
tilted in my favor. Lucent is playing in one of the fastest growth
areas, and 12 months from now you may be pretty happy that you
bought it at $45.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors haven't lost their faith in technology,
either. According to Financial Research Corp., investors poured
$2.5 billion into tech funds in June, a sharp increase from May.
The other fund categories that saw big inflows _ large-cap growth
and mid-cap growth _ tend to have a big percentage of their money
in technology, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of advice from the professional tech advisers:
Learn to live with gut-wrenching declines like last week's. If you
can't, dump your tech stocks and buy bonds.

PIONEER HAITIANS BACK IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamaica's Reggae Boyz phenomenon has been an inspiration for the
hemisphere's island nations. The Jamaicans qualified for the France
'98 World Cup, and their performance helped promote the country's
sporting image as well as showcase players such as Ricardo Gardner
and Theodore Whitmore.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a precedent to Jamaica's successful campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Republic of Haiti became the first Caribbean nation
to qualify for the World Cup finals and threatened to become the
surprise team in Germany. In their opening match, the Haitians took
the lead against Italy as Emmanuel ``Manu'' Sanon scored in the
first minute of the second half, breaking goalkeeper Dino Zoff's
streak of 1,142 consecutive scoreless minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sanon had predicted he would score twice in the game, saying,
``The Italian defense is too slow for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy recovered for a 3-1 victory, though, and Haiti began
self-destructing. Ernst Jean-Joseph, a commanding and elegant
central player who would later perform for the Chicago Sting,
tested positive for a banned substance after the match. The Tonton
Macoutes, the notorious enforcers of the Duvalier regime, then
began making their presence felt in the Haitian camp, leaving the
team in disarray. Even the spectacular goalkeeping of Henri
Francillon could not prevent Haiti's first-round elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was so excited because Haiti is a small country and
it was our first World Cup game ever,'' Francillon recalled Monday.
``But Italy is always one of the strongest teams in the World
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Haiti's starters went on to professional careers.
Francillon was signed by TSV 1860 Munich. Sanon went to Belgium and
then to the San Diego Sockers.
</P>
<P>
   Francillon and Sanon will be reunited when Haiti's national
team, coached by Sanon, meets El Salvador in an exhibition at 4
p.m. Saturday at Foxboro Stadium. The Revolution and Columbus Crew
play in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next four years, Haiti will be preparing a new
generation of players,'' said Francillon, now soccer coach at
Emerson College. ``When we were playing, the government paid a lot
of money to develop a strong team, and they got it. After that,
they didn't work with the young kids, and each generation went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of home-field advantage has been apparent in the
US' first two World Cup qualifiers this year. And Haiti was wise
enough to play host to the final round of the qualifying tournament
for West Germany '74. But playing before a home crowd of Haitians
can be a mixed blessing because of fans' tendency to be both
discerning and demonstrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished it by working hard,'' Francillon said. ``We
started playing together in 1965 and we were in last place in the
CONCACAF tournament. By 1971 we were second and in 1973 we were in
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Haiti soon was submerged into two decades of what amounted to
soccer isolation, a victim of a chaotic economic and political
system. Hundreds of thousands fled the country, including the best
soccer players, mostly to Boston, Miami, Montreal, and New York.
The return of Sanon signified a commitment to the national team,
which reemerged in the 2000 CONCACAF tournament, now called the
Gold Cup. Haiti was eliminated quickly from the tournament and lost
to Trinidad and Tobago in World Cup qualifying, but several players
impressed, and Sebastian Vorbe signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti is a poor country and it is isolated as the only
French-speaking country around,'' Francillon said. ``The team needs
support from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, this is a good team. The players have talent and
skills, and the more experience they get, the better they will
become. But it is difficult to play before a Haitian crowd because
they are like the French: Soccer is in their blood and they are
very critical. If you don't play well, you will have a problem with
them. The game is never over for them: They will stay around the
stadium talking about it until 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Francillon moved to Boston from Florida after Hurricane Andrew
in the early 1990s and began coaching South Shore United in
Hingham. His Emerson coaching position is part-time and he works a
night shift as a supervisor at Gillette, a strange fate for the
area's only coach who has experience in both the Bundesliga and
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might not be the right time for me, but it will happen
someday,'' Francillon said of potential coaching opportunities.
``It is the same for Haiti's players. The only way they are going
to get professional contracts is to go outside the country, because
no one comes to see us in Haiti. That is why the game Saturday is a
good idea for the Revolution to see some of our players.''
</P>

<P>
   A game of eight-ball
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer's three-division alignment has become
irrelevant. The division winners qualify for the playoffs, but the
true playoff race involves the competition to be among the top
eight, regardless of geography.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution play host to Central Division teams Dallas
Wednesday and Columbus Saturday, and these games could be as
crucial as the Aug. 12 visit to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our next two games will dictate where we will be at the end of
the season,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said. ``We have 21
points available in seven home games, and if we take 75 percent of
those points we should be in the playoffs with no worries. We would
be right on target for what we said we wanted to do at the
beginning of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution midfielder Ted Chronopoulos, who sat out the
weekend's All-Star Game to rest a hamstring strain, is questionable
after damaging a right knee ligament in training Monday.

 DON'T CANONIZE BISHOP JUST YET

<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Attention, talk radio denizens. Maybe it's a
little early to trade Drew Bledsoe, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant as a knock on the exuberant Michael Bishop,
who did well enough in his first moments of the summer facing real,
live (if you can call the defense the 49ers cobbled together in the
first half live) professional competition during New England's
exhibition opener against San Francisco in Monday night's Hall of
Fame Game.
</P>
<P>
   It is merely to point out that he had two wide-open guys (Rod
Rutledge and Tony Carter) on their way to the end zone and Terry
Glenn behind the defense early in the first half, when it counts
most, and he didn't put the passes where they needed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I missed a couple of throws because I didn't get my feet
under me,'' Bishop said. ``Sometimes if I see a receiver wide open,
I tend to try and get him the ball (too quickly) rather than get my
feet set and throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always good to hear a young player who not only
acknowledges mistakes but also seems to understand why they
happened; it bodes well for his future. But it must also be pointed
out that only four of the expected 49er defensive starters were in
the game when it began (six of their front seven and their strong
safety did not play at all), so even what Bishop did do early in
the game needs to be tempered by one simple fact: He isn't ready to
lead the Patriots against the best NFL competition despite his
obviously explosive athletic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this is not to pummel Bishop, who made a spectacular
22-yard touchdown run on an option play in the third quarter, when
both teams played guys who may never wear a uniform again after
another week or two. And Bishop continued to do what he did last
year as a rookie in the exhibition season: make enough plays to get
his team a 20-0 lead by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But it needs to be pointed out _ before the debate that raged so
often last year on talk radio begins anew _ that Bishop is a good
changeup, but a pitcher or a football team that tries to make a
living with changeups ends up living a lean existence.
</P>
<P>
   What Bishop showed was why he was runnerup for the Heisman
Trophy two years ago. He showed he can still make plays against the
kind of guys his Kansas State team would have manhandled. And he
showed he is more effective on the move than he is standing stock
still in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't show is that he should be playing ahead of Drew
Bledsoe, despite the fact that the talk radio fraternity in Boston
will be hollering about Bishop more often than Pope John Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some good things and he did some things that he could
have done better,'' Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said. ``Our
third-down conversion rate was not what you want to see (4 of 11,
36 percent). That wasn't all Michael's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but he was the quarterback of record, so the
responsibility falls on his shoulders, as it does on Bledsoe's when
he is in charge of things. Bledsoe, for his part, played only one
series behind a makeshift offensive line and did what he had to do
in a game like this. He stayed in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably be asked to do little more than that Friday night
in Detroit, when the Patriots travel to the Silverdome to play the
Lions. That means Bishop will have another chance to play his
entertaining brand of quarterback on the run, something he did well
enough Monday night to finish 9 of 13 for 101 yards, with a 25-yard
touchdown pass to Kevin Faulk, while also rushing four times for
another 50 yards, including a 22-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   Those are impressive numbers, but they are not the only numbers
that the wise talk-show caller should be looking at when it comes
to Bishop. There is also the number ``3'' that needs to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Three, as in those three open receivers, none of whom got the
ball where they needed it. This is not to say Bledsoe hasn't
overthrown Glenn from time to time. And it is not to say he hasn't
put a ball behind a receiver as he broke wide open, as Bishop did
to Carter and Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   It is just to point out what should be obvious to anyone but
those obsessively wanting a quarterback controversy in New England,
and that is that Bledsoe is a more proficient passer and far better
quarterback at the moment than Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   This should not come as a news bulletin to anyone who has been
paying attention, but the fact is you will hear that Bishop did
this and Bishop did that and how about using him on third down or
running the option on the goal line with him. Or, if the caller has
really been hitting the sauce, that he's even more dangerous than
the strong-armed but immobile Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was proven Monday night despite the numbers Bishop
put up. The reality that emerged was the same as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bishop is a talented athlete with a future. Put into
certain situations _ as offensive coordinator Charlie Weis did when
he had him run the option in the third quarter for a touchdown _ he
is a kid who one day may make life uncomfortable for Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But that day has not yet come.
</P>
<P>
   Not this week, and not any time soon.

   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: After an
evening projecting an image of a party that welcomes women,
minority groups and immigrants, the Republicans are poised to
present a more familiar focus at their convention, that of the
party that embraces and promotes military strength. Tonight, the
podium will be dominated by war heroes: Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
former Sen. Bob Dole and Sen. John McCain. But the underlying
message is the same: The Republican Party under George W. Bush is
united behind a single message, relentlessly disciplined and
focused on taking the White House.

   EDITORIAL-DEATHPENALTY _ Ruling by 11th Circuit panel in Alabama
death-row appeal is unsupportable. When judge writing for the
majority concedes the case against the condemned man is less than
overwhelming, the accused's attorney should have presented evidence
in mitigation during sentencing phase. Since he didn't, the

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ George W. Bush was either, in the cliche,
thinking outside the box or not thinking at all when he picked Dick
Cheney as his running mate. Either way, no candidate before ever
thought of going to the voters in a tandem of two big oil guys from
Texas. This a balancing act akin to a one-arm high BUSINESS

   BILLBOARD-COMPILATION _ For the first time in Billboard magazine
history a non-soundtrack, multi-artist album debuted at the top of
the charts this week, ``Now That's What I Call Music 4.'' It's a
compilation of hits, but not of the old, K-Tel variety we used to
see advertised on late-night television. This series has pretty
recent hits, some of which are on current albums. The appeal is
obvious: It's pop radio without the commercial. But what does a
record label get out of cooperating with a project like this? After
all, it could take away from its own artists' sales. What does
Billboard think about a CD of already-proven hits charting? And
what's the chance of this U.S. phenom going the way of the
long-going British originals, which now are banned from the charts?

&HT;     NEW INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WON'T ROCK THE BOAT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In appointing retired Justice Harry W. Low as
California insurance commissioner, Gov. Davis chose a man seemingly
without enemies and a reputation for integrity and competence _ but
no boat rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is banking on Low to restore public confidence in the
California Department of Insurance, in the wake of the scandal that
forced former insurance commissioner Chuck Quackenbush from office
last month.
</P>
<P>
   He is ``above reproach and, more importantly, above politics,''
Davis said at a press conference announcing Low's appointment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the former appellate court justice for his
character, intellect and judicial temperament, Davis tacitly
acknowledged that Low, unlike Quackenbush, is someone who would
find it unthinkable to use the insurance commissioner's office to
advance a personal political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe at the end of the day, if anyone on the planet can
restore integrity and credibility to the office of the Department
of Insurance, that person is Harry Low,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   low said he plans to apply an even hand to his new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly intend to administer the law as fairly and
favorably as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Justice J. Anthony Kline, who served with Low on the
1st District Court of Appeals and had been then-Gov. Jerry Brown's
screener of judicial nominations when Low was named to the
appellate bench, said Low is ``intelligent, principled and has no
political ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will approach this job with a level of objectivity and
experience that few people could.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 69, Low has been in public life for more than 40 years.
In addition to spending 1966 to 1992 on the bench _ the last decade
as an appellate justice _ Low also served as president of the San
Francisco Police Commission from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of California Insurance Companies said in a
prepared statement that Low's appointment is ``hopefully the first
major step toward restoring the department to an effective and
credible (industry) regulator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey Rosenfeld, a consumer advocate who co-authored a 1988
ballot initiative that made the commissioner's job elective,
questioned whether Low can be an industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a balanced record as a judge (but) we're disappointed
that the governor didn't pick an aggressive advocate for
consumers,'' Rosenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Low said he understood the protections the department must offer
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance department must protect consumers against unfair
practices, excessive or discriminatory insurance rates, and ensure
financial stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering specifics, Low said he plans to review
insurance claims from the 1994 Northridge quake that sparked the
scandal that forced Quackenbush's June 28 resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Low was born and reared and received his early education in the
Stanislaus County town of Oakdale, which is better known for
producing champion team ropers than judges. He attended Modesto
Junior College and graduated from UC-Berkeley in 1952. He
subsequently took his law degree from Boalt Hall School of Law and
went to work as a deputy state attorney general. He was first
appointed to the bench as a municipal court judge by then-Gov.
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. He won election to the Superior Court in
1974 and in 1982 was named an appellate court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance'' is the word that finds itself in virtually every
conversation about Low's performance on the bench. As a judge, he
considered a wide array of insurance cases before his retirement.
He has since been a member of the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Service's Alternate Dispute Resolution Panel, which
handles a number of insurance cases.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1999, Low has chaired San Francisco's Human Rights
Commission. He is also a past president of the California Judges
Association and a past national president of the Chinese American
Citizens Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Low married his wife Mayling in 1952, and they have three
children and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The new position will pay Low $132,000 a year. It requires
confirmation by a majority of both the Assembly and Senate. The
Legislature reconvenes Aug. 7 and is in session through the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican and a former assemblyman, ran into
trouble in May with the disclosure that he had given a
multimillion-dollar break to several insurers of the victims of the
Northridge quake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using his authority to require the insurers to
provide adequate settlements for earthquake-caused damages,
Quackenbush had forced them to contribute $12.5 million _ far less
than the potential fines they faced - to the California Research
and Assistance Fund, which he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The fund financed political polls, minority outreach programs
and charitable grants that bore little if any relationship to the
quake. Some appeared to be vehicles to advance Quackenbush's
personal political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned as legislative hearings into his
mishandling of insurance claims arising from the quake were about
to begin. He is now under investigation by a federal grand jury.

PALESTINIANS MUST TAKE NEXT STEP IN TALKS, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 BY CARL H. LAVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ President Clinton said that it is time for
the Palestinians to take a step forward in the Middle East peace
talks, ahead of a Sept. 13 deadline, according to a White House
transcript released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel has survived a
no-confidence vote in his parliament, Clinton said, the pressure is
on Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to see if we can get some movement from the
Palestinians as well, and see if we can put this thing together
again,'' the president told an interviewer from WTVT, a Fox
television station in Tampa, Fla. The interview was conducted
Monday afternoon, and the White House released the transcript
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a political swing through Florida, confirmed in the
interview that Jerusalem was the sticking point that prevented
agreement at last month's Camp David summit meeting, but he
expressed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think there will be peace in the region; yes, Jerusalem
is the most difficult issue,'' Clinton said. ``They did not agree
on everything else. But they're close enough that I think that we
can still get an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had seen progress during the Camp David talks, ``sort
of the body language that the Israelis and the Palestinians, the
way they relate to each other.'' And he referred to the pressures
of the calendar. ``They have pledged to finish by the 13th of
September,'' Clinton said. ``And that puts all kinds of pressure,
especially on the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent interim peace agreement expires on Sept. 13, and
the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has pledged to
declare a state unilaterally if a permanent peace has not been
reached by that date _ an act that could provoke a chain of
unilateral actions and violent events.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate stop during his two-day Florida swing, which
raised more than $1.2 million for Democrats, Clinton also pressed
the importance of quick action in the Senate to support his China
trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are enough votes now to approve the deal, the
president said, procedural blocks could delay action long enough to
push the final vote to the next administration.

&HT;     NAPSTER FANS FLOCK TO WEBSITE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Online music lovers flocked to Napster's
besieged Web service in record numbers last week after a federal
judge nearly succeeded in shutting the site down.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic to Napster.com rose 92 percent after U.S. District Judge
Marilyn Hall Patel enjoined the file-sharing service from indexing
copyrighted songs, according to Nielsen/NetRatings's weekly
Internet usage data.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a panel of appeals court judges stayed the
injunction Friday, Napster mania hit its peak that day with 849,196
unique visitors ``hitting''the site, up from 443,070 on Tuesday.
Also on Friday, downloads of Napster software more than doubled
from the day before to 22 percent of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   In another measure of Napster's sudden surge, the site shot to
the top of the ``music'' and ``entertainment'' categories of this
week's PC Data Online survey.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 22 to July 29, compared to the week prior,
Napster jumped from 6th place to 1st place in the music category
and took the top spot in entertainment traffic after not even
rating in the top 10 the week prior.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies simply confirmed what most people had expected
all along. Once a judge tried to shut it down, Napster users would
swamp the site trying to get as much free music as possible before
a shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the downloads of Napster on the heels of the
court stay is a strong indication that digital downloading has hit
critical mass among American Web consumers,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at NetRatings. ``The data
underscores the consumers' thirst for MP3 music. Rather than fight
this evolution, the entertainment industry should embrace it and
develop sensible solutions to capitalize on this market
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment has been echoed in recent days by most Internet
watchers, who feel the technology Napster uses to swap files is
already ubiquitous and the record industry must find new ways to
contain piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in the full trial, services like Gnutella,
Scour Exchange, Pointera Sharing Engine, iMesh, and Freenet will
continue to provide the peer-to-peer services that consumers
want,'' wrote Forrester Research analysts Eric Scheirer with Josh
Bernoff in a report released last Thursday. ``And while today's
decision may hasten Napster's demise, there was never a real
possibility that the company could turn its present activities into
a profitable business. Regardless, the ensuing turmoil will shake
up the landscape, and the key players will have to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Scour Exchange is already seeing an upturn in fortunes
since Napster's case has heated up.
</P>
<P>
   The music and film swapping site entered the PC Data Online top
10 lists for the first time last week, ranking 10th in music and
6th in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Scour was recently sued by the Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA), as well as the Motion Picture Association of
America, alleging copyright infringement. A similar suit, filed by
the RIAA, led to the injunction against Napster.

&HT;     NAPSTER'S NOSEDIVE IS NO TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What is intellectual property? A term. What is
that term? Air.
</P>
<P>
   If Shakespeare were alive today, he could consider suing me for
downloading and bowdlerizing his lines from ``Henry IV, Part I''
(Act V, Scene 1).
</P>
<P>
   But the playwright hasn't earned a farthing these last 400
years, so he'd be penniless _ and therefore lawyerless in court. My
team of the slickest suits in this blessed plot, this earth, this
realm, this city of San Francisco (``Richard II,'' Act II, Scene 3)
would send him back to where he came from, the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Not fair? Who says? How can you claim ownership of intellectual
property? It's not real estate or cash. You can't eat it or wear it
to the beach. It won't fetch or let you tickle its tummy. It's an
abstraction, a blueprint, air.
</P>
<P>
   So bite me, Bard.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of Napster's Falstaffian defense against the
U.S. recording industry's charge that it has essentially stolen the
labor _ the blood, sweat and tears _ of thousands of artists, some
of them rich and famous, most of them starving.
</P>
<P>
   We've been hearing the San Mateo-based upstart company make this
argument in various forms since December, when the Recording
Industry Association of American sued it for copyright
infringement, claiming Napster has cost the industry over $300
million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   The suit sparked a debate over the rights of artists and record
companies at a time when Internet users can replicate and
distribute, at no significant charge, not only visual symbols but
pictures and sounds with near-perfect clarity and amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the public purchase 100,000 copies of Sting's newest
CD when it can purchase just one, put it on the Internet and
download it 99,999 times?
</P>
<P>
   We heard the argument again last Wednesday, in the San Francisco
courtroom of U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel, who didn't buy it
and granted the preliminary injunction sought by the association.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's decision would have effectively shut down Napster if two
federal appeals judges hadn't immediately overruled her, pending
further arguments in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created a monster,'' Patel commented.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that depends on your perspective. ``Genie'' might have
been a better word.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot at stake for Napster, which has parlayed an
electronic sleight of hand into a company with an estimated
potential marketvalue of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, despite the
fact that it takes in no revenue.
</P>
<P>
   One might say Napster deserved a swift kick in the teeth for its
parasitic behavior in the marketplace. But there is a problem here.
It's hard to think of the music industry as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Big record companies have been gouging artists and the public
for decades. I remember buying Buffalo Springfield albums for $1.79
on sale and The Doors' ``Strange Days'' for $3.79. Now the cost of
a CD is about the same as a three-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   But CDs at $20 or so today still generate nickels and dimes for
most artists, who sell themselves into slavery to get a break. Give
an 18-year-old a few thousand bucks up front and he thinks he's
died and gone to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It's really the corporate bosses _ the recording companies,
distributors and retailers _ who make the serious dough every time
another Kurt Cobain pops onto the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder more musicians aren't blowing their brains out,
given what lies ahead for even the most talented and dedicated
among them _ long hours in the studio and, if they're very good and
very lucky, maybe a miserable tour as a warmup act.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you're walking down the street and you hear a band in
a garage, knock and ask what it takes to make it commercially.
You'll be shocked at how much is required and how little is given
back.
</P>
<P>
   A free ride on Napster? Sure, we want it. That may be the only
way anyone hears us. Plus, we don't have to sell our souls.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Recording Industry Association of America is right in
the Napster case, that doesn't mean Napster is villainous. It's
more like Robin Hood _ taking from the rich, giving to the poor
and, incidentally, making itself rich on paper in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a principle at stake here and it should be
defended. Jokes aside, intellectual property is worth a great deal,
even if it is, at bottom, just a blueprint, a road map, a castle in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking is sweaty work and the large body of federal copyright
law affords it extensive protections. These include a 95-year ban
on unauthorized use for works created before Jan. 1, 1978 (bite me
again, Bard - your oeuvre has been in the public domain here in the
Colonies for centuries).
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the association, said the
lawsuit will prove to be a ``seminal Internet case.'' She predicted
any precedent set now will shape artistic and merchandising
decisions in the emerging wireless age.
</P>
<P>
   A final ruling that would permit Napster to continue doing
business as usual, Rosen said, would basically scuttle the
pop-music market system, which rewards effort and investment with
appropriate returns, and protects those returns through copyright
law _ which Napster was blithely ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen insisted it isn't a question of the entrenched powers
refusing to recognize that new technology has changed the game. The
issue, she said, is whether the net ``coexists'' with intellectual
property or ``tramples it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right _ even if the powerful economic interests she
represents have done wrong in the past.

<P>
   It's about as easy to find a tasty fish taco in the San Fernando
Valley these days as it is along the sandy beaches of Mexico. The
challenge is in finding the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   We randomly sampled these popular creations at a half a dozen
neighborhood purveyors, and here's how they stacked up from first
to last:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bronco Restaurant, 4378 Woodman Ave., Sherman Oaks, (818)
990-4961.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic, no-nonsense tacos at very reasonable prices. Corn
tortillas are soft, shrimp crunchy in larger-than-expected pieces;
battered pollock fish nicely presented. Pretty good salsa bar handy
for extras. Prices: Whitefish (pollock) $1.25, shrimp $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   2. Carrillo's Tortilleria &AMP; Mexican Delicatessen, 19744 Sherman
Way, Canoga Park, (818) 887-6118. (Also in San Fernando and Simi
Valley.)
</P>
<P>
   Very close second. Tacos look appealing. Also very Mexican
authentic. Cod tacos have good general flavor though a tad salty
for our gringo palates. Char-grilled shrimp tasted especially good
in fresh, house-produced tortillas. Prices: Cod $1.75, shrimp
$2.25.
</P>
<P>
   3. Poquito Mas, 3701 Cahuenga Blvd. West, near Universal City,
(818) 760-8226. (Also in Valencia, Burbank, North Hollywood, the
Sunset Strip and West L.A.)
</P>
<P>
   Lots of good, broiled shrimp. And upscale ahi tuna tacos come
with roasted red pepper sauce. One of the better-stocked salsa
bars. Prices: Shrimp $3.65, ahi tuna $5.10 (market price).
</P>
<P>
   4. Adobe Cantina, 29100 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, (818)
991-3474.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly but good _ we spent the most on these tacos. Really more
like meals than snacks. More fish choices here than elsewhere. We
selected mahi mahi, cod and rock shrimp versions. Bonus: a load of
bright green, red and white chips, the national colors of Mexico.
Prices: Cod $7.95, tasty mahi mahi $8.95, rock shrimp $9.95, the
latter was ordered with rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   5. Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, 19960 Ventura Blvd., Woodland
Hills, (818) 888-3976. (Also in Studio City, Burbank, Pasadena,
Beverly Hills and elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Smoky, char-grilled shrimp for a dime more is a better buy than
breaded red snapper fish tacos. Both made with good and soft, but
small, corn tortillas. Looked attractive. Prices: Fish (Pacific red
snapper) $1.85, shrimp $1.95.
</P>
<P>
   6. Rubio's Baja Grill, 17200 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818)
784-1497. (Also in Glendale, Northridge, Oxnard and elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Though eaten in-house, tacos were delivered wrapped in paper.
Corn tortillas rubbery, rough and tough. Cheese overwhelms shrimp.
Batter-fried fish tacos on sale but impart little satisfaction.
Grilled mahi mahi tasty and worth the extra. Prices: Fish (Alaskan
pollock) 99 cents, shrimp $2.85, mahi mahi $2.55. &QL;

GETTIN' FISHY WITH IT AT HOME

(With FISH TACOS)

<P>
   If you want to make a splash with fish tacos at home, here are
some tips for getting them on the table fast.
</P>
<P>
   -Do preliminary preparations before starting to cook the fish
and have ingredients organized assembly-line style. That means the
batter should be prepared if deep frying, fish cut into pieces, oil
in pot and tortillas wrapped in foil and ready to warm in oven or
toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   -Choose a mild, firm-fleshed fish such as halibut or cod that
will hold up well. It's also possible to use mahi mahi, red snapper
or ahi tuna. Liven up, but don't overpower the batter (if using)
with seasonings such as garlic, ground cumin and chili powder.
</P>
<P>
   -When deep-frying, use a bland oil such as canola or vegetable
oil, and be sure it is heated to 375 degrees to avoid ending up
with soggy fish. Also, cook only a few batter-coated fish pieces at
time (don't overcrowd the pan); when golden, drain on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   -If you plan to grill the fish, for best results, cook in large
pieces and cut into smaller pieces after cooking. Large shrimp are
the easiest to manage. Saute in a little butter and oil over high
heat _ or grill in a foil pan (with holes poked in bottom). The
foil pan will keep the shrimp from falling through the grid. You
can also broil the shrimp indoors.
</P>
<P>
   -Use thick, fresh corn tortillas, if available. Otherwise you'll
have to double the tortillas so diners can manage the tacos without
having them falling apart. Although a few quick-service food places
use flour tortillas, corn are preferred.
</P>
<P>
   -Feel free to dress the tacos with any kind of salsa
(store-bought or homemade) desired. If making pico de gallo (or
whatever other sauce you decide to use) from scratch, whip it up
before starting to cook the fish. -If you plan to dress the tacos
with a white sauce, whip up one with sour cream and a little lemon
juice _ or combine a mixture of mayonnaise and plain yogurt with a
few seasonings. A mild store-bought bottled ranch-type dressing or
sour cream dip could suffice if time is short.
</P>
<P>
   -Have finely shredded lettuce or cabbage (and finely chopped
fresh cilantro) ready to sprinkle on the tacos.
</P>
<P>
   -To heighten the flavor of the fish, offer cut-up lemon or lime
wedges so diners can add a squeeze, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   -Guacamole and shredded cheeses are optional. If you plan to
offer them, remember you can shortcut the work by using prepared
guacamole from the market and preshredded cheeses in a variety of
flavors and combinations.
</P>
<P>
   -Assemble tacos while fish and tortillas are hot _ and eat as
soon as possible to avoid ending up with soggy tacos.
</P>
<P>
   -For speed in assembly, you can tuck the fish (atop a little
sauce, if desired) in the tortillas and ask diners to top as
desired. Or you can assemble the tacos _ with everything _ and
simply pass the hot sauce. There seem to be no hard-and-fast rules
about the order of layering the sauces and greens atop the fish,
but keep in mind the finished tacos should be appealing to the eye.
In recent taco-sampling travels, we found the best and most
attractive-looking ones topped with pico de gallo, chopped
tomatoes, onions and cilantro, and colorful sauces.
</P>
<P>
   -Keep in mind that tacos lend themselves to serving both buffet
and sit-down style. For side dishes to accompany the tacos, offer
black or refried beans and Mexican-style rice (cooked with some
tomatoes, ground cumin and ground chili powder or diced green
chiles). &QL;

12 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined &QL; 
1 tablespoon coarse salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
6 (8-inch) flour tortillas &QL; 
12 small radicchio leaves &QL; 
3/4 cup Avocado Salsa (Recipe follows) &QL; 
6 wedges lime
</P>
<P>
   Combine olive oil with garlic and marinate shrimp 1 hour prior

pepper, and grill approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side,
until center of shrimp is still barely opaque.
</P>
<P>
   Warm tortillas on grill; remove to a cutting board and cut in
half. Fold one edge of tortilla half toward the center, twisting
that edge inside and toward the rounded top, and roll so you have a
cone-shaped tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   Put 1 radicchio leaf, 1 tablespoon Avocado Salsa and 1 shrimp in
each cone and place, seam down, on a plate. Continue until all
tacos are complete. Serve with wedges of lime. Makes 6 servings.

 &QL; 
AVOCADO SALSA &QL; 
2 medium avocados, peeled, seeded and diced &QL; 
1/2 cup seeded and diced tomatoes &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped cilantro &QL; 
3 tablespoons diced red onion &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon seeded and minced jalapeno pepper &QL; 
1 teaspoon coarse salt &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine and gently mix all ingredients in a bowl. Salsa is best
when used same day prepared. Makes 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BAJA FISH TACOS &QL; 
Making a taco is no different than building a sandwich: pick your
bread, be it flour or corn tortillas, decide upon a filling and
then choose a suitable salsa.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is a reasonable facsimile of the fish tacos tasted
in Ensenada. For a variation, try grilling the fish on your
barbecue. Although the recipe specifies sea bass, any firm,
white-fleshed fish will do, as well as shark or swordfish. Don't
fail to give the fish a squeeze of fresh lime. &QL; 
BEER BATTER: &QL; 
1/2 cup flour &QL; 
1 1/2 tablespoons paprika &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
2 tablespoons cornstarch &QL; 
2 teaspoons coarse salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic &QL; 
1 cup beer, cold &QL; 
TACOS: &QL; 
Oil for frying &QL; 
3/4 pound sea bass fillet &QL; 
1/2 cup flour &QL; 
1 cup shredded green cabbage &QL; 
8 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed &QL; 
1/2 cup Cilantro Mayo (Recipe follows) &QL; 
1/2 cup Fresh Tomato Salsa (Recipe follows) &QL; 
8 wedges lime
</P>
<P>
   To make Beer Batter, sift all dry batter ingredients into a
small bowl and whisk in beer gradually until batter is smooth. Keep
refrigerated until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   For Tacos, in a heavy skillet, heat 2 inches oil to 350 degrees
F. Cut sea bass into 8 strips, dredge in flour, cover completely
with beer batter and place carefully in hot oil, frying on both
sides until golden brown. Remove and drain excess oil on paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble tacos, place equal amounts of cabbage down center of
each warm tortilla; then, put a tablespoon of Cilantro Mayo, a
strip of fried sea bass, and, finally, a tablespoon of Fresh Tomato
Salsa. Serve with lime wedges. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Pacifica Blue Plates,'' by Neil Stuart, Ten Speed Press. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CILANTRO MAYO &QL; 
3 large eggs &QL; 
1 teaspoon dry mustard &QL; 
2 bunches fresh cilantro, chopped &QL; 
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
1 teaspoon coarse salt &QL; 
1 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients except peanut oil in a blender or food
processor. Begin to process and add oil in a steady stream until
completely incorporated. Keeps refrigerated 2 weeks. Makes 2 cups. &QL; 
CAUTION: This recipe contains uncooked eggs. Because of the
possible threat of salmonella, U.S. Government officials recommend
that the very young, the elderly, pregnant women and people with
serious illnesses or weakened immune systems not eat raw or lightly
cooked eggs.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, doctor up store-bought mayonnaise with 2 bunches of
fresh chopped cilantro, minced garlic, pepper, dry mustard and a
little rice wine vinegar instead of making your own mayonnaise &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FRESH TOMATO SALSA &QL; 
!ital!There's just no reason to eat store-bought tomato salsa
anymore. Whether you call this ``salsa cruda,'' ``salsa fresca,''
or whatever else, when you use vine ripe tomatoes and serve it with
a basket of fresh, hot tortillas, nothing comes close to being this
good. You can spice the recipe up or down, as desired. If you can't
find tomatillos, you can eliminate them from the recipe. &QL; 
2 cups diced tomatoes &QL; 
1/2 cup diced tomatillos &QL; 
1/2 cup diced red onion &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced &QL; 
1/2 cup chopped cilantro &QL; 
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice &QL; 
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar &QL; 
1 teaspoon sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon coarse salt &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Mix all ingredients in a
bowl. Allow salsa to set 1 hour before serving so flavors develop.
Serve at room temperature. Makes 3 cups. &UR;  &QL;

DIVE IN! FISH TACOS ARE DAY AT THE BEACH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(With TACO-SIDE, TACO-TASTE) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, beef and chicken _ fish tacos are making a splash on
menus these days. If you aren't hooked already, now is a good time
to discover this trendy taco variation. There are plenty of options
at quick-service Mexican food stands and restaurants in the Valley
and beyond to explore _ or you can try your hand at making them at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The humble fish creation seems to have originated more than 25
years ago in San Felipe, a Mexican town on the Gulf of California,
where fresh fish was plentiful and the locals wrapped it up inside
their tortillas. And then surfers and college partiers found them
at stands along the beach in south-of-the-border towns when looking
for something cheap and satisfying to eat.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before entrepreneurs capitalized on the idea,
brought it over the border and added their own style. Rubio's _
Home of the Fish Taco (opened in San Diego's Mission Bay in 1983
after Ralph Rubio discovered the fish taco while on a college
spring break in San Felipe) has to date sold more than 38 million
fish tacos and is now known as Rubio's Baja Grill.
</P>
<P>
   The company's signature Baja-style fish taco combines
beer-batter fried fish (pollock) fillets in warm corn tortillas
with mild salsa, tangy white sauce and shredded green cabbage. But
today Rubio's also offers grilled fish tacos, sauteed shrimp tacos
and fish tacos dressed up with a variety of toppings at its 95
outlets sprinkled throughout the western states (13 in Los Angeles
county).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you order them, fish tacos are cooked and
styled in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   The creations are built around numerous varieties of fish,
ranging from cod and pollock to red snapper, ahi tuna, mahi mahi,
shrimp, lobster, salmon, swordfish, halibut and more. While some
versions feature batter- fried fish chunks, the fish in others is
grilled or charbroiled or even sauteed.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, the fish appears tucked into corn rather than flour
tortillas _ either a single thick one or two thinner ones _ ranging
from 3 to 8 inches in diameter. But be forewarned _ some tortillas
taste better than others. In some instances, the earthy flavor of
the tortillas (which can be rubbery) overpowers the fish; in
others, it blends deliciously with the ingredients. Some upscale
restaurants even use handmade blue or white corn tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   The tacos come sauced and topped in a variety of ways: some with
white sauce and a blanket of red sauce; others with fresh pico de
gallo (a mixture of chopped tomatoes, onions and cilantro); some
even with fruit salsas. Depending on where you eat them, you might
find shredded lettuce or cabbage, lots of chopped cilantro and even
a wedge of lime.
</P>
<P>
   Some come plain (diners are expected to dress them to taste with
toppings and salsas, from mild to explosive), while others are
pre-assembled with everything.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident in a recent tasting at stands and restaurants
that there are many variations on the theme.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7-year-old quick-service Bronco in Sherman Oaks, white
fish (pollock) and shrimp tacos, which were added to the menu about
8 months ago, are only available coated with batter and fried crisp
in vegetable oil. ``They're now as popular as beef and chicken
tacos,'' notes owner Jose Santos. But the shrimp outsells the white
fish version, both of which are assembled and presented in doubled
fresh corn tortillas, topped with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and
onions, then smothered with a layer of sour cream-based
dressing-like white sauce and a layer of special red sauce (with
tomato, garlic and chiles). At $1.25 (white fish) and $1.75
(shrimp), they're a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to making a good fish taco depends on the quality
of the fish and the process (how it is prepared),'' says Santos. He
cuts the fresh fish into same-size pieces _ about 3 inches long and
3/4-inch wide _ and, prior to frying, coats them with a batter made
of flour, beer, egg and fish seasonings. Each taco comes with one
large fish piece or, in the case of shrimp, one large batter-coated
shrimp, which has been cut into two or three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Poquito Mas, which specializes in fresh, healthy, Mexican
cuisine, has been making shrimp tacos since it opened in Studio
City in 1984 (locations now also in North Hollywood, Burbank,
Valencia and West Los Angeles), notes Kevin McCarney,
founder-owner. McCarney said they came about as the result of a
conversation with a woman who owned a taco stand in San Felipe
about 15 or 16 years ago. When he asked if she'd make shrimp tacos
without breading, she immediately whipped up something and asked
him if that was what he had in mind. It was _ and that was the
impetus for his business.
</P>
<P>
   At Poquito Mas, medium-size shrimp are broiled, then put in a
light tomato-based sauce (ranchera) and sauteed quickly. For best
results, use good-quality shrimp, advises McCarney. The wonderful
smoky flavor comes from the flame broiling. The shrimp are then
placed in doubled fresh corn tortillas (warmed on the grill about
20 to 30 seconds per side) to keep the taco from falling apart when
you eat it. Chopped onions and fresh cilantro and a piece of lime
top it off. Customers can then do their own thing and add their
choice of eight different salsas from the salsa bar. ``Chapina
salsa (cooked tomatoes, onions and celery) is my favorite sauce for
shrimp,'' adds McCarney.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled ahi tacos were introduced at Poquito Mas about four
years ago as another fresh, upscale presentation. The fish is
grilled and presented atop a single mini 3-inch flour tortilla. Two
come with a combination plate _ or you can order them a la carte.
The delicious roasted bell pepper-sour cream sauce, served
alongside, elevates them a notch above some others. The secret to
cooking the ahi, says McCarney, is to remove it from the broiler
when it is about 90 percent cooked because it will continue to
cook. Some customers prefer ordering it seared _ not cooked
through. ``We don't do batter-fried tacos,'' explains McCarney,
adding that ``our concept is clean and good-for-you food. A
batter-fried fish taco is tough to eat two or three times a week.''
Ahi and shrimp tacos are about equal in sales and popularity with
steak and chicken tacos in all locations except North Hollywood,
where fewer fish tacos are consumed, adds McCarney.
</P>
<P>
   Fish tacos can be made successfully at home, says McCarney.
``Ahi is one of the best fish for flavor and consistency.'' It
maintains its flavor without being overpowering and is better for
Mexican food with tortillas than sea bass or snapper, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo's in Canoga Park (other locations in San Fernando and
Simi Valley are owned by different family members) has been serving
batter- coated fried cod (white fish) tacos for two years and
grilled shrimp tacos for the last six months, says owner Larry
Luna.
</P>
<P>
   Both utilize a single, thick 7 1/2-inch corn tortilla, hot off
the grill, handmade daily on the premises. ``Thick corn tortillas
hold up better and are less likely to get soggy when salsa and
other toppings are added.'' The tacos are topped with finely
chopped lettuce (which is more popular than cabbage) and pico de
gallo (chopped tomatoes, onion, cilantro), making for an attractive
presentation. The white fish taco comes with sour cream mixed with
a little lemon juice _ and assorted salsas are included with all
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife likes to make fish tacos at home,'' notes Luna. For
best results, ``Don't let the batter sit too long _ or it won't
stick to the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   When you want to give fish tacos a whirl at home, pick and
choose from the array of recipes that follow _ and adapt them to
suit yourself. Once you get the knack, you may turn them out often
for family and friends. &QL;

3 MILKS, 3 VERSIONS, 1 GOOD CAKE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In response to Sue Mullins' request for a Tres Leche Cake,
several readers sent similar variations on the theme. The first
recipe, from the new ``Joy of Cooking,'' was shared by Marilyn
Kessler, who noted that she had made it several times _ and it has
always received rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Two recipes have a meringue topping, while the other has a
whipped cream frosting. &QL; 
TRES LECHES CAKE &QL; 
(Shared by Marilyn Kessler, Encino) &QL; 
CAKE: &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
2 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
3 large egg whites &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional) &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
3 large egg yolks &QL; 
1/4 cup milk &QL; 
MILK MIXTURE: &QL; 
1 cup heavy whipping cream &QL; 
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk &QL; 
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk &QL; 
MERINGUE TOPPING: &QL; 
2/3 cup light corn syrup &QL; 
2 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   Have all ingredients at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350
degrees F (325 degrees F if using glass). Grease 1 (9x9-inch) pan
or 1 (11x7-inch) pan.
</P>
<P>
   For Cake, sift together flour and baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium
speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating at high
speed. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Add 1/4 of flour mixture at a time, beating on low speed or
stirring with a rubber spatula just until incorporated and scraping
the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add 1/4 cup milk and beat just
until mixture is smooth and evenly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake at 350
degrees F until top springs back when lightly pressed and a
toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
Let cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make Milk Mixture by combining cream, evaporated milk
and sweetened condensed milk.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the cake in pan, prick with a toothpick at 1-inch
intervals. Pour milk mixture slowly over cake, including corners
and edges. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   To make Meringue Topping, combine corn syrup and egg whites in a
2 1/2-quart heatproof bowl (preferably stainless steel).
</P>
<P>
   Bring about 1-inch water to a gentle simmer in a wide, deep
skillet. Set bowl of egg whites directly in hot water. Immediately
begin beating on low speed, moving mixer all around bowl, until
mixture reaches 140 degrees F. If you must stop beating for any
reason, remove bowl from hot water until you can resume to prevent
egg whites from scrambling. Beat on high speed 5 minutes; mixture
will be billowy and hold a stiff shape. Remove bowl from skillet
and beat 2 to 3 more minutes until meringue is cool.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, leave cake in pan or slide a slim knife around cake to
detach it from pan. Invert cake onto a large shallow serving
platter with enough of a rim to hold excess milk that will
gradually collect around cake like a sauce. Spread or pipe meringue
topping over cake. Cut into squares to serve. Makes 1 cake.

LOS RANCHOS TRES LECHES &QL; 
(Shared by Steven Shunn, Glendale; and Ruth Nebron, Valley Glen)
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is from Los Ranchos Restaurant in Miami, which was
founded by a nephew of the late Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza. &QL; 
CAKE: &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
5 large eggs, separated &QL; 
1/3 cup milk &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar &QL; 
MILK SYRUP: &QL; 
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk &QL; 
1 cup EACH sweetened condensed milk and whipping cream &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 tablespoon light rum &QL; 
MERINGUE: &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
1/4 cup water &QL; 
3 egg whites &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   For Cake, beat 3/4 cup sugar and egg yolks until light and
fluffy, about 5 minutes. Fold in milk, vanilla, flour and baking
powder. In separate bowl, beat egg whites to stiff peaks, adding
cream of tartar after 20 seconds. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup
sugar and continue beating until whites are glossy and firm, but
not dry. Gently fold whites into yolk mixture. Pour batter into
prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake cake in preheated 350-degree oven about 40 to 50 minutes,
until it feels firm and an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Let
cake cool completely on a wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile make Milk Syrup: Combine evaporated milk, sweetened
condensed milk, whipping cream, vanilla and rum in a mixing bowl.
Whisk until well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Unmold cake onto a deep, large platter. Pierce cake all over
with a fork. Pour Milk Syrup over cake. Spoon overflow back on top
until all is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Make Meringue: Place 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a heavy
saucepan with water. Cover and cook over high heat 2 minutes.
Uncover pan and cook sugar to soft-ball stage, 239 degrees F on a
candy thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beat egg whites to soft peaks with cream of tartar in
electric mixer. Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar gradually,
continuing beating to stiff peaks. Pour boiling sugar syrup in a
thin stream into whites and continue beating until mixture is cool
to the touch. The hot syrup ``cooks'' the whites.
</P>
<P>
   Using a wet spatula, spread top and sides of cake with a thick
layer of Meringue. Refrigerate cake, covered, at least 2 hours
before serving. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

<P>
   For Cake, sift flour with baking powder. In a large bowl with
clean beaters, beat egg whites until fluffy. Add sugar gradually,
beating to form stiff peaks. Add yolks, one at a time. Fold in
flour mixture and milk; mix well but don't beat. Pour batter into
prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven until edges are golden brown,
about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare Three-Milk Topping: Combine milks and sour cream. Do not
beat. Pour Topping over cake and let sit until all mixture is
absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes (or refrigerate overnight).
</P>
<P>
   Prepare Whipped Cream Topping: Chill cream, bowl and beaters
thoroughly. Beat cream with electric mixer until it begins to
thicken. Gradually add sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks
form. Refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, cover top and sides of cake with Whipped Cream
Topping, cut cake into squares and serve. Or spread Whipped Cream
Topping over squares of cake. Makes 12 servings.

 Food Lovers' Walks: Strolling on Polk Street Offers a Big Slice 
 of Life   By Lesli Neilson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Standing on the corner of California and Polk
streets in the heart of Polk Gulch, the neighborhood looks a little
scruffy. Liquor stores, 24-hour doughnut shops, hardware stores and
vintage gay bars (from the days when Polk Gulch was the center of
the gay community). But the strip also holds lots of culinary
discoveries.
<P>
   Just a couple of doors from the corner lies major sustenance for
an afternoon's walk _  &UR; Swan Oyster Depot &LR; , which has been feeding
locals and tourists fresh seafood since 1912. In May, Swan received
a prestigious James Beard award as a Regional Classic. The
Sanchimino family has been running the place since father Sal and
three cousins bought it from the original Danish owners in 1948.
Sal bought out his cousins in 1973 and added the clam chowder,
smoked salmon and take-out fish business. He died in 1989, and Swan
is now run by his children.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two tips _ arrive early to avoid a line winding out the
door and, if soft-shell crab ($12.50) is available, order it. The
28-seat marble bar holds evenly dispersed bowls of oyster crackers,
lemon wedges, Tabasco sauce and horseradish. Oysters on the half
shell ($13.90 a dozen) are as fresh as they come; the combo salad _
a large portion of crabmeat, bay shrimp and medium shrimp atop
crisp iceberg lettuce with Louis dressing ($14.25) _ is big enough
to share. Wash down the frutti di mare with one of the beers on tap
or a glass of white wine. Swan is open only during the day _
Monday-Saturday 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, pop in to the oldest existing  &UR; See's Candies &LR;  store
in the country, right next to the graffiti-laden skeleton of the
Royal Theater. Opened in 1936, the black-and-white-tiled shop
offers the usual top-notch See's specialties.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't too many culinary destinations over the next four
blocks, but the reward for covering them is  &UR; Leonard's 2001 &LR; , on
the corner of Pacific Avenue and Polk Street. Owner Leonard Born
boasts over 275 domestic and imported cheeses, which are precut for
shoppers' convenience. Born not only will suggest interesting
products but will let you sample them and offer a recipe while he's
at it. He also carries worldly foodstuffs such as Callebaut
chocolate _ a favorite among bakers _ specialty dried pastas and
dried herbs, spices, fruit, nuts and legumes in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Just off Polk on Pacific Avenue lies the  &UR; Jug Shop &LR; . Native San
Franciscan Phil Priolo opened the store 22 years ago, and stocks
more than 11,000 items, most of it wine. The shop offers wine
tastings every Thursday, Friday and Saturday for a $3 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Head back to Polk, then walk north toward Broadway, ducking into
 &UR; Cafe Aroma &LR;  for take-out. The rotisserie chicken ($7.95) is a
favorite among locals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official demarcation line is further up Polk,
Russian Hill's influence on the street really begins at Broadway.
Here you'll find a variety of coffee houses, antique stores and
markets to explore, including  &UR; Real Food Co. &LR; , opened in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Another slice of San Francisco history is at  &UR; Mario's Bohemian &LR; 
 &UR; Cigar Store Cafe Ristorante &LR; , the newer sister to the original
North Beach Mario's, opened in 1972 by Trieste natives, Mario and
Lilliana Crismani. Son Paolo and daughter-in-law Debbie have been
running both locations since the early '80s, but Mario still comes
in occasionally to whip up a batch of his famed apple turnovers.
Lilliana's ricotta cheesecake is also a favorite. The Polk Street
location features live jazz Wednesday and Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, you'll find Carol and Richard Martucci's
 &UR; Russian Hill Bookstore &LR; , with nearly 1,500 cookbooks. The
Martuccis' collection consists of recent editions, standard
classics, &LR;  and pre-1920 editions. The vintage volumes are a
particular hit among chefs, says Carol Martucci.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andrew Rothstein Fine Foods &LR;  is a couple doors away. A former
private chef to Charles Schwab, Rothstein opened the store in 1997,
offering upscale entrees, side dishes and salads for take-out.
Dishes such as teriyaki flank steak, orange-glazed pork chops and
lemon-dill salmon with orzo salad are available by the pound or
sold by the meal.
</P>
<P>
   If you want something to drink with your take-out, head across
the street to  &UR; William Cross Wine Merchants &LR; . The array of wines
has a California focus but includes imports, as well. The store
also offers group wine tastings from 7-9 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.
This week's tasting is David vs. Goliath _ boutique wines versus
the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   With the renowned  &UR; La Folie &LR;  and the new  &UR; La Boulange de Polk &LR; ,
this section of Polk Street may make you wonder if you've been
transported to France. La Boulange, with its outdoor tables,
authentic clafouti, Bordelais  &LR; canelles &LR;  and mini-quiches, is a
refreshing addition to the neighborhood. It's open 7 a.m.-7 p.m.
Wednesday-Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If all this food has given you the urge to cook, make your last
stop  &UR; City Discounts &LR; . When Rita and Joe Paoli opened the place 15
years ago, they sold pots and pans from a single room. Over the
years, the minirestaurant-supply store has expanded to nearly five
rooms. The place is packed with kitchen utensils, gadgets,
appliances, baking equipment and glassware. There even are some
imported Italian foodstuffs like Genoa tuna packed in olive oil
(31/4-ounce tin, $1.35), dried porcini mushrooms (4-ounce bag,
$3.29) and Illy coffee (8.8 ounces, $8.49).

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 The Working Cook: Making the Most of Summer Produce  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Head to the farmers' market or even the grocery
store during summer and it's easy to be seduced by the beautiful
array of tomatoes, squash, corn and peppers. Next thing you know,
you're carrying around 20 pounds of produce without a clue about
what to do with it all.
<P>
   When this happens, it never hurts to make a simple sauce and
then freeze it for later, when produce is not so abundant or at
least your refrigerator is not so full.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer Tomato &AMP; Eggplant Stew with Pasta &AMP; Toasted Pine Nuts
fits with this plan. Since this recipe serves 12, set aside some of
the stew to freeze and then prepare the pasta and toppings again
when you defrost it. Although freezing destroys some of the
vegetables' texture, it doesn't affect their wonderful fresh summer
flavor. There's only a little bit of extra liquid after defrosting,
and the pasta will help soak this up.
</P>
<P>
   Summer vegetables sometimes do need special treatment. The
tomatoes in this sauce, for example, must be peeled and seeded.
It's a little laborious, but you'll be glad you did it. The acidity
and liquid from the seeds can ruin the smoky, slow-roasted flavor
and firm texture of the eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   In the Black Pepper Beef &AMP; Cucumber Salad, this week's 30 Minute
Main Dish, I call for seeding and salting the cucumbers, which
removes some of their liquid. Not only does this help the dressing
adhere to the salad, it gives the cucumbers a crisp cool texture
that contrasts well with the savory beef.
</P>
<P>
   For this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh dish, Salmon with Spiced Green
Beans &AMP; Yogurt Sauce, steam the green beans and then shock them in
ice water to ensure a crisp texture. This method also gives you the
option of partially preparing the dish before everyone shows up for
dinner. If you blanch the beans and prepare the sauce ahead, it
will take only about five minutes to broil the salmon and saute the
beans with smoky cumin and mustard seeds.

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound green beans
</P>
<P>
   Handful cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 skinless salmon fillets (6 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon yellow or black mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off the stem ends of the green beans. Prepare a large bowl
of ice water. Place the beans in a steamer and cook for 3 to 5
minutes, or until crisp-tender. Immediately plunge the beans into
the ice water. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop the cilantro (you should have about 2 tablespoons).
Mix with the yogurt and lemon juice and season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Season the salmon with salt and pepper. Place skin-side down on
the prepared baking sheet. Broil for about 5 minutes, or until the
salmon flakes but still is pink in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drain the beans and shake off excess water.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the
mustard seeds, cumin and cayenne. Saute for about 5 minutes, or
until the mustard seeds just start to pop. Add the green beans and
cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until heated through. Season
with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the salmon and beans among serving plates. Pass the sauce
at the table. There may be leftover sauce.

   6 large ripe summer tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   10 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: (amounts are for full recipe)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds penne or other short pasta
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces mild feta cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 bunch Italian parsley, minced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the stew: &LR;  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Coat 2 large baking sheets with 4 tablespoons of the oil. Divide
the eggplant cubes between baking sheets, spreading them out in a
single layer. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Roast for about 15 minutes, or until the cubes begin to brown.
Using a spatula, stir the cubes, scraping the browned bits from the
pan. Return to the oven and roast for 10 minutes. Stir again, and
roast for 10 to 20 minutes longer, or until the eggplant is just
tender. Remove from the oven, scrape the pan again; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

</P>
<P>
   Using a paring knife, cut out the core of each tomato and score
the other end with a shallow ``X.'' Drop 1 or 2 tomatoes at a time
into the boiling water. Don't add too many; the water should remain
at a boil. Boil the tomatoes for 15 to 30 seconds, then remove with
a slotted spoon and plunge into the ice water to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the tomatoes. Cut them in half widthwise and gently squeeze
out the seeds. Cut the flesh into large dice.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large Dutch oven. Add
the onions and saute for 15 minutes, or until golden. Add the
garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Add the eggplant and cook,

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics. 
 
 Wine Potpourri: Pet Provides Solace in a Cabernet-Free Zone   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Not long ago a ground swell movement began to gain
momentum, suggesting alternative wine choices to Chardonnay and
Cabernet Sauvignon. Someone tagged the mini-trend ``Learning Your
ABCs'` and suggestions began popping up for alternative wines from
Albarino to Viognier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smuggest of the anti-Chardonnay crowd defined ABC as
``Anything but Chardonnay (or Cabernet).'' Others, with less of a
problem about the dominance in the marketplace of Chardonnay and
Cabernet, took the more diplomatic road with ``Alternatives Beyond
Chardonnay.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the term was defined, though, wine-industry types
were convinced that consumers wanted new tastes, new wines _
especially ones that would complement the highly flavored foods so
much in demand. Wineries began to look at ``new'' grapes like
Syrah, Sangiovese and Viognier. Most of these choices already had
firm reputations in France, Italy and other known wine regions, but
they were unknown to many American wine drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   As the list of alternative wines continued to mount, stalwart
varieties such as Petite Sirah (Petite Syrah in France), were all
but forgotten. Grown in California since the 1880s, Pet, as it's
affectionately known, was an important component in many red wines,
including California Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, with the renaissance of Rhone-style wines, a
small group of California wineries began talking up Petite Sirah.
Dennis Fife, proprietor of Fife Vineyards in St. Helena, unhappy
with what he sees as ``confusing and/or misleading information
about (Petite Sirah),'' recently presented a paper on the varietal
at the Hospice du Rhone seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Fife and his fellow Pet producers want wine drinkers to know
that with all of the interest in Syrah and other Rhone varieties,
Petite Sirah has an important place as a varietal wine and as a
blending component in Rhone-style wines.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fife, the true origin of Petite Sirah was bandied
around for years with some experts, including viticulture
professors at the University of California at Davis, claiming that
Petite Sirah was one or a combination of French grapes, including
Syrah, Durifcq &LR;  and Peloursincq &LR; . Then, in the 1990s, UC Davis
professor Carole Meredith determined, using DNA, that the Petite
Sirah grown in California is related to Syrah and that ``Durif is
Peloursin fertilized by Syrah and thus shares the characteristics
of both varieties.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all still as cloudy as unfiltered wine, but what Fife wants
consumers to think about is that Syrah and Petite Sirah are very
close in flavor and texture, and even wine experts sometimes are
fooled. Using current winemaking techniques, winemakers are making
Petite Sirahs with reduced tannins and little bitterness. Rich in
fresh-berry flavors, Petite Sirah is a substantial red wine of
great character and length, the ideal accompaniment to meals
centered around red meats, stews and roasts.
</P>
<P>
   The well-matched flavors of Syrah and Petite Sirah come through
nicely in Fife Vineyards Max Cuvee, made from estate vineyards in
the Napa Valley. Among other good Petite Sirah choices are
Foppiano, Concannon, Louis M. Martini, Bogle Vineyard, Christopher
Creek Winery, Ridge Vineyard and Stags' Leap Winery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's Beauzeaux, Bozo! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Beaulieu Vineyard director of winemaking, Joel Aiken,
conceived of an unorthodox blend of red varieties, based on
Zinfandel, that he named Beauzeaux (pronounced Bozo).
</P>
<P>
   Today, Beauzeaux is no joke. The contemporary blend from vintage
1998 starts with Zinfandel, then adds Primitivo (an Italian variety
similar to Zinfandel), Valdigue, Charbonocq &LR; , Grenache and _ Petite
Sirah. Beauzeaux is aged in oak, and at $20, is a great choice for
summer barbecues, especially if finger-lickin' ribs are on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; German-Inspired Washington Riesling &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Loosen, a leading winemaker from Germany's Middle Mosel
region, has teamed up with Washington's Chateau Ste. Michelle to
produce a Riesling called Eroica. Loosen worked with Ste.
Michelle's vineyard manager, then he and his winemaker teamed up
with Ste. Michelle white-winemaker, Erik Olsen, to produce a Eroica
Riesling from the Cold Creek Vineyard in the Columbia Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of steely, refreshing Mosel Rieslings will want to try
this unique joint-venture wine. Eroica, named with the Beethoven
symphony in mind, is priced at $20 and is widely available wherever
fine wines are sold.

 Best Way: Cooking Corn on the Cob   By Amber Thompson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The last time I sped past a roadside corn stand, I
immediately slowed down and made the first U-turn I could. I picked
out a dozen fresh ears and raced home to indulge in a summer
classic _ corn on the cob.
<P>
   But what's the best way to cook it? Boiling is basic, but many
people swear that steaming or microwaving yields the best results.
</P>
<P>
   To find which method is best, we cooked fresh corn 10 ways.
Sacrificing the traditional accompaniments of butter and salt, we
ate our corn plain, searching for the truest corn taste and best
texture.
</P>
<P>
   We boiled, steamed and microwaved the ears, with and without the
husks, in plain water and in salted and sugared water.
</P>
<P>
   To boil the corn, we brought six pots of water to a rapid boil,
fully immersed the ears, covered the pots and cooked the corn for
three minutes. We boiled shucked and unshucked ears in plain water,
salted water and sugared water. The ratio of salt and sugar to
water was one tablespoon per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Food Department staffers liked the shucked ears boiled in salted
water the most. The corn had a lively crunch and true flavor.
However, because salt toughens the kernels of older cobs, adding
salt works only when the corn is very fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The corn boiled in sugared water drew mixed reviews. Two staff
members thought it enhanced the natural corn flavor, but others
felt it added an impurity that lessened the authentic corn taste.
</P>
<P>
   Most staffers did not like the corn boiled in the husk; it
tasted slightly raw and had a starchy texture. But, a few staff
members said that the husk protected the true corn taste.
</P>
<P>
   Shucked steamed corn was the department's overall favorite. When
the corn was done, its bright yellow color testified to the crisp,
sweet kernels. Steaming corn is also the quickest cooking method _
an inch of water boils faster than a full pot.
</P>
<P>
   Although steaming the corn in its husk also had its fans, it was
harder to prepare. Steaming greatly intensifies the heat of the
husk, and it is easy to burn yourself trying to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Microwaving was the clear-cut loser. We microwaved corn in its
husk and also in plastic wrap for three minutes per ear. Once
removed, we let the corn rest for five minutes. Both tests produced
flabby ears of wrinkly corn kernels that lacked any true character.
</P>
<P>
   Once Food staffers decided they liked the steamed, shucked corn
the best, they began the classic epicurean debate. Should you eat
your corn in rows or around in circles? Divided on this question,
we abandoned the argument and went searching for floss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remove the husks and silks from the ears of corn. Fill a large,
wide-mouth pot with one inch of cold water. Place the pot over high
heat and bring the water to a rapid boil. Lay the ears of corn in
the boiling water, stacking them on top of each other, if
necessary. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and steam over high heat
for seven minutes. Remove the corn from the pot and serve. Smear
with butter and sprinkle with salt, if you like.

 Taster's Choice: Knudsen Cottage Cheese Creams the Competition   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Some people equate cottage cheese with diet
plates, but others love the creamy freshness. Today's panel tasted
eight low-fat cottage cheeses and were surprised by the
differences.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel agreed that personal preference plays a large part in
what they liked. Some preferred cheese with a tangier flavor, while
others opted for a mild, milky taste. They also felt that what the
cheese would be used for was important in deciding which brand they
would choose.
</P>
<P>
   All of the cheeses were labeled low-fat, although the milk-fat
content varied from one to two percent. That means that a half-cup
serving has between one and 21/2 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming favorite was  &UR; Knudsen &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.49 at
many markets). Panelists liked the slightly tangy flavor and the
size of the curds. One panelist thought it would be particularly
good for using in dishes like cheesecake or as a topping for baked
potatoes. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Berkeley &LR;   &UR; Farms &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.09 at
Andronico's). Some panelists objected to the homogenous texture,
but most liked the creamy mouthfeel and tangy, fresh flavor. One
dissenter thought the curds were too dry and tough. Two would buy
it, one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TASTE 8- (71777 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.49 at Trader Joe's) came in third.
One panelist described it as a ``classic'' cottage cheese, although
others thought it was bland. One would buy it; three might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Lucerne &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.99 at Safeway).
Most panelists thought the curds were too large, lumpy and dry, but
two liked the milky flavor. Two would buy it, one might buy it and
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nancy's Organic &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.39-$2.89 at many supermarkets)
was fifth. Two panelists thought it was too tart, but the others
thought it would work well combined with other ingredients. One
panelist &LR;  suggested adding herbs and spreading it on toasted
baguette slices.  &LR; One would buy it, one might buy it and two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Sunny-side, Clover Stornetta and Nancy's
(not organic), but they ranked too low.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Meryl Bennan, food writer and consultant; John P.

 Secrets Of Success: At Bistro Viola, Vegetables Are Stars  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; I'm always pleasantly surprised when a restaurant
goes the extra mile and tries to do something special with
vegetables. Sure, lots of people are vegetarians or want to eat
lighter, but too many places think no further than grilled
vegetables or pasta primavera.
<P>
   At Bistro Viola in Berkeley, however, the vegetables can be the
stars, either on their own or as a side dish. One of my favorite
combinations created by Bistro Viola's former chef Mark Zeitouni is
the stuffed tomato, filled with haricots verts, potatoes and fresh
corn. The ingredients are cooked separately and then warmed in a
ripe tomato shell, under a creamy blanket of goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The stuffed tomato can stand alone as a simple vegetable main
course when served on a bed of frisee, or it can accompany roast
chicken as it does in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bistro Viola, which opened in 1999, has a cozy neighborhood feel
with polished birch plywood floors, an open kitchen and a sleek
stainless-steel bar that dresses up the 40-seat dining room.
There's also a 35-seat patio, one of the few places for outside
dining in Berkeley. The area is covered and, with the addition of
space heaters, it's possible to eat al fresco much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bistro Viola, 1428 San Pablo Ave. (at Page Street), Berkeley. &LR;

SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Individual cooking. &LR;  Cooking the vegetables separately and
then warming them in the tomato keeps them tasting fresh.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The goat cheese. &LR;  Just a small amount helps to turn a
vegetable into a star, either as a side dish or a main course.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; STUFFED TOMATOES WITH GOAT CHEESE CRUST
</P>
<P>
   This simple mixture is seasoned only with salt and pepper.
However, don't be afraid to use fresh herbs such as tarragon, thyme
or parsley in the blend.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 large tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound haricots verts, or other thin young green beans
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Kernels from 1 ear of fresh corn
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 fingerling potato, roasted or boiled and diced
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 head frisee
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Core the tomatoes and scoop out the inside of each, leaving the
walls about 1/2-inch-thick. Rub about 1 tablespoon of the oil over
the skin and around the inside of each tomato, then season
generously with salt and pepper inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the haricots verts in a large pot of boiling salted water
for about 4 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and rinse in cold
water. Cut into 1-inch lengths and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add
the green beans, corn and water and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
diced potato and cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the
liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the tomatoes in an ovenproof pan or on a baking sheet.
Spoon the hot vegetables into the tomatoes. Top with the goat
cheese, pressing it gently into the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 6 minutes, or until the tomatoes are hot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, toss the frisee in a large bowl with the remaining 1
tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the lettuce among serving plates, then top each with a
stuffed tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 At the Source: Nannies Know Best at Skyhill Farms  
 A herd of 700 goats do the work to make creamy goat-milk yogurt 
 and mild, rich cheeses  By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _  &LR; In political debates and labor negotiations,
hot-button topics always include maternity leave and retirement
benefits. But employees of Skyhill Napa Valley Farms, Inc., high
above the valley floor, don't have a problem with these issues.
They get a two-month leave every time they have a kid, and they are
well provided for when their working days come to an end.
<P>
   The employees in question, some 700 strong, are, however,
segregated by gender much of the time. They are goats, and if the
randy males are allowed anywhere near milking females, even if they
don't as much as brush coats with each other, the milk will take on
the males' overpowering scent _ what most humans would call a
stench.
</P>
<P>
   Skyhill started as an organic farm in the late 1980s. As a
hobby, co-owner/operator Amy Wend acquired three Nubian goats,
Emily, Natalie and Rose. Emily, Wend recalls fondly, had the finest
Nubian markings on her long, aristocratic face. So when Wend, with
partner Ted Connolly, started to sell her first goat cheese at
farmers' markets in 1993, Emily's face went on the label. Many
generations of goats later, Emily was still the poster girl for the
farm's products, including its outstanding yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Skyhill's Nubian and Alpine LaMancha goats now produce enough
milk for an average of 700 gallons of yogurt a week, along with
about 3,000 pounds of handmade cheese: many kinds of chevre, fetas,
Rigoatta (a cousin to ricotta) and, the latest introductions, aged
jack and creamy fontina. Like the cheeses, the yogurt surprises
first-time buyers with its mild, rich flavor. The strong taste many
people expect from goat milk products just isn't there, thanks to
Wend's careful monitoring of her herd.
</P>
<P>
   Wend has great fondness for both her goats and their milk. Goat
milk, she asserts, has tiny fat globules and most closely resembles
human mothers' milk. Most people with lactose intolerance, she
says, can eat goat yogurt with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Wend feels that goats deserve the good life they lead in
Skyhill's pastures since, she says, ``they are smart, and they have
an admirable social order.'' When they go to the milking shed twice
a day, they line up and take the same station every time _ no
shoving, pushing or trying to break away. (The fact that a little
granola treat awaits at the station may help just a bit.)
</P>
<P>
   When matriarch Emily got too old to reproduce or be milked, she
became something of a den mother, staying close to young females
giving birth and helping mind the kids. The other goats, Wend says,
always let old Emily get at food first, as though they respected
her senior status.
</P>
<P>
   During pregnancy and for their two-month maternity leave after
birth, the young mothers have separate pastures on the roughly
30-acre property.
</P>
<P>
   Wend is now the head honcho of Skyhill, though founding partner
Connolly, an all-pro guard with the 49ers from 1954 to 1963 and
later a major developer of shopping centers and other commercial
properties, still keeps a hand in. ``Ted does a little PR for us,''
she says, and right now he is helping her secure a different site
after the current lease expires. It will still be in Napa, but Wend
hopes to expand. Her dream farm would allow room for making blue
cheese, which needs a separate facility so the bacteria involved in
making it does not destroy the yogurt culture. Otherwise, she says,
``We'd end up with liquid yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wend would also like to add a viewing area and retail shop,
which the current remote mountain location doesn't allow.
</P>
<P>
   She has no plans to raise kids for meat consumption. When people
call asking about buying a kid goat for a barbecue, they are told
Skyhill is not a meat farm. Wend does send surplus kids and
under-producing milk goats to auction, but she hopes that they find
homes on other farms, as pets or for 4-H projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, she would like to set up a system that would allow her
to monitor where these animals go. There is no question where the
goats who have passed beyond their useful milking time of about
eight years go. They retire to a Santa Rosa farm where they can
follow their proverbial taste for anything green by making a living
grazing for weed control.
</P>
<P>
   At Skyhill, it appears, it's not such a bad thing to be an old
goat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Skyhill Napa Valley Farms is not open to the public. The &LR; 
 &LR; phone number is (707) 255-4800. Skyhill natural goat milk &LR; 
 &LR; yogurt, plain or flavored, is sold in quart containers at &LR;   &LR; Trader
Joe's. The farm's goat cheeses are available at most &LR;   &LR; upscale Bay
Area groceries and natural food stores but not in &LR;   &LR; supermarket
chains. &LR;

c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MEDELLIN DE BRAVO, Mexico _ Hunched on a footstool in front of
his empty one-room store in this wilted community, Miguel Angel
Torres surveys the deserted main street and explains why Mexican
politics have changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past nine years, they've been promising pavement,
drainage and such,'' Torres, 36, says as he watches a few shoppers
shuffling home with loads of groceries down the street, which has
been closed off for 13 months. ``They haven't done anything.
Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' are local and state officials who for seven decades
have been from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which
lost Mexico's presidency in historic elections July 2 to Vicente
Fox of the center-right National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   And ``they'' now confront local balloting Sept. 3, which many
here say promises to extend the PRI's stunning decline to towns and
villages across the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, once considered
the party's impregnable heartland.
</P>
<P>
   While its national bosses wrangle over the PRI's future and
their role in it, the party's fate is playing out in backwaters
like Medellin de Bravo, a township of 30,000 people about 15 miles
outside the port city of Veracruz. And from all indications, the
party's future seems even less promising than its present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the PRI's strategic reserve,'' Torres says of the
party's hold on Veracruz state politics for most of the past 70
years. ``Not anymore. If the PRI doesn't fulfill what it promises,
it's going to disappear from here as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico's next nationwide elections three years off, the PRI
enters a long season on the fringe in which most politics will be
decidedly local.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Oct. 20, the PRI confronts crucial elections in
three states across Mexico's impoverished south, a region
considered by many to be the last redoubt of the ruling party's
once-formidable political machinery. But even here, the discipline
and arm-twisting that kept the party together and in power has
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   In the south, PRI militants have been revisiting old feuds and
scrapping for what remains of the party's power.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate of a united opposition is favored to win the
governorship in southernmost Chiapas state. And in recent weeks,
fierce squabbling has broken out among local PRI politicos for
candidacies in Veracruz's municipal and state congressional
elections. As many as 13 people competed for the party's mayoral
nomination in some towns, because the PRI's state bosses proved
unable to impose their will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the PRI is that everyone wants to be a
general; no one wants to be a soldier,'' complains Aquiles
Rodriguez, 35, a wealthy cattleman and University of Houston
graduate who is the outgoing PRI mayor of Medellin de Bravo. ``The
same people who have lived off the party don't want it to progress
because you take away their means for making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   The infighting in Medellin de Bravo was as fierce as anywhere,
with the daughter of a former PRI mayor leading a successful
rebellion against the candidate Rodriguez had tried to impose. The
woman, Norma Jacome, won the candidacy with the backing of the PRI
state president, an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the PRI is a bad system but that the selection
of candidates has gone wrong,'' Jacome says. ``People are just
looking for power. But they must have ideals, conviction, values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't political control,'' she says of the PRI's
internal conflicts. ``There is a lot of resentment. We don't have
the political maturity to work all this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Jacome says, she now faces a tough race in a town
where most everyone is more than a little irritated with the
current mayor, with her father and with the PRI in general.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's hold on Mexican politics was fatally eroding even
before Fox's victory. The PAN and other opposition parties govern
55 percent of Mexicans at the state and local levels. For the past
three years, opposition parties have controlled 103 of Veracruz
state's 210 townships.
</P>
<P>
   The main street of El Tejar, Medellin de Bravo's shopping
district, has been closed off for more than a year now. After
contractors sent by the PRI-controlled state government tore up the
pavement to lay new sewer lines, funding evaporated and work
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The street remained closed for five months until new money was
found and a new contractor hired. Although Mayor Rodriguez promises
that the street will be open by Election Day, work continues at a
turtle's crawl.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, heavy buses, cargo trucks and family vehicles
detour through the village's residential backstreets, which have
never been paved.
</P>
<P>
   Chasms the size of swimming pools have been worn into the
once-smooth and bucolic lanes. Seasonal tropical downpours have
filled the pools with muddy water, making a drive across the
village seem like a back-country challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I go ask people for their vote with the streets like
this?'' Jacome asks. ``You have to work for people. If we don't
change, it's the party that is going to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in Medellin de Bravo would agree. Many work in
nearby Veracruz and Boca del Rio, increasingly prosperous cities
that have been governed by Fox's PAN for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement has perhaps been most noticeable in Boca del
Rio, a shabby suburb of Veracruz until just a few years ago. Now it
sports a large mall with some of Mexico's best retailers and a
multiscreen theater as well as a hotel strip along the beach and
new streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the townships where the PAN is and the quality of life
is better than where the PRI governs,'' says Cristobal Soto, 50,
another idle merchant on El Tejar's main street. ``The need for
changing parties is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in town remain loyal to a former peasant leader who
defected from the PRI to the leftist Workers Party three years ago
when PRI state leaders selected Rodriguez for Medellin de Bravo's
mayor over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are destroying the official party by putting in their
pals, their accomplices,'' says Julio Martinez, the 55-year-old
former PRI peasant boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in the PRI just for themselves. That's why the
party is disappearing.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ ``Compassionate conservative'' _ Is it nature or
is it nurture?
</P>
<P>
   A lot depends on the way you were raised, say members of the
Texas Delegation polled for their definition of Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
   Nurture? Well, yes, to a certain extent _ but with limits.
Indeed, ``but'' was a key word in most responses.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from interviews conducted at random.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``To help people to take care of themselves,'' said Carole
Ragland of League City. ``To be compassionate but not to make
people slaves to welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mother raised me to be compassionate,'' said Jan Kennady of
New Braunsfels, president of the 2,500-member Texas Federation of
Republican Women. ``But she also liked people to be willing to help
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie O'Reilly, 68, of Plano, owner of McDonald's
restaurants, understandably believes ``it's wrong to let people go
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives can be very compassionate and very liberal in
some respects. I shouldn't use the word 'liberal,' but at least
have a sense of empathy toward other people.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For Bill Keating, 43, of Arlington, a Texas A&AMP;M graduate and
former Marine fighter pilot now flying for American Airlines, said
it involves caring about the ``whole person.'' ``Not just whether
they have a minimum wage job, but how's their life going and are
they doing OK. You can't throw money at that kind of problem.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For William Russell, 64, of Dallas, whose business is
investment and ranching, ``Ours really is the compassionate
party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in providing the best opportunity for everybody,
regardless of color or national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who grew up on a Texas Panhandle ranch, said he was
raised ``to be self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you learn from a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ William Fairbrother, 34, of Round Rock, a computer programmer,
said compassionate conservatives ``will help you but there has to
be an end-game to getting you out of government welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized ``faith-based initiatives, putting time limits on
welfare, going from welfare to workfare, holding down a job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sue Evenwel of Mount Pleasant, a housewife whose husband is an
executive with a chicken-processing company, said compassion
``describes the heart of a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have compassion for the poor and downtrodden, but we're
more interested in teaching them the skills to get ahead, not just
shoving programs to keep them where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger O'Dell, 46, a utilities consultant from El Paso, said
his party realizes ``there are times when people have to be on
welfare, but not forever. Teach them how they can provide for their
families, start paying taxes and help pull the wagon for someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Anderson of Spring, a housewife and volunteer whose
husband is a pastor, had this advice for the poor:
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean on Him and He
will direct your path. When you are really in need, a relationship
with God is something amazing to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sue Hershey, an Amarillo homemaker whose husband is a grain
broker, put it simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free enterprise, the opportunity to either succeed or
fail without interference from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The button Hershey was wearing made a compassionate conservative
statement of its own: ``If it's not a baby, you're not pregnant.''

 &HT;    Delegate says character is still the issue
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For Bob Flournoy, 59, a delegate from Lufkin,
Texas, the Republican Party's ``determination to restore integrity,
truthfulness and decency to the presidency overshadows all the
other issues,'' including abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' he said, ``I don't think there's a more
important issue than the issue of life, but those of us who
disagree aren't being combative or angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the GOP's desire for inclusiveness, said Flournoy, a
lawyer and lay preacher active in local and state GOP politics
since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge, but I believe it's in our heart to be
inclusive, to have more women and more minorities involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Flournoy contends that the Republican Party ``stands for what
the majority of minorities believe in ... faith, family, peace,
security and strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we haven't always done a good job of communicating what we
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He also concedes that ``many times we have been too quick to
criticize people for not standing for the same things we stand
for.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``It's like they say, 'If you don't stand for
something, you'll fall for anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Flournoy says he doesn't want to see his party ``give up all our
standards and try to be all things to all people. I certainly hope
the GOP isn't going there.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, there's no problem in where to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it by drawing on the Bible,'' he said. ``That's the
standard that the Lord has set for us _ unity, caring, help and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all found in the very basic character of the Lord, in
love. Loving people covers a multitude of other shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's those characteristics that Flournoy said he finds in George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked with him for years, and I really believe that it
(love) is the motivation of George Bush's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's wife, Laura, and his parents, President and Mrs.
Bush, are all ``good honest folk,'' Flournoy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are consistent in what they stand for,'' he said. ``Their
moral code of ethics is what I want to see in my family and my
community. They're great.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Flournoy's first national convention, and he says he
``picked a good one to come to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in the cradle of American history at one of the
most critical times in our nation's history,'' he said, ``and we
have a long way to go to restore the moral fiber of our country's
leadership.''

`LIMP BIZKIT ROCKS THE NAPSTER DEBATE'(PHOTO) &HT;    By MICHAEL D. CLARK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This wasn't the biggest performance of Limp Bizkit's
career. It wasn't the longest and probably not even the loudest.
But for the 2,500 fans Monday night, it was the best for one simple
reason.
</P>
<P>
   It was free.
</P>
<P>
   Many Limp Bizkit fans spent their Sunday waiting, sleeping and
camping in line for the Monday morning distribution of entry
wristbands to the concerts Monday and Tuesday night. The shows were
underwritten by Napster, the online music download site temporarily
saved from shutdown by federal judges last week.
</P>
<P>
   (Other Napster-sponsored shows are scheduled for Aug. 2 in
Dallas, Aug. 4 in Denver, Aug. 6 in Salt Lake City, Aug. 8 in San
Francisco, Aug. 11 in San Diego and Aug. 12 in Los Angeles)
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Napster's ultimate fate, Limp Bizkit stands to be
a winner for years to come. Its advocacy of Napster has moved the
band into national debates about e-commerce, the political and
legal ramifications of online music, and the future of music
distribution. And the band's free shows have made loyalists of a
nation of kids unable to afford the high cost of concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The hot and humid wait for wristbands sent at least 10 people to
the hospital to be treated for dehydration and heat exposure.
Shortly before showtime, the Houston Police Department reported
that seven arrests were made for public intoxication, indecent
exposure and theft.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening the fans had revived, returned and were ready
to thank the metal rappers for their generosity by tearing
themselves apart. The mosh pit was already in full force for stereo
music piped in before Limp Bizkit came on.
</P>
<P>
   Signs around the theater asked all to refrain from public
indecency, public exposure and violent or nonconsensual contact.
This crowd did everything it could to flagrantly break those rules.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 12-song, 80-minute set, guys slammed into each
other like football linemen and women lifted their shirts to catch
Bizkit frontman Fred Durst's attention.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Limp Bizkit dressed its stage with a prison
yard-style chain-link fence, which separated the band from the
audience. As bodies surfed across the crowd and into the metal
barrier, the group thrashed like inmates behind it. It looked like
a steel cage wrestling match could break out at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Durst stalked the stage dressed in black denim and a red
baseball cap flipped backward. His rhyme style can lapse into a
pleading whine reminiscent of Shaggy from ``Scooby Doo,'' but it
works best when he puffs out his chest and gets his throat dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Like This'' had the entire room pogoing. ``Break Stuff''
was playful but turned the crowd fierce enough to jog memories of
the mayhem at Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   The set rolled to a brief pop-rock pause while Durst sang a
cover of George Michael's ``Faith.'' A rendition of House of Pain's
early '90s East Coast rap jam ``Jump Around'' worked much better,
backed by the urban rave crash of guitarist Wes Borland and bassist
Sam Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the set was a breakdance beat approach to
``Counterfeit'' from Bizkit's first album, ``Three Dollar Bill
Y'All''. Overlaid with old-school vinyl scratches, a jeep-jumpin'
bass loop and guest shouts from Cypress Hill's Sen-Dog, the song
was a model for what once made smash-nose hard-core rap appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit's contribution to this summer's ``Mission:
Impossible-2'' soundtrack, ``Take a Look Around,'' also transfers
well to the stage. Borland's dexterity mixing the original
``Mission Impossible'' theme into the track, combined with Durst's
solid blend of singing and shouting, made for a balanced output of
melody and lyrical content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a Look Around'' has to excite the Limp Bizkit fans
waiting for the band to come out with a new album. That won't
happen until its last release, ``Significant Other,'' leaves the
charts (57 weeks, 6 million copies sold and counting). With the
Napster-sponsored momentum Limp Bizkit has created, don't look for
that to happen anytime soon.

 &HT;    As calendar turns, a day-by-day food fest for August
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - August is like a beauty who knows the clock is
ticking relentlessly. With tender youth past, she puts a touch of
color on her face and strides out, head high, flaunting her charms.
And she's got a lot to show off. Right now, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who get to enjoy this sensual, passing show,
August is the most excessive part of summer. Think of the month,
like the lady, as dead ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Local farmers, blessed with the best growing season in years,
have bounteous crops of corn and tomatoes, zucchini and beans,
peaches and berries, including a second harvest of raspberries on
the horizon. And there's more to come, the melons and plums and red
bells by the bushels full.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough to fill each page of the calendar until September
signals that the extravagance of summer is fading.
</P>
<P>
   Today (Aug. 2) Buy local peaches at market. Let ripen fully and
make quick freezer jam. Have a package of Sure-Jell and sugar on
hand. The instructions are in the package.
</P>
<P>
   3. Layer slices of tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and torn basil on
a platter. Drizzle with vinegar and olive oil, sprinkle with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn leftover corn on the cob into corn salsa with chopped
tomatoes, onion, garlic, minced jalapenos, cilantro, fresh lime,
and salt and pepper. Serve with grilled chicken or pork.
</P>
<P>
   5. Make pesto before the flavor of the basil plants get too
strong. Freeze some for later.
</P>
<P>
   6. Make a big batch a ratatouille with August tomatoes, bell
peppers, eggplant, zucchini, garlic and lots of fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   7. Make a quick vegetable soup with green beans and shell beans,
summer squash and tomatoes. Add a little pasta. Top the soup with
leftover basil pesto.
</P>
<P>
   8. Make old-fashioned succotash with lima beans or green beans
and corn off the cob.
</P>
<P>
   9. Vary the salad lineup with cucumber salad made with sour
cream thinned with olive oil. Add minced garlic.
</P>
<P>
   10. Make a modern variation on stuffed peppers by filling
roasted red bell peppers with smoked cheese. Bake them in light
tomato sauce .
</P>
<P>
   11. While chicken or pork chops are cooking, fix separate
skewers of vegetables on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   12: Take a few minutes to make tarragon or opal basil vinegar.
Stuff a quart jar half full of fresh herbs, bruising with your
fingers. Fill with rice wine vinegar, and let steep on a sunny
windowsill for 2 to 3 weeks. Bottle with fresh sprigs of herbs.
</P>
<P>
   13. Turn all those tomatoes and cucumbers into a cooling
gazpacho.
</P>
<P>
   14. Make an old-fashioned peach cobbler or crisp.
</P>
<P>
   15. Grilling zucchini is the best thing you can do to that
vegetable. Slice 6-inch squash in half lengthwise and salt it to
draw off juices. After a half hour, brush with oil and grill until
it is tender and the cut surfaces are brown.
</P>
<P>
   16. Try something different from the farm market, maybe orange
or striped beets. Toss the cooked beets with a vinaigrette made
with orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   17. Make a quick tomato sauce and toss with spaghetti squash
pasta and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   18. Make eggplant caviar _ also known as Texas caviar _ as a
dip.
</P>
<P>
   19. Company is coming so it's time to get fancy. Make a fresh
tomato tart for appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   21. Be the first on the block to grill brussels sprouts. Cut
them in half, thread on skewers, brush with olive oil and cook 5 to
10 minutes, until golden but not charred. Serve piping hot.
</P>
<P>
   22. Make a fruit salad with the bounty: watermelon, cantaloupe,
honeydew, peaches and plums.
</P>
<P>
   23. For a quick dessert using late summer' raspberries, pile 3
cups in a baking dish, spoon on a half cup of sour cream mixed with
2 tablespoons brown sugar and a tablespoon Chambord. Chill for an
hour then sprinkle with more brown sugar and broil 1 1/2 minutes
until the sauce begins to bubble.
</P>
<P>
   24. Don't forget the tomatoes margarita. Buy sweet cherry
tomatoes. Set them out with coarse salt mixed with minced cilantro
and a mix of tequila and lime juice for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   25. Make a sorbet or granita with pureed berries, cantaloupe,
watermelon or pear.
</P>
<P>
   26. Put up red bell peppers for winter. Core, seed and slice or
cube and freeze in a single layer on cookie trays. Store in freezer
bags.
</P>
<P>
   27. Grill new potatoes. Put them, single layer, in a
triple-strength packet of foil with salt, pepper, minced garlic and
a little water. Roast on hot coals 45 minutes to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   28. Make a plum pie.
</P>
<P>
   29. Make classic Pizza Margherita, a red, white and green
Italian favorite with nothing more than slices of fresh tomato,
mozzarella and fresh basil.
</P>
<P>
   30. Make the French vegetable sandwich called Pan Bagna, with
layers of salted tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper and hard -boiled
eggs on an olive-oil-drizzled baguette. Let it sit a half hour _
it's best a little soggy.
</P>
<P>
   31. Make pasta with roast tomatoes. Peel, core and season
tomatoes and place cored side down on a bed of basil leaves. Roast
for 1 1/2 hours in a 350-degree oven. Break up with a spoon and
serve over pasta.

   &QR;  There's one month left for summer picnics. If you have a
picnic hamper packed with the basics ready to go at all times you
can pick up and go whenever the mood stripes. Include a tablecloth,
napkins, bottle opener, corkscrew, paper plates, plastic utensils
and at least one large plastic trash bag. Be sure there's a blue
ice pack in the freezer. All you have to do is stop at the
supermarket deli for quick picnic makings. See, life can be simple.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anyone who has ever cut the kernels from an ear of corn knows
they can fly all over the kitchen. The most frequent suggestion is
to place the corn end down in a large mixing bowl and cut away, but
frankly that's awkward. Here's another suggestion: cut the cob in
half crosswise, then put cut end down on a plate with a lip. Cut
off kernels with the sharp edge of a knife. If the recipe also
calls for corn milk, turn knife and repeat with the dull edge to
free extra corn and corn milk.

BLENDER? WHAT'S A BLENDER? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too often, cucumber soup is made with no more thought than
``Let's throw it in the blender with some yogurt and salt.'' To me,
that's not soup but a kind of bizarre milkshake. A real cucumber
soup has backbone.
</P>
<P>
   The usual alternative is a cooked cucumber soup, and that's
fine, but I think the whole point is to avoid heat and effort while
making something cooling, soothing and perfectly refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I was stuck on cucumber soups, cooked or from the
blender, that had a smooth, creamy consistency. Then, I was served
a clear chunky ice-cold soup laced with soy and with the
characteristic sour, sweet, salty and spicy combination that is
characteristic of so much Southeast Asian and Korean cooking. The
base was chicken stock, and the very thinly sliced cucumbers were
mixed with scallions, watercress and fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   After I duplicated that, it occurred to me to make a similar
soup with coconut milk and the fish sauce nam pla. This variation
is equally spicy but wonderfully creamy.
</P>
<P>
   These soups showed me how to improve on the European-style
versions that I had always made. For those, I use yogurt or sour
cream, but the cucumbers are thinly sliced, not pureed, and the
soup has better texture. I doubt I'll ever use the blender to make
cucumber soups again.
</P>
<P>
   For either Asian or European cucumber soup, most of the time
involved lies in chilling. I refrigerate the seeded, sliced
cucumbers after they are seasoned, as their moisture is drawn out;
I refrigerate the stock, yogurt or sour cream that is the soup
base; and if time allows, I refrigerate the soup itself.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of these soups is quite lively, not really from the
cucumbers but from the load of herbs with them. Both the Asian and
European variations can be augmented with other vegetables _
arugula is good _ and both work well with a few cooked shrimp or
some cooked shredded chicken tossed in.
</P>
<P>

TURNING GRILLED FLAVORS INSIDE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN RAICHLEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to grilling, Americans achieve flavor through a
free-handed use of rubs, pastes and marinades. Asians take a more
internal approach. They grill their kebabs on skewers made of
flavorful grasses and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   I first encountered this practice in Bali, where roadside cooks
grill seafood mousse kebabs called sate lilit. An explosively
flavorful mix of pureed fish and spices is molded onto stalks of
fresh lemon grass, then grilled over coconut shell charcoal. The
lemon grass perfumes the sate from the inside out, and you get a
blast of flavor as you nibble the mousse off the skewer.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Vietnamese grill a delicately flavored shrimp
mousse on broad, flat lengths of sugar cane. These kebabs, called
chao tom, offer a stunning contrast of textures and flavors: the
refreshing crunch of the sugar cane versus the soft succulence of
the mousse, the briny tang of the seafood against the sweetness of
the cane juice. As with the lemon grass in sate lilit, you don't
really eat the sugar cane, but chew it a little to release the
juice.
</P>
<P>
   This dish made me think about other uses for sugar cane,
specifically the sugar cane swizzle sticks that are sold at
specialty shops. The thin, square-sided sticks make perfect
skewers; all you need to do is cut off one end sharply on the
diagonal to help ease the skewer through the food.
</P>
<P>
   Taking my inspiration from chao tom, I created a sort of
Caribbean dish by skewering whole shrimp on the cane and basting
them with a rum-mustard glaze. These offbeat kebabs make great
appetizers at a cookout, and assembling them is a snap. Just make a
starter hole with a metal or bamboo skewer in the item being
skewered. Sprigs of fresh rosemary also make excellent skewers,
with stems slender enough to pass through a small item like a
scallop, yet stiff enough to hold chunks of chicken or seafood. The
heat of the fire releases the rosemary oils, which infuse the kebab
with flavor. You can use fresh rosemary sprigs from a greengrocer,
but you'll get longer, stiffer skewers if you cut them from a
rosemary plant, which will keep growing. Once you start thinking
about flavorful skewers, there's no limit to where your imagination
will take you. Mine takes me to my spice rack. With fresh peaches
in season, I reckoned that whole cinnamon sticks would be just the
thing for skewering peaches or nectarines for grilling. For that
matter, you could use sections of vanilla bean as a flavorful
skewer for chunks of banana. Who ever said that you can't grill
dessert?
</P>
<P>
   ROSEMARY-GRILLED SCALLOPS  &QL; 
Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds sea scallops (about 30)
</P>
<P>
   About 30 fresh rosemary sprigs (each 3 to 4 inches long)
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces prosciutto, sliced paper thin
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Pull off and discard crescent-shaped muscle on side of each
scallop that has one. Strip leaves off bottom 2 inches of rosemary
sprigs (slide them off with your thumb and forefinger). Reserve
leaves, and set sprigs aside. Cut prosciutto into strips just large
enough to wrap around scallops (about 1 by 3 inches).
</P>
<P>
   2. Lay a scallop flat on a work surface. Wrap a piece of
prosciutto around it. Skewer a rosemary sprig through prosciutto
and scallop to other side. Repeat with remaining scallops. Arrange
scallops in a baking dish. Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice on
both sides, sprinkle with rosemary leaves and season with salt and
pepper. (Go easy on salt, as prosciutto is fairly salty.) Marinate
for 15 minutes, while you light grill.
</P>
<P>
   3. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Brush
and oil grate. Arrange scallops on grate, and grill until just
cooked, about 2 minutes a side. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 appetizer servings or 4 main course servings.  &QL; 
PEACH KEBABS ON CINNAMON STICKS  &QL; 
Time: 15 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 large ripe freestone peaches
</P>
<P>
   8 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons salted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons bourbon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Peach or vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut peaches in half, and remove stone. Cut each peach half in
half. Using a metal skewer, make a starter hole in center of each
peach quarter. Skewer two peach quarters on each cinnamon stick,
placing a mint leaf between each.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare bourbon butter glaze. Combine butter, sugar, bourbon
and lime juice in a saucepan, and boil until thick and syrupy, 3 to
5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Brush
and oil grate. Grill peaches until nicely browned on both sides, 2
to 4 minutes a side, basting with glaze. Serve at once, with ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   PLANTATION SHRIMP ON SUGAR CANE SKEWERS  &QL; 
Time: 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   24 extra-large shrimp (1{ pounds), peeled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   { cup dark rum
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon each cinnamon, ground cloves and black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   12 sugar cane swizzle sticks (see note).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place shrimp in a mixing bowl and stir in oil, lime juice,
garlic, salt and pepper. Marinate 15 minutes while you prepare
glaze and skewers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place ingredients for glaze in a saucepan, and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until thick and syrupy, 4
to 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cut swizzle sticks in half widthwise, and cut one end off
each piece sharply on diagonal. Resulting skewers should be about 5
inches long and \ inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   4. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Using
a metal skewer, make two starter holes in each shrimp, one toward
head end, one toward tail. Insert a sugar cane skewer through
holes. Repeat with remaining shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   5. Brush and oil grill grate. Grill shrimp kebabs until cooked,
about 2 minutes a side, generously basting with glaze. Serve any
remaining glaze as a sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 appetizer servings, 4 light main course servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Sugar cane swizzle sticks are sold at Citarella stores in
Manhattan for $3.99 for 10 to 12 sticks. Gourmet Garage stores also
carry them, in packages of eight to 10 sticks for $2.99.

TO SEND IT BACK OR NOT? SOME GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The phone call came from Jean-Claude Baker, who runs
Chez Josephine on 42nd Street. A customer had ordered a $100 bottle
of wine, then announced that it was ``no good'' and demanded his
money back.
</P>
<P>
   As a smart restaurateur, Baker gave the fellow his money even
while convinced that there was nothing wrong with the wine. What,
he wanted to know, was one supposed to do in such a situation?
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat comforting to hear that even veteran restaurateurs
get squirmy when the subject is returning a bottle of wine. Wine is
intimidating to many diners, and most of the time, when they think
a bottle is bad, they lack the confidence to complain and end up
drinking something that should be poured down the sink.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation are the wine boors, who know
too little to accurately judge a wine's quality but are only too
eager to pronounce it inferior.
</P>
<P>
   (Henri Soule, who ruled over Le Pavillon in New York, dealt
summarily with them: When someone complained about a perfectly good
bottle, the captain would summon Soule. ``Of course we will replace
it,'' he would say, adding that he found nothing wrong with the
wine. The captain would then say that he had found nothing wrong
with it, either. Another captain might be consulted; he, too, would
find nothing wrong. By then the cocky customer would be looking for
a table to crawl under.)
</P>
<P>
   The send-back problem has been compounded in recent years by the
huge rise in the price of wine at restaurants, and the increasing
number of ``serious'' wine drinkers. People who have little or no
idea of what a great wine should taste like assume that anything
they pay $300 a bottle for is going to be delicious. And it may
well be _ to someone who has been drinking wine for years and knows
what to look for in a 20-year-old Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer to music is not expected to rhapsodize over the Bach
B minor Mass. Why should a wine neophyte be expected to find joy in
an austere St.-Estephe from 1970 or even 1989? It's the job of a
good sommelier to see problems brewing and head them off by
suggesting _ delicately _ something more appropriate. If the
customer persists, he shouldn't complain afterward _ assuming
there's nothing actually wrong with the wine.
</P>
<P>
   If a wine is truly bad _ if it's corked, for example _ a good
waiter will replace it without question. In turn, most wholesalers
who supply restaurant wines will take the bottle back and not
charge for it.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's an older wine, one the restaurant may have had in
its cellar for a long time, it's hard to blame the distributor _ or
even the producer. Some restaurants have a policy of not replacing
wines 20 years old or more, and they let customers know this when
they order them.
</P>
<P>
   Corkiness is the most common wine problem. The cause is a mold
that thrives in the bark of the cork oak tree. Proper treatment
during the cork-making process eliminates it, but affected corks
can and do slip through. They give wine the smell of a moldy, damp
basement and impair the taste as well. Corkiness is found in both
young and old wines, which is why some wineries now use only
plastic corks. One small California winery, PlumpJack, made news
recently by putting a screw-top cap on a $135 bottle of cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, few restaurant customers know how to identify
corkiness. Good sommeliers understand. ``Too few bottles are sent
back,'' said Larry Stone, the wine director of Rubicon, a San
Francisco restaurant. ``If you look at the statistics on corked
wine, you know there should be more returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the problem of corked wines was serious, with
some distributors and retailers claiming to find a corked bottle in
almost every other 12-bottle case. Faced with mass defections to
plastic corks, the cork manufacturers have improved quality
considerably. But even if only 1 percent is contaminated, a busy
restaurant can expect to serve one or two bad bottles a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me,'' said Darryl Beeson, the wine director at
the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, ``is the ones we don't
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way for a diner to handle the problem is to ask the
waiter or wine steward if he or she thinks the wine is ``off'' in
some way. If they think it is, they will gladly replace it, because
they want the customer to be happy and because it costs the
restaurant nothing to come up with a new bottle. Asking the
server's advice is flattering and nonconfrontational. In a good
restaurant, it almost always works.
</P>
<P>
   If you eat in places where wine is not often served or where the
staff knows little about wine, you may have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   How does one detect corkiness? If the wine has that moldy smell,
even a faint one, it's probably corked. A friend of mine learned to
recognize it by asking waiters to let him smell any corked bottles
they may have retrieved that day.
</P>
<P>
   Other wine problems are rare or easier to deal with. If the wine
is at the wrong temperature _ a red wine too warm, or a white wine
too cold _ a couple of minutes in an ice bucket for the red and 10
minutes out of the ice bucket for the white will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wine that has been aged prematurely by exposure to air, usually
through a dried-out cork, is oxidized and should be returned. It
will smell of glue or nail polish remover, and is the result of bad
winemaking. But that problem is now extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Older wines, even great ones, will often throw a sediment, which
collects in the bottom of the bottle. It has no effect on the wine
and can be eliminated by decanting or filtering the wine through a
clean strainer.
</P>
<P>
   Tartrate crystals, the clear granules that are occasionally
found on the bottom of the cork in a bottle of white wine, are also
harmless. European wine drinkers tend to shrug them off, but they
make squeaky clean Americans nervous, so wine producers strive to
eliminate them before the wines go to market.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is wine that is just plain bad: For one reason
or another, it has turned completely. It will smell of vinegar, and
you don't have to go to wine school to recognize that, do you?
</P>

SUMMER TOMATO TERRINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the seventh of eight columns by Michel Richard, the chef
and owner of Citronelle in Washington. They are being written with
Marian Burros.) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people might call my tomato terrine a tomato pudding, but
it is more a salad, with very thin layers of highly seasoned tomato
slices and bread. It's the perfect first course in summer.
</P>
<P>
   The terrine has so many origins: Mexican pico de gallo with its
highly seasoned tomatoes; Italian panzanella, the bread salad; and
a salad my mother always made.
</P>
<P>
   The idea first came to me when I was making a summer pudding
with layers of brioche, strawberries and cassis. As it sits in the
refrigerator overnight, all the juices soak through the bread and
blend together into a pudding that bursts with the flavors of the
fruit and cassis.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's tomato salad had no bread, but great flavor. It was
seasoned with onion, parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar and peanut
oil, and she made it four or five hours in advance so the flavors
would meld. I use basil and olive oil, but we didn't have those in
the Champagne region. I adopted those ingredients when I went to
work in the south of France and combined them with red onion and
red wine vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   For this salad, the tomatoes have to be skinned. You can do this
with a blowtorch, charring the skin until it can be slipped off, as
we sometimes do, or you can blanch them in boiling water until the
skins loosen and will easily slide off. Just don't put in more than
two at a time, or the tomatoes will remain in the water so long
that they will cook and turn mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Some people blanch garlic when they use it in a dish that won't
be cooked, but I prefer to saute it because that adds a bit of
flavor while removing the harshness.
</P>
<P>
   The bread must be very dense to stand up to all the liquid.
That's why I use brioche, but you can use another dense bread like
hallah or pain de mie, the French sandwich bread, which has a dense
texture and is made with milk and butter.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER TOMATO TERRINE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus overnight refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   4{ pounds ripe field tomatoes (about 10 large ones)
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   5 cloves garlic, finely chopped

   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 unsliced loaf brioche, pain de mie or other fine-textured
white bread
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups minced Italian parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring large pot of water to boil. Using slotted spoon, dip
tomato in for a few seconds and remove. Repeat until skin cracks,
and set aside to cool. Repeat with remaining tomatoes. Slip skins
off, and cut tomatoes in half. Remove cores and seeds. Cut flesh
into \-inch dice, and place in large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small saute pan over low heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil and
saute garlic just until softened, not browned. Add to tomatoes with
onion, vinegar and remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss
to mix well.
</P>
<P>
   3. Line an 11{-by-4-by-3-inch terrine with plastic wrap. Remove
crust from bread, and cut loaf lengthwise to make a slice \ inch
thick to fit bottom of mold. (If necessary, use more than one
slice, fitting them together in an even layer.) Spoon a third of
the tomatoes evenly across bread, and sprinkle with a third of the
parsley.
</P>
<P>
   4. Top with another \-inch layer of bread. Add a third of the
tomatoes and a third of the parsley. Repeat with last layers of
bread, tomato and parsley, and top with bread. Spread any juices
over bread. Cover with plastic, and place brick or similar weight
on top. Refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, lift terrine from mold and remove plastic wrap.

A WORD OR TWO ABOUT RAW EGGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By   MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the subject of raw eggs comes up, questions come
flowing in. Although the government says no one should eat raw
eggs, public health advice must be ``one size fits all,'' and the
risk is not the same for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of getting salmonellosis from uncooked or lightly
cooked eggs, whether in mayonnaise or mousse, is quite small for
healthy adults. It has grown even smaller in the last three years.
In 1997, the chances of an egg being infected with salmonella were
one in 10,000. Today the chance is one in 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   But for certain groups, eating raw food like meat, fish or eggs
is much riskier than it is for a healthy adult. About 300 people in
the United States still die from salmonellosis every year. Raw or
lightly cooked eggs (soft-boiled, for example) should not be eaten
by children, the elderly, diabetics, pregnant women, those with
weak immune systems or liver disease, or those taking medication to
reduce stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   In response to consumer pressure, the industry has assumed more
responsibility for ensuring safety. It produced a consumer
education campaign to raise awareness about safe food handling, and
egg producers have adopted measures that did not exist just a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1995 that the industry created a quality control
program encouraging farms to watch for rodent and pest infestations
and to wash and refrigerate eggs, controls most people assume have
always been in place. Though the program is voluntary, 93 percent
of large egg producers have adopted some version of it, according
to the American Egg Board, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella is transferred from the chicken to the egg, so a
vaccine is now being used on some farms. Food Animal Concerns
Trust, a nonprofit organization financed by private foundations and
individuals, which seeks to improve the safety of meat, poultry and
eggs, is using the vaccine on 13 small farms in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The trust also endorses a technique called competitive
exclusion, which introduces strains of beneficial bacteria in
day-old and 2-day-old chicks, which prevents salmonella from taking
hold. But the technique is relatively expensive, said Robert Wood,
the executive director of the trust, and is used only for broilers
and not for laying hens.
</P>
<P>
   Some supermarkets and specialty stores sell eggs pasteurized in
the shell, which means they are heated just long enough to kill the
germs without cooking the egg. Pasteurized eggs can be used in any
recipe that calls for raw eggs, including mayonnaise and Caesar
salad, though they must be cold in order to separate properly.
Pasteurized egg whites have been available for a few years. Beyond
these changes, Wood said the most promising innovation is the
testing of flocks and their environments at critical points, along
with the diversion of eggs to a pasteurization plant when
salmonella is found. The Food and Drug Administration wants to make
that system mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Because the risk of salmonella poisoning rises with the age of
the egg, the Agriculture Department said Monday that it plans to
prohibit wholesalers from repackaging eggs that grocery stores
return like remaindered books. The department plans to require a
mandatory 30-day expiration date on all cartons. Currently, some
cartons carry sell-by dates, and some carry Julian dates, which
reveal when the eggs were packed, although in coded fashion: 001
means Jan. 1; 365 means Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has also proposed requiring
safe handling instructions on cartons of eggs. They would be
similar to the labels on meat and poultry but would include a
statement saying eggs may contain harmful bacteria and warning that
certain people are most at risk. The Egg Board favors a label
without the warning.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, consumers should observe the following rules:
</P>
<P>
   Buy eggs only from refrigerated cases, and refrigerate them in
their cartons, which helps keep them fresh.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid repackaged eggs, buy only those that carry the
Agriculture Department shield.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Julian or sell-by dates on cartons, and buy the eggs
with the latest dates.
</P>
<P>
   Use only clean, unbroken eggs. Discard dirty or broken ones.
</P>
<P>
   Do not leave eggs in any form at room temperature for more than
two hours. For picnics, pack egg dishes with ice or commercial
coolant in an insulated cooler or bag.
</P>
<P>
   Wash your hands, utensils and work surfaces to prevent
cross-contamination.

STATE PLAN TO UPROOT HOMES FOR NATURE SANCTUARY IS FOR THE BIRDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, in a wooded setting between Weslaco and
Mercedes, bird fanciers and conservationists moved their mobile
homes into a park where they could enjoy the wonders of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Lakeview Park became the winter home of nearly 270
annual visitors to the Texas Rio Grande Valley. An additional 40 or
so families made it their year-round home.
</P>
<P>
   Now they all have to move; tear up years of trees, plants and
shrubs that have grown around their mobile homes and leave the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they destroy that kind of habitat? Because the local
development committee wants to hand the property over to the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department for a bird sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Parks and Wildlife won't accept the land if anyone is
living on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a bird sanctuary for more than 30 years,'' said
George Hoffman. He and his wife, Kathryn, are serving as temporary
managers of the Lakeview Park. ``There are hundreds of species of
birds in this park, and a goodly number of small animals as well.
We have a man living here in this park who is a world-renowned
ornithologist. He moved here because he wanted to study the vast
number of species we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Weslaco Development Committee, which recently purchased
the park, wants the property for the World Birding Center, to be
built by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the center are readily obvious. They are not so
the birds can have sanctuary, but so thousands of visitors can come
to see them, spend money and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Nature tourism, as bird-watching is often called, is
economically important in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year, it
brought $21 million to the McAllen area, according to the chamber
of commerce there.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a $29 billion industry in Texas, and the Valley wants
a greater share.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost? The vast majority of the people living in
Lakeview Park are senior citizens. The mobile homes they live in
are their only investments, and now those homes are being rendered
nearly worthless.
</P>
<P>
   They can't sell because no new residents are being allowed to
move to the park. They can't move because other mobile home parks
in the area don't take houses that are more than 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even if their homes are less than 10 years old, these
people still can't afford to move,'' Hoffman said. ``To tear
everything down, move and put it all back up again costs about
$4,000 to $5,000. These people don't have that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the original plans for the World Birding Center
didn't include the park, and now the plans only take in about 25
percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to turn Lakeview Park into a bird sanctuary
because it already is one, Ben Basham, Lakeview's resident
ornithologist, told The Valley Morning Star in Harlingen. ``I've
got my own World Birding Center in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Basham went on to warn that many of the park's residents would
not leave without a fight. ``Nobody's going to turn over and play
dead,'' he said. ``There are veterans of World War II and the
Korean conflict in here. You don't kick people out of their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman says the battle all comes down to money and a callous
attitude by local officials. ``The Parks and Wildlife Department,''
he said, ``is more interested in woodpeckers than in people.''

 &HT;    YOUNGEST DELEGATE KNOWS WHAT SHE BELIEVES
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``Being the youngest, a lot of people feel the
need to protect me or guide me,'' said Karin Henninger.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger, 18, is apparently the youngest of the 4,132 delegates
and alternates to the Republican National Convention. But this
young Colorado alternate knows what she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by Republican parents, she is well acquainted with the
party. She immediately registered as a Republican voter the day
after her 18th birthday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger said she firmly believes abortion ``should not be used
as a form of birth control'' and that young voters should be aware
of current legislation that will affect their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security for my generation is very important. My
generation will probably not see a penny of it if something is not
done about it,'' Henninger said.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, she has been rubbing shoulders with such
national and state luminaries as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Gov. Bill Owens, R-Colo., and is already well-known among Colorado
politicos.
</P>
<P>
   Her daily schedule at the year's biggest political party
includes early morning breakfast with the Colorado delegation,
lunches with young politicians, workshop sessions on politics
during the day, and evening parties. But as exhausting as it may
seem, Henninger changes into comfortable shoes to continue
politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see more young people involved in politics,''
said Henninger, of Colorado Springs. ``My parents always told me
you can't exercise the right to complain if you don't exercise your
right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people are only apolitical because no one is approaching
them, Henninger said. She encourages her peers and friends to go
out to vote regardless of what party they choose. She tells them
not to ``waste their vote by not voting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't encourage people while they are in high school
then you are not going to get them while they are in college,''
Henninger said. ``You need to start on them young.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado politicians are prepping her for a political career.
She would like to start off by running for a school board and
continue to change the face of politics to include more women.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she will take her experiences back to her local
organizations, including Colorado College Republicans, El Paso
County Young Republicans and Denver Metro Young Republicans. She
will be a freshman at Pikes Peak Community College in the fall.

   SOMALIA-REVIVE (Arta, Djibouti) _ The Somalis originally thought
it could happen quickly, that their country could be resurrected
from its stripped bones in only three days. But they have been here
since March, talking their way down a wandering path of mobile
phones and free roasted camel that just may finally create a
central government for the only nation in the world without one.
There are good reasons to be skeptical about what is happening
here. This is the 13th attempt to remake Somalia since the state
collapsed in civil war in 1991. Some key players, notably major
warlords who keep Somalia in tatters, are not on board. But about
2,000 ordinary Somalis, along with the bulk of their leaders, have
come to the neighboring country of Djibouti, and without exception
they say they are determined to reverse the years of hatred that
made Somalia the No. 1 symbol for chaos in Africa. By Ian Fisher.

<P>
   It was 1993, and I had my first kitchen job, at a restaurant in
Boston. I listened in as the sous-chef and a cook bent over a
blender, the sous-chef slowly giving instructions. With the machine
whirring, egg yolks were dropped in. Then oil, in an erratic,
drippy stream. A sunny yellow sauce rapidly formed. I asked what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayonnaise,'' the sous-chef said.
</P>
<P>
   I almost fell over.
</P>
<P>
   Although I grew up with a mother who baked bread, made her own
jam and never once bought a cake, I thought mayonnaise was
something from a jar. I knew what it should taste like, but I never
really knew what it was.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, is creamy, silky, sharpened with just a splash of
acid, enriched with egg yolk, thickened with oil and pretty much
the best thing that has come to cuisine since butter.
</P>
<P>
   Since I tasted that soft, buttery sauce, I have rarely gone back
to the commercial kind. Watching that mayonnaise whirl together in
what seemed seconds was one of those revelatory moments people new
to cooking have, and it changed me. If you could make something so
splendid from ingredients so ordinary, so unlikely, cooking must be
full of many more unearthed secrets. (It is.)
</P>
<P>
   And though most of America still depends on the stiff, oily
mayonnaise in jars, to serious cooks making their own has become as
fundamental as whisking together vinaigrette. As eggs have grown
safer in recent years, many home cooks have been emboldened to make
it a part of their regular repertory. Hellmann's is a fine product,
sweet and tangy as it is. But homemade mayonnaise is something
entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   It is perfectly divine spread on sandwiches or dressing a salad,
but you can also use it to build sauces. It is the foundation, for
instance, of rouille and tartar sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when I don't feel like cooking an entire meal, I
often gather a few vegetables from my neighborhood market, blanch
them in boiling salted water, whisk together a mayonnaise and break
a baguette into pieces. I dunk the artichokes, asparagus, carrots
or whatever into the mayonnaise and sop up whatever is left with
the bread. It is a perfect supper, easy, restorative and adequately
indulgent. In Provence, cooks have been doing that forever, but
they make the mayonnaise with garlic and call it aioli.
</P>
<P>
   Making mayonnaise is meditative. You can whip it up in a blender
or food processor _ and there are times, as with an herb
mayonnaise, when you need a machine to chop as well as to emulsify
_ but I always do it by hand.
</P>
<P>
   I have a small French whisk with many, many loosely layered wire
loops and a stainless steel bowl. The egg yolk falls into the bowl
like a thick drop of paint, and I loosen it with vinegar or lemon
juice, a pinch of coarse sea salt and a little Dijon mustard. It
smooths out with a few strokes of the whisk, and then I add the
oil, usually peanut or vegetable, whisking steadily, almost
frantically at first, to break up the oil. When it is incorporating
correctly, it seems to melt into the folds of the liquid,
disappearing until no drops of oil can be seen on the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, I add the oil more quickly, whisking, whisking, until
the oil and mayonnaise are no longer at odds, blending as fluidly
as vermouth and gin in a martini. The smooth, yellow emulsion
clings to the sides of the bowl. I taste, add a little salt and
whisk again, and in a few minutes _ no more _ it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   You can do this faster in a blender or food processor, but I
have found I have more control with a whisk, and it is just as
easy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to improve basic mayonnaise, but there seem
to be an infinite number of ways to enhance it. Eggs and oil
welcome almost anything into their realm.
</P>
<P>
   I use a mildly flavored oil so that the richness of the egg
comes through. Many people use olive oil and are disappointed. The
result is often heavy and bitter. I use stronger, similar oils to
flavor the mayonnaise. I might whisk in a few tablespoons of extra
virgin olive oil, walnut oil or Asian sesame oil at the end. So
small an amount can scent the entire sauce without overwhelming it.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a liquid is perhaps the most difficult decision. The
oil needs a liquid to emulsify and stabilize the sauce. You can use
just water. But some kind of acid is typically preferred. Almost
any will work: red wine vinegar, rice vinegar, champagne vinegar,
sherry vinegar, apple cider vinegar, lime juice, grapefruit juice,
lemon juice, Meyer lemon juice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these basic components you are free to roam, within
reason. Garlic in particular does good things to oil and eggs. I
add at least a sliver to most mayonnaise recipes as a gentle
background flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep adding garlic, you'll get aioli. I have read recipes
for 16 cloves to a cup of oil. If you plan to carry on any
conversations in person for the rest of the week, three might be a
better start. But garlic is unpredictable. Some is wickedly strong,
and some is subtle. Crush it with the side of a knife, chop it to a
paste and add it at the beginning. If you want the aioli stronger,
whisk in more garlic later. Aioli, like most flavored mayonnaises,
needs to sit a few hours (in a refrigerator) before serving, to
mellow.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I added a few crushed anchovy fillets with garlic
cloves to a mayonnaise. It became a decadent cousin to anchoide,
the French anchovy dressing, and seemed destined for a steak
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Then I charred a red pepper and pushed it into a blender with a
mayonnaise made with a whisk and a bowl. It turned a pretty salmon
pink and tasted sweet, smoky and only vaguely of red pepper.
Another time, I packed the blender with arugula and pureed the
fresh leaves into mayonnaise until it was smooth, pale green and
peppery. I spread it on day-old bread, rubbed with a tomato, and
covered it with a piece of serrano ham. You could substitute basil
and watercress for the arugula.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs can be added in the blender, or you can chop them up and
stir them in at the end. In the blender, you will get a delicate,
uniform sauce. By hand, you will get something more eventful. Some
tastes will be smooth as a pastry cream, others enlivened with
bursts of flavor from the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Mayonnaise, of course, is the basis of many salad dressings and
sauces. Tartar sauce is just mayonnaise loaded with salty bits of
gherkins, shallots or onion and capers. Sour cream is sometimes
added to mayonnaise to make a creamy and tangy dressing on wedges
of lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I tried whole milk yogurt to see what would happen. The two
allied beautifully. The yogurt added a sharper tang and creaminess
without weighing down the sauce. A little heavy cream stirred into
a bowl of mayonnaise turned up a gentle, light sauce that could be
eaten by the spoonful. I folded it into a salad of smoked mackerel,
red potatoes and celery. The cream in the mayonnaise tempered the
smoke in the fish and thinly washed its flavor over everything as a
shadow softens a landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A standard mayonnaise would have been too thick for this salad.
The cream stretched it out and made it easier to pour. You can
loosen mayonnaise by adding things like cream, sour cream and
yogurt, but you can also simply add water. A tablespoon or so is
usually plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Once the egg yolk and oil emulsify into mayonnaise, it is a
fairly stable concoction. A little water, a little more acid or a
lot of mustard is not going to shake its foundation. Getting it to
coalesce in the beginning is the challenge. Sometimes a mayonnaise
will start thickening and then suddenly turn liquid, or break. It
could be caused by anything from the temperature of the ingredients
to the speed at which the oil is being added.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this hazard, make sure all ingredients are at room
temperature, and when you first add oil, do it a few drops at a
time and no faster. If you add the oil too quickly, it is like
flooding an engine. The protein in the yolks is overwhelmed by the
oil.
</P>
<P>
   If your mayonnaise breaks, don't throw it out. Get a fresh bowl
and a new egg yolk. Begin mixing the yolk with the acid, salt and
whatever else you put in the first batch and then treat the broken
batch as if it were the oil, whisking it in drop by drop. Once this
emulsifies, you can add oil until the sauce is like your original
vision for the mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I have broken many mayonnaises. But I have yet to make
one that has disappointed me. One with lots of lemon juice and
lemon zest folded into chopped eggs changed my opinion of egg
salad. I used another, flecked with coriander and cumin, to dress
red and Savoy cabbage, but it made me consider roasting lamb, just
so I could make a sandwich with it.
</P>
<P>
   A lime mayonnaise with sieved avocado stirred in on a whim was
as green as a baby leaf and startlingly rich. It ended on chicken
and fennel. But it may end up with potatoes next time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best consequences of making mayonnaise is that you
have to make more than you need for a meal. A cup is about the
least you can make, so there is always some left over.
</P>
<P>
   The next day when you pull it from the refrigerator, you can
congratulate yourself and choose its next fate. A basil mayonnaise
for burgers one day has renewed vitality in a chicken salad the
next.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that I have turned my back on what I first
knew as mayonnaise. My mother makes a chicken salad with almonds,
grapes and celery. Commercial mayonnaise holds it together and
asserts itself sharply, sweetly. I would never try to make her
salad with homemade mayonnaise. Both have their place.

BARAK'S ENEMIES RENEW VOW TO TOPPLE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOHN KIFNER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political problems
mounted Tuesday as his right-wing opponents, sensing blood after
their stunning defeat Monday of Shimon Peres, Barak's presidential
candidate, vowed new efforts to bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak doesn't have a government,'' declared the Likud leader,
Ariel Sharon, calling for new elections. ``He has lost his majority
in the Knesset.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Moshe Katsav, the first Likud candidate ever elected
president _ a low-profile local politician and a Sephardi immigrant
who was given no chance by political commentators _ was sworn in
Tuesday evening, there was turmoil and consternation within the
remnants of Barak's battered coalition.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's closest associates, Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh, a comrade from their days in Israel's most elite
secret commando unit and a former general, issued a frustrated call
for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in the current political makeup of the Knesset, we could
not bring about the election of Peres, it is a sign that we will be
unable to pass other things,'' Sneh said on Israel radio.
``Therefore we must go directly to the nation, to present our path,
so that the nation can decide what it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected get through one more acrimonious session of
the Knesset, or parliament, Wednesday before it adjourns for its
regular three-month vacation. A preliminary bill calling for the
dissolution of parliament and new elections is to be referred to a
committee that his party controls.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hopes to use the coming months to strengthen his
coalition, which now has only a minority of 42 in the 120-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon warned Tuesday that what he called his ``Jerusalem
Coalition'' would be ready to act should Barak ``sneak'' into any
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stand on guard,'' the former general, a hero of tank
battles in the Sinai desert in two wars and the architect of
Israel's troubled 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said. ``We can call the
Knesset at any time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it would be unusual, the Knesset could be called back
from vacation on a petition signed by 25 members, a number that
would be easy for Likud and its allies to gather. If the subject
was a vote of no confidence, the petition would need 61 signatures,
an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon made his remarks in a sometimes pugnacious appearance
before a group of foreign journalists, where he repeatedly returned
to his theme that Jerusalem is the rightful possession of the
Jewish people and must never be divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is a symbol that kept the Jews together for
thousands of years,'' he thundered at one point, hammering his hand
on the lectern. ``Jerusalem is a symbol. You don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Political commentators, many of them critical of the vote
against Peres in the Knesset and the role the ultra-Orthodox
parties played in his defeat, were unanimous on Tuesday in saying
that the vote had been a major blow to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority in the Knesset voted not only against Shimon
Peres but first and foremost against Barak, and against what the
two of them represent,'' Nahum Barnea wrote in the newspaper
Yedioth Ahronoth. ``It is no wonder that the left wing in Israel
let out a painful cry yesterday: beyond the sorrow at Peres' bad
luck, people were afflicted by the same sense of self-pity that
seized them after Rabin's assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same newspaper, Sima Kadmon wrote: ``The Likud chalked up
a tremendous political achievement yesterday. It succeeded where
failure appeared certain. And that success is going to accelerate
the collapse of Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Peres this was probably the last defeat,'' Kadmon
continued. ``For Barak it was probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Ma'ariv, Hami Shalev wrote: ``This is a Knesset which
acts in ways that are not only confrontational but also somewhat
perverse. This is a Knesset that will not pass a peace accord with
the Palestinians, that will not legislate a referendum under
conditions acceptable to the government, that will not let Barak
move another meter.''

   I read the first novel in the Harry Potter series, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in April 1999 and was only
moderately impressed. But in April 1999 I was pretty much all
right. Two months later I was involved in a serious road accident
that necessitated a long and painful period of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of this period I read Potters 2 and 3
(``Chamber of Secrets,'' ``Prisoner of Azkaban'') and found myself
a lot more than moderately wowed. In the miserably hot summer of
'99, the Harry Potters (and the superb detective novels of Dennis
Lehane) became a kind of lifeline for me.
</P>
<P>
   During July and August I found myself getting through my
unpleasant days by aiming my expectations at evening, when I would
drag my hardware-encumbered leg into the kitchen, eat fresh fruit
and ice cream and read about Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts,
a school for young wizards (motto: ``Never tickle a sleeping
dragon'').
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I awaited this summer's installment in J.K.
Rowling's magical saga with almost as much interest as any
Potter-besotted kid. I had enjoyed the first three, but had read
the latter two while taking enough painkillers to levitate a horse.
This summer, that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   I'm relieved to report that Potter 4 _ ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' _ is every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3.
It's longer, though. ``Goblet'' is as long as ``Chamber'' and
``Prisoner'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   Is it more textured than the first three? More
thought-provoking? Sorry, no. Are such things necessary in a
fantasy-adventure aimed primarily at children and published in the
lush green heart of summer vacation? Of course not. What kids on
summer vacation want _ and probably deserve _ is simple,
uncomplicated fun. ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' brings
the fun, and not just in stingy little buckets. At 734 pages,
``Goblet'' brings it by the lorry load.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this book is that Rowling's
punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor goes the distance. At
700-plus pages, one should eventually tire of Blast-Ended Skrewts,
Swedish Short-Snout dragons and devices like the Quick-Quotes Quill
(a kind of magical tape recorder employed by the satisfyingly
repugnant Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter), but one never does.
At the least this reader did not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Rowling doesn't dwell for long on such
amusing inventions as the Quill, which floats in midair and bursts
out with florid bits of tabloid prose at odd moments. She gives the
reader a quick wink and a giggle before hustling him or her along
again, all the while telling her tale at top speed. We go with this
willingly enough, smiling bemusedly and waiting for the next nudge,
wink and raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Puns and giggles aside, the story happens to be a good one. We
may be a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his
horrible aunt and uncle (plus his even more horrible cousin,
Dudley, whose favorite PlayStation game is Mega-Mutilation Part 3),
but once Harry has attended the obligatory Quidditch match and
returned to Hogwarts, the tale picks up speed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Newsweek interview with Malcolm Jones, Rowling admitted to
reading Tolkien rather late in the game, but it's hard to believe
she hasn't read her Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Although
they bear the trappings of fantasy, and the mingling of the real
world and the world of wizards and flying broomsticks is
delightful, the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly
shrewd mystery tales.
</P>
<P>
   Potter 3 (``Azkaban'') dealt with Harry's parents (like all good
boy heroes, Harry's an orphan) and cleared up the multiple
mysteries of their deaths in a way that would likely have pleased
Ross Macdonald, that longtime creator of hidden pasts and
convoluted family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, returning to Hogwarts after attending the Quidditch World
Cup, Harry and his friends are excited to learn that the Triwizard
Tournament is to be reintroduced after a hiatus of 100 years or so
(too many of the young contestants wound up dead, it seems).
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring wizards from two other schools (Beauxbatons and the
amusingly fascistic Durmstrang Academy, location unknown) have been
invited to spend the year at Hogwarts and compete in the contest,
which is composed of three beautifully imagined tasks. These can
only be performed well by contestants who can solve the riddles
that bear on them; both children and students of Greek mythology
will enjoy this aspect of Rowling's tale.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sorting Hat, one of Rowling's early ingenious bits of
invention, the Goblet of Fire is essentially a choosing device.
It's supposed to spit out three flaming bits of parchment bearing
the names of the three contestants in the tournament, one entrant
from each school. In a vivid and marvelously tense scene, the
Goblet of Fire spits out four parchment fragments instead of three.
The fourth, of course, bears the name of Our Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harry is supposedly too young to compete in such a
dangerous series of tilts, the Goblet has spoken, and of course
Harry must step into the arena. If you think young readers won't
lap this up, you never had one in your house (or were one
yourself).
</P>
<P>
   Adults are apt to be more interested in just how Harry's name
got into the Goblet in the first place. This is a mystery Rowling
works out with snap and verve. And, unlike the denouements I
remember from the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries of my youth,
where the culprit usually turned out to be some vile tramp of the
lower classes, the solution to the Goblet mystery, like the answers
to the Triwizard riddles, struck me as fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Rowling gives us Harry's first date (not with the
alluring fifth-level dream girl Cho Chang, unfortunately), at least
one thought-provoking subplot (involving house-elves who rather
enjoy their status as kitchen slaves) and an extremely large dose
of adolescent humor (one mildly off-color joke, punning on the word
Uranus, will likely go over the heads of most grade-school readers
and amuse the brighter junior high school set). There's also a
moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling. Adults can
safely speed through these bits; it's a teen-age thing.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone wonder at the fabulous sales success of these books?
The Harry Potter series is a supernatural version of ``Tom Brown's
Schooldays,'' updated and given a hip this-is-how-kids-really-are
shine. And Harry is the kid most children feel themselves to be,
adrift in a world of unimaginative and often unpleasant adults _
Muggles, Rowling calls them _ who neither understand them nor care
to. Harry is, in fact, a male Cinderella, waiting for someone to
invite him to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In Potter 1, his invitation comes first by owl (in the magic
world of J.K. Rowling, owls deliver the mail) and then by Sorting
Hat; in the current volume it comes from the Goblet of Fire,
smoldering and shedding glamorous sparks. How nice to be invited to
the ball! Even for a relatively old codger like me, it's still nice
to be invited to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It would be depressing to announce that the best-selling book in
the history of the world, a position this book will probably hold
only until Potter 5 comes along, is a stinker. ``Goblet of Fire''
is far from that.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harry appeared on the scene, escape-hungry kids had to
make do with R.L. Stine, the uninspired but wildly successful
journeyman who inspired the ``Goosebumps'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books are better natured, better plotted and better
written. They bulge with the sort of playful details of which only
British fantasists seem capable: there's the Whomping Willow, which
will smash hell out of your car (and you) if you get too close to
it, snack foods like Cauldron Cakes and Licorice Wands and the
satisfyingly evil Lord Voldemort (so evil, in fact, that most of
Rowling's characters will only call him ``You-know-who'').
</P>
<P>
   The Dursleys, Harry's unpleasant guardians, explain the boy's
long absences by telling their friends that Harry attends St.
Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. And the book
opens with the murder (offstage, don't worry) of a witch named
Bertha Jorkins. Rowling doesn't exactly come out and say it's what
the unfortunate Bertha deserves for taking her vacation in Albania,
but she certainly implies it.
</P>
<P>
   Is there more going on here than fun? Again, not much. In a good
deal of British fantasy fiction, the amusing inventions are
balanced by themes of increasing darkness _ Tolkien's ``Rings''
trilogy, for instance, in which the fascism of Mordor begins as a
distant bad smell on the breeze and develops into a pervasive
atmosphere of dread, or the Narnia books of C.S. Lewis, in which
the writer's religious concerns invest what begin as harmless
make-believe adventures with a significance that becomes, in the
end, almost unbearable (and to this reader, rather tiresome).
</P>
<P>
   Taken to its extreme, the id of British fantasy produces a
Richard Adams, where the unfortunate talking dogs Snitter and Rowf
suffer almost unspeakable hardships and the bear-god Shardik comes
to stand for all the promises religion ever made and then broke;
where every sunlit field of scampering rabbits conceals its shining
wire of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowling's work, such shadows can be perceived, but they are
thin shadows, quickly dispelled. Harry's adventures remain for the
most part upbeat and sunny, despite the occasional cold pockets of
gruel; more Lewis Carroll than George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   The British fantasy they may actually be closest to is J.M.
Barrie's ``Peter Pan.'' Like any school, where the clientele is
perpetually young and even the teachers begin to assume the
immature psychological char acteristics of their pupils, Hogwarts
is a kind of Never-Never Land. Yet Harry and his friends show some
reassuring signs of growing up eventually. In the current volume
there is some discreet necking, and at least a few sorrows and
disappointments that need coping with.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy writer's job is to conduct the willing reader from
mundanity to magic. This is a feat of which only a superior
imagination is capable, and Rowling possesses such equipment. She
has said repeatedly that the Potter novels are not consciously
aimed at any particular audience or age. The reader may reasonably
question that assertion after reading the first book in the series,
but by the time he or she has reached ``Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire,'' it becomes increasingly clear that the lady means what
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can there be any question that her stated refusal to dumb
down the language of the books (the current one is presented with
such British terms as petrol, pub and cuppa unchanged) has lent the
stories an attraction to adults that most children's novels simply
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is good. Harry Potter will soon be appearing at
a multiplex near you. The initial project is being helmed by Chris
Columbus, a filmmaker of no demonstrable ingenuity; one doubts if
the director of ``The Goonies,'' one of the loudest, dumbest and
most shriekingly annoying children's movies ever made, is up to
bringing Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the
screen. (I hope, on behalf of the millions of children who love
Harry, Hermione and Ron Weasley, that Columbus will prove me
wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy, even that as sturdy and uncomplicated as this Young
Wizard's Progress, is difficult to bring to film, where the wonders
are all too often apt to shrink and become banal. Perhaps Harry
Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers. And if these
millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and rewards of
fantasy at 11 or 12 ... well, when they get to age 16 or so,
there's this guy named King.
</P>
<P>
   (Stephen King's ``On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft'' is coming
out this fall.)

MAD ABOUT NAPSTER? YOU SHOULD BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny, isn't it, how rebellion in rock 'n' roll has evolved?
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five years ago, it was going crazy over Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, it was growing your hair, dropping out,
turning on, going to Woodstock, marching against the Vietnam War
and arguing with Dad at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, it was safety pins, Ramones records,
pogoing and being one of a handful of people watching some punk
band while 12,000 worshipped at the feet of REO Speedwagon or
Journey.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it was throwing away your Cinderella records,
getting a flannel shirt and moshing.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it's stealing music off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I refer, of course, to Napster, which allows people to download
songs off the Net and keep them, forever. For free. Right there on
your computer. For free. Sounding just like the originals. For,
once again, free.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel
effectively shut down Napster, saying the company was infringing on
music copyrights to a massive degree. But on Friday, an appeals
court panel said Napster can continue to operate while it contests
the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patel injected a little sanity into this whole ugly
business, and it's nice to see that someone with some clout
recognizes Napster for what it is: Taking music without the
permission of those who made it, not paying royalties, not caring a
fig about little things like copyrights, and giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which has sued
Napster, has estimated that more than $300 million worth of sales
have been lost due to the free trading, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The rift in the music community over Napster has been
polarizing. Millions of people have used the service and love it,
but musicians feel they're being ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Metallica have taken the most pro-active stance
against Napster: Drummer Lars Ulrich brought the e-mail addresses
of thousands of Napster users to the company's California
headquarters. Then the group sued Napster. And then, the day after
the band played Texas Stadium, Ulrich was on Capitol Hill,
testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Napster issue isn't going away _ company attorney
David Boies says there will be an appeal. In the meantime, reading
Ulrich's testimony should be mandatory for anyone interested in the
Napster debate; it's available at www.metallica.com.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Ulrich takes an honest, nearly comprehensive look at just
how far-reaching the effects of Napster could be _ on bands,
engineers and owners of recording studios, among others. All would
suffer if Napster were allowed to run rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about the whole debate, and Metallica's
stance, is that the band has somehow become ``the enemy'' to
thousands of music fans: To them, the band's members are sellouts,
money-grubbers, capitalist pigs. And now, most probably, even more
evil, as their point of view has, at least temporarily, prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, people think music should be free, maaaan _ the
argument being that if we can download the entire Metallica catalog
without paying for it, we should be able to.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the world doesn't work this way. I can go steal a
Metallica CD _ or at least attempt to _ from my local record store,
and food from my local supermarket and gas from the station I go.
</P>
<P>
   I can go eat dinner somewhere and then sneak out of the
restaurant and into a waiting car without paying for it _ walking
the check, we used to call it _ and I can do the same with a copy
of Rolling Stone down at 7-Eleven. You can take more than one copy
of your local newspaper from the rack.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is called theft: ``Can'' and ``should'' are not the
same thing. Nobody who wants to get Metallica's music for free
would take kindly to being asked to work for a week _ or a month,
or two _ for no pay, much less the many months it often takes
musicians to craft a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's crime, it seems, is being popular _ as if working
for years to build up a fan base and make a decent living means
they should then have to give up all rights and profits from their
music.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the cutoff point? Ten million CDs sold? Fifteen? Five
Top 5 singles? Eight?
</P>
<P>
   Most musicians, of course, are not wealthy. They're devoting
much of their lives to giving people music, and they should be paid
for their work, because it took time and money and effort and
creativity to produce it. We don't live in a society where
everything we want is free _ never has been the case, never will
be. Thanks again, Judge Patel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a secret world of chance meetings between
strangers, of quietly arranged hookups, of one-time encounters that
can turn passionate or can even blossom into semipermanence.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the rave scene.
</P>
<P>
   This is the territory of Mozart and Brahms and Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many social scenes that weave through New York's night
life, few are lesser known than the chamber music crowd. And few
have so many dedicated denizens.
</P>
<P>
   Piano trios, string quartets, wind quintets and other
permutations coalesce within apartment walls and then melt away, or
meet once for a reading, or grow old together. Many players find
one another through Amateur Chamber Music Players Inc., a worldwide
organization that lists some 500 members in New York City in a sort
of giant collective personal ad. Others navigate in small, informal
networks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the amateur classical music world in this city extends
far beyond chamber groups.
</P>
<P>
   There are orchestras: the Doctors' Orchestra, the Lawyers'
Orchestra, the Brooklyn Heights Orchestra and ensembles at the
Bloomingdale School of Music and 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, among
others. Many of the city's more than 20 community music schools
have chamber music programs for amateurs. Around the country, there
are dozens of weekend or weeklong seminars for players willing to
travel, and to pay. One of the most popular seminars runs for a
weekend in March under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center. And this is not to mention youth orchestras and
choruses.
</P>
<P>
   The most fervent devotees seem to be the chamber musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've no hesitation about calling absolute strangers, although
more and more you get to know people and have musical friends,''
said Joan Edelstein, a flutist and director of the physical therapy
program at Columbia University. ``In some cases they become
unqualified friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein plays weekly in a wind quintet, whose previous
incarnation lasted 12 years. Her husband, Haskell Edelstein, a
bassoonist and tax lawyer, plays in two other quintets and two
community orchestras. They play in frequent one-time gatherings and
a sometime nonet. When they travel, they always stop in on the
local music store, a practice that has swollen their sheet music
collection to four shelves' worth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, amateur music-making has been around as long as
classical music. At first a province of the aristocracy, it
broadened into a bourgeois pursuit with the rise of the middle
class in the 19th century. Think of Schubertiade evenings in middle
Europe or parlor soirees in mid-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In an age overwhelmed by electronic pursuits, this acoustic
world _ at least in New York _ seems to be flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important for those who worry about the health of
classical music in America. Amateur musicians are the best sort of
audience, informed to the point that they have played the very
pieces on a night's concert program. Many serve on the boards of
musical institutions, or as arts administrators. Amateur dollars
provide income for professional teachers and chamber music coaches.
</P>
<P>
   And amateur music-making offers an avenue to the types of social
bonds and friendships that have declined as life has sped up, a
problem addressed by Robert D. Putnam in his recent book ``Bowling
Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster). Putnam, a Harvard University political scientist, argues
that civic engagement and private networks have declined over the
past 30 years, to America's detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putnam presents data in his book that shows a decrease
in the number of Americans in the last 25 years who play
instruments, the data does not break out classical music or chamber
music. There are, however, indications that these musical ranks
have been growing.

   The Amateur Chamber Music Players says its membership has
increased by about 800 since the mid-1990s, to 4,900. ``For every
member we have I am sure there are four or five who play quartets
with a member who just didn't join,'' said Daniel Nimetz, executive
director of the association. And the National Guild of Community
Schools of the Arts estimates there are 600 arts schools in the
country, and more than two-thirds of its members were founded in
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Quantity is nice, but to many musicians, it is the quality that
counts. ``Chamber music by its very nature is a kind of analogue
for community,'' said Daniel Epstein, a New Yorker and the pianist
of the Raphael Trio. ``It requires cooperation, it requires
empathy, it requires listening to other people, all the things you
have to do in society to make society run successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The devotion of some amateur musicians knows few bounds, judging
by the behavior at a chamber music workshop that the Raphael Trio
runs in Adamant, Vt., for adult amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get to camp and before they even unpack they pull out
their instruments and start playing,'' Epstein said. ``They'll play
far into the night. People tell us they look forward to this week
the whole year. It really gives meaning to the word amateur, in a
true sense of the word, somebody who loves something. It's not a
job to them. It's something that goes right to the heart of who
they are and what they love.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overestimate the zeal of these amateurs. One
subject, Dr. Franz Alt, a retired mathematician at the Bureau of
Standards in Washington who fled the Nazi occupation of Austria in
1938, approaches people carrying string instruments on the subway
to his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it a habit of collecting people in Washington Heights
who play,'' said Alt, a violist who takes part in four or five
regular quartets at any one time. Alt is 89.
</P>
<P>
   At the Amateur Chamber Music Players association, joining simply
means gaining a place in a worldwide directory. Musicians grade
themselves. Members are encouraged to call one another. New members
are asked to volunteer a contribution of $20. A Web site,
www.acmp.net, allows members to search for players by instrument,
location and grade. In one way, the digital age helps. E-mailing
has made contacting players much easier.
</P>
<P>
   A typical evening of the chamber association took shape July 26.
</P>
<P>
   It was an eclectic mix, like a New York 2000 version of those
bomber crews in old World War II movies. There were the Edelsteins;
a music therapist; a synagogue caretaker for the Soslowitz Hasidic
sect; a federal prosecutor; an official of the city's Department of
Environmental Protection; a computer consultant; and a dot-com
employee. A reporter sat in. The ages ranged from late 20s to early
60s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The evening was organized by Laurence Beckhardt, the
environmental official, who borrowed a sister-in-law's large living
room in Tribeca. The program: two wind octets by Mozart, and nonets
by Charles Gounod and Theodore Gouvy.
</P>
<P>
   Chitchat was minimal. There were deferential offers to play
second parts. Roles emerged. Barry Fader, the caretaker and an
oboist, revealed his former life as a professional musician by
occasionally calling for a chord or attack to be repeated, just to
get it right. Haskell, a true veteran of the amateur circuit,
assumed the mantle of raconteur and joke-teller. (``Did you hear
the one about the soprano standing outside her door in the rain?
She forgot her key and didn't know when to come in.'') Jennifer
Miller, French-horn player and music therapist and another former
pro, seemed the most assured on tempi.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, was the chief source of discussion _ how fast to
play a movement. ``Too bad this is a democracy,'' Fader said at one
point with a wry tone.
</P>
<P>
   There is a seamy side _ well, as far as it goes _ in the key and
fingerboard set.
</P>
<P>
   Some players refuse to play in a group that includes an
individual they do not like. Sessions can become a wedge between a
musician and a nonplaying spouse, or even the source of jealousy
when a spouse perceives a rival in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Finley, a lawyer and violist, attends a lavish chamber
music party in Darien, Conn., every December. ``People bring their
spouses, but they group together and leave early,'' he said. ``Then
we switch around, go from group to group, room to room. It's almost
like a music orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   A recurrent theme among association members is frustration with
players who overrate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun to be in a group with people who play less well,''
said David Greenwald, the federal prosecutor and an oboist. ``And
in the long run, it's better not to play with people who are better
than you, because they will resent you. You want to find your own
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamber association sessions have a vague etiquette. An offering
of drinks is usually important. Don't criticize fellow musicians
unless you know them well enough to rib. Try not to be late. It's
hard enough getting a bunch of busy professionals together. Be
tactful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful about not stepping on anybody's toes,''
Fader said. ``But musicians don't like to be superficial. It's an
art that requires great depth of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   English is not necessary. Finley says he once played string
quartets with an Italian, Japanese and German. Only the Italian
spoke English, to a degree. ``Who you end up playing with is
sometimes a complete mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people generally regard that having a pleasant
evening and being hospitable and having something to eat and
telling good stories is almost as important as the music,'' Finley
added.

<P>
   If you're a typical college student this fall, chances are
you'll buy something in an animal-print motif during your
back-to-school shopping.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't avoid it. Leopard, tiger and zebra prints are
lurking in store aisles on nearly everything: sheets, towels, rugs,
beanbag chairs, ironing-board covers, suitcases, inflatable
furniture, candles, bulletin boards, cosmetic bags, cell phone
covers -- even hair dryers.
</P>
<P>
   But now that animal prints are in, they're going out.
</P>
<P>
   That's the college market. If something is around long enough to
be hip, chances are it's not that hip anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets into the mainstream, then their parents go for it
and it's no longer cool,'' said Eric Weil, managing partner of
Student Monitor, a national collegiate market research service.
</P>
<P>
   So the campus set is a tricky market for retailers. Tricky but
temptingly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The latest census data shows that in 1998 a record 9.4 million
students under age 25 were enrolled in American colleges.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall 1999 semester, the average student spent around
$343 a month on various retail purchases, according to a Student
Monitor survey of 1,200 undergraduates. After food and
entertainment, top spending categories were toiletries and school
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, those students each spent about $23 a month on
toiletries. By region, that figure varies from a low of $22 in the
South and Midwest to a high of $27 in the West. For school
supplies, the average is $21 monthly, from a low of $18 in the
South to $28 in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of students surveyed had a major credit card
in their own name.
</P>
<P>
   And they really like stuff.
</P>
<P>
   They are students like Amit Ray of Houston, a sophomore studying
computer science at Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station. His
dormitory essentials? ``I gotta have my microfridge, microwave, TV,
stereo system, computer, cordless telephone and digital answering
machine,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the attention of these young and enthusiastic
consumers, the manufacturers and retailers have to be -- and be
aware of what is -- cutting-edge cool.
</P>
<P>
   One store that has done a good job, in Weil's opinion, is the
discount chain Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is regarded as so hip in the student market,'' he said.
``It was the kids that first started calling it `TarJAY.' That has
a cache to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``hip factor'' must come from the kids themselves. ``Nobody
in the student market has more credibility than another student,''
Weil added. ``The power of buzz can build or destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies look to the Ridgewood, N.J.-based Student Monitor and
The Gut, a trend publication in South Hadley, Mass., to tap into
the latest buzz on everything from shower accessories to room
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   And, in turn, The Gut turns to a network of trend spotters out
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tap into people we call `style makers,' who are always
ahead of the mainstream,'' said Gut Editor Jennifer Grow. ``Like
those out on the fringe. The skateboarders and surfers in
California, for instance, they're the ones credited with starting
more than 50 percent of trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal prints probably were big with style makers as far back as
two years ago. ``Since that's hot right now, that's it for them,''
Grow said. ``They're not interested in that anymore, it's
overexposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, what's selling well with students is anything that
helps get more stuff into their small dorms, tiny apartments or
minuscule fraternity and sorority rooms, and keeps that stuff
organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a small, confined space, and they have nowhere else
to go,'' said Kate Danaj, research director at Teenage Research
Unlimited in Northbrook, Ill. ``They study, eat and sleep there.
They don't get to put much into it, so they cram in as much as they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   New this year at Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond is a khaki-colored ``cargo
pocket'' for accessible storage that tucks under a mattress and
hangs down beside the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The national retailer also is partnering with MTV, the music
video cable giant. ``The MTV dorm towel has a Velcro pocket,'' said
Amy Susskind, a spokeswoman for Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond. ``Students can
put their room keys or ID in the pocket on the way to the shower,
so they won't lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers also must think differently to pitch products. One
approach is a technique called ``chalking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a big chunk of chalk and you write an ad or slogan on
sidewalks around campus,'' Weil said. ``Very low-tech but visceral.
Kids think that's very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies attract student attention with elaborate
entertainment. During the spring 1999 semester, Hilfiger Toiletries
sponsored a Music Madness College Tour with bands Babe the Blue Ox,
the Interpreters and Trinket. While kids listened to tunes, they
snagged samples -- and purchased products.
</P>
<P>
   Just when a merchandiser manages to get the attention of
students, one-quarter of them graduate and a new bunch floods in --
each with their own ideas as to what's hip.
</P>
<P>
   Jane McCarthy, who coordinates The Gut's network of style makers
and trend spotters, predicts a likely trend: the marketing of
reality TV products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like MTV `Real World' accessories, those cool lamps and funky
bedspreads on the show,'' McCarthy said. ``Kids are talking about
those furnishings. They really like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest buzz.

`VIRTUA TENNIS' CAPTURES JUST ABOUT EVERY NUANCE OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aside from, like, pool and bowling, tennis is probably one of
the most difficult sports to reproduce for the video-game crowd _
namely because, like pool and bowling, the sport is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo is just about the only one to make a decent stab at
tennis, and you probably don't even remember it: ``Mario's 3D
Tennis'' for the company's now-defunct Virtual Boy system. The
three of you who bought it know what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega, doing whatever it can to get you not to buy a
PlayStation 2, has successfully ported its ``Virtua Tennis'' arcade
title to its Dreamcast system, and it's gonna take a P2 title to
beat this thing.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind ``NFL 2K'' and ``NHL 2K,'' ``Virtua Tennis'' (Sega
for Dreamcast, all ages) is the latest Sega Dreamcast sports game
to perfectly capture just about every nuance of that particular
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk this up to the graphics, which are so well-detailed, if
you walked into a room with this on, you'd swear you were watching
TV. Even the crowds, which are notoriously flat as wallpaper, have
depth and dimension to them.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the realism, there are eight players to choose from,
all of whom are based on real-life tennis athletes, such as Cedric
Pioline and Tommy Haas. Hopefully, someone's heard of these people.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing is John McEnroe throwing a tantrum and
cursing at the line judges. Maybe next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution 2: Far Off Promise'' (UbiSoft for Dreamcast, ages 13
and up) is yet another game in an increasingly long line of titles
that look like they'd be cool for little kids but are more suited
for teens.
</P>
<P>
   In this role-playing game, players man Mag Launcher, who must
choose whether he wants to be the world's greatest adventurer or
save his best friend. Hmmmm _ world's greatest adventurer? Wouldn't
you get, like, free food and chicks? What friend?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mag decides to save his friend. Which means you must
fight a bunch of bad people and get in all sorts of the usual RPG
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But ``E2'' is actually executed very well, and doesn't have that
right-traffic-lane-slow gameplay that dogs most RPGs. The graphics
are nicely illustrated, too, with two camera modes and a 3D-based
battle system.
</P>
<P>
   With alcohol consumption and tobacco use going on, though,
parents need to be wary. This isn't Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Parents will, however, undoubtedly love Disney's latest string
of education PC games, titled ``Disney Learning.'' There's three in
the series, aimed at different age levels: toddler, preschool and
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Players participate in a variety of skill-building games, from
finding hidden letters to creating and coloring objects. The games
enhance basic learning skills, like learning math and abstract
thinking. Shoot, ``I'' should be playing these games.

RIGHT TOUCH, AND TOP, FOR ESPRESSO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Penn., Wash.)  By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicholas O'Connell worked like a surgeon, his movements small,
precise. He reached for his tools, handled them like crystal and
was so quiet he barely seemed to breathe. His task complete, he
changed roles. He looked up, his suit still crisp, every blond hair
on his head in place. His inner host emerged. And he handed me his
masterpiece: a cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   A real one, like those you can find in train stations in Italy.
Thick, creamy, so evolved that sipping is an impossibility. The
cappuccino goes down in a long, charged stream.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it different? Excellent beans and equipment, surely,
but also an acute sense of what a good cup of coffee should be. But
more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, 29, works for La Colombe Torrefaction, a coffee
roasting company and cafe in Philadelphia. Dressed like a banker,
he travels to New York several times a week to visit restaurants
like Ducasse, Jean Georges and Daniel, among others. He makes sure
their coffee machines, which they buy from him, are in order and
meticulously clean, that the restaurants don't overgrind their
beans and that the staffs' technique stays honed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell is a detail man. Since the flavor of the water used is
so important to good coffee, O'Connell also checks on the
restaurants' filtration systems. Likewise, he tests brands of milk
and recommends his favorites to the restaurants. (In New York, he
likes Marcus Dairy Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Call him a technician or a consultant. But O'Connell is really
more a prophet, spreading the philosophy of his boss, Jean-Philippe
Iberti, who founded La Colombe in 1994 with Todd Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
   Iberti, 33, came to the United States from France in the late
1980s to study flight engineering in Seattle but ended up working
for a coffee roaster there. He liked the business and decided to go
out on his own. He chose Philadelphia because warehouse space could
be rented cheaply and because ... well, because there was no good
coffee there.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a small cafe on 19th Street near Rittenhouse Square.
It is a spare room with high ceilings and just a few tables and
wood chairs. The croissants are usually sold out before noon. Then
it is just coffee, Iberti's way. Double mocha skim lattes with no
foam are discouraged. But you can get an espresso whose flavor will
stay with you all day. ``The product is first,'' he said. ``The
customer is second.''
</P>
<P>
   The beans, which Iberti buys from growers all over the world,
are blended before being roasted gently, 15 minutes as opposed to
the typical five. The result, in an espresso, is a small shot that
is light and caramelly, with bitterness and acidity that are
deliberate but quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells five varieties of beans by mail order for
$9.55 to $10.45 a pound. The minimum order is one pound, and
shipping is $4; (800) 563-0860.
</P>
<P>
   La Colombe cafe sells 1,500 cappuccinos and lattes a day, and
that is where the flair comes in. The milk is steamed so that it
becomes dense and creamy, with almost no distinction between foam
and milk. It is not merely poured on top of the espresso, but
fashioned to look like a feather, a leaf, a heart or a minimalist
grouping of lines.
</P>
<P>
   La Colombe only recently began taking on restaurant clients
outside Philadelphia. In addition to New York, they are in Boston
and San Francisco. That's where O'Connell steps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' he said, ``is not the technique, but to
teach people to take their time and pay attention to their
senses.''
</P>
<P>
   And learn what a good cappuccino is. One must taste, taste,
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we do is make them a great cup of coffee,'' he
said. ``If they can develop a taste, they can remember what it
should look like and the way it should be.''

INSURANCE COULD BE A PET OWNER'S BEST FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aja was a present to mark Candace Alley's first wedding
anniversary, so when the kitten became ill, no amount of money was
spared to restore her to health.
</P>
<P>
   Alley and her husband eventually spent nearly $1,000 on
treatment for Aja's liver and kidney ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington, Texas, couple has no regrets. But like many pet
owners _ and a growing number of employers _ they have become aware
of the money they could have saved if they had carried pet
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As employers in North Texas and across the country take notice
of the emotional connection between employees and their four-legged
companions, a growing number are including pet insurance as part of
their benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a trend toward providing this type of
coverage to employees,'' said Bill Gorman, regional director of
business development at Veterinary Pet Insurance, which offers the
policies. ``We have now around 200 corporations from all over the
country, but the people that love us are the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, who was in Phoenix recently to work out a pet-coverage
deal with Best Western International, said that with the economy in
such good shape, more companies are looking for extra benefits to
lure employees and keep the ones they have. ``It really doesn't
cost the corporations, except administrative work if they are going
to do payroll deduction,'' Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   While Veterinary Pet Insurance has been around since 1982, it
only recently began expanding its client base to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To date, clients are as varied and far away as Colle &AMP; McVoy, a
marketing and PR firm in Minneapolis and as close as Accor Economy
Lodging in Dallas and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a very good, positive response,'' said Lena
Morgan-Vega, human resources assistant at the cancer center, which
began offering the benefit about 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the center's 350 employees have taken
advantage of the coverage so far, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hettlinger, director of human resources at Colle &AMP; McVoy,
said his firm began offering the coverage in June, splitting annual
premium costs with employees who choose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a half-dozen of our employees have signed up so far, but
I know that that's going to pick up,'' he said. ``We just
introduced it a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies provide the coverage through Veterinary Pet
Insurance, which is based in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage is primarily marketed through veterinary hospitals,
but pet owners can also sign up by calling toll-free at (800)
USA-PETS or enroll online at www.petinsurance.com, said Rebecca F.
Lewis, VPI's vice president of marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great features about our coverage is pet owners can
visit any vet worldwide; they can also go to vet specialists
without any pre-authorization,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more pet owners are finding out that insurance is
available,'' Lewis said, ``they are taking advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   What's changed in recent years, she said, is the growing number
of employers who offer the coverage through benefits packages and
recognize the role a pet plays in a family and also the positive
effect pet ownership can have on employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be competitive, corporations need to provide more
attractive, comprehensive benefit packages,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking at Colle &AMP; McVoy, said Hettlinger and Riff
Yeager, senior vice president at the integrated marketing
communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a chicken-and-egg sort of thing, but we tend to
attract people who love and own pets because they know we're so
prominent in the category. Pets are near and dear to our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said that more than 70 percent of their employees own
pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets are highly regarded as members of the family, and in some
instances even preferred over other members, and pet owners will go
into substantial debt to care for the health of their pets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said that Colle &AMP; McVoy initially pursued Veterinary Pet
Insurance as a client. It was during talks between the companies,
he said, that the firm learned how relevant pet insurance was to
its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a natural fit to sign up for it ourselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   VPI, which covers only cats and dogs, has more than 1 million
policyholders, including policies purchased through corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The premium is based on the pet's age and the plan selected.
Gold plan holders can insure their pet for $97 per year. Costs
start at $179 a year for the Advantage Plus plan, VPI's maximum
benefit plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two plans cover the same items,'' said Lewis. ``The only
difference is the premium and the level of reimbursement to owners.
For example, with the Gold Plan, we will pay up to $9,000 a year
and with the Advantage Plus plan, the maximum benefit is $14,000 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The plans cover everything from accidental injury and illness to
vaccinations to routine care, skin rashes and ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   Alley recently purchased a plan for a second cat, Mia, but opted
not to cover Aja because of her age. Still the coverage, she said,
had to be purchased individually because her husband's employer
does not offer the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   If it did, she said, her family would jump at the chance to
cover their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important,'' said Alley. ``If you don't
have insurance, you can spend a lot of money to keep the pet
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia's coverage costs Alley about $11 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only used it three time since signing up in March, but
they're really prompt in processing claims,'' said Alley. ``We've
probably saved $70 so far, but I expect to get virtually all of our
money back the first year.''

SANTA FE PRESENTS A CRAFTFUL `RIGOLETTO' &HT;    (Photos available from
http://www.santafeopera.org/PressPhotos/PressPhotos.htm.)
 &HT;    By CHARLES WARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Two eras are intersecting _ seamlessly, it
appears _ at the Santa Fe Opera. That bodes well for the United
States' premier summer opera festival.
</P>
<P>
   General director John Crosby, who founded the company in 1957 in
the once serene desert hills outside the state capital, will pass
the reins to his long-groomed successor, Richard Gaddes, at the end
of the current season.
</P>
<P>
   The season is currently at its peak, with five operas playing in
repertoire through next week. They vividly illustrate the
exceptional variety that is this company's signature, from the
American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ``Venus and Adonis'' to
Monday evening's crowd-pleasing ``Rigoletto'' of Giuseppe Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe gave Verdi's story of a court jester, his sheltered
daughter and a sex-addicted nobleman a strong new production. It
featured exquisite sets and direction by Danish designer Mikael
Melbye (cq) and first-class singing, capped by the Gilda of soprano
Elizabeth Futral.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic core of the opera is the way that a curse
insinuates itself into the mind and life of Rigoletto, jester in
the court of the Duke of Mantua.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke, a libertine par excellence, has seduced Count
Monterone's daughter. When Rigoletto mocks Monterone, the count
curses him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Rigoletto sees evidence of the curse everywhere. Courtiers
kidnap his daughter, Gilda, believing she is his mistress, and take
her to the palace. After the Duke seduces her there, she tells her
father that, at church, she had previously met the Duke disguised
as a poor student and fallen for him.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Rigoletto seeks revenge, fate spoils his plan. He pays
Sparafucile to kill the Duke but the assassin's sister, Maddalena,
(cq) also falls under the ruler's spell. She persuades her brother
to kill someone else _ Gilda, who returns to the siblings' lair
determined to sacrifice herself for her lover.
</P>
<P>
   As a character, Rigoletto seethes. He deeply loves his daughter,
the only joy in his life, and desperately shelters her from the
Duke's lust. He grieves for his dead wife, refusing to talk about
her to Gilda. He hates the court for its disdain of the jester's
art.
</P>
<P>
   All this emotion is, of course, in the music for Verdi's first
masterpiece _ but it wasn't present in the portrayal by baritone
Kim Josephson. As with Eddie Carbone in last fall's Chicago
premiere of William Bolcom's ``A View From the Bridge,'' he created
Rigoletto through craft, not passion.
</P>
<P>
   His craft Monday was notable. He offered a handsome voice, a
richly detailed characterization and a thoroughly prepared
performance. Yet his Rigoletto never teetered on the dark edge of
blind emotion, as the character must.
</P>
<P>
   Futral's Gilda, by contrast, connected with the character's
inner life. The soprano used her light, almost silvery sound
virtuosically in ``Caro nome.'' But the famous aria was even more
memorable because Futral made Gilda's naivete and head-over-heels
love for the Duke so real.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when she emerged from the Duke's bedroom, Gilda was a
changed person _ her innocence gone, her hopes shattered. The shift
of mood was compelling, especially compared to the antiseptic ardor
of tenor Martin Thompson as the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   As Sparafucile, bass Raymond Aceto (cq) presented the
character's dark morals with the same emotional reality as Futral.
So did the evening's Maddalena, mezzo-soprano Beth Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   The last act, where the five major characters interact, was the
evening's highlight, with excellent singing and tense drama.
</P>
<P>
   Melbye's staging was consistently taut. His set, dominated by
arches and columns in a simple Italian Renaissance style, rotated
to show the court, Rigoletto's house and the street outside it, and
Sparafucile's inn. Though the playing areas were often small, he
used them well.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, conductor Richard Buckley's propulsive yet supple
accompaniment made the famous Act Three quartet _ Rigoletto, Gilda,
Maddalena, the Duke _ a top-notch ensemble piece.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the evening, the orchestra provided the musical
foundation for a fully gripping drama, no matter how familiar to
the seasoned listener. An emotionally ravaged Rigoletto might have
sparked it.

 &HT;    ``DANGEROUS'' HOSPITAL BEDS LACK STANDARDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death certificates have a grim sameness going
back a decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, usually a woman over age 60, rolls over in a
hospital or nursing home bed and becomes entrapped in the space
between the side rail and mattress. Too frail or too disoriented to
free herself, she suffocates.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 200 people, and almost certainly many more, the
beds that were supposed to protect them turned into death traps.
Dozens more people have been seriously injured when they tried to
climb over the railings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who first began to recognize the problem in the
early 1990s, have issued warnings and advisories to the nation's
health care facilities. But they have yet to establish safety
standards for the beds and railings.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the frustration of experts in the field, deaths and
injuries have continued.
</P>
<P>
   In the period between the first safety alert issued by the Food
and Drug Administration in August 1995 and late May of this year,
federal records show at least 28 deaths across the country. Florida
and Minnesota had the most, with four reported deaths each.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety commission has also recorded
dozens of injuries, including more than 30 cases during the first
five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The actual numbers are thought to be much higher, since federal
reporting rules are laxly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that were reported, a 74-year-old woman in Sunrise,
Fla., became wedged between the bed rail and mattress and was
asphyxiated in June of last year. A 78-year-old man in Minneapolis
died after his head became trapped between the mattress and side
rail last December. And in 1997, a 29-year-old woman in Lubbock,
Texas, was found suffocated in her home after she became stuck
between the mattress and rail of a hospital-type bed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the alarm over hospital beds and side rails is
perplexing to families of patients, said Sarah Burger, an advocate
for nursing home residents. ``There's been an acceptance that bed
rails were there for safety,'' she said. ``There's been a lot of
rethinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But not enough, according to Burger, who works with the private
National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. She noted
that the federal government set standards more than 25 years ago
for cribs to keep infants from trapping their heads between the
side rails.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade after problems surfaced for the elderly,
government agencies are still debating what to do about hospital
beds and even who bears the responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bed frame and rails are labeled ``medical devices,''
they are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).
</P>
<P>
   However, the mattresses are often the major contributing factor
in these tragedies. Facilities often buy replacement mattresses
that are too small for the bed frames, leaving a gap where patients
can become trapped and asphyxiated. And because mattresses are not
considered to be medical devices, they fall into the domain of the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the issue, an inter-agency federal working
group was set up 15 months ago that includes FDA officials, Health
and Human Services Department officials, and private experts as
well as industry representatives. No members from the safety
commission were included.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we've mostly been focused on the bed and bed
design,'' said Joan Todd, an FDA consultant who is working with the
working group. She said that ``it is our intention'' to seek help
from the safety commission later.
</P>
<P>
   The working group has no target date for proposing new safety
standards, Todd said. She blamed the slow progress on a lack of
funding and added, ``I think they're doing a great job, because all
these people are volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member was more critical. ``The FDA panel was supposed
to come out with a final report in December of last year,'' said
Dr. Steven H. Miles, a geriatrics professor at the University of
Minnesota, who is credited for being one of the first to spot the
dangers of hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eight months later, and these deaths have been occurring
for a very, very long time,'' he said. Miles, who left the panel
for an unsuccessful race for the U.S. Senate, accused manufacturers
of ``having an undue influence'' in delaying action.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would be hard pressed to identify another device that has
caused (as many) deaths where the industry has not been forced to
come up with a design modification,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said many facilities are taking more precautions, but he
traced the improvement more to recent lawsuits by angry families
than to government efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pioneering attorneys in this area, Jeff E. Rusk of
Austin, Texas, four years ago won a $900,000 award and promises of
reform from a New Mexico nursing home, plus $4.5 million from the
bed manufacturer, Everest &AMP; Jennings of Earth City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Rusk later reached a settlement that reduced the bed maker's
payment in exchange for a promise to send out thousands of warning
letters to customers detailing the potential dangers of using rails
for weak or confused patients and urging the use of more padding.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas attorney has also taken the case of 71-year-old Sarah
Hitz, who died at Boca Raton's Manor Care nursing home in November
of 1996. The lawsuit in Palm Beach County's Circuit Court charges
the nursing home with ``gross negligence'' for allowing her to
become trapped in her bed rails.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by her son, Alexander Hitz of West Palm
Beach, cites two prior such incidents in the chain of more than 300
facilities run by HCR-Manor Care Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the case but said
that the company's current policy is to perform ``an assessment on
all patients'' and use side rails only when ordered by a physician.

   Hewing to the carefully calculated script of moderation,
tolerance and outreach, speakers on the second night of the
convention will also include Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in Congress, Condoleezza Rice, the black
woman who is Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, and Elizabeth
Dole, the former Cabinet member who briefly ran for the GOP
nomination. Former Presidents Bush and Ford will take the spotlight
in a convention tribute to former Republican presidents. Nancy
Reagan was flying in from California to stand in for her husband,
Ronaldday. At the event, Clinton suggested Bush's campaign message
was: ``How bad can I be? I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was
president. I owned a baseball team. They like me down there. ...
Everything is rocking along hunky dory. Their fraternity had it for
eight years, give it to ours for eight years.'
</P>
<P>
   MAKING ITS LIST AND CHECKING IT TWICE
</P>
<P>
   With control of Congress up for grabs this fall, Republicans are
sending an unmistakable message to political action committees who
are thinking about hedging their bets by writing checks to both
parties. The GOP fund-raising arm for House candidates has created
a 75 Percent Club for special interests to find out who's been
giving too much money to Democrats. What is the 75 percent? A
requirement that political action committees give three-quarters of
their contributions to Republican candidates _ or they might not
get their calls returned. ``They've got to make a decision of how
they are going to help their friends and who their friends are,''
said Rep. Thomas Reynolds of New York, one of the committee's key
fund-raisers. Fred Werthheimer, head of Democracy 21 and an
advocate of reducing the influence of money in politics, criticized
the tactic, saying, ``This is taking it to a new level, from the
selling and buying of access to the political extortion level where
your access may be cut off if you don't pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   A TEMPEST BREWING
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney's discomfort with the media's interest in her
lesbian daughter, Mary, televised nationally over the weekend,
threatens to ignite the first firestorm of the so-far superbly
scripted Republican convention. On Sunday, when ABC's Cokie Roberts
started to ask the GOP vice-presidential candidate's wife about
having a daughter who has ``declared she's openly gay,'' an irate
Lynne Cheney shot back: ``Mary has never declared such a thing.''
The controversy could bubble over this week, since friends of Mary
Cheney - who has publicly declared herself a lesbian and has worked
as the gay and lesbian corporate relations manager for Coors
Brewing Co. - say she's planning to bring her life partner to the
convention.

JOE GUERRA LEAVES HIS GAS STATION TO LEAD THE GOP IN PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE &HT;    By SUSANNA McBEE
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Joe A. Guerra, 66, of Laredo, Texas, still can't
believe it, but on Wednesday night he will lead some 22,000 people
at the Republican National Convention here in reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra, a gas station operator, a city councilman and a
Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city on the Texas-Mexico
border, said in an interview that being chosen by his party to lead
the flag salute ``is an awesome thing for me. I've never been
before such a big crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Guerra, known in Laredo for his strongly held
views against big government, was chosen to lead the Pledge began
with the patriotic festivals he and his family hold each July 4 for
close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cookouts,'' he said. ``We sing patriotic songs, raise
the flag and give speeches about the sacrifices of the Founding
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra said that Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, whose district
includes Laredo, heard about the cookouts last year and asked if he
could send a camera crew to the family's 1999 July the Fourth
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Guerra knew, the Republican National Committee
had used the footage from the cookout in an ad ``that ran on all
major TV networks several months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of the ad, said Guerra, ``was to portray the party as
being more inclusive, to show that it is reaching out to
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Then party officials asked him to appear at the convention and
help open the Wednesday night session. The national committee flew
him to Philadelphia Tuesday and agreed to put him up for two nights
in a downtown hotel before he returns to Texas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra said he won't mind missing a few days of work at his
Exxon station, where he takes pride in getting car windshields
spotless and making sure the tires and oil and transmission fluid
levels are OK.
</P>
<P>
   Operating a service station wasn't his father's first choice of
a career for him.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra recalled that after he graduated from St. Mary's
University in San Antonio, his father wanted him to be a dentist.
``But I just couldn't do it,'' he said. Instead, he went into
business, supported his eight children, and saw them succeed.
``Thirty years after I graduated, my daughter Maya graduated from
St. Mary's, and now she is a dentist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra said he and his family share a number of beliefs promoted
by the Republican Party, including personal responsibility, self
reliance, and the idea that the federal government should be used
as a last, not a first, resort.
</P>
<P>
   Of his night in the GOP spotlight here, he said, ``I feel very
proud to have been chosen. I'm thrilled and excited. But it's kind
of humbling. I don't think I deserve it.''

 REVISING MADAME MAO  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do you know the difference between a traditional opera and a
Madame Mao opera?'' Anchee Min, addressing an audience packed into
the reading room at Boston bookstore, proceeds to demonstrate.
While singing the traditional Chinese opera, she stands still at
the lectern, smiling gently, her voice preternaturally high.
</P>
<P>
   Then she shifts gears, donning a military cap, a remnant of the
Shanghai native's Chinese film studio days. Min's petite body comes
alive as she launches into propaganda-spewing action. Her face
glows, her arms freeze in a variety of heroic poses, her voice
deepens as she determinedly sings:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I fight for victory/
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't stop fighting until all my wishes come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance is Min's unique way of promoting her new book of
historical fiction, ``Becoming Madame Mao.'' The novel, which has
been popping up on bestseller lists in San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and Boston, tells the tale of Jiang Ching, the wife of Chinese
communist leader Mao Tze-tung.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which The New York Times Book Review praised as
``compelling and penetrating,'' is an intriguing profile of a
second-rate actress who molded herself into different characters to
please each of her four husbands (Mao was her last). Jiang finally
created her idealized self during the Cultural Revolution of
1966-76: a strong female protagonist who starred in the ballets and
operas she herself developed.
</P>
<P>
   After Mao's death in 1976, Jiang was imprisoned. Blamed for the
nation's suffering during the Cultural Revolution _ a topsy-turvy
time when intellectuals were vilified, traditional values were
attacked, and hundreds of thousands of people were killed _ Jiang
was denounced as a ``white-boned demon,'' a character from Chinese
history fingered for destroying powerful men.
</P>
<P>
   Although Min never met Jiang, the latter had Min plucked from a
labor camp to star in a film about Jiang's life. Before the
director had even shot a scene, Jiang was thrown in jail and Min
was denounced for her association with the fallen leader.
</P>
<P>
   In her best-selling 1994 memoir, ``Red Azalea,'' Min recounted
her journey from a Chinese film studio to a Chicago art school
(aided by her friend actress/director Joan Chen). With ``Becoming
Madame Mao,'' Min offers a revisionist view of the complicated
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Mao's the god, Madame Mao is the demon,'' says
Min during an interview at a Boston hotel. ``Here you start to see
the complexity of this woman, an early feminist caught up in Mao's
personal political will.''
</P>
<P>
   To paint this new portrait, Min jumps from first person to third
person, separating historical fact from the fictitious tales woven
both by Jiang and by the Chinese government that sought to vilify
her. She humanizes Jiang by packing the tale with enough sex,
betrayal, and political intrigue that it could double as a
bodice-ripper.
</P>
<P>
   Min includes a reference list of 19 biographies about Jiang,
Mao, and their associates. ``She just wanted to make clear that
this book had stuck to the facts,'' explains the book's editor,
Anton Mueller of Houghton Mifflin. ``And that there were more
accurate psychological and sociological ways of looking at Madame
Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   Min's strong opinions in ``Madame Mao'' and ``Red Azalea'' have
angered many of her countrymen. When she appeared on a
Chinese-language talk show in the United States recently, callers
complained: You are not the only one who suffered during the
Cultural Revolution, one said. Who gave you the right to shame
China by telling your and Madame Mao's story?, another asked.
</P>
<P>
   The response to Min doesn't surprise Ross Terrill, an expert on
China who's written biographies about Mao and Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Min is a ``resolute and passionate and maybe somewhat
egotistical person, the way she told her story of growing up and
suffering in the Shanghai area,'' says Terrill, who has reviewed
``Red Azalea'' and ``Becoming Madame Mao.'' ``She is like Jiang
Ching in that controversy and strong opinions would attach to her
like iron filings to a magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has only helped make Min stronger than a Madame
Mao opera heroine. ``I'm not like Dr. Li (Zhi-Sui),'' says Min,
referring to Mao's personal doctor, who wrote the 1994 biography
``The Private Life of Chairman Man.'' ``He got criticized,
denounced by his country, (had a) heart attack, died _ paid his
life for it. They're not gonna kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Min says this, her wide-set eyes are fiery, her voice is
raised for emphasis. Her skin is the color of golden wheat, and she
mentions several times that she doesn't have the porcelain
complexion and almond-shaped eyes that pass for Chinese beauty
these days. ``I'm really considered ugly today,'' she says in
English that wavers between fluid and fractured.
</P>
<P>
   When Min gets excited or nervous, her native language suddenly
fills her head, she says, and her English falters. It's something
her 8-year-old daughter, Lauryann, teases her about, along with
Min's knack for getting lost on the highways of Los Angeles, where
she now lives with her second husband, Lloyd Lofthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Min credits Jiang for providing the women of her generation with
strong female role models, for helping them see that they weren't
blades of grass meant to be stepped on _ as Min's Madame Mao was
told growing up. But Min doesn't shirk from showing the negative
side of a desperate woman who fought for Mao's waning attention
through murder and deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone to feel sorry for her,'' says Min, ``but I
demand an understanding so I can set the historical record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comprehension is necessary, Min believes, because many
Chinese are still living in denial when it comes to the Cultural
Revolution. Autobiography after autobiography has emerged, written
by people who blame Madame Mao for their woes. They ``don't have
the guts to say, `OK, I am a part of this criminal act,' '' says
Min. `` `I am guilty.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me eight years to reform myself, to say, `I am
responsible,' '' continues Min, who credits active ``Oprah''
watching while learning to speak English for helping her evolve.
``And I think we need that to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Min was 7 when the Cultural Revolution started. To evade the
beatings by neighborhood bullies that she received regularly
growing up in what she calls a ``middle lower class family'' _ both
her parents were teachers _ she embraced the ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to survive, you want to be the most powerful,'' Min
explains. ``To gain power is to be an ardent Maoist.''
</P>
<P>
   Min learned Mao's poems and won a district competition for her
efforts. Suddenly ``no one wants to beat me anymore,'' she says.
``Of course I chose society over my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Min's mother constantly shamed Min for her choices. ``She
would beat me until I passed out to set me right,'' says Min.
</P>
<P>
   The punishments didn't deter Min from causing great pain to
friends in the name of the Cultural Revolution. As a schoolgirl,
she denounced her teacher, causing the woman's exile.
</P>
<P>
   Min then volunteered to go to a labor camp in the distant
Chinese countryside, where hunger was a daily ordeal and the
bathroom was a maggot-filled outdoor pit. For Min the camp will
always be the place where she discovered the body of her friend,
Little Green, who had drowned. It is an experience she still speaks
of in a tremulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   Min says she and others had encountered the girl having sex with
her boyfriend at a time when relationships between men and women
were discouraged. The boyfriend was executed; Little Green, who
under political pressure had accused him of rape, went mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living with the guilt all the time,'' says Min quietly.
``We were responsible for her death. There's no way you can repair
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about such shattering experiences now help Min earn a
comfortable living in her adopted country. She does so with a
writing style that melds buttoned-down English with what her editor
Mueller describes as ``the flavor, some of the humor, and a lot of
the poetry of Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   One ``Madame Mao'' passage reads: ``She describes herself as a
radish pickled in the sauce of misery.'' Another goes, ``I am not
afraid of death if I know my spirit will live through the tip of
your fountain pen to the lips of the people, generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But before writing her way into this sunny final chapter, Min
spent several dark years in Chicago with her first husband, a
Shanghai native. The family lived in a neighborhood where white
teenagers crudely propositioned Min and a black man threw a rock at
her husband. The couple ultimately divorced because of her
husband's Taoist religious views.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes so deep that he thinks that to be born is a
tragedy,'' says Min, who yearned for a more positive life for
herself and her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now ensconced in a suburban home writing full time, Min is
living her version of the American dream with Lofthouse, a Vietnam
veteran who works as a high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identify with Lloyd because he qualifies to be a communist,
he's so devoted,'' says Min warmly. ``I said, `Gee, you find this
American who suffered through war and . . . still has this idealism
and dreams of a better life, better society.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Min uses her pen to achieve her own idealistic dream of writing
Chinese history from a woman's point of view. A memoir about her
teenage years will soon be published. Then comes another historical
novel, this time about the empress dowager, another strong woman
whose 50-year rule in the 19th century has been maligned by some
historians who say she brought opium to China and murdered her
husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, says Min. And she'll prove it by using historical
documents, just as she did to re-tell Madame Mao's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found there was no other way to do it as a woman,'' says
Min, leaning forward intently. ``I would be known as the
white-boned demon . . . if I did not have the documents backing me
up.''

<P>
   It's a wonder no one ever thought of it before. For years,
commercial bakers have baked their pies and tarts, their panettones
and sweet breads in disposable paper pans. That saves them
thousands of miles of shelving that would otherwise be crammed with
metal pans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these paper pans are becoming available to home bakers, who
have even tighter space constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Made of specially treated paper, the pans come in all shapes,
including tubes and muffins. They are inexpensive and attractive,
with gold and silver designs embossed on a brown background. You
could take a cake in one of these pans to a dinner party or give
bread in them as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   And you would never have to clutter cabinets with extra metal
pans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as appealing as they sounded, my first response was
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   How can you possibly bake in paper without something metal to
help it hold its shape? Won't the paper collapse? Won't the batter
run out and leak all over the oven floor? Will the cakes and breads
develop the same kind of crust as they would in a metal or glass
pan?
</P>
<P>
   More daunting, the paper pans come without directions, because
they are designed for the commercial market. I had no idea whether
I would have to adjust baking temperatures or need to grease and
flour the interiors.
</P>
<P>
   I got some help from La Cuisine in Alexandria, Va., one of a few
shops to carry the pans. Stephanie Gorenflo, who works there and
does the experimental baking, advised lowering the baking
temperature 10 to 15 degrees to compensate for the color of the
paper, which makes the food brown more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with 8 pounds of butter, 10 pounds of sugar, 10 pounds of
flour and assorted nuts and dried fruits, I began testing.
</P>
<P>
   In all, I made 12 cakes, two dozen muffins and a dozen popovers
in the paper pans and in my own metal pans. With two exceptions,
all the cakes, breads and muffins worked in paper. In most cases, I
would have been hard pressed to tell the difference between them
and those baked in metal. The muffins were actually taller and
prettier in the paper cups than in the tin. And tube cakes, which
are sometimes hard to unmold, were easy to deal with: peel off the
paper and serve. No chunks clung to the pan, as they so often do
with metal.
</P>
<P>
   I tried zucchini and blueberry quick breads, which have heavy
batters, as well as layer cakes made with different densities of
batter. I wanted to try an angel food cake, but no paper pan had
sides high enough. But they came in far more shapes than disposable
pans made of foil.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-duty pans, pleated like cupcake papers, but more
finely, all have tiny holes in the bottom for quicker and more even
baking. The bread pans have larger holes. The pleating adds
strength to the paper. The bottom of the pan is glued to the sides,
and the sides have one large seam where the paper is joined.
</P>
<P>
   While the paper pans are obviously not as rigid as metal, they
are firm enough to move from countertop to oven. Their contents all
baked beautifully and browned evenly as long as I reduced the
temperature; otherwise, the cake was brown before it was baked.
</P>
<P>
   But a very liquid batter leaked through the side seam in one of
the pans. Batter from an orange nut cake began to drip and sizzle
almost immediately, so I placed the pan I was using inside another.
That stopped the dripping.
</P>
<P>
   Popover batter was far too heavy for the paper muffin
containers. Almost immediately, the popovers fell on their sides
and made such a mess they would eventually have set off the smoke
detector.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the pans had to be greased and floured if a
recipe called for that.
</P>
<P>
   The paper sides also peeled away easily from the cakes and
breads. When they didn't on one cake, I simply cut off the sides
and left the cake on its paper bottom. No one would ever know.
Also, if you like, as I do, to bake multiples of a cake or bread,
you don't have to purchase and store a half-dozen metal pans. The
pans can also be put in the microwave to warm muffins or breads.
</P>
<P>
   Paper pans range from 50 cents to $1.70 each and are available
in several shapes and sizes at Zabar's on Broadway at 80th Street,
(212)787-2000. They are also available by mail from La Cuisine,
(800)521-1176, and from Sur La Table on the West Coast,
(800)243-0852. &QL;

RESTAURANT RESTROOMS: BEHIND THE `M' AND THE `W,' A NEW STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To Stephen Lyle, fixing up the bathrooms at his new
restaurant, Village, was less a chore than an archaeological dig.
The chef and his aides carefully stripped and chipped away layers
of plaster and drywall to unearth the ancient subway tile, dating
from the 1920s or '30s. The phone-booth-size marble stalls were so
small that they had to be expanded in the women's room. A tiny
window in the men's room, looking down from the building's second
story onto Ninth Street, had been boarded up. They restored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was choosing the space, one of the things that sold me
on it was these funky old bathrooms,'' said Lyle, who had been at
Odeon for many years before opening Village this summer. It is no
longer enough for bathrooms to be ``just functional.'' Like
restaurateurs all over the city, Lyle believes that bathrooms ``are
definitely a kind of definer.'' They are, he said, ``a statement
about your personality, about who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stern, the manager at Village, offered a more basic
assessment: ``The urinals are pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Polite dinner conversation now includes such observations. You
go to a new place to eat, you talk about the food, the service, the
decor . . . the bathroom. The loo experience has become as
important to the people who design restaurants in New York as
gleaming, steaming open kitchens were in the '80s. No building
material is too obscure, no plumbing detail below notice. Not
terribly long ago, a conversation pissoir was still a novelty. You
had Phillipe Starck's men's room waterfall in the Royalton. You had
Bar 89 in Soho, where the glass doors shift from transparent to
opaque _ as long as the user remembers to turn the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, no new restaurateur dares to opt for cheap generic tile or
unimpressively domestic fixtures. Porter's New York in Chelsea has
shoe-polishing machines. At Fun, in Chinatown, you can see what's
going on at the opposite sex's sink on a little video monitor.
Communal sinks outside the men's and women's rooms are part of the
scene at restaurants like Commune. Attendants are also back in
action, directing diners to door No. 1, 2 or 3 at Thalia,
Guastavino's and, more surprisingly, Vandam downtown _ or wearing
black tie and offering mints and towels at Shelly's New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so that a good bathroom could be an incentive to
return to a restaurant, a bad one a reason never to darken its
stalls again. The Zagat Survey's ``New York City Nightlife 2000''
guide includes a listing of ``cool loos.'' Even a Lower East Side
boite like Oliva has compact, design-conscious bathrooms: walls
done in a blue wash, oval mirrors, original tile on the floor, lily
in a vase filled with green grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did them in blue because of the seafood,'' said Eduardo
Fontan, an owner. ``The idea was that the inside would contrast
with the outside.'' The dining room is as spare as the bathroom is
ornate.
</P>
<P>
   The food is Basque, but the woodwork on the bathroom doors has a
Moroccan flavor. Fontan, who is from Madrid, used to own a
furniture repair shop on Orchard Street, so the work was not
difficult for him. Still, when was the last time you saw custom
woodwork on a bathroom door?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Klein, the general manager of AZ in the Flatiron district,
said, ``I'm a big bathroom guy, and I think ours are pretty cool.''
They were designed by Grant Koerner of Untitled Inc. in the
building that once housed the club-restaurant Flowers. The big,
pitched skylight over the center of the dining room is echoed by a
smaller one in the bathroom. The sink is a transparent glass bowl
with metal trim. And the glass mosaic tile on the floor seems to
change color from every angle. The door is marked with a
gender-progressive ``U.''
</P>
<P>
   New York bathrooms used to be characterized by their cramped
confines and malodorous atmosphere. Larry Bogdanow, of Bogdanow
Partners Architects, traces the expanded notion of bathroom space
to the Americans With Disabilities Act. Passed a decade ago, it
requires new restaurants to provide at least one bathroom large
enough for a wheelchair's turning radius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurant bathrooms were really tight 10 years ago,''
Bogdanow said. ``I find that the extra space is also useful.'' In
the women's room at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, he put a lounge with a
banquette. In both the men's and the women's rooms, the handicapped
stall contains a changing table and a sink, making it almost a
private bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most avant-garde toilettes around are at the
Brasserie. Designed by Diller &AMP; Scofidio, a firm known for
breathing only the most rarefied air of high architectural theory,
the Brasserie bathrooms were as rigorously conceptualized as the
rest of the supermodern space. The men's and women's rooms are
divided by a wall made of Panelite, a translucent plastic. But they
share a sink, an amber-hued, cast-resin trough that runs through
the wall. On the mirror above the sink in the men's room it says,
``WASHISTOPURGEISTODENYIS-TOWASHIS.'' The women's side has a
similar message.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that ``purge'' is not a desirable word to
display above a sink in a New York bathroom. But Liz Diller, one of
the partners of the firm, explained the thinking: ``It has to do
with different aspects of cleaning oneself,'' she said. ``And the
relationship between sin and dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   How much time did she and her colleagues spend worrying about
the bathroom? ``A lot,'' Diller said. ``It's one of the most
potentially interesting spaces in any kind of public space. There
is all kinds of shame associated with bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rockwell, never shy about calling attention to his
restaurant designs, thinks of himself as a pioneer in the bathroom
department. His most recent creation is New York Strip, a
steakhouse opening next week where Asti used to be, at 13 E. 12th
St. Previously, the room's major decor feature had been 8-by-10
glossies of opera singers. Many of them will survive, but the
overall look has been revised to Euro bordello.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference room of his Union Square offices, Rockwell
showed off the materials used in the bathroom: red glazed subway
tile, red glass balls for the sconces, shaded with red
leopard-print fabric.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a black-and-white photograph of a naked woman,
who did not resemble an opera singer. Rockwell said mildly naughty
pictures like it would adorn the stalls in both men's and women's
rooms. He promised that their subjects were authentic French and
German women from the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have one or two memorable things in the
bathrooms,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that diners notice these things during their rest
stops. Laureen Barber designed Blue Hill, the small ground-level
restaurant on Washington Place, for her brother-in-law, Dan Barber,
the chef. She is a graphic designer, and this was her first
restaurant. She was surprised to find that ``when people heard I
was doing Blue Hill, all they wanted to talk about was the
bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the overall design, the unisex bathroom is a
haven of warm, dark tones, with one deep red wall and a greenish
slate countertop, on top of which sit two low-wattage lamps and a
few candles deployed to achieve maximum flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Practical concerns have been dealt with, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 comment was that the wastebasket should be in close
proximity to the door,'' Ms. Barber said. That was from the women.
Men, she said, wanted a hook for their jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The wastebasket-by-the-door thing is a hygiene issue. Some
diners evidently want to be able to turn the door handle with the
towel, then do the germ-phobe's version of a slam dunk, tossing the
prophylactic paper or cloth on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Hygiene is also Shelly Fireman's reason for having attendants in
his large, busy restaurants. At Shelly's New York, which replaced
the Motown Cafe on 57th Street, men and women he calls bathroom
valets solicitously offer towels, mints and combs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in pathologically clean bathrooms,'' Fireman
said. ``I don't know any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of response does he get to his omnipresent valets?
``It's a subliminal response,'' he said. ``Nobody finishes a meal
and says: `Wow! You've got a great bathroom!'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they do now.

   The one-dimension charm of Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M ($30;

You're a soldier, soldier, and bugs are the bad, bad enemy. When
they come at you, blast them. First-person shooters live and die by
the level of adrenaline they deliver, and this one is just
unpardonably dull. If the model for the game was the film
``Starship Troopers,'' Acclaim failed to notice that things get
more interesting when you're battling hundreds or thousands of bugs
rather than two or three. The graphics are pretty crummy, too.

   Playing the role of a hero who roams a magical fairyland in
search of artifacts that enable him to rebuild an entire world from
scratch is not as easy as it sounds. In Legend of Mana ($50;
www.squaresoft.com; for the PlayStation), the sequel to Secret of
Mana, the feat is almost impossible unless you have all afternoon
to get set up. Then, and only then, does the game become even
mildly coherent. Persist and soon enough you'll find yourself
enthralled, travelling from land to land, fighting monsters,
collecting goodies, conversing with strange creatures. The graphics
are strikingly beautiful and make up for the mind-bending drone of
repetitive scene-based theme music. All in all, if you have plenty
of time and an open mind, Legend of Mana will keep you pleasantly
occupied.

this medieval tale and you, lucky boy or girl, get to target
specific body parts when facing opponents. Climbing a fairly steep
learning curve is rewarded by plenty of replayability _ you can't
even get into all areas in the game unless you've run through the
whole thing several times.

   An epic Real Time Strategy game that sold like hotcakes in

North America with a bang. Boasting superior graphics and sound, as
well as intricate but flowing ``all-terrain'' gameplay with an
eight-person online multiplayer component, even those not fond of
meticulous resource-hoarding and management of traditional RTS
games can get sucked into this one. A global warfare premise
ranging across air, land and sea _ plus the ability to take the
fight underground with an innovative ``subterranean warfare''
feature _ makes Earth 2150 a thing of vision and scope. The
``potentially'' possible scenario offers insanely aggressive
science fiction elements blended with traditional war machine
mobilization (robots and ray guns, tanks and helicopters). This is
Armageddon-is-nigh-so-let's-move-to-Mars gaming at its finest.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bearing in mind that Apple veritably coined the
phrase ``user friendly,'' it follows that the iMac DV Special
Edition (SE) ($1,500; www.apple.com) offers everyperson home
computing at its finest. Bundled with an easy, yet detailed
tutorial and a formidable suite of basic computing tools (Internet
browser, e-mail, desktop publishing, graphics editing), the iMac DV
SE's crowning feature is it DVD-ROM drive and the immensely popular
iMovie software, a video editing/moviemaking application for the
home movie enthusiast. Complete with trademark ``FireWire,''
digital video transfer hardware normally sold separately (and at
notable cost) for Windows-based PCs, the SE is a forward-thinking
computer in that it does not accommodate analog video, the more
familiar camcorder format fast on its way to becoming obsolete.
iMacs are inherently less expandable than PCs, though more
adaptable in these later incarnations, yet with specific users and
hobbyists tackling specific home computer tasks, the iMac DV SE is
just what a great many new-to-the-modern-era folks are looking for:
scaled down, professional-caliber computing that brings the
``friendliness'' back to user-friendly personal computers.

</P>
<P>
   I've been using the new IBM T54 flat panel monitor ($979;
www.ibm.com) for the past two months and it's going to be hard to
give it up. The color quality is so close to a conventional, boxy
monitor that I often forget the thing is only two inches thick.
Most impressive, the color is just as vibrant when viewed from an
angle. IBM says it consumes less power, generates less heat and
produces fewer magnetic emissions than a standard monitor. It also
takes up far less space. All of those tangible benefits
notwithstanding, the biggest reason I like the 15-inch T54, the
least expensive of IBM's new flat panel line, is that it simply
looks cool. It's entirely black, with sharp edges and a sleek
stand. But you've still got to pay more to be techno-hip. The price
may make it tempting for some (retail prices of flat panels are
finally dipping below $1,000 this year), but it's still a little
too rich for my blood. I can probably stand to cope with my boxy,
if decidedly 1990s-looking, monitor, for a little while longer.

   BARBECUER'S DECK HAND
</P>
<P>
   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill Pad ($25 to $40
depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little more than a pad
of thick, felt-like material coated in colored concrete. But it's
big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch rounds) to protect
the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from the garden hose.

`AMERICAN HIGH': GENUINE, UNENHANCED TEEN-AGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their puppyish faces alone are enough to show that the students
in ``American High'' are not actors. In television dramas the
supposed teenagers (especially the boys) have the chiseled features
of professional actors in their 20s, a fact conspicuous everywhere
from ``Dawson's Creek'' to the summer series ``Young Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``American High,'' the 14 seniors who were filmed
throughout their last year of high school have the
out-of-proportion features of adolescents. It's not baby fat we're
seeing but the soft, unformed look of people who have not quite
grown into their faces.
</P>
<P>
   That is only part of what makes this documentary series the
least contrived and most realistic of reality programs. When camera
crews weren't following the students, their self-made video diaries
took over (the two forms blend fluently on screen). These
middle-class suburban students, from Highland Park High outside
Chicago, were not dealing with explosive issues of crime or
survival but with the inner turmoil of working out relationships
and getting into college. ``American High'' is serious, expertly
crafted, often poignant, yet disappointingly predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Its flatness may be the most illuminating aspect of all: on the
realistic side, it demonstrates that we already know a lot about
the inner lives of teenagers; on the dramatic side, it suggests how
expectations have been shaped and inflated by movies and series
targeted at teenagers and by other so-called reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   The series was made by R.J. Cutler, a producer of ``The War
Room,'' about behind-the-scenes maneuvers in the 1992 Clinton
presidential campaign, and a co-director of ``A Perfect
Candidate,'' about Oliver L. North's campaign for the Senate. In
theory the same pulling-back-the-curtain aspect should inform
``American High,'' but there is not much to surprise teenagers or
their parents here.
</P>
<P>
   These students are self-aware and articulate as they confront
their typical problems. Robby and Sarah have been dating for two
years, and she is terrified of what will happen when he goes away
to college. With a poignant mix of self-awareness and naivete, she
says, ``I'm scared for myself 'cause I'm a kid still. I've just
turned 17 and I've already found the love of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of scenes she and Robby lie on a bed (clothed), in
intimate yet hardly shocking moments. In this high school version
of pillow talk, they discuss his going away. ``I'll have to teach
you how to do laundry,'' she says. In the most dramatic scene,
Robby's friend Brad reveals that he is gay. Robby is surprised,
though quickly accepting. Brad is later seen at a group meeting for
gay and lesbian students. These are not trivial issues, but in our
confessional culture they are familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the most outrageous of the students, begins the series
with a rant to the camera (with one word bleeped out): ``These are
the years when you're supposed to be wild, blame it all on your
parents or society, not have to suffer consequences, have
unprotected sex, go do drugs, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol.''
His mother interrupts to tell him to quiet down, but he goes on:
``These are your teen years but what are you sitting at home having
to do? Homework.''
</P>
<P>
   The raucous, attention-seeking opening does not truly set the
series' tone. By the end of Wednesday night's two back-to-back
episodes, Morgan has gotten a part-time job helping to coach
gymnastics for disabled young people. He thinks he may want to
teach them as a career.
</P>
<P>
   No one would wish him to be more self-destructive, but it would
have made a livelier story. That's what we have come to expect from
both fiction and reality shows. ``Dawson's Creek'' has included an
ex-convict, drug-dealing father; the entertaining ``Young
Americans'' is even more melodramatic. (Now halfway through its
eight-week summer run, it will be shown Wednesday night at 9 on WB,
directly competing against ``American High.'') The setting is an
exclusive boys' school near a working-class New England town. In
the first episode, the rich, handsome and preposterously named
Scout Calhoun (Mark Famiglietti) falls for the local girl who works
at the gas station, Bella Banks (Kate Bosworth), only to find that
she is his father's illegitimate daughter. That puts a nasty crimp
in the romance. As Scout's roommate wryly says, ``It's socially
unacceptable to date your sister.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oedipal tangle makes the major subplot seem tame: a girl
masquerades as a boy to enroll at Rawley Boys' Academy. ``Young
Americans'' is fun in a soapy way, but it has struggled in the
ratings. Maybe viewers want a bit more attachment to reality than
this.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want a lack of drama. MTV's flourishing ``Real
World'' may feature real-life players, yet they are cast by the
show's producers and placed in a situation _ living and working
together _ contrived for maximum volatility. It's not quite the
real world; it's reality enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer overloaded with shows that turn fake ``reality''
into a game, from the insanely popular physical challenges on
``Survivor'' to the already annoying mind games on ``Big Brother,''
``American High'' is more genuine. But that is not enough to make
it scintillating. The show may inadvertently point out that
pseudorealism and explosive emotions are the kind of escapist
entertainment viewers really want.

CONFIDENCE, CAUTION, AND CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ John McCain is the GOP's designated hitter, the
biggest stick in the party's batting order when it comes to winning
over undecided, unpersuaded and swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   He swings his lumber lustily when it comes to bashing the
Democratic presidential candidate. A thousand times this year he
has vowed to ``beat Al Gore like a drum.'' But if McCain's
Vietnam-era buddy John Kerry is tapped to fill out the Gore ticket,
McCain says he'll rachet down his anti-Democrat rhetoric, out of
respect for the Massachusetts senator.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would not be sufficient reason for Gore to move
Kerry's name to the top of the short list. But neither is it
chopped liver. Short of George W. Bush himself, McCain is the
biggest drawing card on the GOP side, and the single most
influential politician with undecided voters floating around in the
middle of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner party Sunday for some media types, the Arizona
senator breezily acknowledged that his regard for Kerry would
override his let-'em-have-both-barrels attack mode. ``I have the
utmost respect for John, based on work we did together on the
Vietnam-POW issue of the years.'' As decorated Navy officers, one a
flier shot down and imprisoned, the other a river assault boat
commander assigned to forays on ground and water level, the pair
have worked closely across the partisan divide on a number of
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   And in the political calculus worked out at Gore headquarters in
Nashville, Kerry's pluses are adding up impressively. Younger and
more telegenic than Dick Cheney, Bush's choice, Kerry is a veteran
courtroom prosecutor, a brainy debater who got the best of Bill
Weld after nine impressive hour-long TV debates in their
heavyweight Senate fight. Kerry can wonk policy, and he can
wind-surf, and his boosters make the case he helps in Pennsylvania,
the King of Swing States. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz, was married
to the late Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, and the
Heinz name and the foundation she heads are popular brands in the
Keystone State.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's five-month stint in Vietnam and Kerry's Silver Star
combat record make an exploitable counterpoint to the lack of
Vietnam service by either Bush (a truncated term as an Air National
Guard pilot in Texas) or Cheney (deferments kept him out of the
military). Cheney should be Kerry's equal on handling tricky
questions about complex issues. But Cheney's spotty health record _
three heart attacks and a bypass operation _ underscores doutbs
about his stamina, energy level and capacity to handle a grueling
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Kerry to his ticket would give Gore a big-city urban
Roman Catholic, a demographic nod to 50 million US Catholics, not a
few of whom were put off by Bush's clumsy handling of questions
about religious intolerance after he made his infamous South
Carolina primary appearance at Bob Jones University. McCain has not
forgotten how Bush's campaign savaged the Arizonan there. Nor has
ex-New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman, a McCain ally.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Rudman got choked up when they formally turned
over the McCain delegates to Bush, a ceremony reminding the
loyalists of Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Lee kept his sword and
his horse, Traveller; McCain gets to keep his Straight Talk Express
for perhaps the next war. McCain plays the good soldier now, saying
all the right things about Bush. But there's no love lost between
McCain and the Bush clan, even though the Bush Juniors and the
McCains will camp out this month at McCain's Arizona hacienda. If
Bush stumbles in November, the McCainiacs have their battle bus
ready to roll again in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush associates speculate privately that Junior chose
Cheney because the Wyoming businessman would not ``stand in the way
of Jeb Bush'' should the Florida governor try to repeat what his
older brother fell short of pulling off. The mood here among
Republicans is one of confidence, caution, and control. They think
their man will win, if they just don't blow it. The ``iron fist''
convention approach is working.

<P>
   Nobody's allowed to mention abortion, Monica, impeachment, Newt,
Ken Starr, or any other controversial wordset. Opening Night was a
panoply of artfully calibrated inclusionism, capped by Colin
Powell's very effective speech defending affirmative action and
needling ``lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with
preferences for special interests.'' Even the lobbyists, winking
and laughing, enjoyed that one, as they lubricate their way through
the GOP with cash and cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton can jeer about how Bush is trying to ``blur, blur,
blur,'' and Hillary Clinton can grump about ``political amnesia.''
But the Bush game plan is working here, at least, and Gore better
not blow this vice presidential deal. Maine's ex-Senator George
Mitchell would give him another Northeast Catholic with stature to
match Cheney's gravitas, and it would not cost the Democrats the
Senate seat Kerry would have to forgo if they won. Massachusetts
voters view Kerry as Ted Kennedy's junior partner, but Kerry could
give Gore some of the pizzazz he lacks now.

WHAT'S A TALMUDIST DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By FRANZ LIDZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a scene in Barry Levinson's 1987 film ``Tin
Men'' in which a bunch of aluminum-siding schleppers sit around a
diner, ``Broadway Danny Rose''-style, talking television westerns.
One salesman complains that ``Bonanza'' is not an accurate
depiction of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever see the show?'' he asks. ``It's a 50-year-old father
and three 47-year-old sons. You know why they get along so good?
'Cause they're all the same age.''
</P>
<P>
   A second salesman demurs. ``I'm not an authority like you are,''
he grumbles, ``but I occasionally watch `Bonanza' and I think it's,
like, how can you believe there's a man who got three kids by three
different wives and they all died at childbirth?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Musta been a hell of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Musta been the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't get much breakfast-booth banter in the four Hebrew
horse operas being screened Tuesday night at the Jewish Museum in
Manhattan. Billed as ``Wild Wild West: The Jewish Experience,'' the
program comprises hourlong TV oaters with Jewish themes, including
a 1963 episode of the historically dubious ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want audiences to look critically at the way Jewish
ethnicity has been represented on TV,'' said Andrew Ingall, the
museum's broadcasting archivist. ``The Jewish characters on these
shows are basically stereotypes. But then, all four teleplays are
products of their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though these gunfights at the Oy Vey Corral address every
nonsecular issue from anti-Semitism (``Gunsmoke'') to intermarriage
(``Little House on the Prairie''), their leaden lyricism (``She
awaits us, our farm, like the Sabbath bride, scented and
anointed'') is leavened by very little Jewish humor.
</P>
<P>
   You hope the episode of ``Gunsmoke'' will show Marshal Dillon
conducting a Seder in the Dodge City jail, or Doc performing a
barroom bris, or Kitty getting bat mitzvahed in the Long Branch
Saloon. What you get is a stilted story line about the clash
between frontier justice and Talmudic law, which makes no
allowances for circumstantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Marshal Dillon (incredulously): Three men are running around
loose that murdered your boy and you're standing here playing with
words?
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Gorofsky (pedagogically): Words! Some we live by, and some
we must die for.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Jewish TV families facing these problems is ruled by
a bearded Yiddisher with an accent as thick as pumpernickel and
syntax as twisted as kugel noodles. ``A man tell me the ground in
Dakota is black like swamp and fat like grease and there are no
bosses,'' says Papa Kleinfeld in a 1954 Philco Television Playhouse
production. ``There are not enough people for there to have
bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Each patriarch is a stern, intractable scholar who knows God on
a first-name basis. ``He's a wise sage trying to preserve Jewish
values _ honesty, devotion, compassion _ while surrounded by
immoral outlaws,'' observes the comic Jackie Mason, an expert on
Jewish Westerns by virtue of numerous appearances on ``The Ed
Sullivan Show,'' a CBS neighbor of ``Gunsmoke.'' ``Today, it would
be like an Old World rabbi arguing with Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   These Jewish fathers have brought their familes to the New West
to escape the pogroms and harassment of the Old East. Exodus
parallels are drawn so freely, you feel like you're in a Leon Uris
novel. The Philco Playhouse narrator intones: ``Papa led us out of
Chicago like Moses freeing the children of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Moses, a little blood is spilled _ in this case, Papa's.
Shamed by his wife's reluctance to assimilate with other
``greenhorns'' of the 1850s, Papa Kleinfeld stomps out of the
homestead and beds down on the plains, where he promptly burns to
death in a brush fire.
</P>
<P>
   What Papa's hard work didn't accomplish, his sacrifice does.
Mama embraces the idea of 1950s ecumenicalism and holds a prairie
Passover service. Among the guests are a Norwegian and a Native
American in full headdress _ a sight only slightly less incongruous
than the appearance of a Yiddish-speaking Indian chief in Mel
Brook's ``Blazing Saddles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, multiculturalism was valued by the liberal
Jewish community,'' Ingall said. ``Jews wanted to participate in
the same rituals with some boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonanzologists still debate the boundaries of the Ponderosa,
though most agree Ben Cartwright's ranch must have been roughly the
size of Mesopotamia. In the episode under consideration, the
traveling salesman Aaron Kaufman and his Jewish mother of a
daughter camp at the spread for the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa, you always do nothing,'' scolds his daughter. ``The
world spills scalding hot soup all over you, and you stick out your
tongue and lick it and say, `Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the wandering Jews are held up by outlaws, Papa holds his
tongue. Defying his Old Testament teachings, he becomes a kind of
Billy the Kibbitzer, popping off the bandits as easily as if he
were shooting lox in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got 'em both, Kaufman,'' Adam Cartwright says. ``That's
pretty good shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good shooting?'' says the angst-ridden peddler. ``I killed two
men!''
</P>
<P>
   No such moral qualms afflict the avenging farm boy Richard
Dreyfuss played a decade later on ``Gunsmoke.'' Gershon Gorofsky
confronts his brother's killers with a shotgun and threatens to
blow them away. ``The show was filmed shortly after Israel won the
Six Day War,'' Ingall said. ``Dreyfuss' feisty farmer reflected the
New Jew _ the young, macho Israeli filled with ethnic pride and
willing to take the law into his own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason does not argue this point. He does dispute the farmer
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews in the Wild West did not generally own farms or
ranches,'' he contends. ``Jews have never been into that line of
work. OK, so there used to be some Jewish chicken farmers in
Jersey. Maybe because they didn't have to lift nothin' heavy or get
dirty. But very seldom did you see Jewish ranchers or Jewish
cowboys. It was almost always a Gentile riding the horse or poking
the cow or flying from the trees. As soon as a Jew got dirt on
himself, he sold the ranch.''

HOW MODERN DESIGN REMAINS FAITHFUL TO ITS CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By   HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ In the absence of alternatives, there may be no more
important project under way in New York right now than David
Childs' restoration of Lever House, the International Style
skyscraper on Park Avenue at 54th Street. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft and completed in 1952, Lever House was the first glass
curtain wall tower to rise in New York. It remains among the 20th
century's major landmarks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lever House established Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill as the most
progressive firm in the postwar United States. Along with the
Seagram Building, the Guggenheim Museum, the CBS Building and the
United Nations headquarters, it helped make New York the leading
city for architectural innovation in those years. Childs became
chairman of SOM in 1990. His homage to Bunshaft is no mere
sentimental journey. The restoration, due for completion this fall,
is uncovering qualities that are becoming valued in architecture
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncommon Ground,'' a book by Thomas Leatherbarrow, should help
admirers of modern architecture to form a more precisely analytic
appreciation of those qualities. Leatherbarrow, a professor of
architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, also provides a key
for interpreting contemporary work, including recent projects by
Childs, Rafael Vinoly and Peter Eisenman.
</P>
<P>
   The book, due in October from M.I.T. Press, is a revisionist
work. It corrects the distorted view that modern architects were
insensitive to the physical context of their buildings. Focusing on
projects by Richard Neutra and two less well-known figures, Antonin
Raymond and Aris Konstantinidis, Leatherbarrow shows that
modernists did not regard building sites simply as blank slates for
inscribing their fantasies of a uniform, technological society.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he contests the notion that modern architects were
latter-day Vandals, intent on shattering the cultural continuity of
regional and urban life. Rather, the best of them adapted
industrial building techniques to the lay of the land. Modern
design mediated between prefabricated construction and local
topography. It reconciled the homogenizing nature of modernity with
regional differences. Its aim was to prevent the shattering of
continuity in the industrialized world, not to accelerate it.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Frank Lloyd Wright and Luis Barragan were not
the only architects who took landscape into account. Architects
like Neutra regarded the city as an evolving topography in which
landscape and successive layers of built form intersected over
time.
</P>
<P>
   But why use past tense? The International Research Institute for
Climate Prediction at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, completed earlier this year, perfectly illustrates
Leatherbarrow's ideas. Designed by Vinoly, the institute is the
most sensitively sited building I've visited since Tod Williams and
Billie Tsien's Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Both are
science buildings. Both command impressive natural, partially
urbanized sites. Both embody a conception of science as the culture
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly's project is in Palisades, N.Y., on a cliff-top site on
the west side of the Hudson. The institute's design is as serenely
elegant as its name is clunky. Almost Wrightian in its relationship
to the landscape, the institute is composed of two arc-shaped wings
that overlap at the center, forming a double-width lobby area at
the building's entrance. The roof is also designed as two pairs of
overlapping arcs. A clerestory between the arcs illuminates the
corridor that bisects the full length of the building's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbarrow writes that the modern relationship between
construction and topography is best seen in section (a cutaway
drawing), rather than in plan (from above) or elevation (from
outside). The institute's central corridor offers a walk through
this idea. The ground on which the building sits slopes gradually
down toward the north. The land has not been leveled off. This is
translated into the interior by flights of steps that break the
corridor into segments.
</P>
<P>
   Materials and exposed structure further integrate construction
and site. The corridor runs beneath an arcade of wood bow trusses
that support the roof and create an outside-in impression of trees.
Internal office windows, facing into the corridor, pull light and
views into the core. Bearing walls are made from the same local
stone that erupts in boulders from the ground outside. The arcs of
the wings and the metal roof echo contours of land and water.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leatherbarrow, the conflict between technological
progress and cultural continuity exists only in theory, not in the
real world of architecture. Vinoly's building proves the point. The
Palisades were formed 200 million years ago. One of the functions
of the climate research institute is to monitor the global warming
that could result in their submersion. Try that on for continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a review of Peter Eisenman's design for
the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, I wrote that
Eisenman's buildings should be seen as links between the history of
places and the history of ideas. At the site of a recent design for
a hotel on the Friedrichstrasse in Berlin, these two histories
already run closely parallel. The Hotel am Spree Dreieck is a
homage to two unbuilt Berlin projects designed by Mies van der Rohe
in 1921 and 1922. The two projects were Mies' first explorations of
the glass tower, a type that culminated in the completion of the
Seagram Building 37 years later. Eisenman's plan, situated on the
exact spot of Mies' 1921 project (no site was designated for the
1922 project), takes the International Style tower back to its
Expressionist roots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, Mies had yet to rationally integrate steel construction
into his skyscraper aesthetic. His Berlin towers were as much
Expressionist as they were modern. Eisenman has essentially
reversed the course of Mies' later development. His design uses a
scientific technique to arrive at an Expressionist result. The
design was generated by computer. Mies' two Berlin designs were
loaded into the software and morphed into a single, composite
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel combines the three-pointed star configuration of Mies'
1921 ground plan with the biomorphic contours of his 1922 scheme.
The result is indescribably sexy. As with Mies' projects, the
hotel's most prominent feature is the floor planes, stacked one
above the other like a theatrical multiplex of urban stages. It's
peek-a-boo time, not only for the hotel guests, but also for Berlin
and for Mies, its greatest 20th-century architect. The irrational
within the rationalist stands exposed. Eisenman's siteis the
history of modern architecture and of the role Berlin played in it
before Hitler came to power. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the Lever House restoration is
the repair of the glass curtain wall. The spandrel glass,
originally a uniform green, had become a random two-tone mix. But
the restoration should also open our eyes to the fact that
Bunshaft's design involved more than wrapping a pretty skin around
some steel and concrete. The building's importance lies with the
integral relationship between skin, structure and site. At Lever
House, skin and section are one.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of International Style towers along Park Avenue
south of 59th Street has been criticized for destroying Park
Avenue's sense of place. Precisely the opposite is true. The towers
revealed a deeper sense of place than the masonry buildings that
preceded them. Park Avenue is a feat of engineering: a viaduct for
cars suspended over the train tracks that run beneath. The machine
aesthetic of the towers raises this infrastructural dimension above
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed columns of Lever House punch through the thin crust
of sidewalk and convey the impression of stilts straddling the
subterranean tracks. The window mullions extend that vertical
thrust to the skyline. The tower's floating base and stacked floor
planes reveal that New York is a horizontal as well as a vertical
city. Each floor replicates the slice of ground beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the advantage it takes of sunlight, Lever House does
not reflect the natural topography of Manhattan. Rather, the design
adapts construction to the artificial topography of a city that has
evolved over time. Lever House itself is part of the city's
accretive nature. So is its restoration. Half a century after its
completion, we see the building with fresh eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When new, Lever House was received as a sign of progress,
socially and aesthetically. Office workers benefited from the
natural light and the clear, open spaces. The city gained from
being among the first to realize the utopian ideal visualized by
Mies and other modernists. These qualities are still evident. But
they are enriched by our awareness of a psychological dimension
underlying the modern forms. Park Avenue is a CAT scan of New
York's collective brain: our ambition, our exhibitionism, our
compulsion to build platforms for our ideas. The city is more
upfront about these urges than it was 50 years ago. In that sense,
Lever House can stand for progress still.

CANADIANS BUZZ OVER POSSIBLE SHIFT TO LEFT IN NEWSPAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A new media colossus rose north of the
border this week as Israel ``Izzy'' Asper _ a Manitoba entrepreneur
who already controls a hefty percentage of Canada's television and
radio stations _ acquired most of the country's leading newspapers
from Conrad Black, the Canadian-born, British-based press baron.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.3 billion takeover, the biggest media deal in Canadian
history, leaves Asper's CanWest Global Communications Corp., in
control of 148 newspapers from St. John's, Newfoundland, to
Victoria, British Columbia, including 13 high-profile dailies such
as the Ottawa Citizen, Montreal Gazette and Vancouver Sun.
Moreover, Asper and Black will split control of Black's Canadian
flagship, the Toronto-based National Post.
</P>
<P>
   The deal hatched between two of Canada's most colorful and
ideologically contrasting moguls leaves Asper in control the
country's biggest multimedia empire, one marrying Black's
newspapers, trade magazines and Internet companies to Asper's slew
of broadcast outlets, telecommunications outfits and entertainment
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``CanWest has all but cornered the market on the gathering and
dissemination of news in this country,'' Christopher Dornan,
director of the Carleton University School of Journalism and
Communication in Ottawa, wrote in the Globe and Mail newspaper, one
of the very few front-rank Canadian papers left without ties to
Black or CanWest.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction was seen by financial analysts as the first step
by Black's company, Hollinger Inc., to sell nearly all of its 350
newspapers across North America to boost its dormant stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the buzz across Canada Tuesday focused less on the
long-range implications of the megamerger of print, broadcast,
entertainment, and cyberspace media than on the outsized
personalities at the heart of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Asper and Black are Canada's two most flamboyantly recognizable
media tycoons, and both are passionate aficionados of politics with
nearly opposite views. So it seemed a strange twist that the
takeover deal stipulates that Asper and Black's Hollinger Inc. will
share control of the National Post, launched only in 1998 yet
already one of Canada's most influential newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Asper, 67, is a brash, chain-smoking jazz lover who grew up in a
community of Russian Jewish immigrants in Manitoba and whose first
job was scraping gum from under the seats of his father's movie
theater. He's known for his left-of-center political views as well
as an almost eccentric devotion to his home city of Winnipeg. He's
kept CanWest based in the gritty, much-faded former railroad hub
while nearly every other major Canadian corporation maintains head
offices in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary or Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 56, raised a child of privilege in an English-speaking
enclave of Montreal, is an urbane Anglophile who makes his home in
London, hangs out with Margaret Thatcher and William F. Buckley,
rules his print fiefdoms from a chair that once belonged to his
greatest hero, Napoleon, and has never hestitated to use his
newspapers to flog his conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   If the upstart National Post _ Black's proudest creation _ has
gained a reputation for aggressive reporting, sleek design and
stylish writing, it is even better known as the nation's most
prominent trumpet of the political right.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring over the Post's future editorial stands seemed to start
almost instantly, with Asper pointedly telling a news conference
Tuesday that the newspaper will express ``a balanced point of view
on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   For some journalists, the departure of Black comes as a relief.
``The heavy hand of Conrad Black will not be felt as much as it has
over the years,'' said Alexander Norris, a veteran reporter with
the Montreal Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surprise takeover appeared to signal the end of
an era in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with archrival Rupert Murdoch, Black is the last of the
old-style press barons whose newspapers were inseparable from their
own swaggering personalities. Inspired by a biography of William
Randolph Hearst, Black purchased a stake in a tiny Quebec newspaper
after being expelled from university in the early 1960s, and has
since stuck to newspapering _ obviously relishing the power and
punch of controlling his own presses.
</P>
<P>
   Asper is undoubtedly a character, but his corporation, CanWest,
is basically just another colorless media conglomerate and it's
certain that he sees newspapers as just another product, not a
passion. The main focus of the company will remain television and
radio; it controls dozens of stations not just in Canada but in
Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Black will retain newspapers around the world, including the
London's Daily Telegraph, the Jerusalem Post and the Chicago
Sun-Times. But the sell-off to Asper represents a dramatic
eclipsing of his empire.
</P>
<P>
   While Asper and his son, Leonard Asper, president and chief
executive officer of CanWest, held jubilant news conferences, Black
uncharacteristically disappeared from public view _ on vacation,
according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   His only public thoughts, so far, on the deal were expressed in
an interview with the National Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a retreat, but it is substantially a
departure,'' Black told the paper. ``We have said for a long time
we had an overexposure in Canada. You'll hear less of me, but I am
not leaving and I will not go completely silent.''

   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: After an
evening projecting an image of a party that welcomes women,
minority groups and immigrants, the Republicans are poised to

party that embraces and promotes military strength. Tonight, the
podium will be dominated by war heroes: Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
former Sen. Bob Dole and Sen. John McCain. But the underlying
message is the same: The Republican Party under George W. Bush is
united behind a single message, relentlessly disciplined and
focused on taking the White House.

JAPAN'S SOFTBANK CANCELS PLAN TO SELL SHARES IN 5 SUBSIDIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Softbank Corp., one of the world's largest investors in
Internet start-up companies, abandoned a plan Tuesday to sell
shares in five of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank said it made the decision because of potentially costly
tax consequences from such sales. But there was speculation that
Softbank abandoned the plan partly because its own share price has
fallen more than 70 percent this year, and that a spinoff might
have made the company even less attractive to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been criticized by investors and analysts, who
argued that it would further muddy Softbank's accounting, confuse
investors and create conflicts of interest between the company and
the subsidiaries. ``I think they realized they were going to have
trouble selling these companies, especially for the price they were
looking for,'' said Thomas Rhodes, an Internet analyst at Nikko
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiaries are basically clusters of Softbank investments
in electronic commerce, publishing, online financial services and
software.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was that Softbank had intended to use the proceeds
of the sale to finance its portion of the purchase of Nippon Credit
Bank, an insolvent bank taken over by the government during the
height of the Japanese financial crisis of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank, together with Orix Corp. and Tokio Marine &AMP; Fire
Insurance Co., plans to spend 80 billion yen, or $730.6 million at
current exchange rates, for an 80 percent stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank must sell some piece of its Internet empire, which
spans investments in 400 companies, to finance its part of the
purchase. Largely a giant venture capital fund, it has almost no
revenue. In the past, it has sold bits of investments in Yahoo,
Trend Micro and Softbank Technology to raise money to finance its
operations and make further investments.
</P>
<P>
   The bank deal has come under heavy criticism from politicians,
who object to what they consider overly favorable terms for the
buyers. Last week, the government postponed the sale of the bank,
which was to have been concluded Tuesday, by one month in hopes of
increasing political and public support. Softbank and its partners
had threatened to walk away if the government tried to renegotiate
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hideyuki Aizawa, the newly appointed head of the
Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency responsible for
overhauling the banking system, said the deal would go through as
originally planned. ``It's better to keep the existing policy
toward the NCB deal,'' he said. ``We basically won't change the
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment may have contributed to the first rise in the
benchmark Nikkei stock index in five sessions. Investors have been
worried that the Japanese government has lost its appetite for
financial reform, but Aizawa's commitment to completing the sale of
Nippon Credit Bank under the original terms, despite his personal
objections to allowing companies other than banks into the banking
industry, seemed aimed at alleviating those concerns.

A DAZZLING FORT WORTH HOME WITH A HOLLYWOOD PAST IS UP FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The long, low, white house on Ridgehaven
Road stretches out along the property like a Matisse odalisque.
There is no overt recognition of the street, no porch, 2-story
front door or flowered sidewalk. Yet, there is something special
about this house. It is different from the neighbors', more
glamorous, more secretive.
</P>
<P>
   The house has a history that features William Haines, the
notorious Hollywood designer, actress Joan Crawford and the Kimbell
Art Museum. It is a beautiful example of mid-20th century
architecture. The street facade only hints at the glories that can
be seen from the 15th green of the Ridglea Country Club golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Scheneker is the reason this houses exists.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Edmund, built it in 1952, but it was Polly
who had the vision and the Hollywood connections. During the
Depression, Polly came to Texas from California, where she had been
the private secretary for Laura La Plante, one of the goddesses of
the silent screen. Polly was friends with many in the film colony,
and she ran with the fast crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After Edmund made his fortune in oil transportation, it came
time to build Polly's dream house. She called on Haines, a friend
from her Hollywood days, and together with Fort Worth architect
Jack Schutts, they created the sleek contemporary house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought about building that house for a long time. She
knew what she wanted,'' says Schutts, who was fresh out of the Army
and architecture school at the University of Texas. Polly's house
``was one of the first things I ever did.'' Now he is a principal
at the Fort Worth-based firm Schutts Magee and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Haines, though, had been around. He was a silent film star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, he was the major money-making star for MGM, and one of
the few who could insist that his name precede the movie's title.
By 1931, Louis B. Mayer, coming under increased pressure from
critics, was tightening the reins on his sexually wayward stars.
Haines, who was openly gay, was always in Mayer's sights. In 1933,
Mayer began issuing ultimatums: If Haines didn't give up his
significant other, Jimmy Shields, Mayer would terminate his
contract. Haines, who refused to play the Hollywood game of
arranged marriages and publicity dating, said no. His career as a
star was over, but his relationship with Shields lasted 47 years
until Haines' death in 1973. Shields passed away soon after in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Haines was not schooled in interior design, but he had an innate
sense of style, a luxurious, exclusive, expensive one. When roles
ceased to come his way, his former leading ladies began
commissioning him to do their homes. Joan Crawford was one of the
first. Constance Bennett, Claudette Colbert and Carole Lombard
became clients. So did director George Cukor and studio head Jack
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The Haines look was eclectic. He liked combining European
antiques and chinoiserie, pale colors and leather walls. He was the
first designer to champion the placement of telephones in
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   He found the trick to pleasing actors was to place mirrors
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He was also cruel. He put bad lighting in the dressing areas.
Crawford would fix her hair and makeup under ghoulish lighting
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Haines said, ``I told her if she can make herself look good in
that light, she'll look good anywhere,'' reports William J. Mann,
author of ``Wisecracker; The Life and Time of William Haines,
Hollywood's First Openly Gay Star.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, when Polly Scheneker imported Haines to Fort
Worth, Haines' sphere of influence had moved beyond the film
community, and he was coaching Betsy Bloomingdale and Nancy Reagan
in the niceties of California social climbing and power decorating.
</P>
<P>
   Haines created magic for Polly. Entering the house is a dynamic
experience. The modest, dark front door pushes open to reveal a
light-drenched room that seems to swoop toward the golf course,
plainly visible from the back wall of glass. The room grows
lighter, brighter and bigger as you enter.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   This animation of space is enhanced by the blurring of outside
and in. There is indoor landscaping. Huge tropical plants that
scrape the ceiling are growing from rectangular planters in the
floor. The plants seem to have bullied their way inside from the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indoor sprinkler system is built in, so is the radiant
heat under the marble floor. Everything about the house was ahead
of its time,'' says the Schenekers' daughter, Courtney Edwards, who
lives in Dallas. ``Mother was always ahead of her time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the living room walls is upholstered in a rough-textured
ivory silk, and it forms the background for the low built-in sofa
and shelves, still there, exactly as Haines envisioned them. Like a
Frank Lloyd Wright house, there is little need for furniture _ what
is not built-in seems superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   The room is a stage. It is no accident that the fourth wall is
glass. Haines knew his clients expected to be the center of
attention. They are the players, and they are as important as the
view.
</P>
<P>
   During the Schenekers' reign, it was certainly true. ``Polly was
always good fun. She was always planning something. There were a
lot of parties,'' reminisces Annette Potts, a member of Polly's
circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Scheneker guest list encompassed both coasts. Joan Crawford
was often their house guest. Edwards remembers Brooke Astor and the
Douglas MacArthurs coming to party with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a stay with the Schenekers that Crawford left her
mark on Fort Worth lore. Local designer Terry Crane remembers
``the'' incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew she was coming to the deb party at the River
Crest Country Club,'' he says. ``Tout le'' Fort Worth was in
attendance. ``It was when The Assembly ball was the big event,''
Crane continues, ``everyone was waiting for Joan, and the hours
ticked by and she didn't come and she didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, a white moving van pulls up to the front door
of the club. A moving van! The back rolls up and there is Joan,
standing in the middle of the van holding on to a strap connected
to the ceiling. Her dress was too big for the limousine, so she had
herself delivered to the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford stayed with the Schenekers, until, according to Crane,
an unfortunate name-calling incident took place on the dance floor,
and Crawford moved out of the Scheneker house and into the Western
Hills Hotel. She dated Sid Richardson for about a month after that,
says Crane.
</P>
<P>
   After the Schenekers died in 1968, the house was sold to Jim
Meeker.
</P>
<P>
   It had a colorful run as a major party pad, then the Kimbell Art
Museum foundation bought the house for Ric Brown, the museum's
first director. Ted Pillsbury moved his family in when he took over
as director of the Kimbell in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love with the house, but I was uncomfortable being
a ward of the foundation, so I arranged to purchase the property,''
says Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there until 1987 or 1988. I thought it was beautiful,
architecturally, the space, the materials, the shell stone. It was
striking, a simple but striking design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pillsburys added the family room, connecting the kitchen to
the garage, swallowing up a side courtyard. The next owners, the
Richards, added a second-story master suite over the family room.
Crane was very hands-on with that project.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was updated, and the wing and second story were
added, but very little about the original house has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is as it was, no one has abused it. All the owners
left it better than they found it, especially the Richards,'' says
Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the house is for sale again, by Henry S. Miller Realtors,
for just shy of a cool million. But for the money, you get four
bedrooms, music room, sauna, wine cellar, a guest suite and
Hollywood history.

ROCK EN ESPANOL REACHES ITS FINAL BOUNDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 (Eds: 3rd take may be used as a sidebar.)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Rock may have been born as American music,
but at middle age it is also the music of the Americas, as quickly
becomes apparent during an afternoon spent in a recording studio
here with Aterciopelados, Colombia's most popular rock band. The
duo is rushing to finish mixing tracks for its new compact disc
before heading off for a summer tour of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Echeverri and Hector Buitrago, the group's founders, are
putting the finishing touches on a song called ``El Album,'' which
has just the sort of mixed-salad of a sound that has made the band
so successful throughout Latin America. The tune features a twangy
rockabilly guitar, a repetitive piano pattern that would sound at
home on any salsa record, the scratching of a hip-hop D.J., and a
chorus in the accordion-driven Colombian folk style known as
vallenato.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rockers at heart, but we are Latin American rockers,
and that means that our music feeds on a lot of different
sources,'' Echeverri, who sings and writes for Aterciopelados
(pronounced ah-TARE-see-oh-pay-LAH-dos), which means ``the
Velvets,'' said after the session was over. ``We like to mix things
from outside with what is indigenous because that is what makes the
music so cool and unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   In studios and on stages all over Latin America these days,
similar scenes are unfolding as a new generation of musicians,
raised on rock in all its various permutations, topples the
traditional stereotypes of what Latin music ought to be. If only
for lack of a better name, the movement, which has been developing
since the mid-1980s, has come to be known as rock en espanol _ and
to be seen by its adherents as a powerful and energizing global
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll was born out of a cultural clash in the United
States between black and white,'' said Gustavo Santaolalla, an
Argentine who is the leading producer of rock en espanol records.
``Now a new cultural clash is taking place worldwide between
American culture and our indigenous cultures and the result, at a
time when so much mainstream pop music sounds like it has been
rehashed or recycled, is something that is new and fresh and
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The term rock en espanol is all-purpose and all-inclusive,
grouping musicians whose only real points in common are that they
grew up admiring Anglo-American rock bands and that they sing in
Spanish. Indeed, the movement is so wide-ranging that it
comfortably embraces everything from Mexican rappers like Molotov,
Control Machete and El Gran Silencio to melodic singer-songwriters
like the Argentines Fito Paez, Charly Garcia and Andres Calamaro.
</P>
<P>
   But as record companies have discovered in recent years, rock en
espanol is a phenomenon that is as much commercial as aesthetic,
which has created an interesting quandary for many Latin American
rockers about their future directions as their music moves beyond
their borders. Bands like the Mexican power-pop quartet Mana, to
take the most prominent example, routinely fill soccer and baseball
stadiums, arenas and bull rings with audiences of 25,000 or more
and sell millions of records to Spanish-speaking teen-agers all
over Latin America and, increasingly, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has been slower to make an impact in New York,
whose Spanish-speaking population is predominantly Caribbean and
thus more accustomed to tropical rhythms, than in Latin America or
in cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago. But over the next
three weeks that situation may change, as a result of the Latin
Alternative Music Conference, a three-day industry forum scheduled
to begin next Sunday, and a series of showcase concerts sandwiched
around it.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Chilean pop quartet La Ley, the dance
specialists Los Amigos Invisibles from Venezuela and the Argentine
funk band Ilya Kuryaki and the Valderramas will be performing in a
free open-air concert at Central Park Summerstage. Then on Aug. 23
the Watcha Tour, a package show that has become Latin rock's
equivalent of Lollapalooza, arrives in New York for the first time,
with Cafe Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Molotov and Animal playing at the
Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   What is most striking about these and other popular rock en
espanol bands is their eclecticism and flexibility. Like Latin
American musicians from earlier generations, they have grown up
listening to the whole gamut of styles that make up the region's
common musical heritage: salsa, tango, merengue, bolero, cumbia,
mariachi, samba, ranchera, mambo and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to improved communications and economic conditions,
they have also had more opportunities than their predecessors to
become familiar and comfortable with the popular music of the
English-speaking world. From Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Bob
Dylan to Nirvana, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails, they have heard _ and
absorbed _ it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are amphibious,'' said Ivan Benavides, leader of the
Colombian group Bloque, whose eponymous debut album made the top 10
lists of several New York Times critics in 1998. ``We can play the
music of the cultures we were born into, but it also feels natural
to play the music of the broader cosmopolitan culture. That gives
us an advantage over people who are ethnocentric, whether they are
Anglo-, Euro- or Latino-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Latin rockers, most of whom are in their 30s,
were growing up, cultural discourse in Latin America was dominated
by doctrinaire leftists who argued that rock was a decadent
manifestation of American imperialism and that only folk-based
indigenous music could be a valid form of expression. Given what
they saw as a false dichotomy between Silvio Rodriguez and David
Bowie, or Victor Jara and Kiss, the rockers quite deliberately
chose both.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the left tend to have very closed opinions and not
to be very farsighted,'' said Flavio Cianciarulo, the bass player
and a songwriter for Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Argentina's most
innovative band. ``Rock is essentially pure rebellion, and always
has been, but they couldn't understand that, so we just wrote them
off and continued to do our own thing, always with honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   In their early days, admittedly, many rock en espanol performers
sounded like copies of whatever Anglo-American bands first inspired
them to pick up their instruments or sing. Mana drew heavily on the
Police, La Ley emerged as a cross between Depeche Mode and Duran
Duran, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs seemed like an Argentine version of
the Specials and the Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira found
herself being compared to Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   But as bands and singers have gradually gained experience and
confidence, that tendency has changed, and Latin American rock
today can be just as adventurous and stylistically promiscuous as
North American pop. One of the biggest hits in Latin America during
the past year, for example, has been Shakira's ``Ojos Asi,'' which
fuses a Spanish-language lyric with a Middle Eastern melody and
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Barranquilla, which is a Caribbean port city
where you heard every kind of music you could imagine, from cumbia
and vallenato to rhythm-and-blues,'' recalled Shakira, a member of
a Lebanese immigrant family whose full name is Shakira Mebarak.
``Some of the first records I remember hearing as a little girl
were Donna Summer and the Arab singers that my parents liked,''
such as the Egyptian singer Oum Kalsoum.
</P>
<P>
   But if one place has been most influential in the development of
the movement, it is Mexico. Even in the 1960s, Mexican bands were
listening to the ``border blasters,'' high-wattage radio stations
broadcasting to the United States from Mexican territory and
recording Spanish-language cover versions of American rock 'n' roll
hits. By the mid 1980s, Mexican record labels were slowly waking to
the commercial possibilities of home-grown rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock en tu idioma,'' or ``rock in your language,'' was the way
they marketed the new sound. Based in Mexico City, bands like Cafe
Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Caifanes, Santa Sabina and La Castaneda
found small clubs in bohemian neighborhoods that were willing to
let them play, developed followings that soon grew from the local
to the national, and signed contracts with the Mexican branches of
the main multinational record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important as an affirmation to sing in Spanish,'' said
Ruben Albarran of Cafe Tacuba, the pioneering band whose recent
activities have included a tour of the United States with Beck and
recordings with the Kronos Quartet. ``We had to define ourselves.''

 BOGOTA, Colombia: define ourselves.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Argentina, a similar process was under way. A flourishing
rock 'n' roll scene had emerged in Buenos Aires during the 1960s,
but when a right-wing military junta seized power in the mid 1970s,
the music was forced to retreat and only began to re-emerge after
the collapse of the dictatorship following the Falklands War of
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no accident that we began around 1984,'' Cianciarulo
said. Once civilian rule was restored, he said, ``everything that
had gone underground came out into the light of day, and freedom
became the order of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though isolated from the rest of Latin America by language,
Brazil saw its pop music evolve along the same lines. The
tropicalists who first came to prominence in the late 1960s
continue to flourish there, but groups like Paralamas do Suceso,
Legiao Urbana, Titas, Skank, Charlie Brown Jr., Jota Quest, Barao
Vermelho, Kid Abelha, Planet Hemp and Chico Science have forged an
equally catholic, Portuguese-language variant of Latin rock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each nation's burgeoning rock scene might have continued in
insularity were it not for recent advances in technology and more
contacts between the local affiliates of multinational record
companies. Perhaps the biggest factor in breaking down barriers,
artists and managers agree, has been the explosive growth of cable
television in Latin America during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``MTV Latino and CNN en Espanol have been fundamental'' in
spreading rock en espanol, said Beto Cuevas, lead singer of the
Chilean band La Ley, whose base is in Mexico. ``They not only
showed us what was happening in the United States at the same time
it was happening, but also allowed us to see what was going on in
Argentina or Colombia, countries that had their own rock tradition
but hadn't been heard elsewhere because of a lack of
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, because of its very success, the movement, rebaptized
Latin Alternative to make it more palatable to North American
audiences, may be approaching a crossroads. Stimulated by the
recent crossover success of home-grown Hispanic performers like
Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, interest in Latin American rock is
growing in the United States, both among audiences hungry for new
sounds and record companies eager for new profits.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a Grammy award for best Latin Rock/Alternative
performance, for instance, and several Latin rock songs have turned
up in Hollywood films seeking an edgy tone, ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
and various Quentin Tarantino movies among them. College radio
stations are adding rock en espanol to their playlists, Web sites
and publications like Spin have begun to pay attention to the
genre, and booking agencies like Creative Artists Agency have
signed leading rock en espanol bands and sent them out on tour with
established American pop artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I don't get calls from EMI Latino or Sony Discos
anymore,'' said Tomas Cookman, manager of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs,
Aterciopelados and other top groups, referring to the traditional
Latin music departments of two big labels. ``Now I'm more likely to
be dealing with Maverick Records or Atlantic or Warners or Chris
Blackwell. This is a wonderful moment, like the beginning of
hip-hop, when Russell Simmons was just getting Def Jam together.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, however, many of Latin America's most popular rock
bands are facing a dilemma. Do they continue to focus on their
loyal Spanish-speaking audience back home or do they shift more of
their attention and energy to a potentially futile quest to break
into the promising but unknown American market, at the risk of
sacrificing what makes them authentic and perhaps alienating their
original fans?
</P>
<P>
   A hilariously sly new video by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs that has
been in heavy rotation on MTV Latino in recent weeks makes it clear
that at least one band recognizes the problem. The clip
accompanying ``La Vida'' features an American image consultant,
unable to speak Spanish and completely unattuned to the band's
proudly grungy image and sound, trying to repackage them into a
slick, dancing ensemble, a la 'N Sync or Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists, like Shakira, are convinced they can have it both
ways. She recently signed a contract with the same management team
that long guided Madonna's career and has spent much of the summer
in the Bahamas, working on new material and translating some of her
older songs for a projected English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the chance to expand as an artist, and I'm curious,''
she said. ``I want to know what's on the other side, how far I can
take this thing. It's a challenge to sing in another language, but
it's also an opportunity, and if I can have success in both
languages, of course that will also bring credit to Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Julieta Venegas, in contrast, is a 29-year-old Mexican
singer-songwriter who grew up in Tijuana, listening to California
radio stations ``with more a chance of seeing Iggy Pop or Oingo
Boingo in San Diego'' than hearing rock in Spanish. Though she
speaks perfect English, the only suggestion of an accent being that
of a Valley Girl, and recorded her latest disc in Los Angeles with
American studio musicians, she insisted ``it never occurred to me
to write in English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having access to American music, but writing in Spanish
is a big part of what I am and what makes my music interesting,
even to someone who might not understand the language,'' she said.
``We've been watching you people all the time, and now you're
watching us. It's sort of funny, but it's true, and I think that's
the way it's going to stay from now on, with everybody on both
sides of the border exposed to a broader, richer range of
influences.''

 BOGOTA, Colombia: of influences.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the idea of Latin American rock and pop seems utterly
foreign, here are a dozen records, chosen to display the diversity
of the movement, that offer a good starting point for the beginner:
</P>
<P>
   ATERCIOPELADOS: ``Caribe Atomico'' (BMG 1998). Tropical punk?
Psychedelic folk? It is hard to classify this eclectic collection
from Colombia other than to say it never stops swinging, surprising
or satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   BLOQUE: ``Bloque de Busqueda'' (Luaka Bop 1998). The group
started as the back-up band for the vallenato star Carlos Vives,
then made this record showing the darker side of Colombian pop,
with acerbic lyrics and harsh heavy metal guitars over a driving
Afro-Caribbean percussion section.
</P>
<P>
   LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS: ``Vasos Vacios'' (Sony 1994). This
Argentine ensemble has shown jazz leanings on its most recent
records, but this early best-of compilation highlights its
reggae-ska-dub-punk origins and includes the Brazilian-influenced
``Matador,'' still its signature song.
</P>
<P>
   CAIFANES: ``La Historia'' (BMG/Ariola 1997). A two-disc set that
traces the evolution of one of Mexico's most important groups from
a clone of the Cure to a tight and deft ensemble proud of its Latin
American origins.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLY GARCIA: ``Obras Cumbres'' (Sony 2000). A two-volume
career retrospective from Latin America's foremost
singer-songwriter, a disciple of Bob Dylan and the Beatles who has
inspired a generation of younger artists. It includes ``No Voy en
Tren,'' perhaps the first rock en espanol anthem.
</P>
<P>
   LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES: ``The New Sound of the Venezuelan
Gozadera'' (Luaka Bop 1998). Dance music as self-referentially
playful and goofy as anything the B-52's have ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUARES: ``El Equilibrio de los Jaguares'' (BMG 1996). If rock
en espanol has a guitar virtuoso, Mexico's Saul Hernandez is the
man, and this brooding but beautiful collection of songs allows him
to show off all his chops.
</P>
<P>
   MANA: ``Suenos Liquidos'' (WEA Latina 1997). The best-selling
rock en espanol record ever, by a Guadalajara-based quartet that
has parlayed a melodic, power-pop sound into unparalleled
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   MOLOTOV: ``Donde Jugaran Las Ninas?'' (Surco/Universal 1998).
Bilingual rap from a binational quartet (three Mexicans and one
gringo) that is by turns angry, scatological and humorous.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKIRA: ``Donde Estan Los Ladrones?'' (Sony 1998). At 23, this
Colombian singer and songwriter has barely entered adulthood but
already shows a striking talent for the polished, well-made pop
tune, the most appealing of which here is probably the
Arab-influenced ``Ojos Asi.''
</P>
<P>
   CAFE TACUBA: ``Reves/Yo Soy'' (WEA Latina 1999). A challenging
two-disc collection (one of quirky instrumentals, the other of more
conventional but stylistically diverse songs) that may be the
crowning achievement of Mexico's most consistently adventurous and
experimental rock band.
</P>
<P>
   VARIOUS ARTISTS: ``Reconquista! The Latin Rock Invasion'' (Rhino
1996). A chronicle of rock en espanol's early, punk-inspired years,
with an emphasis on the Mexican pioneers of the movement but also
including a pair of key cuts by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.

 &HT;    BUSH SIDESTEPS QUESTIONS ABOUT POWELL'S CONVENTION SPEECH
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. George W. Bush sidestepped questions on
Tuesday about the blunt criticism retired Gen. Colin L. Powell
handed the GOP in the speech he delivered during the opening night
of the 37th Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday if he agreed with Powell's criticism of the GOP's
stand on affirmative action, Bush declined to say one way or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Colin Powell that Republicans need to do more to
reach out to minorities,'' Bush told reporters traveling with him
to Charleston, W.Va. ``We've got a lot of work to do. And I agree
with him that I'm the man to do it for the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned speech Monday night, Powell praised Bush for
improving the educational performance of students in Texas,
particularly minorities, and said that Bush can help ``bridge our
racial divides'' if he wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell had some sharp criticism for their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but you hardly hear a whimper from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with preferences
for special interests,'' Powell told delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not seen Powell's speech in advance but that
Powell called him Monday to tell him that he would ``talk about
these issues.'' Powell, the only African-American to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of the speakers
helping the GOP convey Bush's ``compassionate conservative''
campaign theme during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what specific policies he had in mind,'' Bush
said. ``In my state of Texas we took a very positive step toward
ensuring (that) the racial mix of Texas universities reflected the
nature of our population.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas's 10 percent plan, students of any race who graduate
in the top 10 percent of their classes are automatically admitted
to state colleges and universities. Bush signed the plan into law
after a federal appeals court disallowed the use of race or
ethnicity as a factor for admittance to Texas colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush supports what he
calls ``affirmative access.'' He opposes race-based quotas because
``he believes quotas divide and Balkanize our society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought his delegates and the large, enthusiastic
crowds that have greeted him on his six-state pre-convention tour
are mostly white, Bush said: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the makeup of the crowds in Texas but I got
nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote and I'm not so sure the nature of
the crowd necessarily is going to reflect the nature of the vote,''
he said. ``But we've got a lot of work to do, no question about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Bush may have won as much as 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote during his 1998 gubernatorial re-election,
although some voting groups have cast doubts that he did that well.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was nuanced in his response to Powell's speech, Bush
was loud and clear about recent criticism from President Clinton.
At a fund-raiser late last week, Clinton mocked the Bush campaign
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how bad could I be?'' Clinton, playing the role of
Bush, told Democrats in Rhode Island. `` I've been governor of
Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has been stepping up his criticism of Clinton
throughout his pre-convention tour, reminding audiences almost
daily that his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
``knows what the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' _ a reference to
Clinton's deposition in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech before the convention Monday, Laura Bush promised
that her husband would renew a time when children could respect the
president of the United States. Traveling with her husband to West
Virginia Tuesday, Mrs. Bush said she was not referring to Clinton,
and Bush added: ``I don't think I've ever mentioned President
Clinton's name on the stump recently.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he has been talking about the president
when he uses the ``is is'' line. Almost daily, Bush recounts
stories of people coming to him with pictures of their children,
imploring him to restore respect to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was talking about him then,'' Bush said. ``I sure was,
but in the context of having somebody who's going to shoot straight
with the American people...When people walk up and hold pictures of
their children, they're the ones doing that. And we're just
reflecting what we see. ``

   NEW YORK _ ``I don't expect to be very kinetic,'' Stanley Kunitz
said, with a dry little laugh. A reporter was asking Kunitz what he
would be doing in his new appointment as the United States' 10th
poet laureate, which was announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor do I expect to traipse around the country,'' Kunitz said.
Understandable perhaps, for he is 95 years old. ``I feel the best
service that I can do is to continue to function as a poet.'' He is
certainly doing that. There aren't many poets who sign three book
contracts at age 92, as Kunitz did with his publisher, W.W. Norton.
</P>
<P>
   And in October, when his appointment as poet laureate begins,
Norton is to publish Kunitz's 12th book of poetry, a volume of
``Collected Poems.'' He would like to think there will be at least
one book after that, ``in this millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Jay Parini, a poet, novelist and critic, was told about
Kuntiz's appointment, he said: ``Every poet I know with any sense
looks to Stanley Kunitz and says that's the way to think about a
poetic career. In other words, total devotion to the craft itself,
not the slightest degree of affectation, a complete humility in his
work. There's never a moment when you say, `He's faking it,' or
`He's doing this to impress me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz succeeds Robert Pinsky, and this is actually his second
time round as the nation's top poet. From 1974 to 1976, he was
Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress, before the words
poet laureate were added to the job title. He has also won just
about every other honor possible for a poet, including a Pulitzer
Prize, the National Book Award and the Bollingen Prize. But for
many years, he was overlooked in favor of more famous
contemporaries, like W.H. Auden and Robert Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are critics who believe that Kunitz's work has
gotten better over time. ``I've learned to strip the water out of
my poems,'' he has said. In recent years, his writing has become
sparer, less formal, more direct, in a sense, purer. There are no
rhyme schemes, no complicated metrical designs. In one typical
poem, ``The Wellfleet Whale,'' he describes the cries of a whale
lying stranded on the beach, as ``an eerie medley of clicks/and
hoots and trills,/location-notes and love calls,/whistles and
grunts. Occasionally,/ it's like furniture being smashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Kunitz's work is lyrical and sensuous too, as in
``Touch Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer is late, my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Words plucked out of the air
</P>
<P>
   some forty years ago
</P>
<P>
   when I was wild with love.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the poem he asks,
</P>
<P>
   Darling, do you remember
</P>
<P>
   The man you married? Touch me,
</P>
<P>
   remind me who I am.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Worcester, Mass., the son of a manufacturer who
killed himself before Kunitz was born. He has written about the
anguish the suicide caused his family. He went on to graduate from
Harvard, served in the military and was briefly a newspaper man.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my primary thoughts through the years has been that I
am living and dying at once,'' he said. ``It began long before I
was an aging man. It's continuing. Perhaps the mix gets a bit
different.'' He cites his poem, ``The Layers,'' as an example:
</P>
<P>
   In a rising wind
</P>
<P>
   the manic dust of my friends,
</P>
<P>
   those who fell along the way,
</P>
<P>
   bitterly stings my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz is married to Elise Asher, 88, his third wife, an artist
and poet. Each has a child from a previous marriage, and ``a
bowlful of grandchildren and even great-grandchildren,'' he said.
``They're all going to be up here soon,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The couple gets by without a housekeeper. ``We work together and
manage our lives as best we can.'' They have homes in Greenwich
Village and Provincetown, Mass., where Kunitz enjoys his other
passion, gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in writing every day,'' he said, ``though I'm
at my desk every day. So much of writing is thinking before you
write, reading or simply brooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a night worker,'' he said. ``I love the sense of solitude
and the silence. ``I love to think that here I am alive and burning
and the rest of the world is asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz, who is slender and fit-looking, said he had no special

attention to exercise or diet,'' he said, though ``I'm famous for
my martinis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what keeps me going is my caring about being alive and
caring about the world. And the fact that I love being here, that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   His poem ``The Long Boat,'' expresses it all, he said. In the
poem, he imagines lying down in a cradle with the family ghosts,
``buffeted by the storm, endlessly drifting.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the end, he writes, it is ``As if it didn't matter/ which
way was home;/ as if he didn't know/ he loved the earth so much/ he
wanted to stay forever.''

   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, mentioned as a possible secretary of
state if George W. Bush wins in November, said Monday he also would
entertain a job offer from Al Gore if the Democrat wins the
presidential election. ``If he were the president, I would have to
take it under serious consideration,'' Powell said after being
asked on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' if he could work for Gore.
Powell added: ``I've had conversations with President Clinton like
this. I elected not to accept some of the offers that were out
there, but you always have to listen when a president comes to you
...'' Bush hinted Monday that Powell, the only black to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would be offered a top job
in his administration. ``I hope his greatest service to America
might still lie ahead,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ALSO ON THE LINEUP . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hewing to the carefully calculated script of moderation,
tolerance and outreach, speakers on the second night of the
convention will also include Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in Congress, Condoleezza Rice, the black
woman who is Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, and Elizabeth
Dole, the former Cabinet member who briefly ran for the GOP
nomination. Former Presidents Bush and Ford will take the spotlight
in a convention tribute to former Republican presidents. Nancy
Reagan was flying in from California to stand in for her husband,
Ronald, who has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT STRANGE BEDFELLOWS?
</P>
<P>
   A dozen prominent Republicans spent two hours trying to woo
Teamsters President James P. Hoffa at a reception, hoping to win an
endorsement or at least prevent the labor organization from backing
Al Gore. It was the first time in 20 years a GOP convention has
hosted the union. The 1.5 million-strong International Brotherhood
of Teamsters and the United Auto Workers abstained when the AFL-CIO
labor federation endorsed Gore. Hoffa said he plans to make a
decision about an endorsement - if any - around Labor Day, after
also attending the Democratic Convention. Republicans said when
Teamsters see the pictures of Republicans with Hoffa, that alone
will convince some members who were on the fence to vote for Bush.
``That picture is what it's all about,'' said Scott Reed, the man
who put the meeting together.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, PART II
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken civil rights activist and Democrat, the Rev. Al
Sharpton, is attending the convention today not as a protester but
as a guest of conservative commentator Armstrong Williams. Williams
said Sharpton will spend most of the day with him, including taping
Williams' syndicated radio show from inside the convention hall.
``We're just trying to show that people of different political
persuasions can try to come together and talk about their
differences,'' Williams said. In exchange for his attendance here,
the Republican Armstrong said he'll go to Los Angeles for the
Democratic convention, Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   NO CLINTON-BASHING AT THIS BASH
</P>
<P>
   When the New York Republican delegation takes the floor at the
convention this week, the Republican running in the state's most
important race will be nowhere to be seen. Rep. Rick Lazio decided
to skip most of the convention to stay in New York and continue his
Senate campaign against Hillary Clinton. He made a cameo appearance
with New York delegates today, speaking at their breakfast and then
raising some money at a private event. Rep. Peter King, a fellow
Long Island Republican, said Lazio wouldn't be addressing the
convention because, ``The feeling is that if (he) got up to speak,
that would be looked upon as an anti-Clinton speech and the crowd
would obviously respond, maybe too enthusiastically, to Rick
because of their dislike of Mrs. Clinton. And the Bush people don't
want to make this an anti-Clinton convention.''
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH FOR THE SPIRIT OF HARMONY
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes may have dropped
out of the race, but he apparently won't give up any of his
hard-won delegates. Keyes received five of the 288 votes cast
during the roll call of the states at the convention. George W.
Bush, the presumptive nominee, got the remaining votes. Keyes
earned the five Arkansas delegates in the state's May 23
presidential primary. Because they were never released after Keyes
quit the race in July, the delegates technically remain pledged to
him _ even though only one of the five delegates supports him,
according to Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Anne Britton, head of
Keyes's campaign in Arkansas, said Keyes probably would have
released his delegates if he had been given a chance to speak at
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   YOUR BEEF'S WITH ME
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says he is more nervous about the outcome of
his wife's New York Senate race than he ever was about any of his
own elections, and he worries that people who ``always hated me''
have ``transferred all their anger to her.'' In an interview with
Fox television broadcast Tuesday, Clinton said, ``It's almost as if
they've got one last chance to beat me. I feel like I just wake up
every day wishing I could do something else to help.'' Recent polls
have shown Hillary Clinton and opponent Rick Lazio in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S IT, I'VE HAD IT
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush has generally refrained from mentioning
either President Clinton or rival Al Gore by name, he did so twice
Tuesday, responding sharply to criticism from Clinton, who he said
is ``so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore
elected, he'll say anything, just like Gore will.'' Bush later said
on his plane that he had ignored his self-imposed ban on mentioning
names because he was ``riled up'' by Clinton's remarks at a
fund-raiser last Friday. At the event, Clinton suggested Bush's
campaign message was: ``How bad can I be? I've been governor of
Texas. My daddy was president. I owned a baseball team. They like
me down there. ... Everything is rocking along hunky dory. Their
fraternity had it for eight years, give it to ours for eight
years.'
</P>
<P>
   MAKING ITS LIST AND CHECKING IT TWICE
</P>
<P>
   With control of Congress up for grabs this fall, Republicans are
sending an unmistakable message to political action committees who
are thinking about hedging their bets by writing checks to both
parties. The GOP fund-raising arm for House candidates has created
a 75 Percent Club for special interests to find out who's been
giving too much money to Democrats. What is the 75 percent? A
requirement that political action committees give three-quarters of
their contributions to Republican candidates _ or they might not
get their calls returned. ``They've got to make a decision of how
they are going to help their friends and who their friends are,''
said Rep. Thomas Reynolds of New York, one of the committee's key
fund-raisers. Fred Werthheimer, head of Democracy 21 and an
advocate of reducing the influence of money in politics, criticized
the tactic, saying, ``This is taking it to a new level, from the
selling and buying of access to the political extortion level where
your access may be cut off if you don't pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   A TEMPEST BREWING
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney's discomfort with the media's interest in her
lesbian daughter, Mary, televised nationally over the weekend,
threatens to ignite the first firestorm of the so-far superbly
scripted Republican convention. On Sunday, when ABC's Cokie Roberts
started to ask the GOP vice-presidential candidate's wife about
having a daughter who has ``declared she's openly gay,'' an irate
Lynne Cheney shot back: ``Mary has never declared such a thing.''
The controversy could bubble over this week, since friends of Mary
Cheney - who has publicly declared herself a lesbian and has worked
as the gay and lesbian corporate relations manager for Coors
Brewing Co. - say she's planning to bring her life partner to the
convention.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dreary conditions that have enveloped much of the Northeast
since late last week will yield to weather more like summer as a
warm front plods northward into Maine. Fog will shroud the New
England coast, but some sunshine will break through by afternoon
from Boston southward. It will turn sultry in the New York area as
breezes from the southwest develop.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical air gliding northward around the Bermuda high will pass
over the heated land of the Southeast, leading to widespread
thunderstorms in the afternoon. Flooding is possible as storms move
slowly along the same path in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   A cool front pushing southward into the Great Lakes will promote
thundershowers. Cooler, less humid air will cover the northeast
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Torrid weather will persist in the Rockies and interior West,
though the Northwest will turn cooler. Afternoon storms will
develop in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TOTALLY MARINE
</P>
<P>
   The enormous capacity of the ocean to temper the climate along
the coast was most evident from New York to Boston on Monday. The
temperature there varied by no more than 3 degrees during that
24-hour period. While thick clouds and some rain helped to reduce
the temperature variation, a persistent wind from the North
Atlantic drove ocean-cooled air into the region. It is remarkable
that in late July, with nearly 15 hours of daylight and the sun
high in the sky, the ocean overwhelmed the season.

WHAT'S A TALMUDIST DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: For release Sunday, Aug .  6)  
 By TESSA DE CARLO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since the Exploratorium was founded here 31
years ago as an innovative ``museum of science, art and human
perception,'' it has taken pride in breaking traditional museum
rules. Mixing science exhibits and artworks with little concern
about which is which, the Exploratorium encourages a giddily high
level of interactivity, inviting visitors not just to stand and
contemplate but to touch, pump, spin or otherwise mess around with
most of the 600-plus items on display.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, a few distinguished visitors are being
treated with decidedly old-fashioned formality.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the ``Medical Venus,'' a lifesize and alarmingly
lifelike 18th-century Italian wax sculpture of a young beauty who
lies in a swoon on pink damask cushions. It's hardly surprising she
feels faint, since she's not only naked but cut open from stem to
stern to reveal her heart, liver and other viscera, as beautifully
made as the rest of her dainty person.
</P>
<P>
   The Venus, who hails from the Museo La Specola in Florence, is
making her first appearance in the United States as one of the star
turns in ``Revealing Bodies,'' which runs through Sept. 4. The show
uses an array of artifacts and artworks to demonstrate that our
view of human anatomy has always been informed as much by culture
as science.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the Exploratorium's history, this
temporary exhibition has been given a traditional gallery-style
installation off to one side of the museum, acoustically and
visually segregated from the whirling, flashing, wiggling exhibits
on the cavernous main exhibition floor. Moreover, while dozens of
the exhibits in ``Revealing Bodies'' welcome participation, the
Venus and other items are tucked safely under glass _ no
interactivity allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first attempt to do something like this, but
`Revealing Bodies' is where we're headed,'' said Kathleen McLean,
the Exploratorium's director of public programs. While more
traditional museums try to move toward greater interactivity and
livelier, less contemplative exhibitions, she said, for the
Exploratorium, doing something new and different means ``creating
more environments for focus and reflection and slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy isn't sitting well with everyone. ``There's been a
lot of concern here among staff that we're going to slip into being
just another museum,'' McLean said. ``But I don't think very many
museums could have done the `Revealing Bodies' show.''
</P>
<P>
   For while ``Revealing Bodies'' may be straitlaced by
Exploratorium standards, its multicultural, cross-disciplinary
blend of art, science and participatory technologies is very much
in the institution's mold-breaking tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ``Medical Venus,'' the show includes African
carved figures used in healing rituals, prosthetic legs from a
variety of eras and cultures, Ken Wilkes' elegant, horrifying
photographs of dissections, a screen that displays the heat
emanating from the viewer's body in vivid colors, historic and
contemporary X-rays and copies of astonishingly varied medical
drawings from 17th-century Persia, 16th-century Holland and 1920s
France.
</P>
<P>
   Within the relatively staid ``Revealing Bodies'' environment,
there's also plenty of hard science and a number of the kind of
interactive exhibits that the Exploratorium is famous for. For
example, visitors can draw their own silhouette, peer into the
inside of their own eyes or page through a giant flipbook-style
display of the ``Visible Humans,'' two corpses (one male, one
female) that were frozen, milled from the feet up removing a
paper-thin section at a time, photographed and reassembled as
stacks of digital images that look disturbingly like human-shaped
slices of headcheese.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when so much of contemporary art aims to subvert
rather than investigate the truth, it can be problematic to bring
art into a science museum. So if one source of internal controversy
about the ``Revealing Bodies'' show is its artiness, another is
that some of the artworks look too much like science, while turning
scientific realities topsy-turvy.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the ``Face Value'' machine created by the British
artist Alexa Wright and the computer scientist Alf Linney. ``Face
Value'' compares the viewer's face to a composite portrait of some
200 other visitors, then spits out a ``personal face reading'' that
purports to use that comparison to define character. The readings
are nonsense, of course, a commentary on our naive willingness to
trust both technology and first impressions. But Melissa Alexander,
the show's project director, said some Exploratorium staff worried
that visitors would assume that ``Face Value'' was as real as a
nearby exhibit that lets them hear their lungs at work.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of potential confusion is the New York artist
Scott Serrano's curiosity cabinet of drawings, artifacts and
photographs telling the story of a 19th-century anatomist, Wilson
Quain, a man so ``science-intoxicated'' that he took to dissecting
himself. Quain is a fiction, but on one recent afternoon several
visitors clearly believed he was a historical figure. ``How could
anyone do that to themselves?'' one mother exclaimed as she and her
child stared at a series of animated digital photographs of Quain
(played by Serrano) apparently peeling off his own face. They were
too horrified to notice that the photographs obviously dated from
the 21st rather than the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the show's juxtaposition of the fine and the
medical arts is stimulating on all fronts, highlighting the formal
beauty of the latter and the sometimes grim reality embedded in the
former. An artificial heart made of shiny metal and intricate
swirls of plastic could pass for a sinisterly futuristic sculpture.
Rosamund Purcell's stunning photograph of a dissected hand, which
on a conventional gallery wall might too easily be seen as merely
an arty novelty, becomes a moving reminder of all the ways the
living feed on the dead when it's juxtaposed with a set of three
dissected, mummified hands used as teaching aids a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinction between art and science didn't always exist in
our culture,'' Alexander said. ``The Venus is proof that they used
to be much closer together. And the Exploratorium was based on the
idea of not making any distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   That course was set by the museum's founder, Frank Oppenheimer,
a brilliant physicist and teacher who worked with his brother,
Robert, on the development of the atomic bomb. Where most museums
expected people to absorb information passively, like students
sitting in a lecture hall, Oppenheimer sought to create a place
that would emphasize play rather than pretension, where visitors
could do their own experiments and make their own educational
leaps. From the beginning, artists and scientists have worked side
by side in the museum's workshop, using scientific phenomena as the
basis for exhibits that inspire aesthetic delight as well as
curiosity about how the natural world works.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Exploratorium opened in 1969, its innovative ideas
have been adopted by museums all over the world. But Oppenheimer's
vision tended to scant the cultural side of the art-science
partnership, focusing more on science phenomena and less on their
social interpretations and ramifications. Moreover, the
institution's anti-museum environment _ dark, noisy and usually
full of excited children dashing from one activity to the next _
favors the didactic over the contemplative, and sometimes
hyperactivity over either.

   Following Oppenheimer's death in 1985, his successors have

   ``There's a new emphasis on making everything clean and

the Exploratorium from 1972 to 1992. ``I think they see that as the

to see how inventive and experimental a show like `Revealing
Bodies' is.''

BUSH LASHES OUT AT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Governor George W. Bush, who has long pledged
to rise above personal attacks in his presidential campaign, used
some of his harshest language yet to ridicule his opponent's
administration Tuesday, calling President Clinton ``desperate'' for
getting involved in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing amused by reports that Clinton had called him a rich
kid whose ``daddy was president,'' Bush said: ``You know something?
I welcome President Clinton's criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me that the president of the United States
would spend time trying to be a political pundit,'' Bush said.
``He's so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore
elected, he'll say anything, just like Al Gore will.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came one day after Bush's father, former President
George Bush, threatened to ``tell the nation what I think'' about
Clinton if he continued bad-mouthing his son. Still, the Texas
governor held firm to the notion that he is not attacking his
opponent. Speaking with reporters on the fifth day of his slow
procession toward the Republican National Convention, Bush said he
makes references to Clinton _ and his impeachment trial in
particular _ only in reaction to comments by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied his frequent references to morality and ``restoring
honor and dignity to the White House'' were aimed specifically at
Clinton, whose impeachment scandal is often viewed as having done
the opposite. And his wife, who the night before made similar
comments in her debut convention speech, sounded indignant at the
suggestion she had made a personal attack. The night before, Laura
had said: ``I want my son or daughter to respect the president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't talking about President Clinton,'' Laura Bush told
reporters Tuesday, interrupting her husband to answer a question
about her speech. ``I was talking about my husband, and what that
means when people come up with pictures of their children and say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stepped in. ``That's reality,'' he said. ``When people walk
up to us and say, `Don't let us down,' we're just reporting what's
happening, and I don't think I've ever mentioned President
Clinton's name on the stump recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally at a West Virginia War Memorial in
Charleston, Bush told a cheering crowd: ``This nation does not want
four more years of Clinton-Gore.'' Afterward, Bush sheepishly
admitted the questions about Clinton ``got me all riled up.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly edgy tone came as Bush prepared to arrive
Wednesday morning in Philadelphia, where he will perform a
technical rehearsal of his nomination acceptance speech Wednesday
afternoon. Bush aides have already begun giving glimmers of what he
will discuss, describing the script as a blend of folksy charm and
serious policy issues such as public school reform and the budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But the 45-minute speech is clearly intended to shore up the
down-home image Bush has crafted. Although he will share his
``personal history'' and describe his upbringing in Midland, Texas,
Bush will not make as much as a passing reference to his degrees
from two Ivy League universities, Yale and the Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they define him as much as Midland does,'' Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said of the New England schools, where
Bush spent six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who rarely strays from his stump speech, will also repeat
phrases he has said countless times on the campaign trail over the
last year, including his promise for his swearing-in as president:
``When I put my hand on the Bible, I will promise to uphold the
honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected,
so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he visited with reporters on his campaign plane _ newly
painted with the ``Bush-Cheney'' logo _ Bush had little chance to
promote his upcoming speech. Instead, he faced a battery of
questions about racial issues, especially the speech given at the
Republican convention the night before by retired General Colin
Powell, who made an unusually firm plea for the Republican Party
not to abandon affirmative action for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose not to go into the details of his stance on
affirmative action. Although he lauded Powell's speech, Bush hewed
to the general position he has long espoused, which encourages
``affirmative access'' and disapproves of quotas. Asked directly
how he felt about affirmative action and Powell's remarks, Bush
replied: ``I don't know what specific policies he had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``In my state of Texas, we took a very positive
step toward ensuring the facial mix of Texas universities reflected
the nature of our population.'' And he pledged to make a similar
effort as president. ``We've got to do a better job of recruiting
minorities to our party. And I'm going to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not reviewed Powell's speech in advance. But
the two men talked on the phone, and when Powell described his
intended remarks, Bush said he told the retired general: ``I said,
`Please do, we've got an important message to send.' ''

PARKS SERVICE TRYING FRIARS' PATIENCE _ AND CHARITY _ IN LAND
DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARRISON, N.Y. _ For more than a century, the Franciscan friars
have made the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, set in a hilly swath
of forest here, their world headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, much of Graymoor is like a page out of Chaucer, with
whispering friars in brown robes and sandals strolling past
abbey-style buildings. Though they may resemble their legendary
jolly counterparts of yore, today's friars are hardly known for
taking up a stiff cudgel for bandying errant knaves who refuse to
yield the path.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, however, they can be as fiercely territorial as
their forefathers, and they are now fighting to keep a wooded
18-acre section of their property that the National Park Service is
trying to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   The parcel is adjacent to the Appalachian Trail, which runs
through Graymoor's 400 acres of woods in Garrison about an hour
north of Manhattan in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   The park service, which oversees the 2,144-mile trail stretching
from Maine to Georgia and used extensively by hikers, says the
friars could threaten one section of trail.
</P>
<P>
   But the friars say it is the Park Service that is encroaching
and starting a land-grab that could endanger the future of their
ministries. So they are standing their ground.
</P>
<P>
   Graymoor, the world headquarters for the Franciscan Friars of
the Atonement, was established in 1898. There are 45 friars and 86
nuns living there; they operate a retreat, a drug and alcohol
rehabilitation center, an ecumenical institute and St.
Christopher's Inn, a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Graymoor definitely has one foot in the past with the style of
its buildings and wandering friars, thought the friars now wear
their robes over their street clothes, and their sandals are
Birkenstocks. The Rev. Arthur Johnson, minister general of
Graymoor, has a secretary and a computer in his fifth-floor office
in the center's main administrative office building.
</P>
<P>
   The friars say that losing the parcel involved in the dispute
would cripple their ministry in the future. Though the only
building on the 18-acre parcel is a maintenance shed, the land is
crucial to the maintenance of their complex, they say.
Relinquishing rights to it would hinder maintenance of roads and
other buildings. Also, they say, the parcel is next to the center's
sewage treatment plant, and surrendering it would hinder access to
the plant and any expansion in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to take up archery again,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   His quip was only partly in jest. Instead of stout oaken staffs
and longbows, the Graymoor friars are wielding slightly more modern
weapons: a publicist and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The park service already has an easement on 58 acres of the
friars' property. But the friars said they did not learn until July
that in May, the park service had asked the Justice Department to
order the friars to sell the government an easement on 18 more
acres as ``buffer land'' for the trail, under eminent domain, a
legal procedure that allows governments to take land for the public
good, like roads and parks, at its fair market value. Neither the
friars nor the government would say what the park service was
offering, but both sides privately acknowledged that it was less
than $10,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the battle was not over money but over ``the
principle that the federal government thinks it can come in and
take over our land.'' Allowing the park service to have the parcel,
he said, could open the floodgates to future government land
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say they won't come along next time and say they want
more?'' he said, adding that the friars would consider challenging
a forced acquisition in court.
</P>
<P>
   Edie Shean-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the northeast region of
the National Park Service, said the agency was simply fulfilling
its mandate from Congress to obtain any land it needs to ensure
that the trail remains continuous.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the friars and the trail goes back to
1923, when they and the trail's organizers agreed to allow the path
to cross an undeveloped wooded area along the eastern edge of the
friars' property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the park service wanted to move the trail, and paid
$116,500 to acquire a formal easement on 58 acres, much closer to
the friars' buildings. Since then, the park service has tried
unsuccessfully to get the friars to give it an easement on the
18-acre parcel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the friars still technically own the property covered by
the easement, they cannot build on it or sell it without permission
from the park service.
</P>
<P>
   Shean-Hammond said that almost immediately after the friars sold
the government the easement in 1984, they violated its terms by
building a pump house for the sewage plant on it and by running
pipes under the trail. The Park Service has decided to seek more of
Graymoor's land to preclude a similar encroachment in the future,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called the construction of the pump house ``a
miscalculation,'' but noted that the building is the size of a
one-car garage and is barely visible from the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect for the Franciscan friars, the land has
been built on,'' Shean-Hammond said. ``And we have to ensure that
it won't happen again. We're simply trying to protect the
taxpayers' investment in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to protect that corridor,'' she added. ``In other
cases, we have acted more immediately, but we recognize that the
friars have been good hosts to the hikers.''
</P>
<P>
   She also voiced concern that the friars would some day sell the
land to a private developer. Johnson said the friars had no
immediate plans to do so, but he would not rule out such a sale in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The friars say they are friends of the trail and have always
permitted hikers without charge, often allowing them to camp
overnight. Day hikers may park free, and the friars have built
showers, toilets and a shed for them. Trail users may roam the
entire Graymoor property, use the friars' library, and are invited
to share dinner with the friars without charge. Some guide books
call Graymoor the ``Hilton of the Appalachian Trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Kelly, a Republican whose congressional district
includes Garrison, wrote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt asking
him to have the park service drop the acquisition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this drastic action against the friars offensive,'' she
wrote, ``and using these strong-arm tactics against the friars is
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Touring the property in a sport utility vehicle, Johnson said
that despite its claims against the friars, the park service was
the one encroaching on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like inviting someone for the weekend,'' he said, ``and
all of a sudden they stay and claim squatters' rights.''

   GOP-RDP (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: After an evening
projecting an image of a party that welcomes women, minority groups
and immigrants, the Republicans are poised to present a more
familiar focus at their convention, that of the party that embraces
and promotes military strength. On Tuesday night, the podium will
be dominated by war heroes: Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, former Sen.
Bob Dole and Sen. John McCain. But the underlying message is the
same: The Republican Party under George W. Bush is united behind a
single message, relentlessly disciplined and focused on taking the
White House. By Richard L. Berke.

   FUEL-COST-IMPACT (Brooklyn, Iowa) _ Middle class Americans,
flush with prosperity, are grumbling about high fuel prices, but
rising gas and heating costs are inflicting catastrophic burdens on
the working poor. For low-income families in small towns and
suburbs, where long distances and the lack of public transportation
make driving a necessity, filling gas tanks is coming at the
expense of proper nutrition and medicine. One study suggests that
higher heating bills this winter could even compel low-income
consumers to do without health care, phones and electricity. By

   SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ Preparing for a new round of
negotiations over how to reduce levels of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases that may be warming the climate, the United States has taken
the stance that using forests and farmer's fields to sop up carbon
dioxide, the chief warming gas, is just as important as cutting
emissions from smoke stacks and tail pipes. The position was stated
in documents filed before a deadline with a U.N. office that is
overseeing talks aimed at implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an
international agreement among industrialized nations aimed at
averting any dangerous climate warming. By Andrew C. Revkin.

CANADIANS BUZZ OVER POSSIBLE SHIFT TO LEFT IN NEWSPAPERS

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A new media colossus rose north of the
border this week as Israel ``Izzy'' Asper _ a Manitoba entrepreneur
who already controls a hefty percentage of Canada's television and
radio stations _ acquired most of the country's leading newspapers
from Conrad Black, the Canadian-born, British-based press baron.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.3 billion takeover, the biggest media deal in Canadian
history, leaves Asper's CanWest Global Communications Corp., in
control of 148 newspapers from St. John's, Newfoundland, to
Victoria, British Columbia, including 13 high-profile dailies such
as the Ottawa Citizen, Montreal Gazette and Vancouver Sun.
Moreover, Asper and Black will split control of Black's Canadian
flagship, the Toronto-based National Post.
</P>
<P>
   The deal hatched between two of Canada's most colorful and
ideologically contrasting moguls leaves Asper in control the
country's biggest multimedia empire, one marrying Black's
newspapers, trade magazines and Internet companies to Asper's slew
of broadcast outlets, telecommunications outfits and entertainment
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``CanWest has all but cornered the market on the gathering and
dissemination of news in this country,'' Christopher Dornan,
director of the Carleton University School of Journalism and
Communication in Ottawa, wrote in the Globe and Mail newspaper, one
of the very few front-rank Canadian papers left without ties to
Black or CanWest.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction was seen by financial analysts as the first step
by Black's company, Hollinger Inc., to sell nearly all of its 350
newspapers across North America to boost its dormant stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the buzz across Canada Tuesday focused less on the
long-range implications of the megamerger of print, broadcast,
entertainment, and cyberspace media than on the outsized
personalities at the heart of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Asper and Black are Canada's two most flamboyantly recognizable
media tycoons, and both are passionate aficionados of politics with
nearly opposite views. So it seemed a strange twist that the
takeover deal stipulates that Asper and Black's Hollinger Inc. will
share control of the National Post, launched only in 1998 yet
already one of Canada's most influential newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Asper, 67, is a brash, chain-smoking jazz lover who grew up in a
community of Russian Jewish immigrants in Manitoba and whose first
job was scraping gum from under the seats of his father's movie
theater. He's known for his left-of-center political views as well
as an almost eccentric devotion to his home city of Winnipeg. He's
kept CanWest based in the gritty, much-faded former railroad hub
while nearly every other major Canadian corporation maintains head
offices in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary or Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 56, raised a child of privilege in an English-speaking
enclave of Montreal, is an urbane Anglophile who makes his home in
London, hangs out with Margaret Thatcher and William F. Buckley,
rules his print fiefdoms from a chair that once belonged to his
greatest hero, Napoleon, and has never hestitated to use his
newspapers to flog his conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   If the upstart National Post _ Black's proudest creation _ has
gained a reputation for aggressive reporting, sleek design and
stylish writing, it is even better known as the nation's most
prominent trumpet of the political right.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring over the Post's future editorial stands seemed to start
almost instantly, with Asper pointedly telling a news conference
Tuesday that the newspaper will express ``a balanced point of view
on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   For some journalists, the departure of Black comes as a relief.
``The heavy hand of Conrad Black will not be felt as much as it has
over the years,'' said Alexander Norris, a veteran reporter with
the Montreal Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surprise takeover appeared to signal the end of
an era in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with archrival Rupert Murdoch, Black is the last of the
old-style press barons whose newspapers were inseparable from their
own swaggering personalities. Inspired by a biography of William
Randolph Hearst, Black purchased a stake in a tiny Quebec newspaper
after being expelled from university in the early 1960s, and has
since stuck to newspapering _ obviously relishing the power and
punch of controlling his own presses.
</P>
<P>
   Asper is undoubtedly a character, but his corporation, CanWest,
is basically just another colorless media conglomerate and it's
certain that he sees newspapers as just another product, not a
passion. The main focus of the company will remain television and
radio; it controls dozens of stations not just in Canada but in
Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Black will retain newspapers around the world, including the
London's Daily Telegraph, the Jerusalem Post and the Chicago
Sun-Times. But the sell-off to Asper represents a dramatic
eclipsing of his empire.
</P>
<P>
   While Asper and his son, Leonard Asper, president and chief
executive officer of CanWest, held jubilant news conferences, Black
uncharacteristically disappeared from public view _ on vacation,
according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   His only public thoughts, so far, on the deal were expressed in
an interview with the National Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a retreat, but it is substantially a
departure,'' Black told the paper. ``We have said for a long time
we had an overexposure in Canada. You'll hear less of me, but I am
not leaving and I will not go completely silent.''

CHENEY ADJUSTING TO BEING BACK IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney had finished his speech and was
posing for snapshots with old friends from Wyoming when his
daughter Mary tapped him on the shoulder and pointed behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn around, the cameras are over there,'' she seemed to
whisper into his ear, as Cheney spun on his heels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small moment on opening day of the Republican National
Convention, but it captured the feel of the Cheney campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a week after George W. Bush plucked Cheney
out of the business world and thrust him onto the Republican
ticket, the campaign is still adjusting to having a second banana
while the former congressman and defense secretary is hustling to
reacquaint himself with his political roots.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which has offered presidential-style planning
since Bush announced his candidacy more than a year ago, struggles
when asked about Cheney's schedule. As for ``the secretary,'' as
the staff calls him, Cheney makes his remarks and drives home
Bush's familiar themes while referring to handwritten notes on
paper folded lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tonight &LR;  Cheney steps into the spotlight on the grandest of
political stages: a national party convention to deliver his
nomination acceptance speech. Cheney, and then Bush  &UR; tomorrow &LR; 
night, despite their conservative beliefs, will try to appeal to
moderate and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have hammered at Cheney since Bush chose him,
highlighting his draft deferments during the Vietnam War. The party
has also launched television commercials criticizing his
congressional votes in the 1980s against the Clean Water Act and a
proposal to ban armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, President Clinton has gone on the attack on behalf
of Vice President Al Gore, challenging Bush's rationale for running
and criticizing Cheney's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sort of at a crossroad,'' said Charles Cook, a
columnist and author of the Cook Political Report. ``The initial
gut reaction that people had was this was a real experienced guy
and that was good with Bush's relative lack of experience. But then
Democrats really started punishing the guy and some of that has
started to bite him. That 1980s record dropped into this
vegetarian, no-red-meat convention here in 2000. The question now
is what image takes hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, a Republican political strategist who managed Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said the Democrats have made a
tactical error in attacking someone voters will remember  &UR; tonight &LR; 
as the trusted adviser who calmly led the nation through the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney had a bumpy start, but it's nothing that won't be
overcome by George W. Bush. At the end of the day, people vote for
the top of the ticket. Cheney will be seen as a great choice who
helped solidify the base and helped in the battleground states and
will eventually help George W. Bush govern,'' said Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, has never had a reputation as a dynamo despite a
swift political ascent. By age 34, he was President Ford's chief of
staff. Next he served six terms as Wyoming's lone congressman,
including a stint as the No. 2 Republican in the House, before
President Bush tapped him to be defense secretary in 1989. For the
past five years, Cheney has headed the Dallas-based Halliburton
Co., a multibillion engineering and oil services firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bush carefully choreographed Cheney's selection, but both
campaign and candidate have struggled since.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush travels in a custom Boeing 727, the staff is still
deciding when to start coordinated travel for Cheney and his
would-be press corps. Tuesday his schedule listed one event, a
luncheon speech honoring House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. Cheney
earlier visited former President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney and Hastert started shaking hands with the luncheon
guests, one aide assembled a group of photographers to take
pictures, but another aide cut them off in mid-stride and herded
the photographers into a pen at the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, meanwhile, has the halting manner Bush displayed a year
ago when the Texas governor announced he was running for president.
</P>
<P>
   The former defense secretary makes short speeches and only
occasionally stops to take a question. When confronted with
Democratic criticisms, he sometimes struggles to recall issues.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival in Philadelphia on Sunday, Cheney made brief
remarks at a rally and then bounded off the stage, all before the
campaign staff had time to fire up confetti machines.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his re-entry into politics, Cheney smiled and
remarked: ``It's a lot of fun. It's a change of pace, different
style of operation.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with CNN, Cheney added: ``I'm glad I stepped
back onto the political stage. It's not easy, it's a tough thing to
do, but it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   That reality has been noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost think he's been off balance since he started, because
that's not his style,'' said Wyoming delegate Scott Court to a
friend as the two chatted in front of reporters before Cheney spoke
at a breakfast meeting of the state's delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney has had to start going off his game plan because
of the negatives being thrown at him,'' Court added.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Costantino, chairman of the Wyoming state party, disputed
that impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed by how quickly he seems to have gotten back
into it,'' she said. ``I watched him on the Sunday talk shows and I
was impressed that he hadn't lost one bit of his smoothness. I
think his foray into the world of business has been good for him,
but I don't think he's lost one bit of his political savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's new press secretary, Dirk van de Beek, himself in
transition after resigning last week as head of global public
relations for Halliburton, said his boss is handling the change a
lot better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cheney is always so calm, patient. He's very grounded, so
`whirlwind' is not a good word, but the things going on around him
have probably been a whirlwind,'' said van de Beek.

 &HT;    CHENEY TO JOIN BUSH ON POST-CONVENTION TRAIL
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney said Tuesday he would join George W.
Bush on a post-convention barnstorming tour targeting battleground
states in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take the battle to the heart of Democratic
territory,'' Cheney said. ``After the convention, George W. Bush
and I will be taking a train to campaign in states such as Illinois
and Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments came at a luncheon to honor House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   As he continued a round of meetings at the Republican National
Convention, Cheney also held an impromptu reunion with former
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a chief of staff in the Ford White House, said afterward
that he was very happy to get the chance to meet with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to recognize what he meant to me, because I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for Jerry Ford,'' Cheney said at a luncheon
Tuesday to honor House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who addresses the convention Wednesday night to accept
the vice-presidential nomination, said Bush has the exuberance
needed for the long fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``George's greatest strength is the ability to get others to
support his policies for the greater good,'' Cheney said. ``He is a
very persuasive man _ I did not volunteer for this job _ I said no
to him several times before I finally said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert called Cheney a seasoned and honorable political veteran
who has the experience and intelligence to represent the country
with Bush. He cited Cheney's experience in Congress, as White House
chief of staff, and as defense secretary under President Bush
during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that he was pleased to see a Republican majority in
Congress, something he never experience in his 10 years serving as
a representative from Wyoming. He also praised Republicans for the
``robust'' surplus that was he said was due to the Republican
majority in both the House and Senate.

PATRIOTS PLEASED WITH BALANCE, DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Michael Bishop was exciting, Raymont Harris was
surprising, and the Patriots defense was virtually flawless, but
standing out most in their 20-0 win over the San Francisco 49ers
Monday night was the team's discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best of teams incur penalties. There are messed-up
substitutions that leave 12 or 10 men on the field. Guys might jump
offside once or twice. Maybe there's a blown coverage or a receiver
runs the wrong route.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the teams that limit those snafus that are usually the
best prepared _ and the ones that win.
</P>
<P>
   In game management, the Patriots couldn't have been better
Monday night for a team playing its first game in a new system with
a new coach and 17 players out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick did allude to a few problems with
``communication,'' but that was just coachspeak.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, Belichick was a stark contrast to the excitable
Pete Carroll. It's not that one style is better than the other, but
in this case the style fit the philosophy: no nonsense. Notice that
players weren't celebrating after big plays as much. Notice that
Belichick's mood changed little.
</P>
<P>
   Those things have not gone without notice from the players, who
agree that the timing and execution displayed on the field was at
times better than what was seen during regular-season games last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a well-balanced game,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy.
``There was a lot of enthusiasm. We have runng backs who aren't
afraid to stick it in the hole. There were people making plays.
Belichick has done a good job with our talent. He's bringing that
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy also made the comment that Belichick had prepared the
Patriots better for this game than the team had been prepared for
playoff games in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously bringing out all of the little things that win
games,'' said Milloy. ``I think we were on the same page out there.
Sometimes that doesn't happen so early in the season. We can get
better, and that's the exciting thing _ that we can take this as a
positive experience but know we can execute even better than what
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation applied to all three units.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were tagged with only three penalties, one of them
a roughing-the-kicker call on Milloy, who tried to block a punt but
missed by a split second. That 15-yard penalty came with about four
minutes remaining in the first quarter after the defense had
stopped the 49ers on three plays. After the penalty, Willie
McGinest made three superb plays over a five-play span, two of them
resulting in sacks of quarterback Jeff Garcia. McGinest likes to
anticipate the snap count, and to do that with such precision so
early in the exhibition season was another sign of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' patchwork offensive line had only one holding
penalty, that by Jason Andersen in the third quarter. And the only
other penalty was on third-string safety Reggie Rideau for holding
in the fourth quarter. Unless it was simply a case of the officials
letting a lot of things go, the youngsters on the Patriots
offensive line were in step and certainly got the messages that
line coach Dante Scarnecchia and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis
have hammered home about technique and avoiding bad penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Coach Belichick had us well-prepared for
the first game,'' said running back Raymont Harris, who ran hard
inside as well as he did in training camp. ``We thought it was
important to get off on the right foot. It's a preseason game, but
this is our first under Coach Belichick and we wanted to make it a
good debut for him and our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Harris (58 yards on nine carries) didn't play
at all last season, and considering that he was running behind an
unfamiliar line, his timing and reads were top-shelf.
</P>
<P>
   There were other things done well, too. Adam Vinatieri made both
of his field goal attempts (21 and 39 yards), with good snaps from
Derrick Fletcher and flawless holds by Lee Johnson, who also punted
for a 47-yard average. The cover teams did allow one 32-yard
kickoff return, which is about 12 yards too much, and one 12-yard
punt return, which is also more than the coaching staff would like.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots did not turn the ball over, another sign of
strong preparation. Meanwhile, Troy Brown did force one 49er
fumble.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems, familiar ones, that Belichick will likely
harp on in limited practice sessions this week, namely third-down
conversions. This was a huge problem last season, when the Patriots
converted 35.4 percent. On Monday night, they were 4 for 11 (36
percent) on third down and 0 for 1 on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing the Patriots can gloat about is their running
game, which produced 193 yards for a 5.1-yard average. The Patriots
averaged only 89.1 yards per game last season, which severely
reduced their time of possession and put the defense on the field
for too long. While optimistic about the running game, the Patriots
haven't yet seen third-round pick J.R. Redmond, who is still
recovering from groin surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what the next four exhibition games will bring? Maybe
all of the problems of the previous regime may reemerge. But for an
exhibition debut, it was tight and efficient.

   AFFAIR-OF-LOVE-FILM (Undated) _ ``I lived a powerful love story,

by way of explaining his tender, unconventional and emotionally
charged movie about middle-aged romance, ``An Affair of Love.''
Written by his longtime friend and collaborator Philippe Blasband,
it depicts a 40-something woman and a slightly younger man who meet

   AIMEE&AMP;JAGUAR-FILM (Undated) _ Felice Schragenheim was a
high-spirited, educated, sensual, witty and wily young lesbian,
whose dangerous misfortune was to have been born Jewish in
pre-World War II Germany. During the war she lived in Berlin under
an assumed name and worked at a Nazi newspaper, feeding information
to the underground resistance. Lilly Wust, the young wife of an SS
soldier, was the mother of four boys, and for her effort in
producing such strapping young specimens of Aryan youth, she was
awarded the Nazi's Maternal Cross in bronze. She had reportedly
once said that she could ``smell Jews,'' a comment that, when it
reached Felice via a mutual friend, challenged the playful Felice
to arrange a meeting with such a person. ``Aimee and Jaguar,''
which opens August 11, is based on the true story of Felice
Schragenheim and Lilly Wust. By Nancy Ramsey.

   JEWISH-TV (New York) _ You don't get much banter in the four
Hebrew horse operas being screened August 8 at the Jewish Museum in
Manhattan. Billed as ``Wild Wild West: The Jewish Experience,'' the
program is comprised of hourlong TV episodes with Jewish themes,
including a 1963 episode of the historically dubious ``Bonanza.''
``We want audiences to look critically at the way Jewish ethnicity
has been represented on TV,'' said Andrew Ingall, the museum's
broadcasting archivist. ``The Jewish characters on these shows are
basically stereotypes. But then, all four teleplays are products of
their time.'' By Franz Lidz.

<P>
   AFRIQUE-DANCE (Undated) _ ``Le Coq Est Mort,'' an earnest but
problematic production that will open on August 9 at the Jacob's
Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., sheds light on some of the
tensions inherent in working with people from other cultures, a
practice that is gaining favor among performing artists. By
Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   STREB-DANCE (Undated) _ At a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb
introduced herself with considered clarity: ``Ten years ago I
thought of myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think
of myself as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments
in a show that I sell.'' Streb, artistic director of Streb, has
never been a typical choreographer. For her new show, ``Action
Heroes,'' Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a music-sound
score and at least the semblance of a story. Streb has gone Vegas.
Or, at least, that's where she's headed. By Ann Daly.

   EXPLORATORIUM-ART (San Francisco) _ Since the Exploratorium was
founded here 31 years ago as an innovative ``museum of science, art
and human perception,'' it has taken pride in breaking traditional
museum rules. Mixing science exhibits and artworks with little
concern about which is which, the Exploratorium encourages a
giddily high level of interactivity, inviting visitors not just to
stand and contemplate but to touch, pump, spin or otherwise mess
around with most of the 600-plus items on display. This summer,
however, a few distinguished visitors are being treated with
decidedly old-fashioned formality. By Tessa DeCarlo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SKYSCRAPER-REFORM (Undated) _ In the absence of alternatives,
there may be no more important project under way in New York right
now than David Childs' restoration of Lever House, the
International Style skyscraper on Park Avenue. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft and completed in 1952, Lever House was the first glass
curtain wall tower to rise in New York. It remains among the 20th
century's major landmarks. By Herbert Muschamp.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FAUST-THEATER (Hanover, Germany) _ There are also two souls
within ``Faust.'' ``Faust,'' Part 1, published in 1808 and a work
of both Goethe's youth and maturity, contains the well-known plot _
the bargain of the learned Doctor Faust with Mephistopheles, the
seduction of the innocent Gretchen _ that has been echoed in
novels, movies, puppet shows and several operas. ``Faust,'' Part 2,
written in Goethe's old age and published shortly after his death
in 1832, is more abstract, disjunct, and hardly ever staged. So
when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors, Peter
Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut
``Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude.

<P>
   TRAVEL-OLY-TICKETS (Undated) _ Time, something that many Olympic
athletes compete against, has turned out to be a friend to
Americans thinking of going to the Summer Games in Sydney next
month. Those who have waited before buying package tours to the
Games, which officially open Sept. 15 and continue to Oct. 1, will
find cheaper plans than were available several months ago _ in some
cases, the savings are about 50 percent. By Joseph Siano.

<P>
   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-QUEENSTREET-ART (Undated) _ Visitors to the
Olympics who need an antidote to the events and the crowds can
spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in Woollahra. The
quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques stores and a few
smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become overwhelmed with new
building and brash architecture, but Woollahra, one of the early
settlements of the colonial city, has retained its original terrace
houses, shady trees and village atmosphere. By Jane Perlez.

   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-ARTS-ART (Undated) _ Australia has
well-deserved credentials as one of the great sporting nations of
the world, but its reputation in the arts is a more recent
phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the Sydney Olympic
Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art, theater and
film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the rich and
diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place Australia's
artistic achievements in an international context. The
six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the
Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of
arts offerings. By Susan Gough Henly.

 &HT;    SECURE VISITORS CENTER TO BE READY FOR INAUGURATION -- IN 2005
 &HT;    By Rob O'Dell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after the fatal shooting of two U.S.
Capitol police officers, designs are being completed for a $265
million Capitol Visitors Center that will boost security and allow
police to better manage the flow of more than 2 million visitors a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The center will be the first planned addition to the Capitol
building since 1959, but you won't be able to see it from ground
level. The 500,000 square foot center will be built underground,
between the Capitol and the U.S. Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin in 18 months and be completed
in time for the Presidential inauguration in January 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, visitors enter the Capitol through several entrances
near the central staircase. Tour staging areas are held outdoors in
the east plaza.
</P>
<P>
   When the center is completed, most visitors will enter through
the center. A sloped entry way would be carved from First Street,
east of the Capitol, to a point in the east plaza about 100 yards
from the building. The entrance would be cut from stone in keeping
with the character of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would pass through a security screening area and enter
the Capitol underground through a connection to the rotunda. Tour
staging areas would be held in the center instead of outdoors,
providing a protected entrance and enabling police to better manage
the flow of visitors by screening them outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of outside screening was heightened on July 24,
1998, when a lone gunman bypassed the metal detectors at an
entrance used by tourists, killing the officer at the checkpoint
and another guarding the office of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, before being apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The center will also offer auditoriums and exhibits designed to
enhance the educational experience of Capitol visitors, in addition
to providing more restrooms, gift shops, and a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the visitors center occurred on June 20, as
Capitol Preservation Commission members, with commemorative
shovels, turned soil and unveiled a plaque that will be laid
commemorating the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly an historic occasion, because this is the first
time since the East front extension in 1959 that we have had a
groundbreaking ceremony on Capitol grounds,'' said House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, co-chair of the CPC. ``We have begun the process of
constructing a facility that will enable us to take better care of
those who come to visit the 'People's House'.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the center will be shared by public and private
sources. Congress has appropriated $100 million for construction.
Private support from U.S. foundations, individuals, and
corporations is expected to raise another $100 million. More than
$35 million has been received to date from private donations.
</P>
<P>
   A series of environmental and archeological tests are being done
underneath the east plaza to determine the condition of the site
where the Visitors Center will ultimately be located. A final
design report will be issued to the commission in early fall, and a
final vote on the design will occur then.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Preservation Commission consists of 19 members, nine
members from both the House and Senate, and the Architect of the
Capitol.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ No off-message dissent is being brooked at the
lock-step love-in that is the Republican National Convention, but
the careful listener can pick up faint murmurs of trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the charitable can write it off as merely ``different
emphases.'' But over the next three months, it could blow up into a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are divergent notions of the Bush campaign and the
national Republican Party leadership about how to fight at the same
time to regain the White House and to keep control of Congress.
It's a classic question that's almost always decided in favor of
the presidential candidate doing whatever is necessary to win. If
the House and Senate elections break the party's way, fine; if not,
too bad.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a bit cavalier for Republicans this year, given that
partisan control of the House really does hang in the balance. A
shift of six seats out of 435 to the Democrats would end the GOP
interregnum that began only in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, of course, would rather become president with
Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Unified campaigns
will be run in many states to that end. But as long as the
presidential race remains fairly tight and public dissatisfaction
with the national legislature remains fairly strong, Bush is
unlikely to make retaining Republican control of Congress a major
issue in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican National Committee and the
House and Senate Republican campaign operations will be spending
millions of dollars on generic ads seeking to boost the chances of
the GOP remaining in power on both sides of Capitol Hill. More will
be laid out in individual races.
</P>
<P>
   The differing views of the Bush campaign and the institutional
Republican hierarchy in Washington on this point was evident in
comments to reporters here by Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist,
and Jim Nicholson, RNC &QL; 
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicholson, Armageddon seems to be approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an historic election,'' the chairman said. ``It's really
a parliamentary election'' because the fate of all three branches
of government is at stake. Not since the days of Herbert Hoover
have Republicans controlled the White House and Congress, and had a
majority of Republican-appointed justices on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ages and health of some members of the Supreme Court,
it seems likely that the next president will fill enough vacancies
to alter the precarious 5-4 split on such fractious social issues
as abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's how much we have riding on this thing,'' Nicholson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats share Nicholson's cataclysmic view, and the threat
that they see implicit in a GOP takeover of the entire government
is already a central theme of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise then that Rove was less apocalyptic than
Nicholson in assessing the importance of the congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, we'd like to win,'' Rove said,
sounding like he was discussing a $2 ticket at a dog track.
</P>
<P>
   Rove pledged that the Bush folks will ``do our part'' to
maintain Republican majorities in the House and Senate, but he made
clear that was not the be-all, end-all for the high command in &QL; 
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Rove said, would be ``prepared to deal with whatever kind
of circumstances face him'' on the congressional front.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, in fact, spent more time laying out how Bush had worked
with a divided government in Texas and explaining how the governor
``understood the prerogatives of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   This flows from Bush's theme about returning a bipartisan spirit
of cooperation to Washington, which flows from public disgust at
incessant bickering and &QL; 
gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have developed a perverse affection for divided
government but also an aversion to the constant clashes it seems
destined to produce. So for a presidential candidate to make a
strong, sustained pitch to give his party all the reins of
government could be risky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has even shown he can light into congressional Republicans,
criticizing them last fall for trying to ``balance their budget on
the backs of the poor.'' It was a shrewd bid to distinguish his
``compassionate conservatism'' from the sledgehammer oafishness of
Tom DeLay &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton-Gore engineers the budget train wreck in September or
October that some skeptics foresee and seeks to blame the
Republicans, don't be surprised if Bush's attitude is ``a pox on
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes kicking two dogs is as easy as kicking one.

A CANDIDATE FOR NOTHING BUT UNDER 2 MICROSCOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  Here are two ambitious books on the same subject, and almost a
single theme. The subject is Rudolph Giuliani, the most famous
mayor in the world and a surprise noncandidate for Senate. And the
theme is the depth of his flaws, despite the magnitude of his
accomplishments as a mayor. The fact is that voters will not be
using the information disclosed in these works to inform any
electoral decisions in the very near future. Still, the books tell
a great deal about recent local history and the role played in it
by one of the more compelling and energetic protagonists in
contemporary politics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The books are Wayne Barrett's ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography
of Rudolph Giuliani,'' which is a major work of political
biography, and Andrew Kirtzman's ``Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the
City,'' which is merely good.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman, who covers city politics for New York 1, focuses
entirely on Giuliani's career as an elected official, with little
about his background or even his earlier career as the U.S.
attorney for the Southern District in Manhattan. If his book were
the only one available about Giuliani, it would seem a competent,
informed, fair-minded though generally critical account of
Giuliani's life in city government.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett, a veteran reporter for The Village Voice, has
written a book with broader shoulders and a deeper reach than
Kirtzman's. It is also an indefatigable accumulation of facts and
anecdotes about Giuliani guided by a muckraker's impulse to find an
unsavory maximum about him.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett unearths numerous details about Giuliani's family
background that, he contends, the mayor has assiduously tried to
keep secret, specifically that several of his close relatives,
including his father, were criminals. He analyzes his record as
U.S. attorney and finds a sizable gap between the record and the
Great Prosecutor's reputation. He goes back to Giuliani's career as
the youngest-ever associate attorney general in the Justice
Department and finds that he played a major role in devising the
Reagan administration's contradictory policy of interdicting
Haitian refugees while providing asylum for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barrett and Kirtzman aver early on that New York has become
vastly better off in the years Giuliani has been mayor. ``It is
hard to overstate the degree to which the culture of the city
changed under his mayoralty,'' Kirtzman writes. By culture he means
such matters as the extent of homelessness, the sense of lurking
danger that New Yorkers used to live with on a daily basis, the
neighborhood pornography stores that Giuliani closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett makes a similar overall judgment. ``There is little
question but that New York City has become a better place to live
on Rudy Giuliani's watch,'' he writes. ``It got dramatically safer
and cleaner. The tax load dipped and the budget surplus soared.''
But one senses a pro forma quality to that remark, which is
followed by nearly 500 pages portraying Giuliani as not just a
zealot, but so driven by his zeal that he is unaware of his own
corruptibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrogance that is like body odor to Rudy,'' he writes in
his concluding chapter, ``repellent to others but undetectable to
him, is rooted, strangely enough, in his concept of clean hands. He
is never wrong, his swagger says, because he has spent his life
uncovering and combating wrong, a knight besieged but undaunted by
the compromised, confused and corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessarily the case, contrary to an underlying
assumption in both of these books, that a flawed man can't make an
excellent mayor, but both authors do show direct connections
between the flaws _ an unwillingness to share public credit chief
among them _ and the city's problems. One important item in the
bill of indictment in this sense was City Hall's effort to push the
city's highly successful police commissioner, William Bratton, to
resign, mainly because Bratton was getting too much credit in the
press. Barrett contends that all the initiatives in the dramatic
reduction in crime that occurred in New York came from within the
Police Department. Still, he argues, Giuliani ``dumped Bratton when
polls showed that 60 percent of New Yorkers credited him, while
only 18 percent cited the mayor, for the two-year, 26.3 percent
drop in felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a relentlessness to Barrett's effort to discredit
Giuliani that gives the impression of a journalistic vendetta, and
yet there is much too much evidence in his book to ignore. (One
minor mystery is that Barrett provides footnote references for only
three of his 21 fact-packed chapters.) He details Giuliani's
unfaithfulness to two wives _ his first marriage, to his second
cousin Regina Peruggi, was annulled after 14 years. He mentions
about every sighting on the record of Giuliani and his chief press
aide, Cristyne Lategano, with whom he maintained an unseemly
closeness. ( Barrett, like other writers on this well-covered
subject, provides no hard proof of just how intimate the two were.)
He practically counts the failures of Giuliani to spend quality
time with his children.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett argues strenuously that Giuliani's record as U.S.
attorney was actually not as good as his predecessor's in that job
or as good as his rival's in the Eastern District in Brooklyn,
although he does allow that Giuliani won his share of major cases,
against organized crime and against corrupt Democratic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of Rudy's term as U.S. Attorney, he had ushered in
the end of an era: the demise of Democratic machine politics in New
York City,'' he writes. Both Kirtzman and Barrett bring the
Giuliani story up to date _ to his withdrawal from the Senate race
after announcing almost simultaneously that he had prostate cancer
and that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, were separating.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtzman's book, while not as complete as Barrett's, is modestly
more generous in some ways. He is willing, for example, to
attribute to Giuliani sincerely held values and honest convictions
even while assiduously chronicling his faults. ``Giuliani believed
that his predecessors had gotten themselves and the city into
trouble by blurring the distinction between right and wrong,'' he
writes. ``His strategy was to stake out a principle, send a
consistent message, and refuse to compromise.'' Still, Kirtzman's
detailed account of Giuliani's pained relationship with Ramon
Cortines, the former schools chancellor, is a study in manipulative
unreasonableness.
</P>
<P>
   One has the sense that there is a degree of zeal in these books
_ more in Barrett's than in Kirtzman's _ that mirrors the Giuliani
zeal and that therefore leads the authors to miss a point. The
steady listing of personal and political flaws makes one wonder how
it is that, as both authors acknowledge, New York got so much
cleaner, safer and more prosperous with Giuliani in charge. One
reads these books with interest for their huge compilations of
facts and details, and yet one reads feeling also that the answer
to that question is missing in both.

   CVN-MURRAY-CHARACTER _ PHILADELPHIA _ For Bob Flournoy, 59, a
delegate from Lufkin, Texas, the Republican Party's ``determination
to restore integrity, truthfulness and decency to the presidency
overshadows all the other issues,'' including abortion rights and
gun control. ``Personally,'' he said, ``I don't think there's a
more important issue than the issue of life, but those of us who
disagree aren't being combative or angry about it.'' (Murray, Cox
News Service)

<P>
   GA-SENATE _ ATLANTA _ Set-up for three-day candidate qualifying
period for the race for the U.S. Senate from Georgia. Story will
lead with ValuJet founder Lewis Jordan if he announces candidacy
today. The seat was previously held by Paul Coverdell, who died
unexpectedly recently. Gov. Roy Barnes appointed former Georgia
Gov. Zell Miller to serve Coverdell's term until a special election
for the seat in November. (Pruitt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

take action beyond issuing warnings. The deaths continue. A Boca
Raton, Fla., nursing home is among those being sued. (Malone, Cox

</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ George W. Bush was either, in the cliche,
thinking outside the box or not thinking at all when he picked Dick
Cheney as his running mate. Either way, no candidate before ever
thought of going to the voters in a tandem of two big oil guys from
Texas. This a balancing act akin to a one-arm high wire artiste.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While much attention recently has been paid
the demands for return of art treasures looted by the Nazis, and
while Greece continues to insist Great Britain give back the Elgin
Marbles looted from the Parthenon two centuries ago, a court ruling
in Virginia late last month has turned this type of reclamation
into a tizzy. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.)

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ PELEE ISLAND, Ont. _ Robin, in cut-offs and a
pink terry tube top, directs the action as she rolls a 40-year-old
wringer washer out of the storeroom and into the back yard. My job
is to haul hot water from the kitchen sink while Sharon and Pat
fill two galvanized rinse tubs with the garden hose. Right away I
start in whining. ``Why can't I have a cushy job like theirs?''
Robin says I can, just as soon as I finish hauling the water and
wiping off the clotheslines. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ If George W. Bush was paying attention behind the
scenes during the 1992 convention in Houston's Astrodome, he was
learning how not to win a nation's heart. You don't win it by
repeating the phrase ``family values'' every other sentence, as
speaker after speaker after speaker did in the Astro-drone. They so
cheapened an already two-bit phrase that when all was said and
drummed it couldn't have been weighty to an ear mite. (Young, Waco

   ELECTRICPOWER-SOUTH _ The FPL-Entergy marriage looks to put the

   CREDIT-CARDS _ When it comes to credit cards, gold and platinum
just don't cut it anymore with the well-heeled set. AmEx has
launched its BlackCard of Centurion Card which comes with an annual
fee of $1,000 and MBNA has launched the Quantum Card with a credit

<P>
   BILLBOARD-COMPILATION _ For the first time in Billboard magazine
history a non-soundtrack, multi-artist album debuted at the top of
the charts this week, ``Now That's What I Call Music 4.'' It's a
compilation of hits, but not of the old, K-Tel variety we used to
see advertised on late-night television. This series has pretty
recent hits, some of which are on current albums. The appeal is
obvious: It's pop radio without the commercial. But what does a
record label get out of cooperating with a project like this? After
all, it could take away from its own artists' sales. What does
Billboard think about a CD of already-proven hits charting? And
what's the chance of this U.S. phenom going the way of the
long-going British originals, which now are banned from the charts?

A RARE LEADER &HT;    By MARIANNE MEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Only rarely in history does a public figure come
along with great stature and popularity _ and no ambition to become
president.
</P>
<P>
   In retired Gen. Colin Powell, the country has such a remarkable
personage, a worthy successor to two other generals content to let
their fame speak for them _ George C. Marshall and Douglas
MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, part of their charm that although they could
not entirely escape the tentacles of presidential politics, they
never sought the office for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Powell want the presidency anyway? He's already more
widely respected than President Clinton or this year's two main
presidential contenders. Some other fellows who build national
reputations look good until they let the public adulation go to
their heads, start to pick and choose among controversial issues
and stoop to name-calling. Suddenly, they make enemies and don't
seem so perfect any more. That happened to Ralph Nader, once a
greatly admired consumer advocate and now just a millionaire
egotist running for president as a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to find other leaders to compare Powell
with. Alas, he is one of a kind. Democratic guru Robert Strauss,
former ambassador to the old Soviet Union, comes close. So do
former Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the late House
Speaker Sam Rayburn and the late Senate Republican Leader Everett
Dirksen.
</P>
<P>
   All giants, none White House occupants. But there aren't many
more.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's rare position at the pinnacle of public life was
dramatized at the Republican National Convention when no less than
Gov. George W. Bush himself, speaking via satellite, delivered a
lavish introduction to Powell's speech, an unprecedented compliment
from a future presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Powell went on to demonstrate his talent for words of wisdom,
urging greater national efforts to improve education, expand
opportunities for racial minorities and apply common sense to
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was clearly a warm-up for a role as Bush's secretary
of state, a job Powell does want.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who was President Bush's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and a central strategist in Operation Desert Storm that
forced Iraq out of Kuwait, is so universally popular that President
Clinton tried to lure him into the Democratic Party, and Dubya, as
his campaign heated up, repeatedly dangled the vice presidential
nomination. But Powell had promised his wife Alma _ who worried
that as the first African American on a major national political
ticket he might be assassinated _ that he would neither run for
president nor vice president. The Cabinet, however, is a different
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's performance was a dandy. It fit neatly into the
convention theme of kindly inclusiveness but it demanded that
Republicans really mean it . He didn't spare his audience of mostly
white delegates,
</P>
<P>
   reminding them forcefully that giving minorities a competitive
chance is an everyday task, not just a campaign-year slogan. ``Some
in our party roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that
helped a few thousand black kids get an education, but hardly a
whimper is heard from them over affirmative action for lobbyists
who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special
interests,''' he thundered. Ouch. A painful truth.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Powell was a loyal Bush backer. He could get
away with dumping a little rain on Bush's sunny parade here. In
fact, there's not much he can't get away with. Nobody can accuse
him of not being his own man.
</P>
<P>
   He also lectured the Republicans on the proper uses of military
power, warning that our armed strength cannot serve just ``the
well-to-do, the comfortable, the privileged.'' He talked about
national education initiatives that go further than the GOP
platform proposals. He is on the team, but not singing by rote from
the party script.
</P>
<P>
   Powell arrived at his invincible position the hard way _ he
earned it. He rose steadily through the military ranks before he
became a White House fellow in 1972. There, he was discovered by
Reagan and Bush administration officials who were excited to find
an articulate, discreet, intelligent and conservative black officer
capable of leading armies. Given their trust, Powell delivered. And
so did they.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of our republic, career military men often
made it to the White House. But since World War II a uniform has
seldom been a boost to a political career. Powell is so exceptional
it is difficult to compare him with past heroes.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired as a four-star general in 1993, he wrote a
memoir that sold like Pennsylvania pretzels and further enhanced
his reputation. Recently, he has directed a national project to
encourage community volunteerism to help children _ an effort that
has bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   His selfless service ranks up there with that of the great Gen.
George C. Marshall, a World War II hero who served as President
Harry Truman's secretary of state and initiated the massive postwar
aid program that rebuilt Europe and became known as the Marshall
Plan. Marshall, who had his hands full with conservatives who
feared he was wasting money overseas, had no interest in seeking
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Another great general was Douglas MacArthur, who was so popular
in his day that when Truman fired him in 1951 for refusing to
follow orders in Korea, MacArthur was greeted by cheering crowds
and a ticker-tape parade in New York City. A week after he was
fired, he addressed a joint session of Congress and delivered his
famous line that ``old soldiers never die; they just fade away.''
In 1952, some Republicans launched a boomlet for him for president,
but MacArthur discouraged it. Besides, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and
Sen. Robert Taft had the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Powell doesn't have any delegates either. He doesn't need them.
He has himself, which is quite enough.

U.S. SOLDIER SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR KILLING KOSOVAR
GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A U.S. military court in Germany sentenced a U.S.
soldier to life in prison without parole Tuesday for the murder of
an 11-year-old Kosovar Albanian girl.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, 36, who was sent to
Kosovo last summer with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th Parachute
Infantry, pleaded guilty last week to sodomizing and murdering the
young girl, Merita Shabiu, while he was on peacekeeping duty in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence is the most severe available to a U.S. military
court holding a trial in Germany, where the death penalty does not
exist. It was handed down after the girl's father and mother had
provided moving testimony about their own suffering and their
daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter welcomed the peacekeepers,'' the father, Hamdi
Shabiu, said. ``She was very happy because she thought they had
come to protect us. How do you do this to someone? He massacred my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bruised and slashed body was found in the snow on Jan. 13
outside Vitina, where Ronghi's company was based. Ronghi has said
he sodomized and murdered Merita in an abandoned building in
Vitina, before stuffing her corpse in a plastic bag and dumping it
in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what went wrong that day,'' he said in court
Tuesday, standing before a jury of six uniformed Army officers. ``I
am still trying to look for answers myself to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi had a previously impeccable record.
</P>
<P>
   Until shortly before the trial _ and despite compelling evidence
against him from another soldier in the company who witnessed his
removing the body _ Ronghi had insisted that he was not guilty and
was being framed as ``a bad guy.'' But on Friday, he abruptly
changed his plea to guilty.
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence that he had planned the killing. Citing
testimony from a fellow soldier, Capt. Alton Gwaltney, a prosecutor
said Ronghi had told fellow soldiers that he had a plan to ``grab a
little girl and rape her, but would have to kill her to get away
with it and would blame the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Remize Shabiu, wept as details of the murder
were read out in court. ``Merita is not the only one that died,''
Shabiu said. ``We all died. We are half-people now.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple have five other children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its sentence, the panel accepted the prosecution's argument
that the crime amounted to cold-blooded murder and an ignoble
betrayal of a mission to maintain security in a province bitterly
divided between Serbs and Albanians. The panel ignored defense
arguments that the sergeant should be granted some leniency because
his unit was under extreme psychological pressure in Vitina.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Kosovo, where U.S. soldiers are situated, was supposed
to be relatively safe, far from the traditional front lines between
the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the insurgent Albanian
movement. But the area proved to be as unstable as the rest of the
province and quickly became a haven for smuggling and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi was born in Niles, Ohio, the third of four children. He
is divorced. He joined the Army in 1988, serving in Egypt, Haiti
and during the Gulf War. By the time he arrived in Kosovo in late
summer 1999, he had risen to staff sergeant in Company A of his
infantry regiment. In Kosovo, he commanded about 12 soldiers
responsible for controlling checkpoints and patrolling streets.
</P>
<P>
   His company earned a reputation for aggressiveness. In late
March, after their return home to Fort Bragg, N.C., five of its
soldiers were disciplined for mistreating civilians on Jan. 9 and
10, a few days before Merita's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The defense for Ronghi alluded to those incidents, suggesting
that a ``negative command climate'' had developed in a highly
unstable situation. But the evidence that he had carefully planned
the killing proved more compelling than those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, who said he regretted what he had done and the disgrace
that he had brought on the Army, is to serve his sentence in the
United States. Under the terms of the sentence, he has no
possibility of obtaining parole.

<P>
   My first wife, Jill, and I adopted 14 children between 1983 and
1993. We had been married 11 years and already had three birth
children.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I resisted adopting; I couldn't fathom it. Jill was
initially the driving force, but then I became the aggressor. I
learned everything I could about adoption and threw myself into it.

   In our first adoptions, we brought home two little girls, Sarah
and Andrea, from South Korea in September of 1983. After that, the
floodgates started opening. Over the next 10 years, as we heard of
children who needed homes, we would adopt them. We also had another
birth child, Michael. We brought home children from the
Philippines, Romania, Brazil and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Many images stay with me from our visits to orphanages. I
remember going to Brazil in the summer of 1992, the same summer the
Magic drafted Shaquille O'Neal, and we were just flabbergasted by
the living conditions. There were countless numbers of children of
every size, shape and color, all longing for a home. They were like
goldfish, with wide eyes, like they were swimming in a bowl. Their
physical needs were being met, but they needed more.
</P>
<P>
   We came out of there wanting to adopt every kid we saw. We
brought home two from Brazil in February of 1993, Richie and
Daniela, who were both 11. Later that year, on Christmas night, we
brought home two more, Caroline, who was 10, and Alan, who was 8.
At that age, they are basically unadoptable. Most families want
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I've had wonderful help in raising these children.
We've always had a great nanny, and we have had people come in and
cook. You can learn a lot about management from managing 18 kids. I
have tried to give them each special attention, but it's a daily
struggle. I have breakfast with them, drive them to school and go
to their sporting events. But my life is demanding, and it's been
challenging to keep the thing afloat financially. Also, I usually
travel three or four times a month.
</P>
<P>
   Things certainly didn't get easier when Jill filed for divorce
after 23 years of marriage. July 5, 1995, the day I got the divorce
papers from her lawyer, was the worst day of my life. I was
flabbergasted, devastated.
</P>
<P>
   We had had many long discussions. All I can say is, she wasn't
happy. She wanted to go in another direction and start a new life.
I felt like I had tumbled into a black hole, and never felt so
helpless. Since Jill didn't get custody of the kids, I was left to
raise 18 of them by myself. This was never part of the game plan
when we had talked about adoption.
</P>
<P>
   That September, at a seminar on time management and
organizational skills, I met Ruth. I was in my mid-50s, and the
odds of a woman falling in love with me knowing that I had 18 kids?
Well, that kind of narrows the field, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   We married in April 1997. At one point last year, there were 16
teen-agers in our family at the same time. The pressures on
teen-agers are enormous today, with alcohol, drugs, rock music and
the media. It's an era of almost-anything-goes. But Little Ruth,
who has a grown daughter of her own, has helped me raise those
children, even while she has continued working and traveling. She
came to me like some kind of miracle.

BUSH STAGES RAID ON DEMOCRATIC WEST VIRGINIA (For use by New York
Times News Service clients.) By STEWART M. POWELL c.2000 Hearst
Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. With a promise to bolster the nation's
defenses, Republican George W. Bush made a pitch Tuesday to the
voters of West Virginia, a state that has a long tradition of
preferring Democrats for president. The Republican presidential
nominee touted his edge over Democrat Al Gore in the latest
statewide poll and outlined plans that could attract a hard-bitten
state of 1.8 million people where coal mining and related
industries employ nearly 150,000 and account for more than
one-third of the state's economic activity. A welcoming crowd of
several thousand on the grounds of the state capitol failed to
diminish Bush's apparent sense of awe that he could be within
striking distance of becoming the first Republican outside the
White House to capture the Democratic stronghold in 72 years. Bush,
jovially feigning disbelief, recalled the improbable invitation by
Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood to add West Virginia to the list of
swing states Bush is visiting en route to the GOP convention in
Philadelphia. ``Wait a minute
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia hasn't voted Republican for a while,'' Bush
recalled telling the West Virginia governor, a Republican. Bush
scanned the enthusiastic audience on the state house lawn and
declared: ``Gov. Underwood produces,'' adding: ``You know what? I
like our chances in West Virginia.'' The latest statewide survey in
West Virginia shows Bush leading Gore, 47 percent to 38 percent an
astonishing margin in a state that has voted Democratic in 14 of
the 17 presidential elections since the onset of the Great
Depression in the early 1930s. Ohio State University's Center for
Survey Research released the survey May 1. Bush hopes to repeat the
feat of Republican Herbert Hoover, who swept West Virginia in 1928
on his way to a 444-electoral vote landslide over Democrat Al
Smith, a New Yorker whose Roman Catholicism alarmed Protestant
descendents of Scot-Irish settlers who settled this remote, rugged
territory in the 18th century. Underwood set the tone for Bush's
remarks, which were crafted to mesh with the national security
theme at the GOP convention in Philadelphia Tuesday night. ``The
only way to get Al Gore to pay attention to veterans and national
defense is to tell him that Navy SEALS are on the endangered
species' list,'' quipped Underwood to the delight of the crowd,
which included veterans. `` ``We need a president who waves the
Star Spangled Banner more proudly than he waves the flag of
Greenpeace.'' Bush did not directly attack Gore but rather echoed
the theme of national defense, telling his audience that he would
revive armed forces' ``dangerously low morale'' by hiking military
pay, modernizing military housing and strengthening American
defenses. He also promised to end the partisan backbiting in the
nation's capital. Bush said he would be ``a uniter, not a divider''
with an administration ``that appeals to our better angels and not
our darker impulses,'' adding: ``This nation is sick and tired of
the politics of personal destruction.'' West Virginia has been more
elusive for Republicans than the four other swing states visited by
Bush before arriving in Harrisburg, Pa., Tuesday, en route to the
GOP convention on Wednesday. Those states Arkansas, Missouri,
Kentucky and Ohio last voted Republican in 1988. West Virginians
who took part in Tuesday's pre-convention rally and a historian at
nearby West Virginia University Institute of Technology said state
residents are drawn to Bush by his ``common man'' manner, his
willingness to ease environmental restrictions on coal mining
operations and his reputation as ``a family man.'' Former
three-term Republican Gov. Arch Moore said West Virginians ``do not
trust Al Gore because he represents himself too many different
ways'' and they feel ``taken for granted'' by Democrats. The
state's two senators and three House members are all Democrats.
James W. Teets, chief of staff to the state's GOP governor, said
West Virginians ``feel more at home with Bush who, coming from an
oil state understands you need a balanced approach that offers jobs
as well as protecting the environment.'' Joe Rigney, 31, a
mechanical engineer from Hurricane, W.Va., who was wearing a Bush
sticker, liked Bush's plans for ending the ``thermonuclear partisan
warfare in Washington,'' adding: ``People here are just sick of all
those verbal bombs being thrown.'' Tom Wilkerson, 71, a teenage
member of the once powerful United Mine Workers Union who later
attended law school and became a lawyer, says voters are alarmed
that ``Gore wants to shut down the mining industry with his
environmental regulations.'' Steve Brown, a historian at
2,600-student West Virginia University Institute of Technology for
27 years, said Bush is reaping the benefits of West Virginians'
readiness to punish Gore for Clinton's lapses of morality. ``People
here have a strong work ethic, a strong faith in their religion and
are attracted to Bush's reputation as a family man,'' Brown said.

CONSUMERS SPEND HEARTILY, ECONOMISTS WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in three months,
providing new evidence for economists who argue interest rate hikes
have failed to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Commerce said Tuesday that personal spending
on goods and services in June outpaced growth in personal incomes,
as it has during much of an expansion. Record employment levels
have kept consumers flush and eager to spend all _ even more than _
they earn.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
economy, rose last month by 0.5 percent, compared with a 0.4
percent increase in personal incomes in June. Spending was driven
in part by a rebound in auto sales, which drove spending on durable
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data shows an acceleration of May's activity, when
spending and incomes stayed even, each rising at a revised pace of
0.3 percent. Consumer spending rose only 0.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The June spending jump was one detail embedded in a broader
report, issued last week by the Commerce Department, which showed
that US gross domestic product expanded 5.2 percent in the second
quarter, outperforming first-quarter growth of 4.8 percent.
Economists seized on that report to argue that the Federal Reserve
has not brought growth down to a more sustainable pace _ one that
would not cause an acceleration in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June and will
meet again on Aug. 22 to consider another rate increase. Richard
Yamarone, economist for Argus Research Corp., a private firm in New
York, believes the Fed may be forced to raise rates again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty apparent that we never got a soft landing,''
Yamarone said. ``In fact, we never got a landing at all. the
economy continues to soar unfettered.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree the economy needs to slow from its
breakneck pace of growth. But, in truth, the signals are more
mixed, as is often the case in a maturing expansion. There is
heated debate among economists about whether the economy has cooled
and whether the Fed believes a seventh rate hike is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, analysts noted the jump in spending last month was
due to an oil-driven spike in inflation. The higher prices tended
to inflate what consumers paid for the goods they purchased, from
gasoline to plastic razors, economists said. The Commerce
Department's consumer spending figures, adjusted for inflation,
increased only 0.2 percent in June _ far less than a 0.5 percent
rate, unadjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Personal spending ``wasn't strong,'' said Nicholas Perna, an
economist and consultant in Richfield, Conn., citing the ``big
pickup in inflation'' in June.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a mix of signals that also include a softer housing market,
analysts agreed that the government's report on July job growth, to
be released Friday, would be a significant indicator of the
economy's strength and would be watched closely by the Federal.
</P>
<P>
   In June, total government and private employment grew only by
11,000 jobs, a tepid comeback from May, when private payrolls had
plunged. Nevertheless, economists said the job market remains very
strong, putting upward pressure on spending _ and inflation _ in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue facing Fed policy makers, as explained by
Richard Rippe, managing director and chief economist for Prudential
Securities Inc.: ``The economy is at full employment already, so if
we continue to grow at a pace faster than supply is growing _ now
that we're at full employment _ there's likely to be inflationary
pressure down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing activity remained steady in July, ending a
four-month decline, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Managers, which surveys executives who buy raw materials
and other supplies for industry. The association said its
production index was unchanged from 51.8 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial
Services Inc., said the purchasing manager's number ``was a little
weaker than expected. That's the kind of number the Fed would be
reassured by.''
</P>
<P>
   But he explained that data often conflict when an economy is in
transition, hence a strong rise in spending and second-quarter
growth at the same time there is a slowing in housing sales due to
the Fed rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the data is ``confusing,'' and economists ``have
been misled before.'' In the fall of 1998, however, the economy
began to slow but then picked up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the economy was slowing down before and it's turned
out not to. It's come steaming right back,'' he said.

REV. JACKSON URGES TREATMENT, NOT JAIL, FOR DRUG ABUSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Tuesday demanded that
Republican and Democratic leaders start sending nonviolent drug
abusers to treatment centers rather than to the nation's crowded
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 2 million people in prison. That is an international
scandal,'' said Jackson, leader of the Rainbow Coalition. Inmates
``come to prison sicker . . . and come out slicker,'' he said. ``We
have to wipe out recidivism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the main attraction at the Shadow Convention, an
alternative event organized by Common Cause, conservative
commentator Arianna Huffington, and a host of public interest
groups to focus on issues they say are being ignored by the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jackson, 80 percent of the inmates in prison for
drug arrests have been charged with nonviolent crimes. He also said
most of the people crowding the prisons are either African-American
or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Jackson, a recovering addict who attended the
standing-room only speech, agreed with the civil right's leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending drug addicts to prison really doesn't do anything but
hardens a person,'' said Jackson, of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil rights leader's fire-and-brimstone speech
contrasted to the scholarly but emotional address of retired
General Colin Powell the previous night at the GOP convention,
their messages were similar.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson echoed Powell, the Republican Party's most prominent
African-American figure, who told the delegates that blacks are
cynical about the party's opposition to affirmative action.
Jackson, who in 1984 was the first African-American to make a
serious run for the White House, said building schools not prisons
would help curb crime and violence in the country's urban
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Colin Powell was a statesman . . . I think he is
correct to stand on the platform and preach moral values,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said Powell's compassionate appeal for inclusiveness
does not reflect the conservative ideologies of the party's
leaders, such as Senators Trent Lott of Mississippi and Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, another high-profile civil right's leader
criticized the Republican's strategic appeal to minorities and
women at the convention. Sharpton, who talked to reporters as he
walked through the media pavillion Tuesday, said he was invited to
the GOP convention by Armstrong Williams, a black Republican and
radio commentator. Sharpton said Republicans were using blacks and
Hispanics to show a moderate face when most party members and
delegates are wealthy white men.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Sharpton also said Governor George W. Bush's
decision to chose Dick Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman and
former defense secretary, as a running mate is proof that the party
is not changing its views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say let's have a new game when you are playing
with your same old teammates on the field,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, however, Cheney said he would now vote in
favor of the Equal Rights Amendment, Head Start funding, as well as
a ban on ``cop killer'' bullets, issues he voted against in the
1980s.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS -- Michelle Pfeiffer's biggest problem making the
psychological thriller (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)wasn't learning her lines or even holding her own with
co-star Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   It was her buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to weigh me down because I kept floating up,'' says
Pfeiffer, whose character has a long, crucial scene in a bathtub.
``And my robe kept billowing, and so I had weights holding my robe
down and then I had this sandbag they would put on my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a member of the crew had to climb in the water with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this big guy - they called him Moose - and he would
hold me down during the scene,'' Pfeiffer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose and I became very close,'' she adds with a mischievous
grin.
</P>
<P>
   The tub sequence took two weeks to shoot, and Pfeiffer says she
was wet most of the time. But her character also played the cello,
so the actress had to find time to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how pitiful (it was),'' she says. ``I'd be in my
trailer, soaking wet with my robe on, with my wet nightgown
underneath, with my cello, with my soaked fingers, practicing my
cello like a drowned rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unglamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   The dunking aside, Pfeiffer, 43, says (beginitalic)What Lies
Beneath (enditalic)was a reach for her, especially since she had
never done a horror movie. She has always had range, playing roles
from a sultry singer in (beginitalic)The Fabulous Baker Boys
(enditalic)to a drug dealer's moll in (beginitalic)Scarface
(enditalic)to the seductive villainess Catwoman in
(beginitalic)Batman Returns(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who has twice been nominated for Oscars, made her film
debut in the teenage comedy (beginitalic)The Hollywood
Knights(enditalic), starred in (beginitalic)Grease 2 (enditalic)and
made a big splash in (beginitalic)Dangerous Liaisons(enditalic)
opposite John Malkovich and Glenn Close.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer became interested in (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)after learning that Robert Zemeckis
((beginitalic)Forrest Gump, Back to the Future(enditalic)) was
directing and that Ford had decided to star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would not have done it had it not been Bob
Zemeckis,'' she says, ``because I think these movies, the reason
they don't make so many of them is that they're hard to do, which
is why they always just resort to cutting people up when they want
to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zemeckis was happy to have Pfeiffer. He describes
her as a great actress with screen presence, a combination found
only in a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just gifted with this thing that you can't take your
eyes off them,'' Zemeckis says. ``They have power that just comes
off that screen, plus they have all this talent.''
</P>
<P>
   About Pfeiffer, Zemeckis added, ``You can't stop watching her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Pfeiffer's character, Claire, is married to Norman
Spencer (Ford), a respected researcher with a dark secret. The
truth starts to seep out as Claire begins to see the ghostly form
of a young woman and hears mysterious sounds around her house.
</P>
<P>
   Claire grows more paranoid and frightened as the supernatural
events escalate. She slowly transforms from a happy wife to a
suspicious woman to, ultimately, a frightened victim.
</P>
<P>
   Though it didn't dawn on her during filming, Pfeiffer later
realized that she was on screen in almost every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly started to think that it's just me walking around a
house for hours. It's going to be boring {hellip} but the other
character that is always with me is the camera,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Pfeiffer says, she's never experienced a
supernatural occurrence like those in the film, but she's open to
the possibility that such things exist:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have, and they're people that I really
respect {hellip} they're not crazy. So I would have to lean toward
being a believer.''

SOUTH KOREAN CONGLOMERATES STILL HAVE DEBT PROBLEMS, NEW DATA
SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ It has been nearly three years since the
South Korean government ordered the nation's largest business
conglomerates to reduce their staggering debts. But official
statistics released Tuesday showed that the debt levels of most of
the conglomerates remained significantly higher than what the
government considers acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the major conglomerates reported their debt
levels in consolidated financial statements, which bring together
all the assets and liabilities of a parent company and its
subsidiaries. Under an earlier accounting system, the true extent
of a conglomerate's debt was hard to determine, obscured by the
ability of subsidiaries to finance each other's loans.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Samsung, South Korea's second-largest business
conglomerate, and Lotte, a hotel, food and beverage group, the
nation's largest conglomerates failed to lower their debt-to-equity
ratios below 200 percent. That level, which means that a company's
long-term debts are twice as high as the vale of its stock, was
imposed by the government last year under new methods of evaluating
the size of liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the huge amounts of debt held by the conglomerates has
been a focus of the Seoul government's financial and economic
reform plans since the nation was forced to seek a $58 billion
bailout package from the International Monetary Fund late in 1997.
The debts of these conglomerates have been cited as one of the main
causes of the financial crisis and the recession that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The average corporate debt-to-equity ratio stood at 225 percent,
according to the Financial Supervisory Commission, which has been
overseeing the restructuring of the conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top four business groups, the debt-to-equity ratio of
Hyundai was 229.7 percent, LG 273.2 percent, SK 227.6 percent and
Samsung 194.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the average debt-to-equity ratio rose to 349 percent when
the highly leveraged financial units of the conglomerates were
included, with Hyundai's rising to 296 percent and Samsung's to 443
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the statistics, government officials expressed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt levels were a lot lower than we had expected,'' said
Lee Suk Jun, a manager at the commission's corporate accounting
division. ``In fact, the debt ratios, excluding financial units,
have actually gone down _ a sign we consider as a significant
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were also optimistic that the new system of accounting
for debts would lead to more effective ways to reduce them. ``It's
what we were expecting from a fully consolidated balance sheet,''
said Paulo Rhee, deputy head of chief at HSBC in Seoul. ``I'm
positive that we're seeing more transparent numbers. Now we know
more clearly what the problem areas are and the magnitude of the
debt levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said that financial support among the
subsidiaries of a conglomerate remained a problem. Jang Ha-sung, a
campaigner for minority shareholder rights and professor of
business administration at Korea University, said the level of
transactions between the same conglomerate's subsidiaries is ``a
lot higher than I thought.''

FALTERING STEPS OF A NEW SITCOM; LOOKING FOR A BOOST FROM
`SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Richards, who played Kramer on ``Seinfeld,'' has not had
an easy time producing his new sitcom. Called ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' the comedy is about a bumbling private detective,
played by Richards. It will make its debut on NBC this fall.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives considered the show's pilot episode so lacking in
hilarity that they refused to show it to critics who gathered last
month in Pasadena, Calif., to learn more about the network's fall
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With production scheduled to begin next week, the show has been
retooled. The pilot was shot by a single camera, but new episodes
will be filmed with four cameras on a traditional sitcom set and
before a studio audience. Also, Richards will be joined by new cast
members, an apparent ``Seinfeld''-like ensemble, including Tim
Meadows of ``Saturday Night Live,'' William Devane of ``Knots
Landing'' and Amy Farrington, who was most recently a guest star on
``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the production have said that the script
for the first episode also had some major problems and needed
reworking.
</P>
<P>
   But Spike Feresten, one of the show's creators, said that
despite having ``some problems with some jokes here or there,''
Richards was now quite happy with his first episode. Still, to
ensure that everything goes smoothly, Richards has ``been in the
room writing with us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the project did not have Richards as its star, all of this
retooling could be very worrisome for NBC, which, like the other
networks, is struggling to develop a new hit comedy and has high
hopes for the program. But executives there have repeatedly said
that even the original, junked pilot scored high marks with test
audiences, which are apparently still quite fond of Richards from
his ``Seinfeld'' days.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see him on television and they're excited that
he's coming back,'' said Shirley Powell, an NBC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said that executives were optimistic about the show's
future and that any changes in the scripts were a normal part of
the process of producing a new TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Feresten said that the first episode was to be shot on Aug. 18.
After that, he said, the producers will show outlines for future
episodes to network executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hope they'll see the comedy in there,'' he said.
``But there are talented writers in  &UR; that room,  &LR; too.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of time to fix any problems that may arise.
The show is not scheduled to make its debut until Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Richards was not available for comment. But when he was asked
about the state of his new show last month by the critics in
Pasadena, he said, ``There's no trouble here.''

<P>
   Looking for a `Survivor' Lift
</P>
<P>
   Is everybody at CBS happy to finally have a breakthrough hit
like ``Survivor?''
</P>
<P>
   Not if you include David Letterman, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman expressed a bit of unhappiness on the air on Monday
night during some joking cross-talk with his band leader, Paul
Shaffer, suggesting that CBS was not helping ``the whole CBS
family'' as much as it could with ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shaffer asked several times what he meant, Letterman was
not specific but did agree that his discontent had something to do
with the show's scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Letterman has called some CBS executives in Hollywood
wondering _ in what one executive called a mostly humorous way _ if
perhaps the hit show might be moved to a place that would prove
more advantageous to his ``Late Show,'' say 9 p.m. or 10 p.m,
instead of 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has set ratings records this summer, reaching close
to 30 million people on Wednesday nights from 8 to 9, including
more young adult viewers than any other show on CBS by a huge
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman has long suffered from not being able to promote his
show to many young adult viewers because so few of them watch CBS,
and his producers have long pointed out that he is at a distinct
disadvantage against his main rival, Jay Leno at NBC because of
CBS's 10 o'clock weeknight shows.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has ``E.R.'' and two editions of ``Law and Order,'' while
CBS has ``Judging Amy'' as its only real 10 p.m. hit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Survivor,'' from Letterman's point of view,
is that many of the viewers it has been attracting in droves have
drifted away from CBS by 11 p.m. On several nights Letterman made a
particular comic target of ``Falcone,'' which CBS was using at 10
p.m for a while, for driving away the remnants of that big
``Survivor'' audience.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Pope, the show's executive producer, said Tuesday, ``We
have not asked formally that the show be moved to 9 p.m.,'' though
she acknowledged that she had ``made a pitch for `Survivor II' to
be moved to 9.'' She said, ``I don't know if Dave has called
himself about it.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS plans a second round of castaway adventures _ this time in
the Australian outback _ to start in January. The network has not
committed itself to a time period for ``Survivor II,'' but
Wednesday Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said,
``It could definitely go at 9 next time.''
</P>
<P>
   He ruled out starting the show at 10 because it has a
significant audience of children.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves noted that the ratings for ``Survivor'' had always been
bigger from 8:30 to 9 than from 8 to 8:30, suggesting that the show
might be even a bigger hit if it started at 9 p.m., when more
viewers overall are available to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves pointed out that ``Survivor'' had already helped
Letterman considerably. ``We had our biggest Wednesday night in
months for Dave last week,'' he said. On that occasion CBS followed
``Survivor'' with its other summer reality show, ``Big Brother,''
and far more of the audience was carried over.
</P>
<P>
   That Letterman show scored a 4.3 overnight rating, well above
the 3.6 the show is averaging for the summer. For the weeks since
``Survivor'' started, Letterman is up about 25 percent in total
viewers over the comparable weeks last year, to about 4.35 million
from about 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly we're delighted that `Survivor' is on CBS,'' Pope
said. ``I wish we had more shows like that.'' She acknowledged that
promotions for Letterman's show run regularly on `Survivor' and
``it's very helpful to reach that young audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope said that the Letterman team was looking forward to the
night of the finale of ``Survivor'' on Aug. 23, which CBS has
turned into a three-hour ``Survivor'' extravaganza: two hours to
settle which contestant wins the $1 million prize followed by an
hourlong ``town meeting'' with the 16 original participants.
</P>
<P>
   That will lead directly into the local newscasts and then to
Letterman.

TERRORISTS FIRE ON HINDU PILGRIMS IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Apparently in an effort to subvert the budding peace
effort in Kashmir, terrorists opened fire Tuesday on an area
crowded with Hindu pilgrims. They killed at least 20 people in
Pahalgam, 60 miles south of Srinagar, the summer capital of the
Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred around sundown, the authorities said. The
target appeared to be both Indian security forces and the pilgrims
whom they were guarding. Thousands of people were in the area, on
their way to the holy cave at Amaranth, where the Lord Shiva is
worshiped in the form of a lingam-shaped ice block.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports from the police indicated that the dead included
pilgrims, Indian soldiers and two heavily armed militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, groups who do not like peace restored _ peace to
come back _ will do these things,'' said Ashok Bhan, the inspector
general of police in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest anti-India
militant group operating in the state, declared a unilateral
three-month cease-fire, setting the stage for talks with the Indian
government and the possible end to more than a decade of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Other militant groups have objected to the peace overture,
condemned the Hizbul as traitors and pledged to step up their
attacks.

PARTNERS IN DANCE MEET AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO CULTURES
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: For release Sunday, Aug. 6) 
By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Germaine Acogny was sitting in a Viennese cafe four summers ago,
smoking her pipe, when a blond woman with a broad, animated face
sauntered in. Acogny recognized her as Susanne Linke, the gutsy
German dancer she had once seen on television performing an
anguished duet with a claw-foot bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Acogny took the liberty of introducing herself, for she, too,
was a dancer of some renown. Maurice Bejart, calling her ``my
African double,'' had enlisted her in 1977 to open a branch of his
modernist dance school in Senegal, the former French colony where
she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The school, known as Mudra Afrique, ran out of money within five
years, but Acogny was ready to try again. After more than a dozen
years in France, she had decided to start a new school for
traditional and contemporary African dance in Senegal. Perhaps
Linke, she suggested, would like to come teach a workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Their chance encounter ultimately gave rise to ``Le Coq Est
Mort,'' an earnest but problematic production that will open on
August 9 at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass.
Choreographed by Linke, the 70-minute piece centers on eight
African men who cast off the trappings of Western culture and renew
their connection with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Some spectators questioned Linke's artistic vision when
Compagnie Jant-Bi, the fledgling troupe affiliated with Acogny's
school of the same name, performed it last year in Senegal, France,
Germany, Italy and Canada. The flash point was a scene in which the
dancers, who are black, cavort like apes. Linke, who is white, has
maintained that the scene is being crudely misread.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Le Coq Est Mort'' sheds light on some of the
tensions inherent in working with people from other cultures, a
practice that is gaining favor among performing artists. At the
Lincoln Center Festival, for example, the French choreographer
Mathilde Monnier recently presented ``Pour Antigone,'' her 1991-93
collaboration with dancers and a drummer from Burkina Faso and
Mali. In October the Brooklyn Academy of Music will stage ``Tree,''
Ralph Lemon's joint venture with artists from India, China, Taiwan,
Japan, Ivory Coast and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Acogny and Linke, both 56, saw their partnership as an
opportunity to forge a new alloy of West African physicality and
European expressionism. In a recent telephone interview from
Germany, Linke traced her affinity for dance _ and expressionist
movement in particular _ to her childhood. As an infant she had
meningitis, and it kept her from speaking until she was 6. Out of
necessity, she learned to communicate with hand gestures. ``That
had a great influence on my life,'' she said. ``Even now, body
language is closer to me, more natural to me, than speaking with
words. I prefer to move.''
</P>
<P>
   To develop her talent, she sought out some of the most inventive
figures in German dance _ from Mary Wigman, the pioneering
expressionist, to Hans Zullig, a successor to Kurt Jooss at the
Folkwang School, an influential dance academy in Essen. She also
danced briefly for Pina Bausch, who attended the school a decade
ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linke directed the Folkwang Dance Studio for 10 years,
and the Bremen Theater for another 6, she is best known for her
solos. Typically, they are stark portraits of women in distress,
but instead of passing off tired archetypes she achieves a
psychological depth that is eerily persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Acogny abides by a more earthy aesthetic. Speaking on the phone
from France, she likened her dancing to ``a big tree, with deep
roots and branches that reach to the sky.'' (She offers the same
metaphor in ``Danse Africaine,'' a book on technique that she
published in Germany and Senegal in 1980.) ``I'm trying to make a
connection between tradition and modernity,'' she said. ``I take
pride in my personal heritage, but still I want to go in a
contemporary direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first break came, oddly enough, when she was asked to help
``Africanize'' a platoon of drum majorettes in Dakar, the
Senegalese capital. Her fusion of stately marching and polyrhythmic
stamping caught the eye of Leopold Senghor, Senegal's first
president. A poet as well, Senghor became famous before
independence for expressing Africa's social and political mood in
lyrical French, spawning the literary movement known as Negritude.
</P>
<P>
   It was Senghor who introduced her to Bejart and marshaled the
funds for Mudra Afrique. Like Mudra (a Sanskrit term for gesture),
Bejart's school in Brussels, it took a cosmopolitan approach, with
classes in ballet, modern dance, traditional African dance,
drumming and singing.
</P>
<P>
   Money was always tight, but after Senghor left office the school
was hard pressed to continue. Acogny soon moved to France, opening
a school for Euro-African dance outside Toulouse and creating solos
for herself. Her signature piece, ``Ye'ou, the Awakening,'' won a
Time Out London Dance and Performance Award in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Senegal a few years later, she bought some land in
Toubab Dialaw, a fishing village 30 miles south of Dakar. When
Linke arrived there in 1998 for the inaugural session of the new
school, she found 28 dancers _ most of them Senegalese men _ but no
studio. The dancers stayed with local families and shared meals
prepared by some of the village women. Classes were held on the
beach or under a large baobab tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a pioneer project,'' said Helmut Vogt, a German
entrepreneur who met _ and then married _ Acogny after reading her
book 18 years ago. ``When we bought this land there was no water,
no electricity. There was only sand and stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``the energy and power'' of the dancers, Linke
returned last year to create a new work. With Acogny, she assembled
a troupe of eight male students _ six from Senegal, one from
Nigeria and one from the Congo Republic. The new company took its
name from the school; Jant-Bi means sun in Wolof, the Senegalese
dancers' native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make a dance, I always have a strong concept and
meaning in mind when I start,'' said Linke, who had never been to
Africa before she met Acogny. ``But this time I went without any
idea. Only the energy was important to me.''  &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Linke and her assistant, an Israeli choreographer named Avi
Kaiser, spent the first few weeks guiding the dancers in a series
of improvisations. For example, they experimented with leaping and
falling to get around the difficulty of turning in the sand. (Sand
became so integral to the dance that Jacob's Pillow will truck in
nearly 10 tons of it this week to blanket the stage of the Ted
Shawn Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   As themes of power, competition and war began to emerge, Linke
fashioned a narrative about a community that rediscovers its
cultural identity. The title, she said, expresses a desire to be
free of French domination, male swagger and the roosters that woke
the dancers each morning in Toubab Dialaw. (``We wanted to kill
them,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   The dance begins with eight men, dressed as diplomats or
businessmen, who traverse the sand in complex patterns, stopping
occasionally to shake hands or exchange briefcases. Eventually they
grow frustrated and, as the shrill sound of Shostakovich gives way
to spirited drumming, their stiff formal abstractions take on spry,
demonstrative quality.
</P>
<P>
   Shirtless, the men later scamper about like gorillas, with tight
shoulders, bent wrists and a bounding gait. Their reverie is
shattered by the sound of gunfire, and most of them fall to they
ground. Returning to human form, they rise and sing an anthem
associated with traditional Senegalese wrestling matches. Linke
said she used it as an exhortation to resist the homogenizing
forces of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   At first the monkey scene troubled Acogny, who feared that
audiences might take it the wrong way, and she suggested that Linke
cut it. But when they consulted the troupe, the dancers insisted on
keeping the sequence, which they liked for its technical challenges
and intrinsic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers in Toubab Dialaw voiced no complaints, Acogny said,
when ``Le Coq Est Mort'' had its premiere last year in the school's
new outdoor performance space. She said the only criticism came
from ``black and white intellectuals'' who view the dance through
the lens of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question is whether any motive can justify a
white choreographer's decision to have black dancers mimic animals.
Can an artist reasonably expect the audience to view such images
without recalling the painful narrative of slavery, colonialism and
racism?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my opinion that blacks are closer to monkeys than
whites,'' said Linke. ``To me, it's a symbol of an ancestor that we
all share.''
</P>
<P>
   To some critics, though, it doesn't matter whether the dancers
move like apes or angels; as long as a white person is calling the
shots, some exploitation is inevitable. Indeed, many artists who
have forged international creative partnerships have found the
dynamics of power far more daunting than language barriers, the
logistics of overseas travel or aesthetic differences.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Acogny attested to Linke's equitable relationship with
the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susanne never imposed things on the dancers,'' she said. ``She
always spoke with them first. And the dancers gave the
improvisations, they gave the movement phrases, and they created
the work together.'' &QL;

MUCH OF LATIN POP, AGING AND STERILE, ISN'T KEEPING PACE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: for release Sunday, August 6) 
 By PETER WATROUS     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year was a great year for Latin music, and by extension
Latin culture, in the United States, if one accepts that the
enthusiastic reception of Latin music by non-Latinos was a true
indication of the music's health. What happened, in fact, was that
some of Latin music's most popular artists _ Ricky Martin in Latin
pop and Marc Anthony in salsa _ made records in English that were
huge sellers in the United States. As might be expected, the
English-speaking press took notice.
</P>
<P>
   The attendant articles and discussions promoted the idea of a
flowering of Latin culture. The news media were discovering what
had long been obvious to marketers, advertisers and venture
capitalists: The Spanish-speaking population in the United States
was growing and asserting itself culturally through its buying
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists saw a rosy, multicultural future, in which the Anglo
majority gave up some cultural room to the Hispanic minority,
slapping them on the back and inviting them over to dinner.
Meanwhile, pessimists grumbled and waited. In their view, Latin
music in the United States was in big trouble, facing internal and
external conflicts that were largely ignored by the commentators.
And now, a year later, the fault lines have grown wider. As the
pessimists predicted, the non-Hispanic media have lost interest in
the story, and Latin music in the United States continues its
tumble toward a state of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa, the dance music from Puerto Rico and New York, offers a
case in point. It is virtually dead both in terms of sales and the
paucity of promising new artists. Where Marc Anthony, at the peak
of his success three years ago, sold 400,000 copies of his album
``Contra la Corriente,'' the newest pretender to his throne, George
Lamond, sold 41,000 copies of his album ``Entrega'' last year,
putting him in the league of a good-selling jazz artist. (By
comparison, Keith Jarrett's solo piano record ``The Melody at
Night, With You'' was a hit last year, selling 84,000 copies.)
</P>
<P>
   Latin record distributors along 10th Avenue in Manhattan are
clamoring for new records to push to stores _ and not finding any.
What is showing up, from labels large and small, is dreadful, badly
produced and profoundly out of step with the times. To appeal to
young consumers, salsa, like all pop music, must reflect their
concerns. But there are few salsa singers under 30, and none
showing much more than modest promise.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the artists' fault. The problems are systemic. In New
York, where there had been hundreds of clubs in the 1960s and
1970s, places where artists could learn how to play and the art of
dominating a room, there are now only a handful. Much the same
thing is happening in Puerto Rico. And salsa record companies are a
generation or two behind the time, selling salsa's elders, dressed
in coat and tie, to teenagers who are just as much a product of
hip-hop as they are of classic salsa. In a grave misstep, record
companies have stifled innovation in salsa, and as a result the
music has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, once the music's lifeblood, has become a major part of
the problem, sticking to imitations of years-old hits and ignoring
new, youth-oriented trends, most notably timba, the dance music
coming out of Cuba. Mega (WSKQ, 97.9 FM), the tropical station in
New York, which was in the No. 2 spot last fall, fell to No. 6 this
spring, according to the latest Arbitron ratings. Its programming
has become lackluster, the music has grown stale and,
unsurprisingly, listeners have tuned out.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening in salsa is symptomatic of the difficulties
facing all Latin music in the United States, and the reasons are
many. Latin teen-agers flex their bicultural muscles, moving
through all the musical genres available on the radio and among
their peers. It's entirely possible for a Latin teen-ager in New
York to listen to the rapper Jay-Z one minute, the rock group
Matchbox 20 the next and the reggae singer Sean Paul a moment
later. All of it is well-made pop, tailored to the dance floor. It
sounds good, translates well to radio and is on the receiving end
of lots of promotional money from record companies, much of it
aimed at the teen-age market. Teen-agers are buying the comfort of
mass success.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists, advertisers and marketers are now hedging
their bets, revising investments in the Latin market on the
assumption that assimilation may rob the market of its uniform
buying power. Experience has shown them that the influence of
national loyalty lasts one generation, then shows up only
occasionally thereafter. Latin teen-agers act just like any other
American teen-agers, voting their aesthetic preference every time
they buy music or turn on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for salsa, and Latin pop more generally, to be a
part of teen-agers' listening habits, but it has to meet their
definition of hipness (which more than ever means blackness),
danceability and both songwriting and technological sophistication.
In its current state, it comes with none of these elements. When
two second-generation New York Spanish-speaking teen-agers were
asked to name the top three salsa stars a few weeks ago, they
shrugged and said: ``There aren't any. Maybe DLG'' _ a reference to
Dark Latin Groove, a salsa group with an urban sound.
</P>
<P>
   But something else profound is happening in the world of Latin
music: It's exploding with creativity, with uncountable genres
mutating and spawning across the Americas, virtually none of which
have had commercial success in the United States. Mainstream Latin
music companies are pinning their hopes on an astoundingly narrow
group of artists, mostly pop crooners and smooth salsa singers.
This isn't to argue that pop music from elsewhere in the world has
produced an abundance of personalities, but Latin pop simply hasn't
kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, an audience for different forms of Latin music
exists in the United States, and it needs cultivation. Unlike the
United States, many of the countries of Latin America, until
recently, never developed an audience large enough to sustain the
kind of intelligent experimentalism now taking place in Latin pop
under the rubric of rock en espanol. But Latin music has failed to
develop an infrastructure to support anything but the most obvious
music like classic salsa. The success of Latin pop, for example,
depends, like much of popular culture in Latin countries, on its
relationship to telenovelas, the Spanish- and Portuguese-language
soap operas that promote glamour and escapism. An alternative
rocker doesn't stand much of a chance of using that medium, nor
does a salsa singer, especially one with dark skin.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Radio could help, but it hasn't. Rock en espanol, which over the
last several years has produced a slew of exceptional albums aimed
at a sophisticated, young audience, doesn't get played on Latin
radio, and the few commercial radio stations in the United States
that do, only do so occasionally. Without radio airplay,
disseminating the music is almost impossible. Worse, the Latin
major labels are run by people whose strengths are in marketing pop
or tropical music, and they don't really know how to market music
outside those genres. Consider ``Caribe Atomico,'' a 1998 album by
the Colombian group Aterciopelados that is a beautiful experimental
rock record and one of the genre's best. It was released by the
Latin affiliate of a major American label and sold just under
10,000 copies in the United States. Notwithstanding such failures,
bands and record labels are looking for ways to break with past
practice: The next albums by Titan, an experimental hip-hop and pop
hybrid from Mexico, and Manu Chao, a French and Spanish group, will
be released through the non-Latino side of Virgin Records and
treated as priorities.
</P>
<P>
   So as the second generation of Latins in the United States
continues to grow and develop more sophisticated tastes, the
appetite for less mainstream music is likely to expand beyond
artists in the Ricky Martin or Marc Anthony mold. Shows by bands
from Cuba in the United States used to draw predominantly Cuban
audiences; now they attract fans from across Latin America, along
with others looking for new rhythms to dance to. Ditto for
performances by rock en espanol bands. A recent show at Mercury
Lounge in Manhattan by the band Sergeant Garcia drew listeners from
France, Cuba, Puerto Rico and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This is the music of the future, with audiences that can be
cultivated. While the cracks in the Latin music industry are
getting bigger, there are encouraging signs for the music's
eventual viability in the United States. Yet the question remains:
Can an audience be found for it? If not, the marketplace will
decide and listeners will simply go elsewhere, exercising their
right to exist in several cultures at the same time, and derailing,
at least in the United States, the possibility of a real surge in
creativity.

BUSH STAGES RAID ON DEMOCRATIC WEST VIRGINIA &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. With a promise to bolster the nation's
defenses, Republican George W. Bush made a pitch Tuesday to the
voters of West Virginia, a state that has a long tradition of
preferring Democrats for president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee touted his edge over
Democrat Al Gore in the latest statewide poll and outlined plans
that could attract a hard-bitten state of 1.8 million people where
coal mining and related industries employ nearly 150,000 and
account for more than one-third of the state's economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   A welcoming crowd of several thousand on the grounds of the
state capitol failed to diminish Bush's apparent sense of awe that
he could be within striking distance of becoming the first
Republican outside the White House to capture the Democratic
stronghold in 72 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, jovially feigning disbelief, recalled the improbable
invitation by Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood to add West Virginia
to the list of swing states Bush is visiting en route to the GOP
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute West Virginia hasn't voted Republican for a
while,'' Bush recalled telling the West Virginia governor, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scanned the enthusiastic audience on the state house lawn
and declared: ``Gov. Underwood produces,'' adding: ``You know what?
I like our chances in West Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest statewide survey in West Virginia shows Bush leading
Gore, 47 percent to 38 percent an astonishing margin in a state
that has voted Democratic in 14 of the 17 presidential elections
since the onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. Ohio
State University's Center for Survey Research released the survey
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes to repeat the feat of Republican Herbert Hoover, who
swept West Virginia in 1928 on his way to a 444-electoral vote
landslide over Democrat Al Smith, a New Yorker whose Roman
Catholicism alarmed Protestant descendents of Scot-Irish settlers
who settled this remote, rugged territory in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood set the tone for Bush's remarks, which were crafted to
mesh with the national security theme at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get Al Gore to pay attention to veterans and
national defense is to tell him that Navy SEALS are on the
endangered species' list,'' quipped Underwood to the delight of the
crowd, which included veterans. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president who waves the Star Spangled Banner more
proudly than he waves the flag of Greenpeace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not directly attack Gore but rather echoed the theme of
national defense, telling his audience that he would revive armed
forces' ``dangerously low morale'' by hiking military pay,
modernizing military housing and strengthening American defenses.
He also promised to end the partisan backbiting in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would be ``a uniter, not a divider'' with an
administration ``that appeals to our better angels and not our
darker impulses,'' adding: ``This nation is sick and tired of the
politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia has been more elusive for Republicans than the
four other swing states visited by Bush before arriving in
Harrisburg, Pa., Tuesday, en route to the GOP convention on
Wednesday. Those states Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Ohio last
voted Republican in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginians who took part in Tuesday's pre-convention rally
and a historian at nearby West Virginia University Institute of
Technology said state residents are drawn to Bush by his ``common
man'' manner, his willingness to ease environmental restrictions on
coal mining operations and his reputation as ``a family man.''
</P>
<P>
   Former three-term Republican Gov. Arch Moore said West
Virginians ``do not trust Al Gore because he represents himself too
many different ways'' and they feel ``taken for granted'' by
Democrats. The state's two senators and three House members are all
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Teets, chief of staff to the state's GOP governor, said
West Virginians ``feel more at home with Bush who, coming from an
oil state understands you need a balanced approach that offers jobs
as well as protecting the environment.'' Joe Rigney, 31, a
mechanical engineer from Hurricane, W.Va., who was wearing a Bush
sticker, liked Bush's plans for ending the ``thermonuclear partisan
warfare in Washington,'' adding: ``People here are just sick of all
those verbal bombs being thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wilkerson, 71, a teenage member of the once powerful United
Mine Workers Union who later attended law school and became a
lawyer, says voters are alarmed that ``Gore wants to shut down the
mining industry with his environmental regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brown, a historian at 2,600-student West Virginia
University Institute of Technology for 27 years, said Bush is
reaping the benefits of West Virginians' readiness to punish Gore
for Clinton's lapses of morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have a strong work ethic, a strong faith in their
religion and are attracted to Bush's reputation as a family man,''
Brown said.

TRACING AN AFFAIR FROM END TO BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: for release Sunday, August 6) 
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I lived a powerful love story, I understood nothing
about it, and I needed to delve into my questions in a film,'' said
the Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne, by way of explaining his
tender, unconventional and emotionally charged movie about
middle-aged romance, ``An Affair of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says the film, which has been acclaimed in Europe and
which opens here on Friday, is not autobiographical. Written by his
longtime friend and collaborator Philippe Blasband, it depicts a
40-something woman and a slightly younger man who meet in Paris
through a personals ad that the woman has placed in order to
fulfill a particular sexual fantasy. The characters never tell each
other their names, nor do they (or we) have any information about
their respective backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   We also never see the enactment of the fantasy that brings them
together: for the most part, the camera stops outside their
hotel-room door.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of their encounters, the couple fall in love.
But we are not allowed to hope that their relationship will work
out: interspersed with the flashbacks of their affair are
interviews in which each character, alone, talks about the
now-ended liaison. Each tells a slightly different story.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which was called ``A Pornographic Affair'' in its
European release, stars the French actress Nathalie Baye and the
Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. Baye was named best actress at the 1999
Venice Film Festival and the film earned the distinction of opening
the New Directors/New Films series this spring at the Museum of
Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film has a lot of interesting levels,'' said Richard Pena,
program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which
presents New Directors with the museum. ``What is going on, what
the characters say is going on, and then what we think is  &UR; really
 &LR; going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonteyne, a quiet 32-year-old with the burly build of a
lumberjack, looks as if he would be more at home directing a buddy
film (which he did for his first feature) than delivering a
mysterious, intimate take on a thwarted midlife love affair. Part
of a Belgian cinematic flowering that began in the early 1990s with
offbeat films like ``Man Bites Dog'' and culminated in the first
Belgian Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes International Film Festival
(for Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne's ``Rosetta''), Fonteyne shares
the ironic bent of his compatriots Benoit Mariage (``The Carriers
Are Waiting'') and Alain Berliner (``Ma Vie en Rose'').
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their movies, ``An Affair of Love'' is an out-and-out
love story, springing from Fonteyne's fascination with the
unresolved romance in his own past. ``The film asks questions about
what love is, but also explores how you talk about a love story
once it's finished,'' he said, speaking in French, while in New
York for the New Directors series. ``I wanted to film the pain and
pleasure of recollection _ like a jewel in a box that you peek at
before you close it again.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the greatest irony in ``Affair'' is that the couple
separate not from loss of love but because they fatally
second-guess each other. ``I'm interested in how people talk to
each other, and how do they  &UR; not  &LR; talk to each other,'' he said.
``When you explore communication, you also have to explore the
moments when it breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   By starting with the end, and by withholding background details,
the film does away with many of the usual hooks of narrative.
Instead, it focuses on the poignant contrast between experience and
memory, and on the shifting sands of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the characters he wrote remain anonymous,
Blasband said he ``wanted to make this story as pure and elemental
as possible.'' He chose Paris as a setting, he said with a laugh,
because ``Brussels is such a small town that it would be difficult
to have an affair here anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   Blasband's original title, ``A Pornographic Affair,'' was a
reference to the sexual nature of the couple's tryst. But the title
proved troublesome for some European audiences, who stayed away
thinking the film might be porn. Those who have seen the film
sometimes have the opposite reaction, Fonteyne said. They ask him
why he did not show (or tell) the couple's sexual fantasy outright.
His reasons have nothing to do with coyness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fantasy is a completely private thing,'' he said. ``The
strongest way to convey it is by a closed door. We wanted to do an
erotic film where the eroticism exists not just in the sex scenes
but also when the characters look at each other and think of their
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when we finally see the couple make love _ without the
fantasy _ the impact comes from everything we haven't seen before.
Fonteyne's approach to eroticism is clearly different from the
explicitness of such filmmakers as Catherine Breillat (who directed
the recent French film ``Romance''). But, as a Belgian filmmaker,
he said, ``I did not want to do a typical French film about love.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what distinguishes the Belgian point of view, he
responded: ``I think it's in our slightly skewed sense of humor.
Belgium is such a strange country, with its two languages and
cultures; we're always at the point of the absurd. I also think
that there's a realist side to our films, the opposite of
glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   This gritty humor surfaces in scenes like the one where the
characters first meet. In a painfully funny moment, Baye's
character, who is nervous, starts talking about her longtime quest
for a hairy man. As she recounts her saga in great detail to the
astonished Lopez (who, fortunately, fits the bill), it becomes
clear that we are far from a chic, Gallic-style first encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That human tone is one of the things I really liked about this
script,'' Lopez said from Madrid. ``So often, the man feels he must
take the initiative. But in this film, there is no power struggle:
the man accepts and enjoys the woman's strong personality.''
 &UR;  &LR;  Fonteyne had long wanted to work with Baye, who is one of
France's most famous actresses and who has starred in such films as
``The Return of Martin Guerre.'' Baye, in turn, loved the
character. ``It's rare to have a role of that beauty when you've
passed 40,'' she said, on the telephone from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Fonteyne surprised everyone by casting Lopez as his leading
man. The Spanish-born Lopez (who speaks French in the film) was
well-respected for films like ``Western'' but was not widely known
for romantic roles. ``I wanted to put together these two people who
seem to have nothing to do with each other, and see what happens,''
Fonteyne said. ``Sergi didn't even know who Nathalie was, but there
was a real curiosity and openness between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the film was scripted, Fonteyne had Baye and
Lopez improvise some of the interviews. Since the two actors did
not know their characters' backgrounds, what became important to
them was, as Lopez said, ``playing people caught entirely by
surprise by love.'' In their duet-like scenes, they relied upon
Fonteyne's sense of balance. ``The three of us had a real
complicity,'' Baye said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederic may be young, but he has a powerful emotional
gauge,'' she added. ``He would listen intently until what we were
playing rang true inside him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his friends, Fonteyne has always combined his
ability to listen with a quiet stubbornness. As an introverted
teen-ager, he thought about becoming an artist. His father was at
that time the artistic director of an advertising agency; his
mother, who is Hungarian, had fled to Belgium as a young girl
during the Hungarian uprising of 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Fonteyne ended up going to film school (at the Institut des Arts
de Diffusion in Louvain-la-Neuve), where he met Blasband and,
through him, Patrick Quinet, who is his producer and who founded
the Brussels company Artemis Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The trio are like a youthful Three Musketeers of Belgian cinema
_ and, indeed, soldierly grit is needed to get a film produced in
Belgium. Even now, the paucity of domestic financing for cinema
restricts the production of Belgian films to a handful a year, and
requires most films to be international co-productions. In 1997,
Fonteyne finally managed to direct his first feature, ``Max and
Bobo,'' about the tormented friendship between a hairdresser and a
hobo. ``Max'' flopped at the box office, but Fonteyne hardly
blinked before embarking on ``An Affair of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his second film, he is pausing for breath. ``I
did my first two films so fast,'' he said. ``I've said to myself
that I will stop for one year and think about things, and just
live. And I'm sure that my next film will be completely different.
I've done my version of a love story now; I don't need to continue
to do love stories all the time.'' He laughed. ``I still may not
understand love, but at least I can now talk of other things.''

 &HT;    Ta-da! Laptops without wires
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The office increasingly is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But to really take work on the road, you need a wireless
connection as fast as the wired service you have in the office. So
far, in Atlanta, nobody has offered that.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Ricochet, a service launched in Atlanta this week by
Metricom, a California-based company that is building a national
wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Using a network of shoe-box sized transmitters fastened to
telephone poles all over close-in metro Atlanta, Ricochet claims it
can give users of laptops and other computers a fast, wireless
connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed in metro Atlanta by Juno and Wireless Web Connect, it
offers one more way for millions of people to keep tethered to
work, staying more productive as they cart the office home, carry
it on the road or pack it alongside swim gear for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry into companies trying to tap into a market
potentially worth billions of dollars, Metricom is an ambitious,
well-financed operation with backing from the likes of WorldCom and
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   So far the market has been dominated by wireless telephone
companies like Sprint, Nextel and Southern LINC, which offer
Internet access on handsets or through the phone to a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Other devices, including personal digital assistants like the
Palm Pilot and interactive pagers like those from BellSouth, now
also offer on-the-move e-mail and _ in some models _ Web access as
well.
</P>
<P>
   They can be powerful tools. But each has weaknesses, too. A
phone's tiny screen, for example, mandates a pared-down Internet
experience. A PDA screen is a little better, but it's not made for
writing in-depth reports.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology is improving _ all are still molasses slow
compared with the high-speed connections used in many offices. And
a user generally pays by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricochet is a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman, Chief Executive and President Timothy Dreisbach said
Metricom's market is the growing number of mobile workers who want
full, fast, computer access to the Internet wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is giving people _ the mobile professional _
the freedom to be outside the office and access all the information
they have in their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Metricom is 15 years old and has been operating a lower-speed
version of its network in San Francisco, Seattle and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   It must install new equipment to operate the higher-speed
version, so it's going into new markets first. First was San Diego,
July 21. This week, it is Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom has placed about 2,700 small transmitters on phone
poles throughout metro Atlanta, covering most of the area within
I-285. Each takes less than 10 minutes to install.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitters are not connected to wires. Instead, the modem
on your laptop finds the closest transmitter and links up via a
wireless signal. Messages from your laptop are then divided into
packets of data and sent. Those data packets will be shuffled from
one transmitter to another, taking a variety of routes toward their
intended destination. Each will contain an address, which will tell
the system where it should go so that the pieces can be reassembled
in the right order at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, the same technology protocol used in the
Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom, which has only about 10 employees in its Marietta
office, put up the equipment here using scores of contractors. The
network itself is monitored from Plano, Texas, where technicians
are supposed to identify at once any transmitter that goes haywire,
then have the local folks take care of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom's service has some potential weaknesses too. It is not
everywhere, and if you take your laptop outside the range of the
transmitters, you lose your connection.
</P>
<P>
   And just calling it ``high-speed'' doesn't make it equal to the
speediest of the speedy. It is a bit slower than high-speed lines
like a T-1 that deliver data to many offices at 1.5 Mb per second.
But it's a whole bunch faster than a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   The company guarantees transmission speeds of 128,000 bits per
second, but says the network is capable of transmitting data at 1
Mb per second. That's compared to dial-up modem speeds of 56,000
bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   At about $75 a month, it's not a service for the average
consumer. But then, the target market is made of the same people
likely to be working on laptops or considering buying other kinds
of wireless Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom cites estimates by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce that the area is now home to about 220,000 high-tech
employees. Then there are tens of thousands of professionals, from
chief executives to lawyers, who rely on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that seeming dependence on the money-centric technology
sector of metro Atlanta's Northside, Metricom says its service will
not be limited to high-income areas. After all, there are
technicians of various kinds _ from meter readers to tow truck
mechanics _ who might be more productive with continual access to
messages.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already run ads in national newspapers touting
itself and Ricochet. In Atlanta this week Metricom will be running
messages on radio, billboards and signs on buses. The companies
that will actually sell the service are also expected to start
advertising.

U.S. SOLDIER SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR KILLING KOSOVAR
GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (SUBS to restore `Ms.' to 2nd graf before optional trim) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A U.S. military court in Germany sentenced a U.S.
soldier to life in prison without parole Tuesday for the murder of
an 11-year-old Kosovar Albanian girl.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, 36, who was sent to
Kosovo last summer with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th Parachute
Infantry, pleaded guilty last week to sodomizing and murdering the
young girl, Merita Shabiu, while he was on peacekeeping duty in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence is the most severe available to a U.S. military
court holding a trial in Germany, where the death penalty does not
exist. It was handed down after the girl's father and mother had
provided moving testimony about their own suffering and their
daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter welcomed the peacekeepers,'' the father, Hamdi
Shabiu, said. ``She was very happy because she thought they had
come to protect us. How do you do this to someone? He massacred my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bruised and slashed body was found in the snow on Jan. 13
outside Vitina, where Ronghi's company was based. Ronghi has said
he sodomized and murdered Merita in an abandoned building in
Vitina, before stuffing her corpse in a plastic bag and dumping it
in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what went wrong that day,'' he said in court
Tuesday, standing before a jury of six uniformed Army officers. ``I
am still trying to look for answers myself to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi had a previously impeccable record.
</P>
<P>
   Until shortly before the trial _ and despite compelling evidence
against him from another soldier in the company who witnessed his
removing the body _ Ronghi had insisted that he was not guilty and
was being framed as ``a bad guy.'' But on Friday, he abruptly
changed his plea to guilty.
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence that he had planned the killing. Citing
testimony from a fellow soldier, Capt. Alton Gwaltney, a prosecutor
said Ronghi had told fellow soldiers that he had a plan to ``grab a
little girl and rape her, but would have to kill her to get away
with it and would blame the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Remize Shabiu, wept as details of the murder
were read out in court. ``Merita is not the only one that died,''
Ms. Shabiu said. ``We all died. We are half-people now.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple have five other children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its sentence, the panel accepted the prosecution's argument
that the crime amounted to cold-blooded murder and an ignoble
betrayal of a mission to maintain security in a province bitterly
divided between Serbs and Albanians. The panel ignored defense
arguments that the sergeant should be granted some leniency because
his unit was under extreme psychological pressure in Vitina.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Kosovo, where U.S. soldiers are situated, was supposed
to be relatively safe, far from the traditional front lines between
the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the insurgent Albanian
movement. But the area proved to be as unstable as the rest of the
province and quickly became a haven for smuggling and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi was born in Niles, Ohio, the third of four children. He
is divorced. He joined the Army in 1988, serving in Egypt, Haiti
and during the Gulf War. By the time he arrived in Kosovo in late
summer 1999, he had risen to staff sergeant in Company A of his
infantry regiment. In Kosovo, he commanded about 12 soldiers
responsible for controlling checkpoints and patrolling streets.
</P>
<P>
   His company earned a reputation for aggressiveness. In late
March, after their return home to Fort Bragg, N.C., five of its
soldiers were disciplined for mistreating civilians on Jan. 9 and
10, a few days before Merita's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The defense for Ronghi alluded to those incidents, suggesting
that a ``negative command climate'' had developed in a highly
unstable situation. But the evidence that he had carefully planned
the killing proved more compelling than those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, who said he regretted what he had done and the disgrace
that he had brought on the Army, is to serve his sentence in the
United States. Under the terms of the sentence, he has no
possibility of obtaining parole.

BRADY GUN-CONTROL ACT HAS NOT REDUCED MURDER RATES, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the Brady law requiring background
checks of handgun buyers reduced homicide rates after it went into
effect in 1994, according to a study published Wednesday in The
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study, Philip Cook, a professor of public
policy at Duke University, and Jens Ludwig, a professor of public
policy at Georgetown University, suggested that the reason the
Brady law did not reduce homicides, most of which are committed
with guns, was because it did not go far enough. The law requires
background checks only for those who bought handguns from federally
licensed firearms dealers, and does not cover the large unregulated
market involving an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of all
sales, like gun shows and private transactions, where criminals and
juveniles often buy handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's conclusion was immediately challenged by the
Clinton administration, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, the
gun control group that helped push for the Brady law, and by other
researchers who said the study was misleading and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Johnson, the undersecretary for enforcement at the
Treasury Department, said Justice Department figures have shown
that crimes committed with handguns fell 52 percent between 1993
and 1998, which is twice the rate of crimes overall. The Brady law,
new uses of crime gun tracing by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms and other efforts directed at guns all led to the drop,
Johnson said. ``We think there has been a significant contribution
by Brady,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Weil, director of research at the Center to Prevent
Handgun Violence, said the new study was flawed because it only
measured whether homicide rates in the 32 states that did not have
background checks and waiting periods to purchase handguns before
the passage of the Brady law showed a greater decline than the 18
states that already had such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Weil said, this did not allow the authors to
measure how big an impact the Brady law had on interstate gun
trafficking, in which states that previously had no background
checks or waiting periods had long provided a ready source of
supply for traffickers who illegally resold guns in states that did
have such restrictions. For example, after the implementation of
the Brady law, Weil said, he found that some states with lax gun
laws, like Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina and Ohio, were as much
as 86 percent less likely to be the sources of guns used in crimes
in states like New York, New Jersey or Illinois that already had
restrictive laws.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore this point, Johnson said that 44 percent of the
ATF's investigations of gun trafficking cases involved guns being
sold illegally from one state into another. Therefore to gauge how
much the Brady law reduced homicide, a study would have to look
nationwide, not just compare those states that already had
background checks before 1994 with those that had to implement them
under the Brady act, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Weil said, there has been a sharp reduction in the
percentage of robberies and assaults committed with guns since the
Brady law went into effect, saving an estimated 9,368 lives from
1994 to 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Separately, two studies by Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the
Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of
California at Davis, have found that California laws requiring
background checks of convicted felons and criminals who committed
violent misdemeanors reduced crimes committed with guns by 25
percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute, in another study, also published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association, found strong new
evidence that a small number of federally licensed firearms dealers
are responsible for a disproportionate number of handguns that end
up being used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF has reported that of the 83,272 federally licensed
dealers in 1998, 1.2 percent, or 1,020, sold 57 percent of the guns
used in crimes that the agency was able to trace. The gun industry
has complained that this finding is unfair, because the ATF was not
able to distinguish between large stores, with high sales volumes,
and dealers who were knowingly selling to traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But Wintemute found that 8.6 percent of dealers in California
sold 82.7 percent of all handguns used in crimes there in 1998,
though these same dealers accounted for only 33.2 percent of all
handgun sales during the period from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the gun industry trade association, said the gun
industry ``absolutely supports'' more tracing of guns if there are
corrupt dealers selling to criminals. But he cautioned that there
might be other explanations for so many guns being traced back to a
dealer. For instance, Delfay said, some cities still do not trace
all guns used in crimes, so the existing data may be misleading.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    WHY PARTY PLATFORMS DON'T REALLY MATTER
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JANE ELY
 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Political eons ago, when the Democrats dominated
Texas politics, ideologues who managed to become convention
delegates and wanted their party to reflect their causes usually
found themselves shuffled off to make their cases to the
Resolutions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when it came time to consider resolutions, you almost
could hear the train coming through the convention hall as the one
running this political railroad would take a motion to refer
resolutions to the party executive committee, rule it passed and
instantly bang the gavel to adjourn the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1972, the year of George McGovern, did the action change
as the liberals won enough seats to spout every cause and to drag
the doings into the night.
</P>
<P>
   After that, no matter which philosophy dominated the Dems, they
tended to devote little time to arguing ideology. In fact, they
even trended to reducing their national platform to the most
general of statements, written in the briefest _ and pretty much
the blahest _ of language.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a lot longer coming, but, at last, the Republicans
actually may be _ barely _ starting to go through the same
evolution in writing their ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: The platform, which, in comparison to GOP
documents of recent decades, virtually sailed through the
Republican National Convention here, is certainly not brief, and it
absolutely is not blah.
</P>
<P>
   But, for GOPers, especially those as conservative as most
delegates here, there were a fair number of concessions made in
ideology for the sake of George W. Bush, their certain presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the approved platform does BEGIN ITAL not END ITAL
call for the elimination of the Department of Education, nor does
it contain a lot of the harshness of platforms past.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in obvious concession to Bush, it warmly welcomes
minorities and immigrants to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it sternly sticks to its GOP guns by emphatically
opposing abortion, gay rights and sex education. It covers pages
with the most tedious of details demanding the delegates'
particular wishes and ways be foisted onto all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document leaves one question in particular
unanswered. That is: Is the GOP actually on its way to ultimately
recognizing the reality the platform of the party seldom is truly
the platform of the candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Are Republicans moving to realize that never is a candidate, nor
an elected officeholder, driven purely by the document contrived at
political conventions?
</P>
<P>
   For example, it's one thing for a president to subscribe to the
general tone of his party's platform. It's quite another for him to
expend political capital to achieve what the document dictates. One
has but to look at Ronald Reagan and abortion to recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   By all sane political definition, George W. Bush is a
conservative. Only the most ardent of conservative zealots _ and
there surely are some of those here _ would question it.
</P>
<P>
   But not even they can muster the power or the pure political
guts to do much more than mumble their unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   It is little consolation to those who once again tried in vain
to remove the unyielding anti-abortion language from the GOP
platform, but they can take some relief in knowing lots of
ideologues of polar positions failed to win their ways here as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even Bush, who totally has dominated this confab even
though he has not yet been here, clearly has not had his full way
in the contents and ideology of his party's political platform.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is: While lots of Republicans won their ways in
having input into the party platform, Bush won the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he leaves here to begin _ fully and formally _ his
Republican presidential campaign, GWB may not even have read the
platform produced here.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if modern political tradition prevails, the only ones
besides the most intense Republicans who will read the GOP platform
are the most intense Dems.
</P>
<P>
   And they, just like GOP zealots, will try hard to convince the
nation Bush embraces every word of the platform and will follow it
to the letter if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is most voters won't have read the GOP
platform either. The platform they care about is the one for which
the candidate stands _ not the convention delegates. &QL;

   The expense provokes another puzzle for the professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many stores use rules like, we have to have 100 percent markup
on everything we sell,'' Nalebuff noted. ``And that rule doesn't
take into account the cost of making the product. If our drink
costs 75 cents to make and someone else's costs 50 cents, they will
sell ours for $1.50 and theirs for $1. Interestingly, the store
makes 50 percent more on our product than on the other, but they
don't always see the advantage of selling our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest Tea had its origins in a question Nalebuff posed to a
class one day in 1995, when Goldman was among the students sitting
in the lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, `Why isn't there a normal product for the rest of
us?''' recalled Nalebuff, a longtime drinker of iced tea. ``You can
have 200 calories, or you can have zero calories with NutraSweet.
But if you believe in declining margin utility, why isn't there a
product out there with 10 to 20 calories? Anyone can handle that.
It's fewer calories than a carrot.'' A teaspoon of sugar enhances
the flavor of tea, he believes, ``but by the time you put 16
spoonfuls of sugar in, it's worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goldman, the point reverberated one afternoon about two
years later, after a hot, sweaty run in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into one of these cafes, and there was nothing to drink
that quenched my thirst,'' he said. ``I sort of banged on the table
and said: `That's it. We have to do something about this.'''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, he sent Nalebuff an e-mail message asking if he
was still interested in that soft drink idea he had mentioned in
class. Coincidentally, Nalebuff had just returned from India, where
he had tried unsuccessfully to sell the owners of Tata Tea Ltd. on
the idea of starting a line called Honest Tea. It was not
Nalebuff's first global business concept that failed to catch on.
Earlier, he had wanted to sell fortune cookies to the Chinese, with
each cookie containing an English lesson.
</P>
<P>
   What flopped in India, however, received the red carpet
treatment back in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he told me the name Honest Tea, I felt like that was it,
the angels singing,'' Goldman said. ``It was a product I wanted to
create.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, was the easy part. The partners _ Nalebuff
is chairman of the company, Goldman the chief executive, although
Nalebuff insists on referring to him as the ``TEO'' _ struggled to
find a plant that would produce their product their way. They
eventually set up their headquarters in Bethesda, Md., where
Goldman is a daily presence and Nalebuff is on call from New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   They tried making tea in a giant tea bag, which was actually a
laundry bag converted for the purpose. In one of the early rounds,
the bag burst and spattered wet tea leaves all over the factory.
Eventually they settled on a custom-made tea ball, an
industrial-strength sphere of stainless steel that allows the tea
to be steeped as long as necessary, to get the desired flavor.
</P>
<P>
   They developed partnerships with suppliers like the Crow Nation,
which provides the Montana-grown peppermint leaves that are used in
one flavor. They flirted briefly with using other names for the
company _ Perspicaci-Tea and Golf Tea were among the possibilities,
Nalebuff said _ and at one point got a mildly threatening letter
from lawyers for Nestle, which owns the Nestea brand and thought
that Honest Tea might be misread as ``Ho Nestea.'' (Making the
product's name into one word for trademark purposes, although it
appears as two words in the marketplace, seems to have eliminated
the problem.)
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts have speculated that Honest Tea will have
a hard time building the kind of market share that will keep it
viable for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to convince distributors who already
have trucks filled with strong products to make room for another
product, and that's not easy,'' Sicher said. Still, he noted, some
small companies do figure out a way to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Honest Tea founders are optimistic, pointing to anecdotal
evidence that their product has appeal beyond the obvious health
food store and gourmet-deli circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Kurtis and I am a truck driver,'' read an e-mail
Goldman recently received from a man who called himself ``a
completely addicted iced tea junkie.'' The message continued: ``I
stopped at the T/A truck stop at Antioch, Ill., and found your tea
in the cooler. The info on the label caused me to buy three
different bottles. It was mind blowing different.'' He closed by
informing the company that its products could not be found in
central Illinois, and begged to have his hometown become a test
market.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tests, the Honest Tea partners leaped at the chance
to grade each other's performance in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Nalebuff, the professor, said he would give Goldman an A+ for
his work on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, describing Nalebuff's role as ``more analytical on a
day-to-day basis,'' awarded him an A. ``The ideas are always
creative,'' the former pupil said. ``Barry is an out-of-the-box
thinker. Of course, some ideas are in the box for a reason.''

<P>
   It hardly seems the stuff consumer thrills are made of: a weak,
watery tea, brewed the old-fashioned way, with hardly any sugar and
even less caffeine. Marketing? There is almost none. Edgy
television ads and celebrity endorsements? Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Seth Goldman and Barry Nalebuff started Honest Tea
two years ago, in part to fill what they saw as a neglected market
niche and in part to make a point, they were well aware that they
would be competing against mass-marketed sweetened iced teas made
by the Coca-Colas, PepsiCos and Snapples of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beverages mixed up to address a specific target market are
nothing new: Microbreweries making specialty beers ran long and
hard with the concept. But the beverage industry is especially
tough on new brands; even Coke and Pepsi have stumbled over the
years while trying to induce consumers to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably hundreds of beverages introduced around the
country every year, and most do not succeed,'' said John Sicher,
publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. ``This is a huge
market that requires a great tasting product, good marketing, lots
of money and good distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   As luck, or insight, would have it, when Honest Tea started
landing on store shelves, consumers were showing a distinct
preference for bottled water and other beverages perceived to be
more healthful. And for all it did not have, the founders saw their
product is distinct enough from established brands to attract a
different customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to compete against the big companies on their
terms, unless we won the lottery, we would be finished,'' said
Nalebuff, a professor of game theory at the Yale School of
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and Goldman, a former pupil of his and an alumnus of
the Calvert Group, the largest sponsor of ``socially responsible''
mutual funds, decided to set their own terms. They would make an
iced tea that promoted the tea flavor and would be naturally low in
calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing was, why hadn't anyone else done this?''
Nalebuff (pronounced NAIL-buff) said. ``It wasn't rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   They steered clear of artificial sweeteners; and their
philosophy on sugar was that less was more. Their tea leaves had to
be of high quality, and therefore costly. They promoted the teas
through trade shows and presentations to supermarket chains. They
included a Web site, of course (www.honesttea.com), and printed a
toll-free number, (800) 865-4736, on labels for consumer feedback.
</P>
<P>
   The two partners used their own money, as well as financing from
friends and family, to amass the $507,000 needed to get the company
going in early 1998. Since the product went on the market that
year, $2.7 million more in financing has been raised, mostly from
passionate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution, always tricky in the beverage business, has been a
patchwork arrangement, encompassing everything from driving their
own U-Hauls to piggybacking the product onto delivery trucks
belonging to a corned beef company with lots of deli connections.
Offering samples has been a cornerstone of the marketing strategy,
as it is with many small companies. With sales expected to reach
$3.5 million this year, the company anticipates its first brush
with profitability.
</P>
<P>
   For Nalebuff, 41, the development of Honest Tea has been an
eye-opening foray into the real world of supply and demand, a world
that few academics experience day in and day out. For Goldman, 34,
whose role in the company may have been presaged in childhood (his
parents are scholars of Russia and China, two cultures that
appreciate a properly made cup of tea), it has been an opportunity
to apply what he learned in graduate school. It has also been a
chance to see his former teacher in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry's reputation at Yale was as a very hard-nosed,
cold-calling professor,'' Goldman said. ``You'd walk into the room,
there would be a case study, and someone would be called on and put
in the hot seat for most of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   He now sees Nalebuff as a supportive colleague. ``A lot of
students, when they heard that I was going to partner with Barry,
said, `What is it like to have to go through that every day?' For
me, he has been only affirming and encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``A lot of professors are getting involved in start-up
companies. But how many of them really put money into them? And
when Barry goes to bed at night and when he wakes up in the
morning, he's thinking Honest Tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Nalebuff said he had been surprised to learn how hard it was to
put some of his own theories to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written a book on cooperating with the people you compete
with, and it's easy to say that,'' he said, ``but in practice it's
much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a competing brand wanted to make tea at the same
bottling plant Honest Tea uses, and even wanted to try the same
technology, the brainchild of Nalebuff and Goldman. ``We decided
that eventually they would figure out how to do this on their own,
and we would be willing to help speed up the process for the right
amount of money,'' Nalebuff said.
</P>
<P>
   They made a deal.
</P>
<P>
   To create a product consistent with their vision, the partners
insisted on a specific manufacturing process, on applying socially
responsible principles to how and where they bought their raw
materials wherever possible, and on emphasizing quality over
quantity. Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, the ice cream company that
Unilever PLC agreed in April to buy for $326 million, is their
corporate role model _ not for the takeover, but for the business
principles, which include encouraging minority businesses to become
suppliers and finding other ways to enhance society from the
corporate quarter.

STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM INVESTMENT MADE BY MERRILL LYNCH 12 YEARS
AGO

 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twelve years ago, Merrill Lynch chose 251
first-graders at random from some of the toughest neighborhoods in
10 cities and made them a pledge: graduate from high school by
2000, and we will pay all your college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The company saw the pledge as the kind of transaction a
financial services firm understood: investing money. It would be
pretty straightforward: throw a few community events, collect
report cards from the schools, and send out the checks.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly became apparent that it was not that easy. Getting
the students through school took more hours and people than anyone
predicted. Not least, it took the dedication of students and
families. But now, as the deadline arrives, ScholarshipBuilder
stands out as the longest and one of the most successful of these
kinds of programs, with 93 percent of students _ not counting two
who died _ heading to college in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Following celebrations in the 10 cities _ Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York,
Philadelphia and Washington _ 149 of the students gathered in New
York City this week to meet one another for the first time and to
collect some last-minute advice on how to make the transition to
college. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, was reflecting on the major
lesson of any program of its kind: it's about much more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full scholarship was a big deal,'' said Eddy Bayardelle,
director of the company's philanthropic programs. ``But for urban
kids it's not good enough. Not when you're starting in the first
grade. So many things will happen in 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ScholarshipBuilder, which its founders estimated will cost $16
million at the program's end, came on the heels of other programs
started by philanthropists, universities and companies in the 1980s
as dropout rates soared.
</P>
<P>
   But while others held out the financial carrot to sixth-graders
_ along the model established by New York philanthropist Eugene M.
Lang in a speech to his former Harlem elementary school in 1981 _
Merrill Lynch started earlier. It invested $2,000 for each first
grader every year through 12th grade, and enlisted the Urban League
to be the more human side of the program, offering mentors and
running after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the students say they did not really understand
what was happening to them. They remember they were given bright
yellow book bags and a letter announcing the gift. ``I remember we
had an assembly, we all had to stand on the stage and wave our
letters, look cute for the cameras,'' said Nicole Brown, 18, who
was in a class of first graders chosen at PS 30/31 in Harlem. She
will head to Howard University next month. But in first grade, she
and others were not sure they would go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of celebrities don't graduate from high school,'' she
said, ``I thought maybe it didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some began to realize the benefit as early as middle school, as
people they knew started to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find out how much school costs, and your mother
doesn't make that much in a year, you know it's a blessing,'' said
Travis McKinnon, 17, a recipient from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But most said they did not realize what they had been given
until high school _ and often, not until they had risked losing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realizing that if you don't graduate in 2000 you don't get the
full scholarship, that makes you get your grades up fast,'' said
Ashley Lightborn, another of the Harlem students.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch always planned to offer tutoring, and that
continued throughout. But the needs grew as students got older.
Simply tracking students as they moved between family members and
foster parents proved a huge challenge. By sixth grade, Merrill
Lynch decided to hire full-time coordinators for each city to help
the students and their families. Those people became like parents
in some cases, going to teacher conferences, finding medical help,
arranging summer camps.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch found jobs for some parents, helped siblings with
tutoring, and took the students on college tours as senior year
approached. In each city, the Urban League arranged a place for
students to go after school, where they could bring homework or see
friends. When one girl in Detroit moved out of town, Chris Gaitley,
the assistant to a Merrill Lynch district director, phoned
different cab companies until she found one that would be willing
to drive the girl back and forth to the center for her tutoring
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Gaitley was involved from the inception of the program, working
with the students despite the demands placed on her by her own
three children. ``I never felt I had a choice not to,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bayardelle said starting in the first grade was crucial to the
program's success. One ScholarshipBuilder student drowned, another
committed suicide. But programs that started in the sixth grade
have seen more dropouts, more deaths from gang violence, and slower
high school completion rates.
</P>
<P>
   The students left New York this week with a new laptop computer
from Merrill Lynch, which will allow them to keep in e-mail contact
with their mentors and their fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   The program organizers, meanwhile, are recruiting mentors from
within the firm to advise the students as they go through the next
four years. That, too, was not part of the original program. But
Bayardelle said it would be irresponsible to leave the students at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot over the last 12 years,'' he said.
``There's no magic to this, but there's a lot, a lot of caring, by
a lot of caring adults.''

WOMEN TO HOLD TWO KEY POSTS AT UMASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A businesswoman and an administrator are becoming the
first women to hold two key posts overseeing the University of
Massachusetts and the state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Grace K. Fey, executive vice president of the Frontier Capital
Management Co., is expected to be elected chairwoman of the
university's Board of Trustees Wednesday. Tuesday, Judith I. Gill
was appointed the state's chancellor of higher education, who makes
tuition and academic policy for state campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up about 30 percent of the trustees of public schools
nationwide. There is no data on the profile of board leaders, but
governance experts estimate that only a small number are female.
</P>
<P>
   Fey, who will succeed Robert S. Karam, said she plans to work
with UMass President William Bulger to raise more private funds and
develop joint programs _ such as online classes _ among the
university's five campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance learning has so many wonderful implications for
teaching, learning, the people we can touch, and the revenue we can
generate,'' Fey said. ``We want to attract great faculty and give
students all they need for their education.''
</P>
<P>
   Karam said Fey has already made connections between UMass and
the Boston business community as a university trustee, and that she
has helped the university's efforts to turn intellectual property
and research into profit-making ventures. Among other roles, Fey is
chairwoman of Zoo New England, earning credit for some improvements
to the Franklin Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been like a rainmaker,'' Karam said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 fiscal year, the university raised an estimated $80
million in private funds, up from $69.7 million the year before.
Fey said she would like to break the $100 million mark during her
time as chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Gill as chancellor was expected, and the
Massachusetts Board of Higher Education made it official Tuesday.
She replaces Stanley Z. Koplik, who died in January.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Gill said, she will work with Department of
Education officials on programs to help students pass the MCAS
test.
</P>
<P>
   Passing scores on MCAS will be required for high school
graduation in 2003, and some UMass officials say the test could cut
sharply into their enrollments, especially among minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to public education, and I don't
think it has been our first priority,'' Gill said. ``There's a very
selfish reason for our involvement _ these will be our students.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Every Wednesday, a crowd gathers in the
Plaza of Martyrs here for a ritual as unsparing and inescapable as
the brutal midday sun. They circle a statue of a slender man
releasing a dove to the heavens hoping that their pleas, too, will
rise above the din and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to hide from the assassins,'' they chant.
``The people are like the trees. We will bend but we will not
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will they budge. What started with 11 people in 1997 over
the beatings, rapes and murders committed under the regime that
ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide in a 1991 coup has grown to
a weekly march of more than 100 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a national movement seeking an end to the
tradition of impunity here that has allowed those with money or
political clout to escape judgment. At the Plaza of Martyrs, the
victims and their relatives carry picket signs like crosses slung
over their shoulders _ and they say it is an easy burden compared
with the scars they carry on their bodies or in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my husband,'' said Jocelyn St. Germaine as she held
out a photograph taken at his funeral. His brown suit was spotless.
His face was bruised and bloody. She said masked men came to their
home soon after the coup and killed him because he had supported
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the coup's leaders were routed in 1994, she has been
waiting to find the men who made her a widow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was sacrificed for this government,'' St. Germaine
said, tucking her husband's picture back into her purse. ``Now they
have to make an effort to get those responsible. My husband died
for Aristide.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was restored to power and then succeeded in office by
an ally, Rene Preval, but it has taken all this time for the
country's justice system, weakened by a long years of dictatorship,
to begin to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the officers who led the coup will finally
stand trial _ albeit in absentia because they are in exile _ along
with the soldiers and paramilitary forces accused in a massacre
during the coup era in the Raboteau neighborhood of the town of
Gonaives.
</P>
<P>
   A second trial is expected in the case of six policemen accused
of executing several gang members last year and of killing
witnesses to the executions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public is still skittish over more recent violence,
the trials are seen by many as critical to restoring not only
confidence in the justice system, but faith in the future itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in any democratic transition is there is pressure
toward reconciliation, which usually means forgetting,'' said Brian
Concannon, an American lawyer who has been helping the Haitian
justice system with the Raboteau case. ``That's fine for the
businessmen and politicians, but it doesn't work for the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations at the Plaza of Martyrs started as therapy
for the coup victims by Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine, a psychologist who
ran an underground clinic of sorts during the coup years. During
those years, he said, people who had been raped or tortured could
not seek treatment at hospitals because they feared arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After the restoration of constitutional rule, he continued to
work with the victims and started the September 30th Foundation,
named for the date of the coup, which began the marches. He
fashioned his work after the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the
Argentine group whose vigils sought justice for sons and daughters
who vanished during that country's military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Antoine sees the weekly gatherings as an important way to
help rebuild the tattered social contract. ``One of the dirty jobs
of the coup was that it took away the dignity of the people,'' he
said. ``To forget is not therapeutic. On the contrary, when you
forget something it goes deeper into your mind and changes how you
behave toward the people around you.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like that are not able to work for the construction and
development of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But restoring people's dignity, he said, ultimately depends on
restoring confidence in Haiti's courts, which for decades were
under the control of dictators and the rich. That is why many
Haitians are looking to the coming trials as a bellwether.
</P>
<P>
   Camille LeBlanc, Haiti's justice minister, said that these
high-profile cases, in which attacks were aimed at entire
communities and were witnessed by many, were easier to prosecute
than crimes against individuals, where the trial would hinge on the
conflicting testimonies of two people.
</P>
<P>
   The Raboteau case, he said, will put on trial not only actual
gunmen, who chased down their victims as they fled into the sea,
but also the army generals and leaders of the Revolutionary Front
for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, the paramilitary group,
which created the political atmosphere that led to the massacres.
LeBlanc is intent on sending a message to the high-ranking officers
in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intellectual authors bear the same responsibility as the
material authors,'' LeBlanc said. ``Everyone is accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to root out the crimes of the coup has also propelled
a campaign for the United States to return documents it seized from
the paramilitary group and the Haitian military during the invasion
to restore Aristide to power. Among the more grisly contents are
``trophy photographs'' of torturers with their victims, which
Haitian authorities would like to use as evidence in criminal
proceedings. Concannon, who has also helped rally international
support for the return of the documents, said they could also help
build a case against the coup's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said they had returned the documents
to the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince, although without the
names of American citizens, who they said were covered under
American laws protecting privacy. Haitian officials insist that the
documents are the property of the Haitian government and that they
will accept only the unexpurgated files.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for the CIA to give us their deep dark
secrets,'' Concannon said. ``We only asking them to give us our
secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps tucked somewhere in those files is the answer to the
painful mystery that haunts Efemie Jean-Pierre every time she looks
at her 5-year-old son, Philippe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed my husband, those men without mothers,'' she said
of the night in 1994 when the soldiers came calling. ``They came to
my house afterward and they beat me up. Then they tied me up and
raped me. I became pregnant. I had a baby from them.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, she said, she will tell that child everything _ perhaps
even who the father is, if he is ever caught. ``Justice is closed
in this country,'' she said. ``The box is closed. We have to work
until the box is open and we find out who did this to us.''

A CHANCE TO HEAR A LEGEND'S DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who would have suspected, this late in the game, that there were
any crucial gaps left to fill in the discography of the German
baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau? The very model of the serious
postwar vocal artist, Fischer-Dieskau turned 75 in May. From the
very dawn of his career, microphones seemed to spring up where'er
he walked. For him as for legions of other performers
``legendary,'' honorable or merely retired from the scene, the
opening of the archival floodgates in the CD era has brought an all
but engulfing tidal wave of documentation, much of it previously
impossible for any but the most resourceful, connected and
determined fanatic to find.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here comes Myto Records of Milan, upstaging a flurry of new
Fischer-Dieskau offerings on other labels with what is advertised
as the premiere release of Fischer-Dieskau's first operatic
appearance. The assignment is no novice's walk-on, either, but
Rodrigo, freethinking confidant of royalty, a principal in Verdi's
``Don Carlos'' (001.H038; three CD's). Where on earth did Myto turn
up the source tape? And how is it possible no one got there before?
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from the interest Fischer-Dieskau's debut gives the
evening in retrospect, this was an occasion. The company was the
Staedtische Oper Berlin (now the Deutsche Oper). Its previous
efforts to raise itself from the postwar ashes had failed
ingloriously. With the premiere of a new ``Don Carlos'' on Nov. 18,
1948, Heinz Tietjen, who had run the operation to acclaim in the
late 1920s, was back in charge. In the pit stood his discovery
Ferenc Fricsay, a Hungarian conductor of remarkable gifts, then 34.
</P>
<P>
   Typically for Fischer-Dieskau, his debut in opera was early and
auspicious. An ex-prisoner of war of the British in Italy, he made
his first concert appearance, in the brief (though crucial)
baritone solo of Brahms' ``German Requiem,'' in Freiburg in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1948, at 22, he was heard on Berlin radio in
Schubert's agonized song cycle ``Winterreise.'' That broadcast has
been on CD at least since the late '80s, evidence of his
preternaturally precocious interpretive maturity. True, in later
years he would develop a leaner sound, a broader palette of colors
and greater variety and swiftness of utterance. (This
``Winterreise'' clocks in at a lugubrious 78-plus minutes, some
seven minutes more than later readings of his.) By comparison with
his subsequent work, this performance has a slightly
presentational, old-fashioned cast. Still, no one familiar with the
artist Fischer-Dieskau was to become could fail to recognize the
timbre, musicianship or personality.
</P>
<P>
   With the Myto ``Don Carlos,'' sung in German, as was the local
custom of the time, we are already in the presence of the
``modern'' Fischer-Dieskau. (Perhaps Fricsay's extremes of tempo,
especially the fast ones, have something to do with it.) At his
first appearance, an unexpected reunion with Don Carlos, to whom
Rodrigo is devoted, Fischer-Dieskau's taut rhythms and mercurial
reactions bring not only his own character but also the whole
dramatic predicament sharply to life. What he hears is dire. The
young prince is in love with his stepmother. Fischer-Dieskau gives
Rodrigo's thunderstruck exclamation in a smothered, almost
asthmatic voice but quickly recovers to suggest, with lofty
solemnity and a trace of Mephistophelean insinuation, that Carlos
take up the cause of oppressed Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   The famous duet that ensues goes painfully awry, and the tenor,
Boris Greverus, must bear the blame. (Such from-the-heart,
pitch-approximate bawling as is heard from him throughout the
performance is quite exciting at a visceral level here and there
but catastrophic where voices must blend, twisting Verdi into
Ives.) When Rodrigo reappears, bearing a letter to the queen from
her mother and a whispered message from the prince, Fischer-Dieskau
is urbane, smooth and youthful, his precise diction charged with
the sense of detailed motivation one hopes for in a spoken play.
Once again, he is rhythmically scrupulous; a detractor might say
pedantic.
</P>
<P>
   In his big paragraph of melody describing the prince's
suffering, Fischer-Dieskau conveys tremendous compassion,
emphasizing emotional detail rather than the allure of his own
sound. Italians do not sing this way. And for many,
Fischer-Dieskau's vocal character has always been intrinsically
incompatible with Verdi. ``Che fa, questo Discher-Fieskau?,''
Renata Tebaldi, the quintessential Italian soprano, is said to have
asked when he showed up to sing Rodrigo on Georg Solti's recording
in 1965: ``What is he doing, this Discher-Fieskau?'' No doubt she
scrambled his name perfectly innocently. Why would she have known
it? He was not of her world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fischer-Dieskau could reveal potentialities in Verdi
Italians are apt to overlook. On Myto, face to face with Josef
Greindl's King Philip _ a colder, harsher portrait than one might
think possible, snarly and granitic, as withholding of voice as of
tenderness _ Fischer-Dieskau starts out rather cool and stiff. As
their wide-ranging dialogue proceeds, he grows mysterious,
strangely tentative, before breaking out with wild horror at the
evils he has seen abroad. Thanking the king for his favor,
Fischer-Dieskau at first seems dazed, almost catatonic.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a single word left to go (``Sire''), the light
changes, and Rodrigo seems transfigured, off in his own radiant
world. By the end of the opera, the character will have dealt
double with the king, sacrificing himself for Carlos and the cause
of liberty. Verdi gives the dying man an aria in which the beauty
of the melody expresses the nobility of his ideals. In
Fischer-Dieskau's performance, the arc toward transcendence already
begins many scenes before.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Myto ``Don Carlos'' merits comment on other counts. Verdi's
score is long, and it underwent significant revisions. Different
editions solve the resulting problems in different ways, and the
choices of Julius Kapp, the director of the Berlin production, are
unusual, at times ingenious. Fricsay's highly individual sense of
pace and texture serves the drama excellently, and the cast forms a
remarkably coherent ensemble. As an acting singer, Fischer-Dieskau
was very much among his kind. The practice of speaking in song _
and of speaking as clearly and expressively as actors at the
playhouse _ is common to the entire cast. Myto provides no
libretto, but if you understand German, you will not need one.
(Super-titles? Was ist das?)
</P>
<P>
   But rather than dwell on these matters, let's turn to other
noteworthy recent additions to Fischer-Dieskau's immense
discography. Aribert Reimann's ``Lear,'' adapted from Shakespeare's
tragedy, was composed _ slowly, and against powerful internal
resistance _ at the singer's suggestion. Fischer-Dieskau made
specific dramatic suggestions, too, but these were ignored. Nor was
he consulted about the vocal writing. The score that resulted _
replete with 12-tone rows, quarter tones and other equally
singer-friendly attributes _ received its premiere in Munich,
conducted by Gerd Albrecht, in a production by Jean-Pierre
Ponnelle. Long out of print on LP, Deutsche Grammophon's live
recording of 1978 now returns to the catalog (463 480-2; two CD's).
</P>
<P>
   Verdi, as is well known, dreamed of setting ``Lear'' as an opera
but gave up. He cannot have been thinking of anything like this.
Though the vocal writing, notably for the three sopranos as Lear's
daughters, is in spots jagged and stratospheric, the singers
operate fundamentally within a domain of declamatory recitative
unrelieved by melody. The instrumental writing _ particularly for
percussion, strings (divided into as many as 48 parts) and solo
flute _ creates a bleak yet mesmerizing soundscape within which the
terrors of the action unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A work charged with meaning that must be grasped in its
totality and is far removed from the sensationalism so customary
today,'' Fischer-Dieskau calls Reimann's ``Lear'' in an
introductory note. ``Seldom _ perhaps only in Alban Berg's
`Wozzeck' _ has the loneliness of man been so convincingly
portrayed as the consequence of his blindness to his fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   At a poignant moment on the hard road to self-knowledge,
Shakespeare's mad, outcast monarch calls himself ``a man more
sinned against than sinning.'' Fischer-Dieskau has the courage to
go beyond the partly justified self-pity, taking his character to
the extremes. Whether the voice is writhing through little
serpentine melismas or oscillating in anguished jungle cries,
whether he is shouting or growling, cracking or letting the sound
fade and flare like the last exhalations of a dying candle, he
surrenders unconditionally to the truth of the moment. The
extraordinary supporting cast is with him every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   This journey into the heart of darkness, though one of the
artist's supreme achievements, is surely not for all travelers. As
a happier tribute for his 75th year, Deutsche Grammophon has issued
the Fischer-Dieskau Edition. This boxed set of reissues (463 500-2)
consists of 20 CD's, some also to be sold individually at a later
date, plus a bonus disc of folk-song settings by Haydn, Beethoven
and Weber, recorded in 1961 and 1970: A jewel, demonstrating how
light and unaffected this obsessively detail-oriented interpreter
could be.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the treasure chest in full will take devotion. (The
cover story of International Record Review in June consisted of
nearly three pages of repertory listings from the set and just over
two pages of commentary.) The selection represents most of the
breadth of the artist's repertory, from Buxtehude, Bach and Handel
to Debussy, Ravel and Ives by way of an extremely comprehensive
canon of the German lied (not only Schubert, Schumann, Brahms,
Wolf, Mahler and Strauss but also Liszt, Schoeck, Reger, Busoni and
Pfitzner). A disc of opera arias recorded between 1949 and 1964
includes forays into Bizet (not only the ``Toreador Song'' from
``Carmen'' but also ``O Nadir, tendre ami'' from ``Les Pecheurs de
Perles''), Rossini (``Sois immobile'' from ``Guillaume Tell,'' sung
in Italian), Leoncavallo (the prologue to ``I Pagliacci'') and
Puccini (the quartet from Act III of ``La Boheme'').
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, complete operas are absent, and symphonic repertory
is scarce. On these grounds alone, the Fischer-Dieskau Edition must
be accounted only the tip of an iceberg. (A recent Web search for
the artist turned up 163 record listings, a total that gives a very
false impression. His great Schubert sets, recorded from 1966 to
1972 and originally issued as 29 LP's, include no fewer than 463
songs and appear in discographies as only three items.) Still,
Deutsche Grammophon has struck a perfect balance: The
Fischer-Dieskau whose portrait emerges from the new edition is the
artist who defined an era.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now, there are addenda. Since 1992, when
Fischer-Dieskau quietly discontinued his singing career, he has
taken engagements reciting poetry and texts with music. Thus, in
1994, for Hyperion's Schubert Edition, he recorded the Wilhelm
Mueller poems omitted by Schubert in his setting of the cycle ``Die
Schoene Muellerin,'' adding a rare perspective to Ian Bostridge and
Graham Johnson's febrile account of the songs. (That Bostridge's
volatile, psychologically searching performance style is scarcely
imaginable without Fischer-Dieskau's example makes the linkage all
the more meaningful.)
</P>
<P>
   And last year, for ECM New Series, Fischer-Dieskau lent his
voice to Peter Ruzicka's 21-minute ``Sich Verlierend''
(``Vanishing''). It is the final track on a CD of string quartets
by Ruzicka, performed by the Arditti String Quartet. Between sharp
gestures that hang in air like the strokes of a Chinese master
calligrapher and pools of silence, the speaker is heard in snippets
of text in several languages by a handful of mandarins of modern
prose, Handke, Adorno and Celan among them.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, is Paul Valery, whose bit begins, ``Die Musik ist
in mir'' (``The music is within me''): A pregnant beginning, spoken
from the soul. And last is the oracular Proposition No. 7 with
which Wittgenstein ends his ``Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'':
``Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darueber muss man schweigen''
(``Of things whereof one cannot speak, one must be silent'').
Awkward as this sounds in translation, the original German has the
elegance that arises where accuracy of thought and economy of
expression intersect. If this is not the master's last recorded
word, it deserves to be.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CASH REFUNDS FOR DELAYED FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Delayed four hours in Boston. Flight canceled
abruptly in Atlanta. Stuck overnight in Dallas. Left Sunday
morning, got here Monday. Still waiting for the sales team to roll
in from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 corporate travel managers and travel industry
suppliers milled around the trade show floor Tuesday at the annual
convention of the National Business Travel Association at the Los
Angeles Convention Center. An impressive number of these hard-core
travel professionals seemed to have tales of woe, just like the
rest of us, in this summer of the worst air traffic delays ever.
</P>
<P>
   A good time, then, to check back in with Hal Rosenbluth, the
iconoclastic boss of the worldwide Rosenbluth International travel
management company who gave a case of the vapors to the cozy travel
agency world in May with an audacious offer to pay cash refunds to
customers whose flights were delayed. The offer, which is still in
effect, was for those buying tickets on Rosenbluth's Biztravel.com
Web site for flights on five major airlines. The basic terms: $100
for a flight arriving more than 30 minutes late and $200 for a
flight more an hour late; if a flight is more than two hours late,
the full ticket price is refunded.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth said at the time that he had confidence that the
airlines ``are doing their best to get their planes off on time.''
He said he did not think the offer, which generated tons of
publicity, would break the bank. But that was before the air system
screeched down into near-gridlock in June, with 50,000 delayed
flights, the most ever.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Rosenbluth, himself a frequent business traveler,
might sound like a man singing the blues. ``I've been stuck; I've
been grounded; I've been canceled; I've been overnighted against my
will,'' he said. Just in the past two weeks, he probably would have
gotten about $5,000 back if he'd taken advantage of his own
company's flight-delay refunds, he added. Biztravel.com's total
payout for its money-back offer as of last week: $298,832.33,
according to Rosenbluth. About two thirds of that total was for
flights that were more than two hours late, or were canceled
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put out more money than we thought we were going to put
out,'' he said. I thought we were going to average somewhere around
$10,000 to $15,000 a week. But in June and July, and especially in
June with horrendous kinds of delays caused by weather, we were
experiencing about $30,000 to $35,000 a week in payments.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is this man smiling?  &UR; Volume &LR; , as the old joke goes.
Thanks to the delays and the word of mouth about the refunds,
ticket sales on the site are up 40 percent, Rosenbluth said. In the
fiercely competitive and rapidly consolidating world of online
travel booking, where establishing a brand name is crucial, the
outlays have been worth it even when they went through the roof, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we struck a nerve,'' said Rosenbluth, whose company
announced on Monday that it had started Rosenbluth Everywhere, a
new Web portal for corporate intranets that will enable corporate
travel managers and travelers to link to a variety of custom online
and wireless booking services, e-mail and corporate
travel-management services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perversely, the delays have been great for us, though I'm
hoping that as we get out of the summer and into the fall, the
weather improves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TOURISTS DISCOVER LOS ANGELES' NEW SUBWAY
</P>
<P>
   The newly completed 17-mile-long Los Angeles subway has been
ridiculed by mass-transit planners as a $4.5 billion pork-barrel
extravaganza. But it does have its virtues. The line runs from
downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood, where it bores through the hills
and emerges six miles later into the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are only beginning to find their way onto the subway,
which is called the Metro Red Line. Here's a tip for business
travelers to Los Angeles, many of whom stay not in the more famous
western precincts of town, but in the big new hotels clustered
among the skyscrapers far away in the downtown part of the city:
Try out the subway, which is fast, with clean, comfortable cars and
beautifully designed _ if eerily noncrowded _ stations.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially useful for the increasing numbers of business
travelers who are bringing families along on trips to popular
tourist destinations like Los Angeles. According to industry
statistics, 20 percent of business travelers take spouses or
partners along, and the number of children going along on business
trips tripled in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   From downtown, you can board the subway near the Convention
Center, at Metro Center on Seventh Street, at Pershing Square, at
the Civic Center and at Union Station. The ride to Hollywood takes
about 20 minutes. It's a seedy but requisite stop, if only to
wonder what Nathanael West would make of today's slack-jawed
tourists wandering with their cameras over the faded sidewalk slabs
of movie-star handprints and footprints in front of the decrepit
old Chinese Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the last _ and by far most expensive _ link of the line
was completed under the Hollywood Hills and into the Valley. It's
now just a 25-minute subway ride from downtown to Universal City,
home of the popular Universal Studios theme park. By automobile,
that same ride can take several hours on some days.
</P>
<P>
   And the price is right. Round-trip tickets cost $2.70, and are
good all day long, with unlimited stops. &QL;

GERMANY'S CLASSIC OF CLASSICS, ALL 21 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ ``Two souls do dwell, alas!, within my
breast,'' cries the title character of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's
``Faust.'' Struggling between his thirst for pure knowledge and his
desire for earthly pleasures, he finally chooses youth over
embittered old age, signs a pact with the devil and embarks on the
epic drama that is the cornerstone of German literature _ a text,
some say, that is a key to understanding the German soul.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two souls within ``Faust.'' ``Faust,'' Part 1,
published in 1808 and a work of both Goethe's youth and maturity,
contains the well-known plot _ the bargain of the learned Doctor
Faust with Mephistopheles, the seduction of the innocent Gretchen _
that has been echoed in novels, movies, puppet shows and several
operas. ``Faust,'' Part 2, written in Goethe's old age and
published shortly after his death in 1832, is more abstract,
disjunct _ Faust travels from the court of the Emperor Maximilian
to the shores of classical antiquity _ and downright difficult. It
is seldom read and hardly ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   So when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors,
Peter Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut
``Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude.
Asserting that no one has ever presented an unedited staging of the
work, Stein calls his ``Faust'' a world premiere, and it has
certainly gained the equivalent attention. Tickets for the
production, which opened on July 22 at Expo 2000 in this
northwestern German city, sold out within hours when sales began in
January. The premiere was front-page news in every paper in the
country. And this even though the full play lasts a total of 21
hours, including intermissions. The production is being presented
in Hall 23 at the world's fair here in two formats: in two-day
marathons on Saturdays (7 hours) and Sundays (14 hours), and on six
consecutive nights.
</P>
<P>
   For Stein, 62, staging ``Faust'' was a longtime dream that
somehow had never been realized: not at the Berlin Schaubuehne,
which he took over in 1970 and where he made his reputation as a
revolutionary during a 15-year tenure, nor at the Salzburg
Festival, where he was the head of the spoken theater branch from
1991 to 1997 under Gerard Mortier. During those years, Stein
developed a reputation for seeking an ever-larger canvas as well as
complete control over his projects. The size and scale on which he
prefers to work were evident in an earlier project in 1994 in
Moscow: a staging of the ``Oresteia'' trilogy, a theater marathon
in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   The director had not forgotten his dream; he had been trying to
find sponsors for ``Faust'' all along. Expo was the first
organization to make him a concrete offer of $2 million. But that
wasn't nearly enough to finance the kind of staging the director
had in mind. The 33 actors in ``Faust,'' including the Swiss-born
star Bruno Ganz _ one of the leads in Wim Wenders' film ``Wings of
Desire'' _ started rehearsals a year before the premiere. The cast
is committed to the production through December 2001, going on,
after Expo ends in October, to a 37-week run in Berlin and a
15-week run in Vienna. With healthy subsidies from DaimlerChrysler,
Deutsche Bank and the German federal government, the project has
ended up costing about $15 million. ``Wonderful,'' say some
Germans; ``megalomania,'' say others.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's ``Faust'' was to be a highlight of another project with
megalomaniacal aspects: Expo 2000 in Hanover. The first world's
fair held in Germany, Expo was forecast as Europe's biggest event
of the new century, with an expected 40 million visitors thronging
to see elaborate new national pavilions and an extensive theme park
with exhibits devoted to Expo 2000's theme:
``Humankind-Nature-Technology: A New World Arising.''
</P>
<P>
   But walking through the grounds of the fair is a reminder that
there are also two souls in the breast of Germany. One is the
spirit of culture or learning that makes the staging of a work as
challenging as ``Faust'' the talk of the entire country. The other
is the more earthly spirit responsible for the ``economic miracle''
of fat-cat postwar Germany: a spirit that tends to express itself
in a kind of earnest, dull didacticism and in huge trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
   These characteristics are prominent at Expo 2000, which is also
making headlines _ as a flop. People are staying away in droves,
put off by high prices, negative assessments in the press and a
geographical location that nobody is interested in visiting. As the
arts pages of Germany's newspapers were filled with articles about
``Faust'' in the days leading up to the premiere, the financial
pages were devoted to stories about Expo 2000's lack of visitors, a
desperate new advertising campaign and the question of whether the
government would step in and bail the fair out of a debt that
Germany's education minister fears could exceed $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faust'' is hardly going to affect the financial fate of Expo
2000, since there are only 460 seats available on any given night.
But the work itself does echo Expo's stated theme, exploring the
relationship of man and technology. Stein's staging of it also
represents a huge endeavor, comparable to the scale on which Expo
2000 was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's goal was to create a monument to Goethe's masterpiece,
and to do so in a spirit of reverence rather than reinterpretation.
His main concern, he has emphasized, was to reproduce the text as
faithfully as possible. ``I don't want to reinvent theater,'' he
said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Rome. ``I
want to bring the experience I have amassed in 35 years of working
in the theater and place it at the disposal of this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His intention to follow Goethe's stage directions and vision to
the letter, changing not a word of the original poem, aroused
skepticism from those who believe a director's job is not merely to
present a piece but to interpret it as well: to create, in other
words, the kind of Regietheater, or directors' theater, that Stein
and his peers have helped to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stein was one of the great revitalizers of German theater in
the 1960s and 1970s,'' said Andreas Mury, the theater critic for
the weekly newsmagazine Fokus. ``But now he has turned away from
the principles that made him famous. He has become reactionary.
Simply taking a text and putting it onstage _ that's not
artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of theatrical artistry is required to get
Goethe's text _ with its witches, Greek gods and startling
metamorphoses _ on the stage in any form. ``In the 20th century,''
Stein said, ``artistic forms developed that allow this piece to be
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a choppy, episodic presentation is not as foreign to
a modern audience as it might have been to one in Goethe's time;
Stein likens Part 2, in particular, to cabaret. At the same time,
he said: ``We have developed theatrical structures akin to the ones
Goethe uses. The idea of a circle, of something coming up again and
again, was a formal principle of Goethe's.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in Stein's view, it is only now possible, in the
early 21st century, to stage the piece at all. He paid tribute to
the idea of the circle by using a spiral to represent the approach
to heaven. In the first scene, a circular metal construction was
suspended from the flies overhead with a few actors representing
angels aboard; in the very last scene, the circle unwound into a
spiral path along which the angels led Faust, now redeemed, to the
Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, the most avant-garde element in the work of
Stein's two set designers (Ferdinand Woegerbauer for Part 1 and
Stefan Mayer for Part 2) and the costume designer (Moidele Bickel)
is the juxtaposition of elements both traditional and modern in the
service of illustrating the story. Some sets are as conventionally
representative as Faust's messy, manuscript-lined study, erected on
a proscenium-style stage; others as abstract as the geometric
contours of a forbidding, fortress-like mountain in the fourth act
of Part 2. The witch's kitchen where Mephistopheles takes Faust for
the potion he needs to regain his youth is inhabited by marvelous,
``Planet of the Apes''-style monkeys and a witch who looks like
something out of a Halloween decoration, warts and all. By
contrast, the centaur Chiron is a man fastened to a wheeled metal
contraption that forms his horsey hindquarters and back legs: a
more modern, if no less literal, representation of a mythological
creature.
</P>
<P>
   Another modern element is the way Stein involves the audience.
There are two separate performance spaces in Hall 23, each fitted
out with bleacherlike seating that is continually reconfigured to
create various arenas for the different scenes. The audience is
kept moving between these spaces, each time taking a different
place, sometimes in regular seats, sometimes standing on risers,
and even, at the Emperor Maximilian's court, sitting at banquet
tables set with glasses of real wine.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from one space to another creates a kind of theatrical
democracy: no one is guaranteed a better seat than anyone else. An
unfortunate by-product of this concept, at least during the
premiere, was a kind of cattle-stampede effect every time the doors
opened, as elegantly clad, presumably sophisticated men and women
practically mowed one another down in their efforts to get a good
spot. But at least it kept everyone awake.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of duality was also present in the casting: Stein
divided each of the two leading parts _ Faust and Mephistopheles _
between two actors. This meant that the younger version of Bruno
Ganz's Faust was to be played by Christian Nickel, 31. But the
concept ran into some problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mephistopheles, one of the devils, Robert
Hunger-Buehler, another Swiss actor, was much better than the
other, Johann Adam Oest. Oest tended to bluster ineffectively,
while Hunger-Buehler was at once suave and earthy, understated yet
in perfect control. The contrast between the two performers gave
the character a regrettable disjointedness.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse was the news, five weeks before the premiere, that
Ganz had fallen from a ladder in rehearsal and broken his wrist and
pelvis. After speculation about whether the premiere would be
called off, Nickel took over the entire role, a speaking part that
adds up to about six hours. He did remarkably well under the
circumstances, but his performance was, naturally, uneven.
Surprisingly, he was more convincing as the older Faust than as the
hot-headed young seducer of Gretchen, the role in which he was
originally cast. As a young man, he lacked the sense of making up
for lost time that motivates Faust's disregard for Gretchen's
feelings and her future.
</P>
<P>
   Faust's actions were all the harder to understand because the
Gretchen, Dorothee Hartinger, was so excellent: believable but
never cloying in her innocence, a bit saucy, and heartbreaking in
her final madness.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the absence of Ganz, Stein said, he regards
the performances on July 22 and 23 as a phase in a continuing
process rather than a premiere. ``The real premiere will take place
in December,'' he said, when ``Faust'' opens in Berlin; by then,
Ganz should have resumed his role.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stein himself sustained physical injury in the
pursuit of his dream. During a rehearsal, he closed a rusted metal
door on one of his index fingers, and half the finger had to be
amputated. Of course there were comments that Stein had made his
own pact with the devil, sealed, literally, with flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or no, it was just this kind of literal-mindedness
that characterized the whole production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Goethe's text, Mephistopheles first appears to Faust in the
guise of a black poodle: so there, onstage, was a real black
poodle, too cute and well trained to evoke anything very diabolical
and greeted with affectionate titters by the audience. When
Goethe's stage direction reads that Mephistopheles enters by
emerging from a pair of seven-league boots (an image from German
fairy tales), Stein has him come out from behind a pair of huge red
boots. When Faust's former student, Wagner, creates his own hominid
in a glass beaker in his laboratory, Stein had a little boy in a
glowing glass ball suspended over the stage, an original test-tube
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this kind of literalness can approach caricature.
In Part 1, it seemed that Stein might have been deliberately
working tongue in cheek; after all, he had been quoted before the
premiere as saying that ``any idiot can stage Part 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Part 2, he followed the text as literally as he had done
in Part 1 _ and it fell flat. The actors declaimed each and every
line and wore costumes Goethe might have recognized: the sea gods
``swam,'' miming the freedom of moving through the water with the
help of invisible roller blades; carnival figures danced, strutted
and expostulated from beneath their comic masks between the ranks
of standing audience members. But it was hard to tell what was
going on. At moments, when a foreign critic might struggle to
follow the words, perhaps during what is called the Classical
Walpurgisnacht section in Part 2, many of the native Germans in the
audience seemed to be asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Stein has spent years trying to understand Part 2 of ``Faust,''
and now that he has finally come to terms with it _ to the envy of
many of his compatriots _ he talks about it with unconcealed
excitement. ``Goethe is trying to deal with the subject of the
genetic program of the human race,'' he said. ``Man does whatever
he is able to, even if it's harmful to nature, or to himself. He
won't refrain from doing something he's able to do just because
it's bad for the environment. That's the Mephistophelean element of
the human race. With the help of the devil, Faust can do everything
he wants to; at the end, he's draining the ocean, creating a new
society. And he fails. But all of this happens in a very humorous
way. Goethe described it as very serious jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   If only more of that excitement, and humor, had come across.
Flushed with discovery, Stein may have forgotten how much of the
text still needs to be explained to others. On the page, the words
seem livelier and funnier than they do in the stentorian readings
of Stein's actors. Which brings to mind another observation that
Goethe made about Part 2, to wit, that it is unstageable.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the critics were virtually unanimous. ``A
disappointment,'' said the Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich. ``Too
much Goethe, too little Stein,'' said Die Welt. The Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung compared Stein's pursuit of ``Faust'' to that of
a young man who spends his life running after a young woman,
finally gets together with her in old age for a night of passion,
and has no idea what to do with her, ultimately stripping off her
clothes and leaving her, naked but untouched, on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's description of Man doing something simply because he can
applies (as he well knows) especially to himself, embarking on this
seemingly impossible theatrical project simply because he could.
The consensus after the first round is that he, like Faust, has
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may not be that simple. In his goal of creating a
monument to the greatest work of German literature, Stein may have
succeeded. For monuments are also for the general public; and in
avoiding interpretive excess, the director may have won over a
wider popular audience to his vision. However flawed the
production, there is something undeniably exhilarating about
experiencing this whole text in two days.
</P>
<P>
   It may emerge that there are two souls within the German
audience as well. The critical one has had its say, but the popular
one raised its voice at the end of the premiere in jubilant
ovation. An account of the dress rehearsal in Die Welt am Sonntag,
one of Germany's less intellectual newspapers, was ecstatic.
Furthermore, plenty of people will be able to see some of ``Faust''
without sitting through the entire 21 hours, if they choose single
evenings from the six-consecutive-night format.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Does Faust really fail? At the start of Part 1, the doctor, sick
of words, demands deeds. Nonetheless, he remains more a man of
letters than of action. In translating Goethe's text from page to
stage, Stein is also moving from word to deed. The complete
``Faust'' may remain more successful as a literary creation than as
a work for the theater. But for Peter Stein, as for Doctor Faust,
the act of striving for deeds is what makes it a story in the first
place.

MUSIC, MINUS THOSE PESKY COMPOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: For release Sunday, Aug. 6) 
By   ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  The Lincoln Center Festival's five-concert Electronic Evolution
series last month surveyed the history of electronic music,
starting with the 1920 invention of the theremin, the electronic
instrument that looks like a radio transmitter and was once a
staple of sci-fi movie soundtracks. These rewarding concerts showed
where electronic music has come from.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But a free pre-concert event Columbia University showed where
electronic music, and maybe music as a whole, could be going. It
was a display of six interactive sound and image installations, and
it was packed with mostly young adults. For this veteran
concert-goer, the glimpse into the interactive musical future was
at once fascinating and disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   The gizmos on display were not inventions of computer geeks who
had drifted into music. All of the creators are composers pursuing
advanced degrees who have gotten increasingly involved with
computer software. Yet these interactive inventions may someday put
composers out of business, at least those who cling to the quaint
idea that composing means one person putting notes and sounds
together for later public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Just compare that passive, laughably outmoded way of
experiencing new music with the fun and challenge of ``Soundscape
Navigator,'' an experimental installation by R. Luke DuBois and
Mark McNamara. It allows you to navigate through a virtual-reality
space, a kind of room where wildly varied sounds with corresponding
images, like amazing sono-grams, appear, collide and vanish on
wall-size panels. Moving around the ``room'' with a hand-held lever
changes the way the sounds are ``spatialized,'' to quote the
composers, though perhaps ``designers'' would be a more apt
billing.
</P>
<P>
   In a way ``Soundscape Navigator'' turns Messiaen's conviction
that harmonies have colors into glaring, fast-paced reality.
Instead of just hearing sounds, ``it's as if you are driving around
in them,'' said Douglas Irving Repetto, the producer of the exhibit
and the creator of ``BeatyBeatyBeaty and the Infinite Grid,'' a
software-based instrument that allows the user to improvise highly
complex music. Or so I was told. Try as I did to follow the
explanations of ``gains,'' ``frequency curves'' and ``multitrack
graphical interface,'' I had no idea what the instrument really
does, though it's surely ingenious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tinkering With Speech,'' an installation by Timothy Pol-ashek,
was easy to use and attracted lots of partakers. It enables you to
collaborate in the creation of a text-sound work by speaking into a
microphone and watching the computer-generated results. The sounds
of the words are fragmented in every way imaginable: syllables get
shifted around, vowels are substituted for one another, parts of
words are combined into new words, some as nonsensical as anything
in Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Freeman's ``Locust Tree in Flower,'' the title taken from
a William Carlos Williams poem, is essentially a four-minute
``composition,'' an aural and visual representation of the poem.
Listening through earphones, the ``audience member,'' to use
Freeman's term, is asked to speak selected syllables and words from
the short poem into a microphone. The software responds by mixing,
looping and otherwise altering the speech sounds and corresponding
images.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hit was ``Interactions,'' by David Birchfield. The
user _ again, just one at a time _ begins by typing into a computer
an Internet address of his or her choice. This generates a burst of
images on two adjoining screens. Concurrently, the installation
presents the user with two sets of sounds triggered by the imagery,
one in each cup of the earphones. The user indicates a preference
by tapping one of two small drums with a mallet. This causes the
rejected sound source to alter its content more in line with the
chosen one. But when the sneaky rejected source gets too similar,
the previously chosen one changes drastically. So in a sense the
two sides are constantly fighting for the fickle user's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Watching people thwack the drums with glints in their eyes, you
could sense the seductive allure of ``Interactions.'' All
concertgoers have had the experience of sitting impatiently through
pieces they didn't much like, thinking: ``What's the music doing
now?'' ``Why can't it repeat that pretty good thing it did
before?'' ``I wish the pace would pick up.'' ``What a bore!'' ``Ah,
I like that; it's sort of neat.'' With this installation, the
listener finally has the power to change the piece immediately, to
cater to his or her own taste, mood and attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Give listeners this degree of choice, and they are likely to use
it. Of course, advanced interactive technology, we are told, will
not eliminate the need for composers but simply expand available
sound resources and create a role for newly engaged audiences. I
would say to the composer-computer whizzes who are inventing this
stuff, ``Be careful what you wish for.'' I will not soon forget the
giddy sense of empowerment that every user of ``Interactions''
projected while I stood by, sort of nervous. I mean, who will care
what critics think when music becomes an interactive endeavor?
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who persist in thinking of a musical composition
as a creative statement of a trained and artistic individual, there
was one reassuring thing: though the users of these interactive
installations worked alone, having witnesses watching and listening
on extra earphones seemed a large part of the enjoyment. So
composers as we known them may disappear someday. Yet perhaps the
concert, or at least a new kind of collective listening experience,
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the new technology is astounding. But sometimes
I'm glad I'm not younger than I am.

MISSOURI'S LAKE OF THE OZARKS OFFERS LAID-BACK PACE &HT;    (WITH OPTIONAL TRIMS)
 &HT;    By HARRY SHATTUCK
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE OF THE OZARKS, Mo. _ Here's a tip for those who make
regular pilgrimages to Branson, mid-America's most popular parking
lot:
</P>
<P>
   Next visit, once you've seen all the Osmonds and Lennons _ no
small accomplishment _ and escaped the traffic gridlock on 76
Country Boulevard, mosey up the road about 2{ hours and into a
different world.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a place where you can dock your boat beside the
Three Pigs Barbecue for lunch _ are the Pig Wings for real? _ and
feast on exquisite Chilean sea bass at Andre's French restaurant
come evening.
</P>
<P>
   A place where millionaires from St. Louis and Kansas City mingle
with tourists on the tightest of budgets.
</P>
<P>
   A place for underground weddings. No, nothing subversive; just
ceremonies in a lakeside cave, where brides and grooms have been
known to arrive and depart on water skis.
</P>
<P>
   A place to explore the ruins of an authentic Scottish castle.
Well, almost authentic.
</P>
<P>
   A place with a lake that covers 54,000 acres _ paradise for
boaters and fishing enthusiasts _ and with 1,150 miles of shoreline
dotted by 13 golf courses, whose terrain humans share with
white-tail deer, wild turkeys and eagles.
</P>
<P>
   A place to unwind on a houseboat, in a campground or at a
first-class, family-oriented resort.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the relaxed pace and diversity of enticements at Lake of
the Ozarks, Missourians' favorite summer playground, make it an
ideal vacation companion to bustling Branson.
</P>
<P>
   Like Branson, a trip here fits easily within most budgets. And
leave those fancy duds at home; casual attire is the rule even at
Andre's.
</P>
<P>
   An orientation:
</P>
<P>
   Lake of the Ozarks carries two connotations: (1) a region in
central Missouri, southwest of Jefferson City (the state capital)
and almost equal distances from Kansas City (165 miles to the west)
and St. Louis (175 miles to the east); and (2) a large body of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by thick forests and rolling hills and guarded by
towering bluffs, the lake reminds one of a river. It meanders for
92 miles, from Bagnell Dam to Truman Dam, with three major
tributaries spreading 10-15 miles from the main water mass.
</P>
<P>
   The lake was created during the Great Depression; with almost
5,000 laborers working on it from 1929 to 1931. Bagnell Dam was
hailed as the most skillful engineering feat of its era, impounding
the Osage River and resulting in the world's largest man-made lake
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective on this enormous undertaking is provided at Willmore
Lodge, a log structure about a mile north of Bagnell Dam. It served
as administrative headquarters during construction and is now a
visitor center and historical museum _ and a recommended first stop
for maps and brochures.
</P>
<P>
   The three-county area contains two state parks, Lake of the
Ozarks and Ha Ha Tonka, and 16 communities of varying size and
appeal. Most resorts, restaurants and golf courses are to the east
of the lake, along or near U.S. 54, but a new toll bridge has
hastened development on the opposite bank.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Recent growth is described as ``explosive'' by Joel Pottinger,
executive director of the Lake of the Ozarks Convention and Visitor
Bureau. Not only is tourism up, but the average home price has
increased by about $40,000 in three years. Sixty percent are
weekend or summer homes, and some overlooking the lake cost as much
as $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Growth creates challenges, however, and Pottinger says, ``The
biggest will be the use of the water _ not the quality, but the
use. I can take you to a place on the Fourth of July where you'll
be all alone; that's because we have so many coves. But the main
channel of the lake can get really crowded.:

<P>
   Luxury yachts vie for space with speedboats, fishing vessels,
jet-skiers and wave-runners. About 100 marinas provide rentals or
offer parking and services for travelers who bring boats from home.
</P>
<P>
   Not inclined to pilot a craft on uncharted waters? Omer and
Jacquie Clark operate daily tours from the Lodge of Four Seasons
resort (no relation to the Four Seasons chain) aboard their
150-passenger Tropic Island II yacht, pointing out the newest
mansions _ one built for a Dallas Cowboys physician _ and providing
insight into lake traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here you'll see what we call Party Cove, Omer Clark says.
''People park their boats on Saturday and party all day. Next to it
is Worship Cove. On Sunday, after all the partying, boats move into
this cove, and the same people turn on the radio and listen to
church services.``
</P>
<P>
   Lake fishing can be spectacular, with targets ranging from
largemouth and white bass to crappie, strikers, catfish and _ but
only March 15-April 30 _ the rare paddlefish or spoonbill, said to
be a remnant of the dinosaur age and weighing up to 130 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the water, golf rivals boating as a recreational
pursuit, with courses designed to satisfy all skill levels and
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most renowned course architects are represented,
including Robert Trent Jones and Jack Nicklaus at Lodge of Four
Seasons courses; Arnold Palmer at Osage National, near the town of
Osage Beach; Tom Weiskopf at Old Kinderhook near Camdenton; and
Bruce Devlin and Robert von Hagge at the Oaks Course at Marriott's
Tan-Tar-A Resort.
</P>
<P>
   High-season greens fees are about $40-$100; packages booked
through resorts can provide savings.
</P>
<P>
   Birders, too, find ample rewards. The area is home to the great
blue heron and, from November into March, concentrations of bald
eagles, especially just below Bagnell Dam on the Osage River. More
than 100 species of songbirds nest during summer in the Missouri
Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about Bridal Cave and the Scottish castle:
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, boasting more than 5,700 caves, is steeped in
underground lore. One legend holds that an Osage Indian maiden and
her prince were wed almost 200 years ago in a sacred chamber
beneath Thunder Mountain, a bluff overlooking the lake two miles
north of Camdenton.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of primitive exploration, the cavern became
accessible in 1948, and a couple asked to take exchange their vows
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of snowballed from there,'' says Steve Thompson, a
co-owner of Bridal Cave.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,800 marriages have been performed in an underground
chapel adorned with stalactites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are as nice as any church wedding,'' Thompson says.
``Others border on the ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wedding parties arrive by boat, disembarking at a dock near
the cave's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once the ceremony is completed, we've had them ski right
off our deck into the water,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There was one occasion, he says, when the bride arrived in a a
hoop skirt that wouldn't fit through the narrow entrance to the
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the wedding party was asked to leave,'' Thompson
says. ``Then she removed her clothes, squeezed into the chapel and
dressed again before the others returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another time, a couple wanted to get married on Harley
Davidsons. They worked all day taking the motorcycles apart and
trying to fit the pieces into the chapel where they would
reassemble them for the wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the cave are believed to be 40 million years old.
Tours are conducted several times daily. Some passageways create a
tight fit even for people not wearing hoop skirts, and these
caverns are not recommended for anyone who has difficulty walking
or who becomes claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-minute drive to the east, within Ha Ha Tonka State Park,
stands another intriguing attraction. Or what's left of it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, wealthy Kansas City businessman Robert Snyder bought
more than 5,000 acres here, and two years later he hired 60
stonemasons from Scotland to build a castle much like those in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Snyder was killed in 1906, in what is believed to be
Missouri's first automobile accident. His sons finished his dream
house, though less elaborately than Snyder had envisioned. It
opened first as a home, then as a 60-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, a fire gutted the interior and a nearby carriage house.
For almost three decades, the site was abandoned. Then the state
bought it, and the ruins became an integral part of Ha Ha Tonka
State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Ha Tonka is notable, too, for its geological formations,
including a natural bridge, a 150-foot sinkhole and bluffs that
rise to 250 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lake of the Ozarks State Park, to the north, has more of a
marine emphasis, with 90 miles of shoreline, two public beaches and
boat-launching areas. Another cave system, Ozark Caverns, is within
its boundaries, and naturalists present summer programs in an
open-air pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   A third cave system, Jacob's Cave, lies to the northeast. It is
fully accessible to people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other diversions in towns and along roadways include six small
amusement parks, seven go-kart tracks, seven miniature-golf
courses, more than 50 antiques shops and the 110-store Osage Beach
Factory Outlet Village.
</P>
<P>
   But where do you hang your hat for the night?
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't get too much of the lake, a company called
Forever Resorts, headquartered near Camdenton, rents houseboats
that accommodate 10 people, with bedrooms, a living area, a kitchen
and a sun deck.
</P>
<P>
   Campgrounds abound. So do bed-and-breakfasts, motels and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Or splurge _ it's not a serious splurge either, given the
reasonable rates _ at one of several full-service resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With 930 rooms and suites, Marriott's Tan-Tar-A is the largest
property. Its accommodations range from standard rooms with
balconies overlooking the lake to five-bedroom houses. Features
include 27 holes of golf, a marina, swimming pools, a health club,
a miniature-golf course, tennis and racquetball courts, a bowling
center and, for winter guests, an ice-skating rink. Room rates
start at $69.
</P>
<P>
   The Lodge of Four Seasons has 300 rooms, 13 suites and 85 two-
and three-bedroom condominiums, with rates starting at $99. Guests
have access to 45 holes of golf, a marina, a spa and swimming
pools.
</P>
<P>
   More intimate is the Country Club Hotel and Spa, home to 63
suites, 16 villas and 20 deluxe rooms, plus a health and fitness
center, a tennis academy with indoor and outdoor courts, and live
jazz five nights a week. Rates are $159-$179.
</P>
<P>
   All these resorts deliver high-quality dining. Try brandied
lobster bisque with lobster ravioli and pecan-encrusted salmon at
Tan-Tar-A's Windrose Restaurant, or savor prime rib or turkey steak
at HK's, one of several eateries associated with the Lodge of Four
Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Andre's, overlooking the water near the town of Lake Ozark,
provides a special culinary treat _ and marvelous views at sunset.
Parisian onion soup and a carpaccio of beef tease the palate, and
chef-owner Andre Torres' perfectly seasoned entrees even include
Catfish Provencale.
</P>
<P>
   Prefer something less formal? Kenilworth Bakery and Grill in
Lake Ozark and Kenilworth Restaurant in Osage Beach serve soup of
the day in a sourdough bread bowl and tempt with delicious
sandwiches, salads and pastas.
</P>
<P>
   Well off the beaten path, at Mill Creek Cove near the town of
Gravois Mills at the lake's northern extreme, Three Pigs Barbecue &AMP;
Marina welcomes customers who arrive by car or boat. Pork ribs and
onion rings are addictive. But the Pig Wings _ served spicy or mild
_ sure do resemble chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, no visit is complete without a stop at Randy's Frozen
Custard _ ``made fresh every hour'' _ along U.S. 54. Choose vanilla
or chocolate, then mix in key lime, raspberry or any of 26 other
flavorings. Or sample an Ozark Turtle: vanilla custard with hot
fudge and cream caramel fudge, topped with pecans and cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a bench in the open air. Linger for a spell. There is no
rush. The only show is the custard dribbling down your chin. You're
a long way from Branson.

BUSH'S GLOVES STARTING TO COME OFF AS CLINTON PRESSES VOCAL JABS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ After four days of subtle digs at President
Clinton, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas took him on directly Tuesday
and said the president was ``so desperate to have his legacy intact
by getting Al Gore elected, he'll say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks on his campaign plane came as he stopped in two
more battleground states _ West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ on his
way to a triumphant coronation at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was prompted by a stream of verbal broadsides
from Clinton, who said at a recent Democratic fund-raiser that
Bush's message amounts to the following: ``How bad can I be? I'm
governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team.
They like me down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush said he welcomed the jabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me that the president of the United States
would spend time trying to be a political pundit,'' he said. ``He's
so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected,
he'll say anything just like Al Gore will. And I welcome him to the
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at his first rally of the day at the West Virginia war
memorial at the foot of the state Capitol, Bush stepped up his
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win the state of West Virginia,'' he told
several thousand people gathered on the humid morning, ``and we're
going to do so because this nation is sick and tired of the
politics of personal destruction.'' He added, ``This nation is
looking for an administration that will appeal to our better
angels, not our darker impulses. This nation does not want four
more years of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in days that he had mentioned the two
Democrats by name in a speech; until now he only implied criticism
at President Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his
evasions about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, made a similar dig on Monday in her
convention speech about education when she that said her husband
hears pleas from people to bring back an era when children can
``respect the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush escorted his wife down the aisle of a new, red, white and
blue campaign plane Tuesday morning to celebrate her speech, and
she protested when a reporter suggested she had criticized Clinton:
``I wasn't talking about President Clinton,'' she said, ``I was
talking about my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush jumped in and said their comments simply reflected public
sentiment. ``When people walk up and say `don't let us down,' we're
just reporting what's happening,'' he said. ``I don't think I've
ever mentioned President Clinton's name on the stump recently.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Honor and dignity in the White House is an issue in
this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was talking about Clinton when he introduced
his new running mate, Dick Cheney, as a man ``who knows what the
meaning of is is,'' Bush said, ``Yeah. I was talking about him
then. I sure was. But in the context of having somebody who's going
to shoot straight with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rally in West Virginia was followed by one in Harrisburg
late Tuesday, as he completed a trip through six swing states and
prepared to make his entrance in Philadelphia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the crowds Bush has drawn during the last five days,
the audiences Tuesday were overwhelmingly white, despite the
careful choreography of the convention, which has been featuring
minorities as speakers to moderate the Republican Party's image and
to appeal to suburban voters. The largest group of black voters to
appear at any of Bush's rallies was a cluster of union members who
showed up to protest against him on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the lack of diversity showed that his appeals were not
resonating with minority voters, Bush said, ``We'll see on Election
Day, won't we.'' He added: ``I can't remember the makeup of the
crowds in Texas, but I got nearly 50 percent of the Hispanic vote,
and I'm not so sure the nature of the crowd necessarily reflects
the nature of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised retired Gen. Colin Powell for his prime-time
challenge to the Republican Party on Monday to reach out to black
voters and ``not just during an election-year campaign.'' Bush
said, ``He's right and we have a lot of work to do and I'm going to
go out and try to do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked about Powell's criticism that some in the party
condemn affirmative action to help ``black kids get an education''
but do not protest ``affirmative action'' for lobbyists, Bush
sidestepped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what specific policies he had in mind,'' Bush
said. ``Children not getting into places of higher education? In my
state of Texas we took a very positive step toward ensuring the
racial mix of Texas universities reflect the nature of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to legislation he signed in Texas after a
federal court threw out an affirmative action plan for higher
education. The legislation guarantees that the top 10 percent of
graduates from every high school in the state will be ensured a
place in a Texas college or university.

PLAIN TALK FROM CARLOS MENCIA &HT;    (ADV for release Thursday)
 &HT;    By SHERRY THOMAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Mencia isn't on the telephone _ half-awake _ to talk
about Ted Nugent. In this long-distance call from a hotel room in
Denver, he's supposed to be plugging his ``Take a Joke America 2000
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   But when did Mencia ever follow the rules?
</P>
<P>
   The half-Honduran, half-Mexican comic has risen to the top by
calling it like he sees it. Bottom line? He thinks everybody should
wake up, speak up and stop complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mexico was such a great place _ or Honduras _ my parents
wouldn't have come here,'' he said during one of his hilarious,
stream-of-consciousness rants. ``I don't understand why everybody
moves to America and (dumps) on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Nuge came up:
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Mencia believes everybody should speak English:
``People who come to this country who don't learn English end up
paying the price for it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a guy like Nugent insults Mexicans onstage, at a KISS
concert in Houston of all places _ and then gets national media
attention out of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is he?'' Mencia said, half-laughing into the phone. ``He's
an (idiot).''
</P>
<P>
   Later he continued: ``What he doesn't understand is, immigrants
who come to this country are going to do jobs that he would never
do and his kid would never do. When you go to Taco Bell at 3 a.m.
and the guy doesn't speak English very well, you get mad. But think
about this: How (much of an idiot) is Ted Nugent's son who just
lost his job to a kid named Julio _ who can't speak English _ from
Nicaragua?''
</P>
<P>
   Mencia has been called an equal-opportunity offender (his
publicist makes it nice-nice by describing Mencia's observations
``equal-opportunity frankness.'') But Mencia says comedy should
never be offensive: His job is to make people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Take a Joke America 2000'' tour has been billed as one of
the most ``ethnically diverse'' comedy shows on the circuit.
Mencia, however, says that while he appreciates the absence of
color lines in the show, it wasn't really intentional. He asked Guy
Torry (who's black), Dave Attell (who's white) and Bobby Lee (who's
Korean) to join him on the road because he thought they were funny
_ not because he was trying to compete with the Rainbow Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour is me,'' Mencia said. ``You're getting these guys for
free. It's like, `But wait, there's more.' That's who they are.
They are the set of steak knives that don't break.''
</P>
<P>
   On his debut album with Warner Bros., ``Take a Joke America,''
Mencia skewers many of life's hypocrisies and absurdities while
addressing a proverbial rainbow of subjects, including ethnic
stereotypes (don't get him started), racism, people's inability to
laugh at themselves, and a certain president's, um, sexual needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of his material plays off the news, it's always
changing. Last week, one day after the Concorde jet crash, Mencia
was already thinking of a way to work it into his act.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in a plane and the captain comes out and says there's
a mechanical problem and we're going to have to fix it, I don't
stay on that plane, personally,'' he said. ``People are so afraid
to say what they feel. I guarantee you that somebody on that plane
is dead right now when their initial thought was, `I want to get
off this flight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an East Los Angeles housing project, Mencia is fast
becoming one of hottest comedians in Hollywood. Just don't call him
the ``hottest Hispanic comedian.'' He doesn't want any racial
labels, thank you very much. He just wants to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if I don't get a TV show or if I don't get into
movies, as my predecessors have, then I wasn't good enough,''' he
said. ``That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. It you can't make it to the Aerial, check out Mencia in
cyberspace at www.carlosmencia.com.
</P>
<P>
   Details: &UR;  &LR; The ``Take a Joke America 2000'' tour: Dallas, Aug. 5;
El Paso, Aug. 11; Riverside, CA, Aug. 12; Corpus Christi, Aug. 25;

``THE TIC CODE'' HITS HOME (PHOTO) &HT;    By LOUIS B. PARKS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ How many strikes can one film have against it and
survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tic Code'' _ the title is strike one _ may supply this
season's definitive answer. It's had enough strikes to retire the
side at your local ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   That audiences are even getting to see the movie _ it opens
Friday in Houston, New York and Los Angeles _ testifies to the
determination of former ``thirtysomething'' actress Polly Draper
and the movie's surprisingly strong emotional story.
</P>
<P>
   Draper wrote the screenplay and stars in the movie, which she
also produced with her husband, Michael Wolff. Wolff also did the
film's jazz-rich score.
</P>
<P>
   Draper and Wolff, who met when he was band leader on ``The
Arsenio Hall Show'' and she was a guest, were in Houston recently
for a screening of ``The Tic Code.''
</P>
<P>
   They were having so much fun cutting up, laughing, talking on
top of each other's sentences and, frankly, snuggling, that you'd
never suspect the seven years of hassles they had getting the movie
made and released. Maybe they were giddy during their visit because
the process had come to a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the vague title, ``The Tic Code'' sounds like a check
list of things screenwriters are told to avoid:
</P>
<P>
   It's about jazz and the jazz world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three central characters is a 10-year-old boy, and
yet the film, rated R for language, is meant for adults, not
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   It features an interracial love story, between Draper, as the
boy's mother, and a jazz musician played by Gregory Hines.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film was made for theatrical release, it was first
shown on the cable network Starz.
</P>
<P>
   While Draper is well-known onstage (``Closer,'' ``Trudy Blue'')
she's not a name known to film audiences.
</P>
<P>
   And _ this may be the toughest strike _ the story deals with the
neurological disorder called Tourette's Syndrome, making many
people immediately think, ``Uh-oh, disease-of-the-month movie.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't even go into the financial problems or the death of the
original director.
</P>
<P>
   How did ``The Tic Code'' even get made, much less released?
</P>
<P>
   For starters it has a solid, emotional, but not mushy plot about
a mother seeking a strong male role model for her troubled son, a
jazz prodigy who has Tourette's. She falls in love with a musician
(Hines) who is still unwilling to admit that he also has
Tourette's.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the film offers some cool jazz, both on the soundtrack and
played by the characters.
</P>
<P>
   If the story is believable and free from the usual ``disease
movie'' sentiment, it's because Draper knew what she was writing
about: Wolff has Tourette's Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Tourette's is a disorder that causes involuntary behavior, which
can include repetitive, compulsive movements, facial or body tics,
coughing or, in some cases, cursing.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff had never admitted he had Tourette's, even to himself,
until he was 35. When he started dating the outspoken Draper, she
mentioned it right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she said,'' Wolff recalled, ``was, `What's the matter
with you anyway?'''
</P>
<P>
   Draper, all but elbowing Wolff in the ribs, insisted she was not
so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I said it in a kind, gentle manner,'' she insisted.
``I was the only person, apparently _ according to him _ that was
rude enough to ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Wolff, who manifests the disorder through
tics, not the more publicized but less common cursing, displayed no
obvious sign of Tourette's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expended a lot of my life learning to suppress and repress
it,'' Wolff said. ``It gets better and worse, but you master
yourself better.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Tic Code'' was shown on cable _ due to a deal made
by the bank to cover the movie's outstanding bills _ the film won
audience-popularity awards at a number of film festivals, including
Berlin, the Hamptons and Montreal. That was enough to make small
distributor Lion's Gate decide to give it a chance in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story of ``The Tic Code'''s survival is Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polly gets the credit because she decided she wanted the movie
to be made the way she wanted or not at all, not going with what
the studios wanted to change,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   When she first wrote the script for ``The Tic Code,'' several
studios showed interest but wanted changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing people would say, `Are you crazy? It's got an
interracial romance; it's got this kid with tics. It's got jazz,
and who cares about jazz?'''
</P>
<P>
   Draper just kept saying no to changes. To her, all the elements
tied together: an African-American with Tourette's who is unwilling
to admit it, finding safety in the world of jazz, which readily
accepts both blacks and abnormal behavior; a mother trying to find
a role model for her Tourette's-afflicted son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a story that needed to be told a certain way,'' she
said. ``I don't care if I'm the only one seeing the movie in some
screening room somewhere. I have to see it the way I'm proud of it.
Otherwise, I can't live with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple regard Tourette's in the film as a metaphor for
people outside of society's comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of this movie is people accepting who they are,''
Wolff said, ``not having to be the ideal of normal. Whether it's
being a black person, having Tourette's _ whatever it is _ we feel
everyone, underneath, has something they feel is wrong with them,
something where they feel they don't quit fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was the movie's glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the main character of the movie,'' Draper said. ``It's
the fabric that ties the three people together. It's the thing that
allows them to talk about their Tourette's.''
</P>
<P>
   How well ``The Tic Code'' does in its initial release will
determine its future in national release. Whatever its fate, Draper
and Wolff said, they feel they have succeeded in what they set out
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so happy it's coming out at all,'' Draper said.

   These stories from the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia are moving to all points.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MAIN _ In an evening where the themes of strength and
compassion intertwine, the main speakers are Sen. John McCain and
former Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf on defense policy, Bush foreign
affairs adviser Condoleeza Rice on foreign affairs, and Elizabeth
Dole. (Herman).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-PROTESTS _ PHILADELPHIA _ Protests turned violent Tuesday as
demonstrators and police battled with fists and clubs in the heart
of the city. More than 90 arrests were reported, and delegates were
delayed arriving at the Republican National Convention. (Galloway)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-BUSH _ CHARLESTON, W.Va. _ George W. Bush continues his
march to the convention with appearances here and in Harrisburg,
Pa. (Heath).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GAY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., becomes the
first openly gay official to address a Republican National
Convention, though his topic Tuesday night is trade. There are
reports that the head of the Texas delegation was trying to head
off a walkout by some members when Kolbe speaks. That would mar the
convention theme of tolerance and diversity, exemplified by a
reception Tuesday honoring Republican gay and lesbian elected
officials. (Dart).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MONEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Like most coventions, this one is
awash in corporate sponorship, in various forms. Companies like
BellSouth with interests before the Commerce Department are
shelling out big bucks to sponsor lavish parties for Reps. Mike
Oxley and Billy Tauzin, who are vying for the committee chair.
Lobbyists pushing private Social Security accounts have supplied
1,000 beach balls to be released on the convention floor Wednesday
with slogans like ``Don't float more debt'' and ``Don't inflate the
trust fund.'' And Kraft is continuing its tradition of supplying
elephant-shaped macoroni to delegates and media. (Sherman).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-CHENEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney said Tuesday he would
join George W. Bush on a post-convention barnstorming tour
targeting battleground states in the Midwest. ``We are going to
take the battle to the heart of Democratic territory,'' Cheney
said. ``After the convention, George W. Bush and I will be taking a
train to campaign in states such as Illinois and Michigan.''
(O'Dell)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GEORGEP _ PHILADELPHIA _ An interview with George Prescott
Bush, the 25-year-old nephew of the nominee seen as one of the
GOP's strongest forces to attract young and Hispanic voters.
(Crowley)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-YOUNG-DELEGATE _ PHILADELPHIA _ ``Being the youngest, a lot
of people feel the need to protect me or guide me,'' said Karin
Henninger, 18, apparently the youngest delegate to the Republican
National Convention. But this Colorado alternate knows what she
thinks. (Garcia).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-NOTEBOOK _ PHILADELPHIA _ Tidbits from the Republican
National Convention. (Staff).

REVIEWS OF NEW VIDEO &AMP; DVD RELEASES &HT;    By BRUCE WESTBROOK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Romeo Must Die''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Titanic'' was ``Romeo and Juliet on a sinking ship,'' this
is ``Romeo and Juliet in a modern American gang war.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea worked better in ``West Side Story,'' not to mention
``Romeo + Juliet.'' Here, mundane mechanics are melded to fierce
ethnic stereotyping to create a cultural melting pot simmering with
too few action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo'' was intended as a breakthrough vehicle for Hong Kong
action star Jet Li after his strong supporting turn in the
unsatisfying ``Lethal Weapon 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Here he plays a Hong Kong cop heading to the United States with
Motivation No. 1 (and only) for far too many action films: revenge.
His brother was killed in a conflict between organized crime groups
_ one black, the other Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Via absurd coincidence, Li instantly meets Trish (singer
Aaliyah), daughter of the black crime boss, and they, of course,
fall in love. You figure out the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The drama is dreary, especially with so many flat supporting
performances (not counting Delroy Lindo's fine work as the black
godfather).
</P>
<P>
   But Li is likable enough, and he makes the most of his chances
to cut loose.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoyed the high-flying stunts of ``X-Men,'' you can find
some of the same thrills here, thanks to Corey Yuen. For ``X-Men,''
Yeun was ``action director.'' For ``Romeo Must Die,'' he was
``martial-arts coordinator.`` Either way, his work is a kick, and
Li delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is largely an exploitation flick you wish would get
busy and exploit. Instead, it tries to tell an ambitious yet
ultimately tired tale and sputters badly while its engine idles
between action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo'' has one extra for both VHS and DVD: Aaliyah's music
video for her contribution to the soundtrack, ``Try Again.'' The
DVD also adds several featurettes and trailers. &QL; 
Grade: C &QL; 
2000, R, Warner, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.98

   X X X
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes''
</P>
<P>
   For yet another teen romantic comedy, boy-girl maneuvers are
patterned after a classic tale, this time that of ``Cyrano de
Bergerac.''
</P>
<P>
   At least there's a fine cast. Playing high school seniors are
``The Practice'''s Marla Sokoloff and ``Once and Again'''s Shane
West. They're next-door neighbors, a la Melissa Joan Hart and
Adrian Grenier in ``Drive Me Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He craves an unattainable girl, while his jock friend eyes
Marla. Together the boys scheme to fulfill each other's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a fine array of pop songs, the film provides the usual
youth-market pandering, including wealth fantasies and a strange
absence of parents.
</P>
<P>
   These high schoolers live like they're in their early 20s (which
the actors are) and are financially independent. In one scene, they
have free rein in a mansion for an alcohol-soaked party.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are witlessly overstated and unlikable. The
script isn't smart, and it lacks a heart. For a John Hughes flick
wannabe, there's also an aimlessly edgy slant. ``Whatever It
Takes'' is coarse but not comical, with some gross-out gags that
just don't fit.
</P>
<P>
   But at least we can't blame Freddy Prinze Jr. for this one. &QL;

   Nanny bonanza
</P>
<P>
   If a Julie Andrews nanny movie is among your favorite things, a
double dose awaits you on video.
</P>
<P>
   New in stores is a ``Gold Collection'' edition of ``Mary
Poppins'' ($22.99 on VHS, $29.99 on DVD). Due Aug. 29 is a
35th-anniversary edition of ``The Sound of Music'' ($14.98 on tape,
$29.98 on disc).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' has been on tape since the '80s and had an
earlier DVD release. But the new ``Sound of Music'' is big news.
This marks the beloved film's debut on the booming DVD market.
Also, Fox is loading the two-disc sets with more than six hours of
bonus material, much of it never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among extras will be ``The Sound of Music'': From Fact to
Phenomenon,`` a new 87-minute documentary on Austria's singing Von
Trapp family, as it is in real life and as it is portrayed on the
screen. Narrated by Claire Bloom, it will have interviews with Von
Trapp family members, as well as ''Sound of Music`` stars Andrews
and Christopher Plummer, director Robert Wise and others in the
cast and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Also shown will be rare footage from the set. Many ``home
movies'' shot on location by the cast and crew in Salzburg,
Austria, were uncovered recently, lending themselves to this
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Discs also will offer trailers, TV and radio spots, audio
interviews, storyboards, production stills, sketches and a
production diary. Still more interviews, photos, clips and music
will arise, along with audio tracks by Wise and screenwriter Ernest
Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Also shown will be ``Salzburg Sight and Sound,'' a theatrical
featurette from 1965, with cast member Charmian Carr hosting a
Salzburg travelog. (It previously appeared on laserdisc.)
</P>
<P>
   For tech-heads, Fox says the film has a ``breathtaking new
hi-definition video transfer created from the original 65mm film
source,'' with Wise's approval. The soundtrack has been restored
and presented ``in discrete 4.1 Dolby Digital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' has far fewer spoonfuls of sugar. Its first DVD
had no extras, and this one adds only a few _ chiefly, a 16-minute
documentary, ``The Making of `Mary Poppins,''' hosted by star Dick
Van Dyke.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's not new.`` Making of'' was produced for a previous VHS
edition in 1997. (Oddly, ``Poppins' '' new tapes don't have the
featurette.)
</P>
<P>
   Other extras for DVD: a 16-question trivia game (geared to young
kids); a theatrical trailer; and ``Hollywood Goes to a World
Premiere,'' a 10-minute featurette documenting the film's premiere
in August 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its footage overlaps the making-of material, and its
sustained film clips are more superfluous than supercali _ well,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   But it's interesting to see fresh young stars of the era make
their glittering arrivals, from Mary Tyler Moore and ``enchanting
Angie Dickinson'' to Andrews _ beaming while wrapped in fur _ and
Van Dyke with his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Poppins'' is shown in the wide-screen format, with a
1.85-to-1 aspect ratio on DVD. As for the transfer, it looks
exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   If you already own the film on tape or disc, Disney feels your
pain. The studio is offering a $5 ``upgrade'' rebate when you send
in the proof-of-purchase tab or UPC symbol from your original copy.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Clint's Warner link
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' (opening Friday) isn't Clint Eastwood's first
film for Warner Bros.; it's just his latest. In fact, the actor's
longtime link to Warner has enabled that studio to issue a new
``Clint Eastwood Collection'' spanning 27 films.
</P>
<P>
   All are on VHS, but only 10 are on DVD: ``Unforgiven,''
``Absolute Power,'' ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' ``Dirty
Harry,'' ``The Gauntlet,'' ``Pale Rider,'' ``The Outlaw Josey
Wales,'' ``True Crime,'' ``Bronco Billy'' and ``Kelly's Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two are making their DVD debuts.
</P>
<P>
   Only on VHS are ``Magnum Force,'' ``The Enforcer,'' ``Sudden
Impact,'' ``The Dead Pool,'' ``Any Which Way You Can,'' ``City
Heat,'' ``Every Which Way But Loose,'' ``Firefox,'' ``Heartbreak
Ridge,'' ``Honkytonk Man,'' ``A Perfect World,'' ``Pink Cadillac,''
``The Rookie,'' ``Tightrope,'' ``Where Eagles Dare,'' ``White
Hunter,'' ``Black Heart'' and ``Eastwood on Eastwood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapes are $14.95 each, while discs are $24.98.

   These stories from the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia are moving to all points.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MAIN _ In an evening where the themes of strength and
compassion intertwine, the main speakers are Sen. John McCain and
former Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf on defense policy, Bush foreign
affairs adviser Condoleeza Rice on foreign affairs, and Elizabeth
Dole. (Herman).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-PROTESTS _ PHILADELPHIA _ Protests turned violent Tuesday as
demonstrators and police battled with fists and clubs in the heart
of the city. More than 90 arrests were reported, and delegates were
delayed arriving at the Republican National Convention. (Galloway)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-BUSH _ CHARLESTON, W.Va. _ George W. Bush continues his
march to the convention with appearances here and in Harrisburg,
Pa. (Heath).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GAY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., becomes the
first openly gay official to address a Republican National
Convention, though his topic Tuesday night is trade. There are
reports that the head of the Texas delegation was trying to head
off a walkout by some members when Kolbe speaks. That would mar the
convention theme of tolerance and diversity, exemplified by a
reception Tuesday honoring Republican gay and lesbian elected
officials. (Dart).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MONEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Like most coventions, this one is
awash in corporate sponorship, in various forms. Companies like
BellSouth with interests before the Commerce Department are
shelling out big bucks to sponsor lavish parties for Reps. Mike
Oxley and Billy Tauzin, who are vying for the committee chair.
Lobbyists pushing private Social Security accounts have supplied
1,000 beach balls to be released on the convention floor Wednesday
with slogans like ``Don't float more debt'' and ``Don't inflate the
trust fund.'' And Kraft is continuing its tradition of supplying
elephant-shaped macoroni to delegates and media. (Sherman).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-CHENEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney said Tuesday he would
join George W. Bush on a post-convention barnstorming tour
targeting battleground states in the Midwest. ``We are going to
take the battle to the heart of Democratic territory,'' Cheney
said. ``After the convention, George W. Bush and I will be taking a
train to campaign in states such as Illinois and Michigan.''
(O'Dell)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GEORGEP _ PHILADELPHIA _ An interview with George Prescott
Bush, the 25-year-old nephew of the nominee seen as one of the
GOP's strongest forces to attract young and Hispanic voters.
(Crowley)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-YOUNG-DELEGATE _ PHILADELPHIA _ ``Being the youngest, a lot
of people feel the need to protect me or guide me,'' said Karin
Henninger, 18, apparently the youngest delegate to the Republican
National Convention. But this Colorado alternate knows what she
thinks. (Garcia).
</P>
<P>
   CVN-NOTEBOOK _ PHILADELPHIA _ Tidbits from the Republican
National Convention. (Staff).

THE BEST SHOW AT THE CONVENTION: PSEUDO.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It may go down in history with Kittyhawk and
Marconi's first transatlantic message. Then again, it may be
remembered for its distinctive blend of Wayne's World and Animal
House in a skybox the size of Elizabeth Taylor's bathroom. Either
way, Day One of pseudo.com at the Republican convention was the
best show in this undazzling spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, print and network reporters wandered into the
cramped space to witness history or, at the very least, hide from
their editors. No one was quite sure what was happening except
that, for the first time, they could peek at any part of the hall
on a computer screen while following the live video interplay
between chatroom addicts and talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   This was not controlled chaos; it was the real thing. Pseudo was
playing without a net. Guests either appeared or they didn't. ``We
have no idea who will show up from those we asked,'' said pseudo
editorial director Gersh Kuntzman, who rather liked the
arrangement. ``Then there are others here we didn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who invited Philadelphia City Comptroller Jonathan Seidel,
for example, remains unclear. But there he was, with the look of a
man who had just made a huge mistake, waiting next to the stale
crackers and grape stems to be an online guest in the pseudo
skybox. He proved to be game, though, and declared the experience
``amazing'' as he left.
</P>
<P>
   The on-air talent was an eclectic bunch. Some appeared on
pseudo, while others were guests on Salon.com's hour-long show that
runs in the pseudo skybox each evening of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Among the talking heads during a two-hour stretch were 90
year-old CBS legend Robert Trout; the formidable arriviste and
Shadow Convention doyenne Arianna Huffington; New York Congressman
Jerry Nadler; Log Cabin Republicans head Rich Tafel; and The New
Republic scribe and Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz, who
favored a Jimmy Buffett look in a Hawaiian shirt with a beer in his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was decidedly Margaritaville. ``Rock on,
gentlemen,'' producer Sam Hollander exorted the group. He was kind
enough to add, ``You can bring the beer with you,'' as Wilentz
prepared to join the online fray. During the breaks, pseudo piped
``Green Onions'' by Booker T and the MGs through its speakers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, pseudo CEO David Bohrman, who reigns as skybox
impresario, gazed at the dead food littering the floor and
announced, ``I'm going to get the garbage out of here before we do
anything else. The Internet should be neat.''
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, the pseudo experience works something like this:
an EJ, pseudo's version of a DJ, monitors a chatroom whose members
receive a live audio feed from the skybox discussion. Monday's EJ,
a woman with the online moniker of Jaxx, took questions from the
chatroom off of her computer screen and gleefully interrupted the
on-air guests with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to be obnoxious,'' she said. ``If people in the
chatrooms don't believe what they're hearing, I'll let the online
people know about it.'' Jaxx gives new meaning to the talk show
dictum, ``Feel free to jump in at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo's fanciest gizmos are its five 360-degree web cameras
that continually pan the convention hall, day and night. A user of
its web site can control the view with a computer mouse and stop
the camera at any point to focus on interesting turf.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much as voyeurism goes. Republican delegates, after
all, don't provide many steamy scenes. And the visuals are
worthless until the technology improves. For now, they occupy a
small piece of real estate on a computer screen and are all but
impossible to decipher without 3-D glasses and a microscope. Pseudo
spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer conceded as much when she called the look
``chunky pointillism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not there yet,'' admits Bohrman, a former CBS producer.
``But from these feeble beginnings we see a glimpse of things to
come. The technology is too early now and it will be too late four
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuntzman adds that the pseudo package poses no threat to
reporting. ``We will never affect serious journalism,'' he says.
``We're the window dressing around it. Fortunately for us, there is
so little real reporting going on here that the question for us is,
did we book good guests?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: interactive explorations of medicare funding
are just as deadly as similar exercises on cable or at the Shadow
Convention, which continues to lose altitude daily. Pseudo's best
chance for survival is its mix of sponaneity and rudeness. If it
ever gets polite, it's in real trouble.

GA-GA OVER GAMES: BOARD GAMES HAVEN'T LOST THEIR APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photos; w/Boardgame-Tips) &HT;    By DANIEL J. VARGAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just got paid. It's Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is tuned to a station spinning the best from the '70s
and '80s. Chocolate chip cookies are baking to a golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   Come inside the Rodriguez household, where Fridays are family
board game night around the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, it's Monopoly _ Bass Fishing edition-style.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Rodriguez, the matriarch of this game-loving family, is
the trustworthy one. That's why she's always the designated banker.
</P>
<P>
   Dad _ Dave Rodriguez _ is resident comedian. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   Maripat, 13, is the forgetful one who's more worried about the
layout of her money than who lands on her property.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Dan wears his emotions on his sleeve and has a
noticeable allergic reaction to losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling lucky tonight,'' Mom proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you said that the last 10 games,'' her husband quips. The
kids laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is the Bass Fishing version where Bassmaster's
Classic is the equivalent of Boardwalk and houses and hotels become
bait shops and marinas. So Mom's game piece is the tackle box,
daughter the hat, Dad is the open-mouthed bass and son the fishing
boat.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 minutes into the game, things are getting a little
cutthroat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, we need to think about some alliances here,'' Dad says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't `Survivor','' the son responds.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway. (FYI: A board game version of CBS' hit
voyeuristic show is expected on shelves by November. Rats _ we hope
_ not included.)
</P>
<P>
   The simplistic, yet mind-stimulating, board game is thriving
despite the fact we live in a high-tech, computer-driven world
where most traditional board games such as Monopoly and Scrabble
are now available to play on computer with snazzy graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Avid players say, however, there's nothing like cracking open a
board game, spreading it out on the floor or table, and hanging
with friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The board game) Risk is fun, and Risk is fun to play against
a computer but nowhere near as fun as playing with a neighbor or
your best friend,'' says Erik Arneson, board game guide for
About.com. ``It's that face-to-face social aspect. Board games are
a nice way to get away from a computer monitor and use your brain
in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   To say board games go way back is an understatement. The
precursor to checkers, Arneson says, dates back to 600 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us probably remember the more recent classics such as
Clue, the Game of Life, Stratego, Candy Land, Scrabble and Risk.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget the characters of Mr. Green, Professor Plum and
Col. Mustard? Or the metal game pieces of Monopoly: Scotty, the
Scottish terrier; the tiny thimble; and the old-school racing car.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the computer and the Internet have opened the doors
to new games around the world, especially in Germany where games
such as Diplomacy, Settlers of Catan and Torres are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally immersed in board games,'' says Arneson, who owns
about 150 board games. ``I buy imported games from Germany. There
are great games out there for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And great places to play them: among them coffee houses and
cafes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday nights, board gamers practically rule the
Dessert Gallery in central Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, board game fans have packed the place
to play Scrabble, Yahtzee and Backgammon, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just crazy about playing games,'' owner Sara Brook
says. ``I've seen people crowded around a table to look at a hot
game of Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she isn't a board game enthusiast herself, Brook
purchased more games to keep her clientele happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more games now, and we branched out to Pictionary,''
she says. ``We even have Barrel of Monkeys for the young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Morris, spokesman for Hasbro Games, which owns Milton
Bradley and Parker Brothers, says board games are not just
surviving, they're growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   He says more than 600 people will compete at the
Hasbro-sponsored Scrabble national championship to be held next
week in Providence, R.I. _ that's a threefold increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in 1999, sales of the company's 30 most popular classic
games such as Monopoly were up 6 percent from the previous year.
Children's games such as Trouble were up 14 percent. Hasbro does
not release sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the very mature games to get a 6 percent increase is
almost amazing,'' Morris says. ``People are finding that they want
to come back to board games. They're vital because they provide
social interaction like no other form of entertainment can.''
</P>
<P>
   When just mere inches separate you from the next player, you're
bound to learn a few things about them beyond personal hygiene
habits. And not all of it is nice.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy suddenly becomes Mr. Know-It-All. The quiet one
transforms into an ear-bursting Chatty Cathy. The soft-spoken one
becomes a ruthless assassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for people to hide their faults, but it's harder for
them to do it when they're playing a board game,'' Arneson says.
``You simply have more interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the presence of games and competition mean sore
losers aren't far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get pretty nasty,'' Arneson says. ``I've seen people
curse at the board, other players. They'll knock off the pieces
from the board, abruptly leave or accuse someone of cheating. It's
amazing how serious people take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the inevitable cheater who likes to swipe money
from the bank or move pieces when there's a bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do?'' Arneson asks. ``You have to ask youself if
you want to play with them again. You can't stop it the first time
around, but you can the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing games on Fridays has been a tradition for the Rodriguez
family for about 15 years. The family has two other sons, Bob, 18,
and Michael, 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sons will come home from college and want a Monopoly night,
and that's wonderful,'' Janet Rodriguez says. ``It's an opportunity
for them to bring up things going on in their lives in a relaxed
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez says family game night is a priority, especially as
their children get older and begin to start their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they're family, and we have to know each
other,'' she says. ``And to do that, we have to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   Togetherness seems to be a common theme among board game
players.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Haseltine, a 61-year-old teacher from Pearland, Texas,
plays Parcheesi nightly. It's not that she has a particular
fondness for the game. She enjoys watching her 87-year-old mother,
Novella Myers, play.
</P>
<P>
   Myers suffers from mild memory loss, and to see her mentally
active is a beautiful sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see more sparkle in her eyes when she plays,'' Haseltine
says, adding that she's lost interest in needlework and
conversation as she's gotten older. ``It's enjoyable to just watch
her strategize and plan ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers' love for Parcheesi stems from childhood when she played
Parcheesi on her family's farm in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every night Haseltine breaks out the game on top of a
wooden, folding food tray. They'll play three games a night.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter don't talk much unless it's about the game.
Not even the lack of conversation can spoil these moments,
Haseltine says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a whiz at this game,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At times like this, it doesn't matter who wins.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Let each person bring his favorite game(s) and introduce it
to the group.

</P>
<P>
   3. Munchies (popcorn, chips, cookies) are a necessity.
</P>
<P>

angering your fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   5. Feel free to use house rules if everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   6. Be open to new board games.
</P>
<P>
   7. Choose teams. It can add to the fun.
</P>
<P>
   8. If you're playing with friends, rotate game locations.
</P>
<P>
   9. Resist sidebar conversations that distract from the game.
</P>
<P>
   10. Be patient with other players.

U.S. Capitol police officers, designs are being completed for a
$265 million Capitol Visitors Center that will boost security and
allow police to better manage the flow of visitors. The center will
be the first planned addition to the Capitol building since 1959,
but you won't be able to see it from ground level. The 500,000
square foot center will be built underground, between the Capitol
and the U.S. Supreme Court building. (O'Dell, Cox News Service).

HOLLYWOOD IS FINALLY FOCUSING ON SAVING ITS CELLUOID PAST
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PRESERVATION-LOST FILMS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner, yes he of the silk pajamas, rotating bed and that
little social bombshell he launched nearly 50 years ago, is on the
phone from ``the mansion'' and is mildly fulminating. Hefner is a
self-anointed defender of Hollywood celluloid history. He's got the
letter ``Y'' from the original ``Hollywood'' sign as a badge of his
film protector credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that the entire Hollywood community has been so
completely unaware of its own heritage,'' says Hefner, who admits
to a sentimental attachment to those melodramatic yarns involving
William Powell, or Basil Rathbone as the tweedy Sherlock Holmes.
``In terms of film preservation and recognition of film as a
universal art form, and one of the most important parts of this
country's past, there has been a real lack of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The level of Hefner's high dudgeon seems justified. Although the
last decade has revealed a sudden awareness by mainstream Hollywood
studios of the need to preserve and resurrect a number of classic
films, this is more an 11th-hour Band-Aid gesture than anything
else. It barely masks Hollywood's startlingly cavalier neglect
toward its own product. The studios' passivity stands in marked
contrast to the actions of graying moguls like Hefner who regularly
pony up tens of thousands of dollars to preserve their childhood
screen favorites in the name of posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Pounding home the crying need for greater film preservation
awareness was June's American Movie Classics eighth annual
``Preservation Festival.'' This year, AMC trumpeted its message by
showcasing the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the glossy restoration
of ``Rear Window,'' whose original negative was reportedly so
damaged that it almost resisted resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   AMC could easily have bandied about statistics that point to a
disturbing film mortality rate. About half of the 21,000 shorts and
feature films shot before 1950 are lost, that is to say,
unviewable. For films made before 1921, including numerous silent
era chestnuts, the number of perished films rises to 90 percent. At
Paramount studios alone, only 37 of 1,014 silent films survive. And
most of the color films produced on Eastman Color stock between
1950 and 1975 will likely fade into pink obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, in the Hollywood community, there have been
accounts of tins of film stock and negatives converted into
Wilshire Boulevard landfill or Pacific Ocean chum, images that
perhaps best sum up the movie industry's malign neglect of its
archival riches.
</P>
<P>
   For a vain community so eager to elevate its work to near mythic
status, film artists have historically yielded to the hard-core
business decision of jettisoning their films as soon as they
exhausted a screening run. ``For Hollywood, it has always been the
shortsighted approach of what can you do for me today or
tomorrow,'' says Ken Weissman, head of the motion picture
conservation center of the Library of Congress' facility at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Almost none of Hollywood's most beloved films has been
inoculated from the Chinese water torture of gradual deterioration.
While working on the re-release of ``Star Wars,'' George Lucas
discovered an original negative so decomposed that he had to resort
to outtakes to complete the restoration. Universal Pictures
reportedly no longer has a single original print of its
Oscar-garlanded ``The Sting.'' The original negative for John
Ford's ``Stagecoach'' is gone. And until a recent restoration
supervised by the late Stanley Kubrick himself, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' was shaded like a smoked salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a human face on that kind of deterioration reveals whole
film careers reduced to celluloid dust. ``Take someone like Theda
Bara who was the Madonna and Sharon Stone of her silent-film day,''
says Margaret Bodde, director of The Film Foundation. ``Of the more
than 40 films she made, only one of them has survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety, not heritage, was the prime incentive for most studios'
systematic destruction of many films made prior to 1950. Old film
stock was composed of silver cellulose nitrate, a substance that
put the ``silver'' luminousness onto the silver screen. The only
catch is that nitrate film made prior to 1950 possessed properties
alarmingly similar to gunpowder. As it ages, cellulose nitrate
breaks down, turns to jelly or dust, and runs a good risk of
exploding _ as happened during nitrate fires consuming the original
negatives of ``Singin' in the Rain'' and ``Citizen Kane.'' So the
studios pre-emptively destroyed the silver nitrate powder keg they
had inadvertently created.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many of silver nitrate's replacements weren't
improvements in preservation. One brand of ``safety'' film, a
popular replacement stock, suffered from the ``vinegar syndrome,''
whereby extreme changes in temperature would trigger an instability
in the film while emitting a pungent, vinegar odor. And even
without this odoriferous demise, a film's surface area could show
scratches, brittleness, tearing and/or massive fading, known as the
shrimp effect, ``where facial highlights become a lovely shade of
crustacean,'' says Robert Harris, an archivist with The Film
Preserve, one of the country's leading film restoration firms.

NO ENGINE PARTS IN CONCORDE DEBRIS TRAIL, SAY INVESTIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   French investigators said Tuesday that they had not found any
engine parts in the trail of debris shed by an Air France Concorde
on its brief flight before crashing near Charles de Gaulle Airport
outside Paris on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Bureau of Accident Investigations also said
that it had found no evidence of any ``particular problem before
the departure of the flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew had radioed shortly before the crash that two engines
were not working properly, raising the possibility that an engine
had broken up in flight and thrown off parts that punctured a fuel
tank or a fuel line; in that case, engine parts would have dropped
on the ground. Some work had been done on an engine part, a thrust
reverser, shortly before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators are focusing on the possibility that tires
burst and sent debris flying up into the fuel tanks or other parts,
releasing fuel that allowed a spectacular fire to begin even before
the plane had lifted off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The French authorities reiterated Tuesday that Air France's five
remaining Concordes would stay grounded for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, which had continued flying its seven Concordes,
had to take one out of service Tuesday, shortly before it was due
to leave Heathrow Airport in London for New York, because more work
was needed on an engine that had been replaced over the weekend.
That plane had suffered an engine surge while landing at Heathrow
from New York on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways put the 33 passengers on another Concorde, which
took off more than two hours late.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You might mistake the Republican convention for an
ethnic festival or a forum on women's rights,'' The New York Times
said in a description that seems to capture the scene in
Philadelphia this week. Except this dispatch didn't come from the
convention that is nominating George W. Bush, but the one that
nominated his father 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The image of diverse Republican speakers is so at odds with the
usual portrayal of the party that some people have concluded that
something radical and significant must be going on. Last week, a
Times story said the convention would ``showcase women and people
from minority groups, faces that are not usually highlighted at
Republican conventions.'' Actually, the last convention, in 1996,
gave prominent roles to Susan Molinari, Colin Powell and Elizabeth
Dole. And GOP conventions have been showcasing women and minorities
since at least the time of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans held their 1980 convention in Detroit, a heavily
unionized city with a majority of black residents. In 1984, women
received the two longest speakers' slots at the Dallas convention.
And in 1988, trying to close the gender gap and appear ``kinder and
gentler,'' Republicans gave over their podium to a parade of women
and members of minority groups. Even the 1992 convention, now often
characterized as a right-wing hate fest, featured an event called
``Black America Salutes the First Family'' and forced white male
luminaries like Alfonse D'Amato and Howard Baker to surrender their
credentials to make room for more female delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A convention is a television commercial, and the decision to
feature black or female faces has barely any deeper philosophical
import than the decision to feature balloons or confetti. In
February, when Bush needed the support of conservative whites in
South Carolina, he visited Bob Jones University and refused to
denounce the Confederate flag. This doesn't mean that Bush is a
secret racist; it simply reflected expediency in the choice of
racial symbolism at that moment. Now the moment and the symbolism
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that Bush has not fundamentally altered the
direction of his party is reaction of the GOP's right wing.
Conservatives are so vigilant against creeping moderation that they
have denounced Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott for ideological
deviation. Not only is this group not barking out any complaints
now, but it is nuzzled lovingly in Bush's lap. And no wonder. His
positions on economics and judicial appointments hew firmly to the
conservative line.
</P>
<P>
   Party diehards understand that it doesn't much matter if a blind
mountain climber gets to speak in prime time while Lott is shunted
to 11 a.m. Come next year, it is Lott, not the mountain climber or
the gospel singers, who will be helping to set the legislative
agenda for the GOP.

 By ALAN K. SIMPSON    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Since he became the Republican vice presidential
nominee, Dick Cheney has been depicted as some kind of right-wing
kook. His detractors have scoured his record in Congress and
plucked out a few votes with no reference to their context. They
toss out conclusions about him that have no relation to his
splendid reputation among his former colleagues, Republican and
Democrat alike. But if his detractors continue to focus on only a
few of his thousands of votes, let's at least be upfront with the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS: Dick Cheney opposed sanctions against
South Africa under apartheid and voted against a resolution calling
for the release of Nelson Mandela. But the issues then were not so
simple.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, there was a consensus to end apartheid. The debate
was whether sanctions should be imposed or whether we should follow
President Ronald Reagan's policy of free trade and open dialogue.
Reagan believed the American companies could best help black South
Africans by giving them jobs. Sanctions, the thinking went, would
only hurt black South Africans, because these companies would have
to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the resolution to free Mandela contained language
requiring official recognition of the African National Congress as
the legitimate representative of the black majority. But the South
African government was then our ally in stemming communism in
Africa, particularly in Angola, and the leaders of the ANC included
admitted communists.
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney cast his votes, neither he nor anyone else knew
when the Cold War would end. Nor could we know that sanctions would
ultimately help create a free South Africa. Members of the House
are issued voting cards, not crystal balls.
</P>
<P>
   EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT: It is not easy being a minority member
of the House. The majority party can use procedures that deprive
the minority of offering amendments. That's what happened when
Democrats brought the equal rights amendment to the House for
consideration under ``Suspension of the Rules,'' which doesn't
allow debate or amendments _ even though this legislation would
have amended the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has always supported the equal rights amendment. He voted
no because he believed that a proposed amendment to the
Constitution should be subject to full debate. But this vote was
not about equal rights for women. This was about the Democrats'
hardball efforts to create an issue during a campaign year.
</P>
<P>
   HEAD START: If Dick Cheney were voting today on whether to
expand this program, or any other social program, he would first
ask whether it was worthwhile. If the answer was yes, the next
question would be, ``Can we afford it?'' The answer today, with the
surpluses piling up, is likely yes. But Cheney served in Congress
during the days of huge deficits. It's never easy for politicians
to say no to worthwhile programs, but if we hadn't had members of
Congress like him to cast these tough votes, we might not have the
luxury of surpluses we wallow in today.
</P>
<P>
   GUN CONTROL: In Wyoming, gun control means holding your rifle
steady. We have a different lifestyle; we learn to use firearms for
hunting or target practice responsibly at an early age. The way for
a guy to be ``outside the mainstream'' _ or out of office _ is to
vote for gun control. The last time I checked, members of Congress
are encouraged to represent their constituency. But things change,
and the Columbine shootings and other tragedies have haunted us
all. I personally know that Dick Cheney would almost surely support
tough laws to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and
criminals. He would also support child safety locks and raising the
age of handgun possession to 21.
</P>
<P>
   THE ENVIRONMENT: Cheney is an avid outdoorsman, committed to
conservation and a clean environment. I remember his steady efforts
on behalf of an act that set aside thousands of acres of Wyoming
for special protection. No one fought harder for it than he did,
despite the powerful economic interests and many Republicans
fighting against the designation.
</P>
<P>
   To evaluate his record fairly, one must look at the 1980s, with
its deficits and Cold War antagonisms. And one must remember that
he represented a very conservative state, and ask whether these
votes are relevant to judging his qualifications. As vice
president, he would take a broader view than his role of
congressman from Wyoming required. After all, we know that as
defense secretary during the Gulf War, Cheney was calm and cool
under pressure _ thoughtful, competent and trustworthy. What he is
not is an extremist. Those who know him will tell you this,
including honest Democrats.

UNDATED: restoration firms. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even worse has been the sheer abuse or careless cataloging of
many great film negatives. Consider 1954's ``Rear Window,'' whose
original negative was in tatters thanks to the churning out of 389
prints of the film. And ``Stagecoach,'' John Ford's cornerstone
western and collaboration with John Wayne, had to be repaired
without the benefit of its original negative as only a 16mm print
was thought to exist. Eventually a 35mm version was found, rumored
to belong to Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios' record on preservation is unspeakable,'' says
Kevin Brownlow, director of London-based Photoplay Productions, one
of the world's pre-eminent restoration firms, ``Frankly, I think
that executives are much more interested in their lunch than in
looking after their pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that each studio doles out between $2 million
and $5 million per year to their preservation and restoration
programs. That seems a tad stingy when considering that for $50
million, roughly the average cost of a feature film, 30,000 reels
of silent-era film could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Columbia Pictures lacked a film-preservation
program. But thanks to its merger with high-definition TV-minded
Sony, Columbia created a whole department devoted to restoration.
Universal, MGM and Warner Bros. maintain their film libraries
collection with some care. However, The Walt Disney Company,
insiders say, seems to pay the greatest attention to preserving its
cache of classic animation. Witness ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in these companies really treat films like selling
black rubber combs,'' Harris says. ``They aren't passionate about
film, so when it comes to restoration, they feel no one will care
if you start messing with the color of `Lawrence of Arabia.' Now
with that attitude, where does that leave America's art form?''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture that amounts to the path of least resistance,
Hollywood's studios have allowed several outside organizations to
compensate for their lax preservation effort. Pitching in are the
National Endowment for the Arts, The Pew Charitable Trusts and The
Film Foundation, co-created by Martin Scorsese, George Lucas and
Steven Spielberg, among others. Many of the oldest, frailest films
are drawn from the extensive archives held at UCLA, the Library of
Congress (among its 120,000 film cans in its Ohio storage area is
``The Great Train Robbery''), New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and George Eastman
House.
</P>
<P>
   Where the main Hollywood studios have most clearly dropped the
ball is in their preservation of silent films. The main object of
the National Film Preservation Foundation's ``Saving the Silents''
effort, fueled by a $1 million federal support fund, is to
preserve, usually on a modern, 35mm master copy, some 67 shorts and
serials. In addition, the foundation has salvaged thousands of
minority-made films, avant-garde reels and other so-called
``orphans'' that lack real commercial viability.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a $500,000 grant from the National Endowment
for the Arts has helped a fascinating selection of rare films
remain alive. They include ``Blacksmithing Scene,'' the nation's
first commercial film (made in 1893), several ``one-reelers'' from
Thomas Edison in his laboratory, and home movies from Ernest
Hemingway and Groucho Marx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that there are very few marketplace
incentives to protect so many of these orphan films,'' says Annette
Melville, director of the National Film Preservation Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps shamed by these vigorous efforts at film preservation
outside the Hollywood studios, the moviemaking community has
invested the last decade in improving its halfhearted conservation
efforts. ``With the value of film having become more obvious in the
last 10 years, many of the studios are finally practicing what they
had only preached before,'' says Roger Mayer, president of Turner
Entertainment Co. and chairman of the National Film Preservation
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's creative and media elite have attached themselves to
idiosyncratic restoration projects. Scorsese took such a shine to
the 1965 Polish film ``The Saragossa Manuscript'' that he helped
defray the $36,000 cost of its renovation. And Ted Turner has taken
a passionate interest in a British restoration company's bid to
rescue a 1925 silent film version of ``Ben Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   When the major studios have launched themselves into the
preservation and the restoration game, it has produced very highly
publicized cosmetic surgeries on such marquee titles as
``Vertigo,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' and ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly an improvement over the days when the only
ones in the community interested in preservation were just a few
archivists,'' says Arthur Hiller, former president of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But the studios' critics still scoff at their attempts to buff
up only the best-known titles. ``What the studios do now is all
about public relations,'' says Brownlow. ``They will bring out the
obvious stuff like `Casablanca' and let the other stuff perish.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The ideal film preservation formula involves maintaining prints
at a steady temperature of 32 to 50 degrees, and 35 percent
humidity. Warner Bros. has six cold storage vaults (many of them
earthquake-proof) and has maintained films in old salt mines in
Kansas. Warner's separate areas contain a total of 650,000 video
and audio reels. Paramount has two storage plants including one
buried in a limestone mine. ``Everyone knows that the proper
storage for a huge film library is nowhere near the cost of even
the marketing campaign of one major film,'' admits Gray Ainsworth,
vice president of technical services at MGM.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The studios' better-late-than-never motivation for preservation
is the explosion of ancillary markets eager for the overhauled
classic. From television to video, cable networks (such as American
Movie Classics), pay-per-view, laserdisc, DVD and the Internet, the
number of new outlets for these musty favorites has grown
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   The studios don't deny the new incentive. ``Quite frankly, not
only do we recognize the new need to sell into these new markets,
but DVD in particular sets a very high standard for quality so
everyone is having to clean up all the pops and crackles on their
material,'' says Grover Crisp, vice president for asset management
and film restoration at Sony Pictures Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every aging film will qualify for a digital
afterlife. ``Films will fall through the cracks; do you really see
the studios spending $1.5 million to restore 1959's `Porgy and
Bess' or rather let it rot, losing those performances by Sidney
Poitier and Pearl Bailey?'' Harris says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to restoration, the only certainty is how
time-consuming and costly it can be. A typical black-and-white film
can run between $20,000 to $50,000 to preserve and restore, while a
color film costs between $50,000 and $300,000. The rescue of
``Lawrence of Arabia'' ate up more than a year and cost $1 million.
That's a bargain compared with the $15 million for the re-release
of the original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every restoration effort reveals either blatant film
neglect or the painstaking effort to revive the film. This year's
USA Film Festival in Dallas showed a fully restored version of
1967's ``In Cold Blood,'' whose original negative was torn in more
than 30 places. In the reconstruction of ``Spartacus,'' not only
were Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick heavily involved, but the
film specialists took two years to comb through 1,600 cans of audio
and visual materials. And The American Film Institute in Los
Angeles recalls how it had to recover the missing 10-minute first
part of its ``Our Gang-Lil' Rascals'' film series through an 8.5mm
home movie in Australia and a film restoration expert in Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, digital technology is playing a key role in all of these
far-flung restoration tales. Digital scanning and adjusting is
helping erase the surface scratches that pock older prints in
addition to smoothing over the nagging pops and hisses from aging
sound tracks. MGM's restoration department used a digital comb to
remove the rain of green specks that had formed on Sidney Poitier's
face in part of ``In the Heat of the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some warn that digital's facility in erasing a film's
time-worn glitches can lead to enslavement to what might be the
accelerating obsolescence of the DVD player. ``It won't last
forever, and if ever there is a problem with a digital copy, there
might not be anything to fall back on,'' Bodde says. ``Putting a
film in digital form is akin to (having) a really good color laser
copy of the Mona Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday night, Hugh Hefner wanted to screen the Errol
Flynn classic ``Gentleman Jim'' with one of Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy's great collaborations, ``State of the Union.'' He
was finding it virtually impossible to track down clean, 35mm
versions of either film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a film is regularly seen on television doesn't
mean that there is a theatrically viable, 35mm print available
anymore,'' Hefner says. ``This bothers me, because other than my
family, movies were the major influence on my life, setting the
dreams of my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner's concern is one of many familiar to the Hollywood's old
guard. But does it bother the new breed? Apparently yes, at least
according to the Directors Guild of America, whose preservation
committee is filled with such young-buck talent as directors M.
Night Shyamalan, Bill Duke and Steven Soderbergh. And a review of
the donor list of The Film Foundation reveals that such young
mega-stars as Leonardo DiCaprio and Winona Ryder have contributed
anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 to the preservation effort.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder's generous donation explains why the actress recently
remarked that a perfect day for her would include her cellphone
suddenly ringing with Scorsese on the line: He ``calls me to tell
me that scientists have discovered an inexpensive way to restore
old movies.''

GOP CONVERTS LEAVE THEIR YELLOW DOG DAYS BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., La.)   By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama is the co-chair of
his state's delegation to the Republican National Convention. Rep.
Billy Tauzin of Louisiana is among the GOP congressional elite on
hand. But not so many years ago, they wouldn't have been let
through the door here.
</P>
<P>
   They were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is an oddity of modern Southern politics that many of the
die-hard, rock-solid conservatives who comprise the bulwark of the
GOP across Dixie got their political start in the opposing camp.
There were no Republicans in the Solid South, not many anyway, an
antipathy directly linked to the vestiges of the Civil War. People
interested in holding office or voting in primaries that were the
true elections had to call themselves Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP converts are quick to point out that though they
might have worn the Democratic label, they never shared the ideals
of what they saw as an increasingly liberal national Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never voted for a Democrat for president,'' boasted Shelby,
who conspicuously switched parties the day after Republicans seized
control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one better illustrates how the Southern political
tide has shifted than Alabama GOP delegate George Wallace Jr., the
son of the fire-breathing governor and presidential candidate who
personified the Southern Democrat for many in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Elected twice statewide as a Democrat, the younger Wallace said
that in 1995 he broke the news to his ailing father that if the son
were to run for office again, it would be as a Republican. He said
his father had already shown his own sympathy for Republican causes
and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear publicly where he was,'' said Wallace, who
was elected to the state Public Service Commission shortly after
his father's death in 1998. ``He understood my change.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, in fact, credits his father with playing a major role
in shaping the current GOP philosophy of states' rights and a
reduced role of federal government, a view espoused by such
contemporary Southern political figures as Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Newt Gingrich of Georgia as well as Shelby and
Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was the architect of the modern conservative
movement,'' said Wallace. ``I think what he represented so well
when he ran for president across the country were Alabama values.''
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of party switching that occurred in the 1990s began
in the 1980s with a nudge from President Ronald Reagan, who was
known to be effective in persuading conservative Democrats that
they should make the jump to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats were easy targets, unhappy as they were with
a party they saw as falling under the control of labor, minorities
and other activist groups, the same interests that made Walter
Mondale the presidential nominee in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who took the plunge is delegate and veteran
Louisiana legislator John Hainkel of New Orleans, who recalls he
flew to Washington to switch parties in a high-profile ceremony
with Reagan and Vice President George Bush looking on approvingly.
Like many who left the Democrats, Hainkel said he didn't change _
the national Democratic agenda did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept going to the left and I sort of stayed where I was,''
said Hainkel, the current state Senate president who noted that
when he joined the legislature in 1968 there was not a single
Republican in either the House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin switched in 1995, one of five conservative House
Democrats from the South to do so that year after Republicans
gained control. He had struggled with his allegiance since
President Clinton took office in 1993. Now he is line to be
chairman of the Commerce Committee, one of the top jobs in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt whatsoever he is truly Republican,'' said
state party leader Pat Brister.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just well-known delegates who made the switch.
Alabama GOP chairman Winton Blount estimates that about half of the
state's delegation has at some point has worked on behalf of
Democratic candidates.

JUDGE WON'T BLOCK LUCENT WORKERS' DEFECTION TO CISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cisco Systems won a round Tuesday in its nasty battle
with Lucent Technologies over Cisco's new optical plant in Salem,
N.H., with a federal judge declining to issue an injunction
blocking 10 former Lucent employees from moving to Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court judge Edward F. Harrington ruled that ``there
is no evidence'' that any of the 10 defectors from Lucent's big
plant in North Andover had disclosed ``any proprietary or
confidential information. . . . There is no evidence that
defendants have caused (Lucent) any actual harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In language that had Cisco executives privately gloating,
Harrington also said in his ruling that the technology Cisco will
manufacture at its new Salem plant ``is a much more highly
developed and complex product than the plaintiff's,'' suggesting
there were few valuable Lucent secrets to divulge anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco will use the new Salem plant to build dense wave division
multiplexing systems that put multiple data streams over a single
fiber line by transmitting in several colors of light. Much of the
Cisco technology came through an acquisition from Pirelli Optical
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become an increasingly common practice in the
bitterly competitive telecom sector, Lucent in June sued 10 former
employees who left its 6,000-person North Andover plant to work for
Cisco. Among them was 18-year Lucent veteran Daniel B. Tymann, who
is now plant manager for the Cisco optical equipment factory.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the 10 employees, whose defense is being funded
by Cisco, charged Lucent with sex discrimination, ``abusive and
oppressive management tactics,'' and toleration of shoddy work to
speed sales. Lucent denied all these charges.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's ruling only blocks Lucent from getting an immediate
order stopping the employees from working for Cisco but preserves
its right to pursue its suit against them.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said Lucent ``still has a viable cause of action
against the defendants'' if it can prove in a trial they are
revealing trade secrets or violating terms of their employment
contracts at Lucent. Harrington said he would entertain future
motions for injunctions from Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent spokesman John Skalko said the Murray Hill, N.J., company
was pleased that Harrington ``recognized our right to protect our
proprietary information. We're encouraged that our former employees
are clearly prohibited from disclosing Lucent trade secrets or
other proprietary information'' while the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Tymann said he was relieved and happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jobs and livelihood were at stake, and our integrity was
questioned and so was that of our peers,'' Tymann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message to people that you have a right to change
jobs and careers,'' Tymann said, but added that he had no comment
on whether he thinks other Lucent employees at its Merrimack Valley
site plan to jump over to Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which has spent more than $8 billion buying local
start-ups in recent years, has faced challenges keeping top talent
from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is renovating a former Digital Equipment Corp. factory in
Salem for use as a 2,500-person optical equipment plant that will
be one of its flagship properties in New England. It expects to
formally open the plant in October.
</P>
<P>
   With the market for fiber-optic telecommunications gear
exploding, Lucent, for years the dominant US telecom gear maker and
still the world's largest, has been in a dogfight with rivals such
as Cisco and Nortel Networks to maintain market leadership.

 &HT;    It's a first: Pop compilation tops the charts
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in Billboard magazine history, a multi-artist
album that isn't a soundtrack made its debut at the top of the pop
charts this week, ``Now That's What I Call Music! 4.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a collection of hits, but not of the old K-Tel variety seen
on late-night TV. The 18-single compilation CD that dethroned
embattled rapper Eminem after an eight-week reign ironically
contains some of the recent singles of acts he most likes to
criticize _ boy band the Backstreet Boys' ``Larger Than Life,''
teen siren Britney Spears' ``(You Drive Me) Crazy'' and blonde
Britney-in-training Mandy Moore's ``Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Richter, manager of HMV Records in Lenox Square, said,
``from what I hear and what I see, this is something that's selling
on all of the racks'' _ both at record shops and at such
mass-market retailers as Target and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now's'' appeal is obvious: It's pop radio without the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't the 320,000 ``Now'' sold during its first week
detract from the sales of its artists' own CDs?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, says Bob Mercer, senior vice president of UTV
Records, the label that released ``Now.'' UTV claims that more than
half of those who buy a ``Now'' album will go on to purchase an
album by one of the participating artists. The record labels
partnering on this project, Universal Music Group, the EMI Group,
Sony Music and Zomba, ``get a considerable amount of income as
indeed do the artists,'' Mercer says.
</P>
<P>
   Plus the labels get to introduce their artists to an audience
that may have bought ``Now'' because of another performer, Mercer
says.
</P>
<P>
   UTV is the arm of Universal Music Enterprises set up three years
ago to put out such TV-marketed compilations as ``Now,'' ``Pure
Funk'' and ``Jamming Grooves.''
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Now'' compilation, ``we are heavily focused toward
MTV, and particularly Nickelodeon, because it is incredibly
influential,'' Mercer says. ``And `Now' records tend to skew
young.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old U.S. version of the ``Now'' series is an
offshoot of the ``Now'' brand that started 15 years ago overseas,
and has sold more than 55 million copies across the world. It's so
popular, in fact, that compilations were given their own chart in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   No chance of that here, says Billboard's Geoff Mayfield,
director of charts. ``We like to see, on one chart, how everything
out there in the marketplace fares,'' he says. ``And surprise,
surprise _ a collection of hit songs sells like a hit album.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mayfield was surprised by ``Now's' chart-topping
appearance. But his 12-year-old wasn't.

 &HT;    Documentary a serious study of kids
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right away, ``American High'' slaps down its manifesto, courtesy
of a kid named Morgan in a Korn T-shirt: ``These are the years
where you're supposed to go (bleeping) wild, blame it all on your
parents, not have to suffer consequences, have unprotected sex, do
drugs, drink alcohol, watch porno, porno, porno, go pick fights, be
reckless. ... And instead, you're stuck at home, doing homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are sentiments guaranteed to give serious palpitations to
any parents of teenagers watching this new Fox documentary series,
not that many parents are likely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``American High'' is of, for and, more or less, by today's
adolescents in all their troubled, contradictory glory.
</P>
<P>
   Although some viewers will want to lump it in with the summer's
Voyeur-Vision trend, ``AH'' is really just a straight,
old-fashioned documentary; with no tribal councils or votes of
expulsion. The filmmakers hung out with 14 students last school
year at mostly white, mostly affluent Highland Park High School in
suburban Chicago and gave the kids camcorders to keep their own
video diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is running half-hour episodes for 13 weeks, with the first
two back-to-back tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Morgan, who has more interesting layers to him
than that opening talking-id barrage would indicate, there's Robby
and Sarah, so hopelessly in goo-goo love that it's almost painful
to watch; Brad, an out gay kid whose parents are textbook-accepting
of who he is; Kaytee, a budding musician-songwriter who may not be
threatening Ani di Franco yet, but whose wicked perceptiveness
makes her a joy to listen to; and Kiwi, a football player who seems
oblivious that his best platonic friend, the Latina Anna, may have
a secret crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the ones we meet in the first two episodes; presumably
the remainder of the 14 will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``AH'' is wise in not making us keep track of too many people at
first, so that despite having to wade through some standard
adolescent ``Who am I?'' navel-gazing, we get to know the kids at
something more than a superficial level.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments here that can just break your heart, whatever
your age. ``It's very lonely at my house,'' Sarah says, and with no
further explanation, she conjures up a world of hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who has attention deficit disorder, visits his doctor
and blinks vacantly as he listens to a discussion about changing
his Ritalin dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Will these kids become Warholian celebs, a la the casts of
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother''? It's doubtful, but these days,
anything is possible. They themselves obviously aren't sure what
they want. They only know they want it now.

ANALYSIS: EFFORTS TO CURB AFRICA REBELS' DIAMOND TRADE PROVE
INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Diamonds have become unfashionable as never
before among Western powers struggling to snuff out civil wars in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled by pictures of children with limbs hacked off by
diamond-smuggling rebels in Sierra Leone and humiliated when those
rebels kidnapped international peacekeepers in May, the United
States, Britain and several other countries are making control of
the diamond trade a foreign policy priority.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations recently imposed an embargo on diamonds from
Sierra Leone, and the United States is threatening sanctions
against other West African countries accused of trading guns for
gems. And a consensus has emerged for a strict certification regime
to keep the stones that have been used to fuel Africa's civil wars
out of the world's jewelry shops.
</P>
<P>
   What has been conspicuously missing from all this is
international support in the form of money, arms or troops _ to
force the rebels in Sierra Leone out of their lucrative diamond
mining turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real critical thing is that someone has got to go in there
and get the rebels out,'' said Ralph Hazleton, a Canadian expert on
diamonds who testified Tuesday at a U.N. hearing on the diamond
embargo in Sierra Leone. ``No matter what the international
community does, the rebels will always find ways to sell their
diamonds. There are a lot of not-so-honest people around.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the existence of unscrupulous diamond traders can be
found by looking to Angola, where the Unita rebel movement, despite
a U.N. diamond embargo, has made hundreds of millions of dollars a
year by selling stones into the international market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations
and chairman of a committee that investigated violations of the
embargo in Angola, has said the embargo did little to put Unita out
of the diamond business. Rather, he said, it was a military
offensive last year by Angolan government forces that chased Unita
away from diamond mines and finally crippled its smuggling
operation.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, though, military analysts say the government
cannot hope to push rebels out of diamond mining areas without
substantial help from U.N. peacekeepers or a major injection of
military aid from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and British diplomats made clear in interviews here
today that there was neither the political will nor the money to
rout the rebels from Sierra Leone's diamond country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not working to militarily defeat the rebels,'' said
Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador to the United Nations.
``It is unrealistic in the short or medium term to expect that
either the Sierra Leone government or the United Nations
peacekeepers will be capable of taking over the whole of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, is spending
$40 million to train security forces in the country and has plans
to supply them with some weapons, Greenstock said. But he added
that British help was not intended to make the government capable
of going on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   What the British, the Americans and the United Nations hope to
do, then, is to make rebels in Sierra Leone say uncle by applying
an economic and political squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said they expect that strict enforcement of the
embargo, which has won broad public support from diamond traders,
will make smuggling much less easy and profitable than it has been
in the past. In recent years, the rebels have been making between
$30 and $50 million a year from smuggled diamonds, according to a
U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking down on the diamond trade is particularly difficult,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars worth of the stones can be smuggled in a
sock, and it is often impossible for experts to determine the
country of origin for small parcels of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the problem is compounded by a long open border
with Liberia, a country where U.S. and British diplomats say the
president, Charles Taylor, is a principal player in the diamond
smuggling. Officials accused Taylor of formulating military
strategy for the rebels and personally profiting from the sale of
illicit stones.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent an envoy last month to Monrovia, the
Liberian capital, to warn Taylor that unless he immediately halted
the trade he would be subject to unilateral and international
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberia may have little to lose from sanctions. Its economy
is already in ruins, thanks to a savage civil war prosecuted by
Taylor. Although it was once the largest-per-capita recipient of
U.S. aid in Africa, Liberia now receives little money from the
United States and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds, in fact, may be more valuable in Liberia than
international good will.
</P>
<P>
   According to a U.S. official, the tiny country exported about
$290 million in smuggled diamonds last year, a huge windfall for a
near-bankrupt state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen no diminution yet between the almost daily
contracts between senior leaders in Monrovia and senior leader of
the RUF,'' said Greenstock, using the acronym for the rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing views of U.S. diplomats, Greenstock predicted that
strict enforcement of the diamond embargo will, over time,
impoverish the rebels and make them willing to discuss a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are lowering the price of diamonds going out and therefore
de-motivating the RUF,'' Greenstock said, adding that there is
evidence that the price of smuggled diamonds has fallen 30 percent
since the United Nations imposed an embargo on Sierra Leone stones
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The British ambassador dismissed a comparison to the largely
ineffectual diamond embargo in Angola. He said that other nations
and the world diamond trade are now much more motivated and united
in their desire to halt violence in Africa.

SPEECHWORKS' IPO BUCKS MARKET, GAINS 184 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SpeechWorks International Tuesday continued a trend of
telecommunications firms bucking the choppy market for
technology-sector initial public offerings. Its shares nearly
tripled on their opening day of trading to give the company a Wall
Street valuation of over $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-person Boston-based company makes speech-recognition
systems that allow people to use their voice _ instead of telephone
touch-tone buttons _ to get information and conduct business over
the phone. Tuesday, its shares soared from a $20 offering price to
as high as $67.25 before closing at $56.75, for a 184 percent
first-day gain.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street has had mixed reactions to this summer's crop
of technology IPOs, the booming Greater Boston telecom sector has
fared well, with SpeechWorks following Sonus Networks of Westford
and Avici Systems of North Billerica in big first-day ``pops'' for
their IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet-connected wireless phones have boomed in popularity
over the last six months, so have complaints about the hassle of
using tiny phone screens and keypads to read information or
transact requests.
</P>
<P>
   SpeechWorks systems, already in use at three airlines, Amtrak
and the E(star)Trade brokerage house, are seen as a potentially
popular way for cell phone users to get information from the Net by
using their voices instead of fumbling around a telephone keypad.
</P>
<P>
   For example, guided by prerecorded voice prompts on the other
end, people can use SpeechWorks products to execute commands such
as ``buy 100 shares of Gillette'' or get answers to questions such
as ``What is the weather forecast for Boston?'' or ``When does
Flight 404 arrive in Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet over the telephone is a hot space,'' Michael Dubrow,
a senior analyst at Jacob Asset Management, told Bloomberg Business
News. ``A lot of people see (the phone) as the ultimate Internet
appliance.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, AT&AMP;T agreed to take an undisclosed stake in SpeechWorks
as part of a deal giving the Boston company access to a trove of
speech recognition technology developed at AT&AMP;T's labs. SpeechWorks
has also formed an alliance with America OnLine.
</P>
<P>
   The offering of a 16 percent stake in the company gave
SpeechWorks $95 million for growth and product development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge value attached to SpeechWorks, it last year
posted sales of only $14 million and a net loss of $15.4 million,
with both numbers about triple what they were in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces intense competition from IBM, Lucent
Technologies and Microsoft as well as local speech-recognition
giant Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, whose North American offices are in
Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   However, SpeechWorks has earned considerable praise from
industry analysts for developing friendly, efficient voice prompts
to speed people through information requests and transactions.
Earlier this summer, it offered to share its software with other
companies to speed the growth of Internet ``voice portals.''

A HIGH-PITCHED DANCE OF LOVE AND DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By NANCY RAMSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Felice Schragenheim was a high-spirited, educated, sensual,
witty and wily young woman, whose dangerous misfortune was to have
been born Jewish in pre-World War II Germany. During the war she
lived in Berlin under an assumed name and worked at a Nazi
newspaper, feeding information to the underground resistance. She
was involved with a circle of sophisticated Jewish lesbians whose
dancing-on-the-volcano lives flouted convention, and sometimes
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly Wust, the young wife of an SS soldier, was the mother of
four boys, and for her effort in producing such strapping young
specimens of Aryan youth, she was awarded the Nazi's Maternal Cross
in bronze. Yet, seeking excitement, she had an affair with an
officer while her husband was fighting on the Russian front. She
had reportedly once said that she could ``smell Jews,'' a comment
that, when it reached Felice via a mutual friend, challenged the
playful Felice to arrange a meeting with such a person.
</P>
<P>
   When they were introduced in late 1942, Lilly's fascination
turned to attraction and fear and then to an all-consuming, erotic
love. It wasn't until well into their relationship that Felice told
Lilly she was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aimee and Jaguar,'' which opens August 11 and is based on the
true story of Felice Schragenheim (nicknamed Jaguar; played by
Maria Schrader) and Lilly Wust (nicknamed Aimee; played by Juliane
Koehler), is a film that the director Max Faerberboeck initially
resisted making. ``I had a sack full of reasons not to do it,'' he
said about his first feature, speaking by telephone from his home
in Hamburg, Germany. Creating solid female characters was familiar
ground for Faerberboeck; ``Bella Block,'' a television show he
wrote and directed, was about an intelligent, stubborn policewoman
and won the German equivalent of an Emmy. And he knew that the
well-publicized story of Aimee and Jaguar _ a best-selling book of
the same title, by Erica Fischer, was published in Germany in 1994
_ would surely be made into a movie. But he had written another
love story he wanted to film, that of two women from highly
bourgeois Hamburg families who admit their love for each other
while on holiday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized `Aimee and Jaguar' was a movie of love and
passion,'' he said. ``If I love it, I thought, I will do it
strongly, and it won't be commercial enough. There would be that
element of German romanticism, with the characters going into deep
sentiment, high feelings and destruction. The only one who had the
courage to play all those cards was Fassbinder.'' But as he was on
his way to Berlin to meet with a producer and turn down the
project, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, conducted by Wilhelm
Furtwaengler, came over the car radio. ``Furtwaengler went for a
very strong emotional dynamic,'' Faerberboeck said. ``You have very
destructive moments and, within half a second, the most tender
violin you can hear. Filmmaking is a question of rhythm, and as I
listened to the symphony's clash of feelings, so many images came
into my mind. The film chose me.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-pitched life of wartime Berlin provided the perfect
backdrop to the remarkable story of Felice and Lilly. ``People who
had lost family one day would dance until morning the next,''
Faerberboeck said. ``They lived for the moment. I used Cuban music,
the rumba, which has the feeling of those days. There were lots of
sexual relationships, people betrayed each other much more than the
Germans like to admit. And the Nazis hated Berlin women; they
didn't want to work in the factories, and they loved pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's elements of tension are found less in the air raids
than in small, everyday moments, and Faerberboeck uses long,
lingering close-ups of his characters to bring the war home. In a
Berlin hotel one day, some young German soldiers send a round of
drinks to Felice and her friends; the soldiers may be unaware the
women are Jewish, or perhaps they are just too young and libidinous
to care. Later in the film, this sinister undercurrent is magnified
when the women, to make money, pose for semi-nude pictures to be
sent to soldiers on the front. Leaving the photographer's studio,
one of them is stopped by two officials, who demand to see her
papers. The camera alternates between the tense, brief
interrogation to close-ups of her friends, walking briskly, as they
grow increasingly terrified: Should they keep walking? Pretend they
don't know her? Seconds count. Look back? Go back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aimee and Jaguar'' opened the 1999 Berlin Film Festival.
Schrader (``The Giraffe,'' ``Nobody Loves Me'') and Koehler (a
theater actress making her film debut) shared the Silver Bear award
for best actress. Alan Riding wrote in The New York Times that ``a
German film has for the first time dared use the Nazi regime simply
as the context for a human drama.'' The Times of London noted that
it ``seems likely to follow Steven Spielberg's epic `Schindler's
List' as a cinematic example of an individual German's struggle to
defy the inhumanity of the Hitler era against all the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's theatrical release in Germany was a commercial
success; the critical reception was mixed. Peter Koerte, the film
critic for the daily Frankfurter Rundschau, said recently that he
found ``Aimee and Jaguar'' too arty, too perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my review I wrote about Rubens' skies, a Rembrandt
chiaroscuro and a glimpse of Caravaggio,'' he added. ``But what
makes it different is the whole angle, which hasn't existed in
German cinema. Films on that period were usually based on
resistance people or on German soldiers as innocent victims of a
big propaganda machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabine Hake, a professor of German literature and film at the
University of Pittsburgh, said that ``Aimee and Jaguar'' is part of
a ``new phase'' in German cinema brought on by both the unification
of Germany and the fact that the last Holocaust survivors are
dying. ``It's an effort at the normalization of the German past.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Films about the Nazi period ``used to be very moral and very
austere,'' Hake continued. ``Now there will be more individual
stories. But is it one of the historical periods that you can set a
love story to, like the Civil War or World War I? The risk is that
you trivialize things.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the ``minefields'' he was encountering, Faerberboeck
considered various approaches. A boulevard comedy a la Ernst
Lubitsch was one, no doubt drawing on the success of Roberto
Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' with Felice's circle of friends
descending upon the Wust household, ``all those girls coming
through different doors into the apartment with this kind of free
living; it was a Nazi house, after all,'' Faerberboeck said. ``But
that would have been a superficial trick. You would have lost that
inner tension of the story, the passion and eroticism. I was more
interested to get the feeling of those two women. For each it was
love for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before she met Lilly, Felice was living like a pirate,'' he
continued. ``She had a warm heart, but she was conquering life. She
wanted every day to steal life away from the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said: ``When Felice first meets Lilly, she uses her as
a hideaway. She's also trying herself out, playing games, to see if
she can get hurt. One of the beautiful things about `Aimee and
Jaguar' is that when it starts out, it's mixing up conventional
roles of perpetrators and victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, Koehler said, ``was afraid that Felice and her friends
were more intelligent, more sophisticated. Lilly was, in a way,
simple compared to Felice, but that's what Felice loved about
her.'' It was Felice who called herself Jaguar and gave Lilly the
pet name Aimee.
</P>
<P>
   Faerberboeck and his co-writer, Rona Munro, extended this nuance
and complexity to their supporting characters as well. For the
newspaper editor, Felice's boss (Peter Weck), Faerberboeck, who was
born in 1950, looked to his father's generation. ``Today it's too
easy to say it would have been impossible to go along with what was
happening,'' he said. ``This editor was a very human, highly
educated man. He's a man you could sit down and talk with today.
But he was 100 percent Nazi. He wrote the most perverted things in
his newspaper. It is too easy to create Nazi characters with
stupid, violent faces, or have them wearing a mask.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1944, Lilly and Felice spent an idyllic afternoon
along Berlin's Havel River swimming, picnicking and taking
photographs and arrived home to discover Nazi officials in their
apartment. They were questioned incessantly, and Felice was taken
away. ``By that point, Felice had fallen in love deeply,''
Faerberboeck said. ``And she got into terrible danger, because she
stayed with Lilly. If she hadn't fallen in love, maybe she would
have been more attentive to danger, maybe she would have escaped
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Felice was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp,
and Lilly actually journeyed to the camp to try to see her, an act
that may have put Felice's life in further danger. ``Lilly was
completely out of her mind,'' Faerberboeck said. ``And this scene
at the camp, of course, is a scene you normally would like to see.
But what I did instead was to film the scene when Lilly returns and
tells their friend Ilse what she did. I wanted the horror on Ilse's
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Felice died toward war's end, probably on one of the death
marches. Lilly Wust, 86, is still alive in Berlin; in 1981 she was
awarded the Federal Service Cross, one of West Germany's highest
service medals awarded to civilians, for hiding Felice and three
other Jewish women. She remarried briefly after the war, to support
her children, but Felice remains her one true love. In June Wust
came to New York for the film's screening at the New York Lesbian
and Gay Film Festival; she finds its ``essence very truthful'' and,
in conversation, readily transports herself back to her days with
the ``radiant and elegant'' Felice.
</P>
<P>
   Faerberboeck did shoot a scene with a pile of corpses, Felice's
body among them. But he chose not to use it. ``The atmosphere of
Felice being taken away is much stronger than showing her as a
corpse,'' he said. ``The movie, until that moment, is told the
other way around, it's not showing the primary images.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have broken the law of that narration, it would have
been too obviously dramatic. This is a film that lives in the
faces.''

   SALMON, Idaho _ Rod Ariwite was the last of the Shoshones to
graduate from the high school here as a ``Salmon Savage.'' It was a
place where he excelled at playing football, while shrugging at the
school mascot in the war bonnet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Salmon Savages remain, while Ariwite, 45, and the
rest of the Lemhi Shoshone tribe are gone. They live on a
reservation in the bleak desert country of southern Idaho, 201
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was here in this scenic mountain valley that the legend
of the Shoshone girl Sacagawea came to be. It was here in August
1805 that the fate of the Lewis and Clark expedition was decided by
Sacagawea's brother in one of the most startling tales of the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   And it is here, today, that Ariwite is working as a Shoshone
Moses, trying to bring his people home in what many view as a
quixotic attempt at restoring a tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend millions of dollars on wolf, grizzly and fish
recovery. What are we doing for the Lemhis?'' said Ariwite, an
education specialist with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. ``What
I am asking for is something that is morally and ethically right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariwite said he hopes the upcoming bicentennial of the Lewis and
Clark expedition will be a springboard to a return of the Lemhis'
reservation, one they lost in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Ariwite said he will appeal this year to President Clinton for
restoration of the Lemhis as a tribe with treaty rights, while
plying other federal agencies for land grants and money to purchase
private land.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, few residents seem to want the Lemhis and
their proposed reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemhis are not a federally recognized tribe; instead, they
are considered part of the Shoshone-Bannock tribe on the Fort Hall
Reservation, located 243 miles east of Boise. Although they once
had a 100-square-mile reservation of their own in the Lemhi River
Valley, and de facto if not legal tribal status, today they are
recognized only by themselves as a unique people.
</P>
<P>
   And many would like to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is slow to recognize tribes in a process
that can take decades, and many people in Salmon River country fear
a return of the Lemhi Shoshones could threaten everything from
water rights to employment in a valley where both water and jobs
are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares if they want to come up and settle, but where are
you going to put them?'' asked Robert Cope, a veterinarian and
candidate for the Lemhi County Commission. ``What isn't already
cultivated isn't any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Shoshone lash out at that attitude, saying the white
residents of the valley want only the legends of Sacagawea and
their Shoshone ancestors, not real human beings. A proposed $12
million Sacagawea Interpretive &AMP; Educational Center in Salmon --
meant to draw tourists during the bicentennial -- is a focal point
for their anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial runs from 2003 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want her as a museum, as an icon to stabilize their
economy, but they don't want her people back,'' said Leo T.
Ariwite, 41, a cousin of Rod Ariwite.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Tom Chaffin, a Lemhi County commissioner. No
proposal has even been put before the county government for it to
consider. He said the Lemhi would be welcome back in the valley,
away from the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. But valley residents
fear establishment of a casino or depletion of natural resources,
from water to fish, if they came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt they have been neglected or abused down there.
My heart goes out to them,'' he said. But, ``personally, I don't
want to see a reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the mountains that ring this remote ranching
community served as a fortress for the Lemhi Shoshone.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea captured the American imagination largely for her role
in the valley where her people lived. Although she is often
portrayed as a guide for the expedition, in truth she knew almost
none of the country they crossed. But she knew the land near the
Salmon River and, more importantly, the people.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1805, the Corps of Discovery was badly behind schedule
in crossing the mountains of what is now Idaho. They had no horses,
no guide and no clear idea of how to reach the Pacific Ocean.
Meriwether Lewis had hoped to cross the Continental Divide into
this valley and find a clear path down the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   What he found were seemingly endless rows of snowcapped
mountains blocking his path.
</P>
<P>
   Sacagawea had been in the area before. Kidnapped by a raiding
party of plains Indians as a teen-ager, she became the property of
French Canadian fur trader Touissant Charbonneau after he won her
in a wager.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the expedition came upon her, she was Charbonneau's
second wife. Lewis and Clark hired Charbonneau as an interpreter.
They saw her as a bonus -- she could speak Shoshone and knew the
uncharted lands of present-day western Montana and eastern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   A fairy tale is more believable than what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   After encountering a band of some 60 Shoshone warriors near
present-day Salmon, a war party that could easily have wiped them
out, Lewis persuaded them to come back over Lemhi Pass and meet
with his party to trade for horses. With great suspicion, Chief
Cameahwait agreed. Then, in a magical episode, Sacagawea recognized
the chief as her long-lost brother.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition got its horses, a guide over the Bitterroot
Mountains and a life-saving chance to make the Pacific Ocean before
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemhi lived largely undisturbed in the valley until 1855,
when Mormon missionaries established a post near Tendoy, Idaho.
Within three years, the tribe sent the Mormons scurrying back to
Utah, but it was a short-lived reprieve. Settlers led by miners and
ranchers began pouring into the valley.
</P>
<P>
   By 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant had allotted a
100-square-mile reservation for the Lemhi Shoshone, said Orlan
Svingen, an associate professor of history at Washington State
University.
</P>
<P>
   But the reservation, like the rest of their territorial claims,
would not last. Almost from the outset, the government and settlers
began to whittle away at Lemhi territory, Svingen said.
</P>
<P>
   Svingen is writing a book about the Lemhi and helping them seek
federal restoration as a tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers ultimately succeeded in 1907, with what Svingen
calls the ``Lemhi Trail of Tears,'' and had them relocated to Fort
Hall. There, they moved in with tribes of Shoshone-Bannock.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   It was a move disparaged among the Lemhi as much for the arrival
at Fort Hall as the leaving of the Salmon River country, Ariwite
said. The Lemhi have been ``hostages'' of the Sho-Bans, he said,
the foster children on a reservation where they never felt they
belonged. The Shoshone-Bannock tribe is composed of bands the Lemhi
often fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that way then. Why in the hell would it be any
different now?'' Ariwite said.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Boyer, Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Council chief, did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Lemhis believe that they are losing their identity with each
passing year, as their culture, their language and their history
fade as the elders die.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Ariwite and some tribal elders are trying to use the momentum of
the bicentennial to gain tribal status and land to return north. No
one knows the exact number of Lemhi Shoshones, but about 400 to 500
exist, according to tribal members. About one-half of those might
want to return to the Lemhi Valley, Ariwite said.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes hinge on public sentiment and the celebration of a
conquering nation that displaced the Lemhis from their native
homeland. The Salmon School District has removed the Native
American in a war bonnet as its mascot, although school officials
will continue with the name Savages.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ariwite said, is not a major issue to him. The land and a
return home is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what happened 200 years ago. The Corps of Discovery
brought back one of our stolen daughters,'' Ariwite said. ``Now,
200 years later, with the bicentennial of the Corps of Discovery,
maybe the Corps of Discovery can bring us home.''

ADVERTISING: ONLINE AD-SERVER GETS $57 MILLION FROM INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company in a crowded market for online advertising services is
hoping to help accelerate its growth with investments totaling $57
million from sources that include major agency and media companies
like the WPP Group, the Reuters Group and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising.com in Baltimore, which was founded in 1998, plans
to announce the additional investments Wednesday. The total
eclipses the $12 million the company raised in four previous rounds
of financing. The investors will receive equity stakes in the
privately held Advertising.com, which began under a more colorful
moniker, TeknoSurf.com; among the other investors are Credit Suisse
First Boston Private Equity, a unit of Credit Suisse Group and
Grotech Capital Group.
</P>
<P>
   The investments come as the field in which Advertising.com
competes, known as online ad-serving, grows increasingly
competitive as pitching goods and services on the Web becomes more
difficult. Ad-serving involves developing systems that send ads to
Web sites so they can be shown to computer users. Other companies
in the category include AdForce, part of CMGI; AdKnowledge;
DoubleClick, the largest; and Engage Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad-serving business is a commodity business, so
differentiation is achieved on price and customer service,'' said
Patrick Keane, senior analyst and director for online advertising
strategies at Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they're all pretty competitive on price, that's where
customer service comes in,'' he added, in the form of ``better
targeting of ads to reach specific consumers through better
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising.com promotes its technology under the name AdLearn,
which is billed as performing automated assessments of the past
preferences of computer users to serve them the ad messages deemed
most appropriate and effective. The company now delivers ads to
more than 5,000 Web sites and also offers an e-mail marketing
network and the ability to deliver ads to wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We formulated the Internet advertising industry as a
mathematical problem,'' said Scott Ferber, chief executive at
Advertising.com, who founded the company with his brother, John,
``and produced a real-time system that makes truly optimal
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for Advertising.com last year totaled $11 million,
Ferber said, which represented an increase of 1,600 percent from
1998; revenue for the first quarter of 2000 totaled $12 million.
However, the estimated 4 billion ads served by Advertising.com in
June is about as many as AdForce serves in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Advertising.com has its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in the company ``makes a lot of sense,'' said Sir
Martin Sorrell, chief executive at WPP in London, which owns Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather Worldwide, J. Walter Thompson Co. and soon, Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc. WPP has been making investments in the Internet
through a division, Wpp.com, which now owns stakes in more than 30
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at a number of companies in this space before
we decided on Advertising.com,'' said another new investor, John
Taysom, founder and co-chief executive at the Reuters Venture
Capital unit of Reuters in London, which under the name the
Greenhouse Fund has spent about $300 million to invest in 62
companies like Infoseek and Yahoo in addition to Advertising.com.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters is seeking ``adjacent category businesses'' to its
primary mission of ``news delivery,'' Taysom said, ``and
advertising is certainly one.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the recent rough times for dot-coms _ which have caused
ad-servers to suffer because fewer ads are delivered when Web sites
go dark _ Taysom said: ``We saw it as an opportunity. A lot of
things out there were very first generation. Advertising.com is
very much about `What is the problem and how do you solve it using
current technology?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, David Moore, chief executive at 24/7, said that revenue
for the third quarter would be lower than expected because Internet
companies are buying fewer ads, partly because many were husbanding
money for the important fourth-quarter holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Keane at Jupiter suggested that the performance of ad-servers
could be improved if they would expand their tracking services from
``looking at successes'' in terms of which ads attract the
attention of Web surfers to include ``looking at negative
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing why ads aren't being clicked on,'' Keane said, is just
as important ``as tabulating and understanding click rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferber described himself as optimistic about the outlook for
online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accountability is the ultimate opportunity for the Internet,''
he said, ``because it's a trackable medium. That's the benefit of
it, so let's capitalize on it.''

 ART ADV: With photo of protester posing as Lady Liberty (NNS4). 
 By JONATHAN TILOVE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bearing signs reading, ``Stop the Racism'' and
``Stop the Greed,'' a small band of immigration restrictionists
called Project USA marched Tuesday on a Republican National
Convention they believe has caved on immigration policy in a craven
bid for business money and Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   Marching the prescribed protest route past boarded-up homes to
the huge, empty park that has been designated for ``free speech''
here, they were out of earshot and eyeshot of everybody but
themselves. At that, the protest was the closest anyone at this
convention is likely to come to hearing a discouraging word about
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, Republicans have been transformed from a party
that fretted about immigration to one that celebrates it. To
Hispanic Republicans, that transformation under the leadership of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush enables them to finally competctively against Democratic domination of the growing Latino
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly helpful,'' said California Assemblyman Rod
Pacheco, a leading figure in California Republican politics. ``This
is really different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal wing of the Republican Party has always
supported high levels of immigration as good for business. But
increasingly, consideration of immigration policy has been
intertwined with the politics of America's changing political
demography.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high, and, some observers warn, a gamble the
Republicans in the long term cannot afford to lose. If Democrats
continue to win Latino votes at anything like their current rate,
Republican support for high immigration levels may ultimately prove
their party's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a point that has been made by unabashed immigration
restrictionists like Patrick J. Buchanan, who may bring the issue
of immigration to the fall campaign as the Reform Party nominee.
When he was still a Republican, Buchanan warned that absent a
moratorium on immigration, Republicans were facing a ``demographic
death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Manza, a political sociologist at Northwestern University,
said Buchanan has a point. ``How long do you allow immigration to
continue at very high rates at the same time that these new voters
mostly vote Democratic?'' asked Manza.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are now 12 percent of the population and it is estimated
they will be close to 15 percent of the population by 2010,
surpassing the African-American population. With the exception of
the large Cuban-American population in Florida, which tends to vote
Republican, most Hispanics lean heavily Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma deepens, Manza noted, because if the Republicans
were to reverse course, they will also reverse whatever headway
they make with Latinos who are a growing electoral force in
important states like California, Texas, Florida, New York and New
Jersey. ``If you try to stop immigration,'' Manza said, ``it will
generate a powerful backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly been proven out in recent history. When Pete
Wilson ran for California governor in 1990, Pacheco said, he won
nearly half the Latino vote. But by the time Wilson got through
supporting Proposition 187, the 1994 California ballot initiative
to deny public benefits to illegal immigrants and their children,
Latino support for Republican candidates in California had been
decimated.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Republicans who took over Congress in 1994
were voting to exclude legal immigrants who were not yet citizens
from some categories of public assistance. The result was a rush
among Hispanics to become citizens, and vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Republican nominee Bob Dole, running on a platform that
backed Proposition 187 and the elimination of birthright
citizenship for children of those in the country illegally, got
only about 15 percent of the Latino vote in California, Pacheco
said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Right now, according to Pacheco, internal GOP polls in
California indicate Bush support is around 25 percent among
California Latinos, and only a few points behind Gore altogether.
If he can get 30 percent of the Hispanic vote, Pacheco said, Bush
will win California.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Guerra, a San Antonio public relations specialist who is
doing work for the Republican National Committee, said that any
time a Texas Republican wins 30 percent of the Latino vote, victory
is certain. If Republicans are not able to do the same in
California, ``California will be lost forever,'' said Guerra.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was crushed among Hispanics by Democrat Ann Richards
when he first ran, won up to half that vote in his landslide
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is, in many ways, the candidate from central GOP casting
when it comes to appealing to Latino voters. He speaks Spanish. As
governor of Texas, he was the un-Wilson, welcoming immigration and
praising immigrants. And his brother is married to a woman from
Mexico, and their son George P. Bush, who has made an ad for his
uncle, has Ricky Martin quality charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican blood runs in the Bush family,'' said Rosario Marin, a
member of the city council in Huntington Park, Calif. ``Blood,''
Marin said emphatically. ``Blood is stronger than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin said it is ``a humbling experience'' to be a delegate to
this convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an immigrant,'' said Marin. ``I was born in Mexico City.
Now, I'm one of 2,000 delegates who will nominate the next
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin used to work for Pete Wilson, her last job being his
liaison to the Latino community. ``I earned my money,'' she said,
noting that she did not agree with her boss on 187.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much better,'' she said of Bush. She believes that
Hispanic voters are ready to discard their Democratic habits for
him, just as they did in electing her in a city that is 99 percent
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Manza, however, believes there has been ``an insane misreading
of Bush's appeal to Hispanics.'' He may have won nearly half the
Hispanic vote in Texas when he ran for re-election, but that was
against a weak, underfunded opponent whom Bush trounced among white
voters. There remained, Manza said, ``a huge gap'' in his appeal to
Hispanic and white voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new approach to immigration comes at a time
when polls indicate immigration is still an issue on which
Americans are very divided. And yet, it has dropped off the
political map, thanks in large measure to a broad alliance between
those on the civil rights left and the leadership of the Hispanic
and Asian communities, which are heavily immigrant, and the
business community, which wants both skilled workers for the
high-tech industry and unskilled workers for those jobs that, as it
is commonly put, ``Americans won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   One political contest where it has emerged as an issue is in
Michigan. There the Federation for American Immigration Reform has
been running ads attacking Spencer Abraham, the architect of
Republican immigration policy in the Senate. But Abraham, who is in
a tough re-election battle, dismisses the ads as the work of ``hate
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ProjectUSA, which has raised immigration restricton billboards
in various states, has also been attacked as racist, even though
its founder, Craig Nelsen of Queens, N.Y., said he is only
motivated by concerns about population growth and immigration is
the single biggest contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The recent history of the immigration debate has been that it is
almost impossible to talk about in non-racial terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a huge insult to those citizens of Latino and
Asian ancestry who feel themselves capable of hyphen-less voting,
who feel themselves as good and loyal Americans rather than a
narrow ethnic group,'' said Nelson. ``It is nakedly racist in
itself that race somehow determines our policy ... . It's
particularly dangerous if immigraton policy becomes a tussle
between the races.''

 &HT;    Atlanta firm sees potential in e-mail access similar to pay
phones
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - With e-mail increasingly vital, with the nation ever
more mobile, maybe the pay phone of the future is an Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, LinkTel Communications of Atlanta is banking
on the idea that people on the move will happily drop a few dollars
into a machine that gives them access to e-mail in places they
would otherwise be wasting time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the name Pay2Linc, the company has installed about 100
devices in Georgia, Florida and Texas, including 40 in metro
Atlanta. LinkTel offers a service that lets people access the Net
and get e-mail while they are otherwise stuck: Their car is being
serviced, they are in a hotel or waiting for a table at a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really work when you've got somebody captive,'' said
Chief Executive Marty Whirl. ``The machine will be your best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The average machine does about $450 to $600 per month, and the
average user spends seven minutes on Pay2Linc, he said. The company
also receives revenue from billboard ads bought on the service. ``I
am looking to put up 5,000 of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Whirl's math, that would produce a business of more than
$30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But will it fly? The main purpose of the machines is to provide
access to e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pay2Linc adds a wrinkle that the company hopes will help it
catch on in tourist areas: A user can take a photo on the spot and
send it via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Among Pay2Linc spots in Atlanta are the Ramada Inn in Conyers,
the Windy Hill Car Spa in Marietta and the Best Western hotel at
Hartsfield airport. In most cases, the Pay2Linc machine is owned by
LinkTel and the owners of the premises receive a portion of the
take _ up to 50 percent, Whirl said.
</P>
<P>
   Pay2Linc charges $1 for three minutes. For $5, the user gets 25
minutes, with the clock in all cases starting only when the Net
connection is made, Whirl said.
</P>
<P>
   Whirl, whose background is as a stockbroker, said the company
started out installing and managing pay phones. LinkTel now has
2,500 pay phones _ a device that is increasingly lonely in affluent
areas where people carry wireless phones. While seeing the Pay2Link
concept as parallel to pay phones, the target market is very
different, he said. ``The people who use pay phones are
predominantly in urban areas or very rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's a different market from the Palm Pilot, too, he said.
It's cheaper, for one thing. And _ whatever the Palm Pilot's charms
_ it is not as simple to use, Whirl insists. As for laptop
connections _ wireless and otherwise _ Whirl said Pay2Linc is much
quicker. ``I'll have you on the Internet before you could unpack
the laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay2Linc is not alone in the market. Among competitors is Darwin
Networks, which makes what it calls ``public Internet kiosks.''

GOP CONVENTION NOT EDGE-OF-THE-SEAT FARE, TV VIEWERS SAY _
THANKFULLY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. _ Some faithful Republican homes here glow
with the blue light of faithful Republican television-watching
these convention nights. But no one can say that even the most
stalwart of stalwarts are sitting on the edges of their leather
couches.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect scripting, it seems, comes with a price: lukewarm
attention, and minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   Four sets of neighbors on White Oak Circle, a sloping cul-de-sac
in this gracious, Republican-leaning suburb of Pittsburgh, shared
their reactions as the convention unfolded and largely concurred
that for them, it held little excitement, less suspense and an
infinitesimal chance of changing their minds about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers described, rather, a sense of watching as a
precaution, on the off chance that something could muddle George W.
Bush's momentum. It would have been more riveting if the choice of
running mate had remained unclear, they said, or differing opinions
on platform issues were expressed. But no such luck; so somehow,
even on the 48- and 50-inch TV sets that fill whole den walls here,
the convention seems a small event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching to make sure he doesn't mess up,'' Dr. Dick
Lewis, a surgeon, said of Bush. ``His single most outstanding
characteristic is that he's got the ability to beat Gore. That's
more important than this platform or anything else as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit, Lewis said, like a golf tournament ending on
Sunday: ``You can't win the tournament on Saturday, but you can
lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Diane Goldschmidt, community service
coordinator at Mt. Lebanon's award-winning high school, said she
had explained to her 18-year-old son that ``if some major trauma
occurred, if Bush had a heart attack or we found out he's a spy, if
something occurred that would prevent him being a candidate, this
is when it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, she said, she has read enough about Bush in
recent years that ``I know my opinion won't be altered.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jack, a financial consultant, noted that this time
around, he has no real questions lingering in his mind about
candidates or issues, which was by no means the case when Bush's
father ran against Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, he said, the convention ``is like the State of
the Union address: It's a feel-good thing. Could we do without it?
Sure we could. It's a chance to get together and toot your horn;
it's a media show and I don't think it's ever going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Such awareness of the convention's limitations did not prevent
the White Oak Circle viewers from enjoying Monday night's top
speeches, though, and forming a few new impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush garnered high marks: ``She's much better than I
expected her to be, she's very natural,'' said Jeff Lammert, vice
president of a company that makes steel-cutting shears.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Teri, responded particularly when Mrs. Bush talked
about returning respect to the presidency: ``That's a powerful
comment,'' she said. ``That brings up a lot of memories of what
happened. I think we have to make the presidency respectable again,
and I think he can do it and she can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Lewis, a nurse and mother of three, said she felt as if
she could relate to Laura Bush: ``She is foremost a mom before
anything else,'' she said, ``and in the baby boom generation, I
think that a lot of people can relate to her _ at least, I can. She
mentioned the empty nest syndrome she's facing this fall, which is
something we're facing; and she seemed so down to earth, I loved
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Colin Powell's speech brought praise as well, although
here, the convention organizers' strategy of scheduling the
highest-profile speeches after 10 p.m., when there would be network
air-time, seemed to backfire a bit.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lammerts' house, some visiting friends listened to the
beginning of the speech, then jumped off into a long, loud tangent
about testing teachers for competency; at the Lewises, Charlene had
to run out for car-pool duty; and Lea Smith, a lawyer who was
watching at home with her husband, Temp, also a lawyer, dropped off
to sleep at about 10:30, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had watched much of the evening, she said, and felt no
shift in her opinions: ``Every time they talked about streamlining
federal government, reducing bureaucracy, I felt energized,'' she
said, ``and then they talked about his education initiative and
requiring reading literacy at third grade level by third grade, and
I thought, `That's all well and good, but that seems like as much
or more federal involvement.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was also struck, she said, by how all the earlier speakers
followed the same pattern: They would talk about what they had
managed to achieve because America was a land of opportunity,
``then education, then what good Bush was going to do and then God
Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little comical,'' she said. ``It made it seem less of
a usual convention and more scripted, more planned and executed
according to a common plan. But I guess when I look at the whole _
the running mate already named, the platform already being passed _
what else is there to do?''
</P>
<P>
   She and most of her neighbors said they would continue watching
the convention in dribs and drabs, and certainly try to tune in
when Bush spoke. But with little expectation of bombshells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything that George Bush would say that would
make me vote for his opponent,'' Temp Smith said. Rather, he said,
he and Lea, who are active in local Republican politics, are
waiting to see whether they get excited enough about him to put any
effort into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said nostalgically that he missed ``the goofy bowler hats
they used to wear, and noisemaker horns.'' Somehow, he said, ``it
doesn't seem like there's quite the party atmosphere you used to
get,'' at least, to viewers.

<P>
   BRATTLEBORO, Vt. _ In a decision likely to damage the nation's
small but growing sheep-farming industry, a federal judge Tuesday
ruled that 355 imported sheep in Vermont should be killed because
they may have contracted a version of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J. Garvan Murtha's ruling, which supported an earlier
order by the US Department of Agriculture, came as fears increase
worldwide that the brain-wasting ailment responsible for more than
50 human deaths in Europe is no longer confined to cows.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the two flocks have until Monday to appeal the
decision, but attorneys for both said Tuesday no decision has been
made yet on whether they will do that. The Lydonville owner of a
third flock voluntarily sold his 21 imported sheep to the USDA last
month.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14 Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman ordered the
sheep execution after eight animals tested positive for TSE, or
transmissable spongiform encephalopathy, confirming the
government's worst fears about the animals. Glickman contended that
the sheep _ most of which are East Friesians imported from Belgium
_ were likely exposed to feed contaminated with the always-fatal
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mad cow disease caused a panic in the British beef market a few
years ago and prompted strict import bans on this side of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision was in the best interests of the
country's human and animal health,'' said Patrick Collins, a USDA
spokesman. ``But I think we have to keep in mind that these three
flocks have shown a unique set of signs that there's a potential
problem there. The real message is: We're taking science-based,
prudent action to control a potential threat before it has the
chance to evlove into something much larger.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the two flocks, philanthropist Houghton Freeman of
Stowe and farmers Linda and Larry Faillace of East Warren, appealed
the USDA's order to Murtha, saying the government's tests were
flawed and inconclusive at best. They also asserted that the USDA
was merely working to protect domestic farmers, whose sheep produce
about one-tenth the milk of the Belgian sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, as supporters of the farmers continued their
``Save the Sheep'' campaign _ which portayed government as a
shadowy band of thugs protecting domestic trade interests and not
public health, the two sides squared-off in Murtha's courtroom.
Meanwhile, friends and supporters made pilgrimages to the Faillace
farm in the unfortunately named Mad River valley, making a point of
eating the family's cheese products and petting the long-earred
grazers in the pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Murtha's ruling, though, the USDA's order had begun
to hurt operations that produce or sell sheep's milk and cheese _
in Vermont and beyond. Whether or not Murtha ruled in favor of the
USDA, some said, the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-win situation for us,'' said Ruth Flore,
president of the American Cheese Society, a trade group with about
500 members nationwide, only a fraction of whom produce sheep's
milk products. `` We're only talking about two farms, and I know
several of our farms around the country have been called and asked
questions. ... Right now, we're already seeing a drop-off. People
are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   David Major, who produces cheese made from sheep's milk on a
farm in Westminster West in southern Vermont, said half of his
buyers have canceled their orders. Orders for his specialty cheese,
marketed under the name Vermont Shepherd, have dropped off so
sharply that he said he might have to cut production or sell some
of his flock if the anxiety surrounding the industry doesn't die
down within three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be eating lots of cheese,'' Major said.
</P>
<P>
   Most sheep farmers say they have always kept their flocks under
strict watch to protect them from any kind of contamination.
Despite that, many consumers are starting to see all Vermont sheep
goods as tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Squier, owner of Sage Sheep Farm in Stowe, said
destroying the sheep on the two farms won't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would still leave a lot of questions in people's
minds,'' said Squier, who sells meat and wool. ``I don't see why
they can't be retested so that everybody can see whether they have
the disease or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, nearly 67,000 sheep farms raise about 7.2 million
sheep, according to Peter Orwick, executive director of the
American Sheep Industry Association _ but he added that only a
small fraction raise the animals for milk production.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Most breeds of American sheep produce about 100
gallons of milk a year, making them relatively unprofitable by
comparison with dairy cows.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep imported by Freeman and the Faillaces are capable of
producing more than 1,000 gallons annually, making them
particularly valuable for breeding rights. The sheep came into the
United States during a brief period in the spring of 1996, when the
importation of foreign sheep was legal, but their owners have been
barred from breeding their flocks since then. Such importations
have since been made illegal, thanks in large part to the risks of
infecting the nation's cows and sheep with mad cow disease and
scrapie, another form of TSE that entered the nation's sheep
population in 1946, from imported animals.
</P>
<P>
   Orwick has applauded the judgment of the USDA from the outset,
saying the sheep posed an unnecessary risk to the health and
reputation of the rest of America's sheep farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those importers in Vermont are portrayed as farmers just
trying to make it, but let's face it, they brought them to the US
to establish a profit-making breeding operation, to sell those
animals nationwide,'' Orwick said. ``The USDA, they don't just pick
on different flocks for the fun of it. ... It seems reasonable to
us that you make sure it does not spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable or not, fears that mad cow disease is now running
rampant in the brains of sheep have begun to gain a larger audience
of late, prompting speculation in Europe that a repeat of the mad
cow panic may be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Times of London reported that Nobel Prize-winning
scientist Stanley Prusiner has found preliminary evidence that BSE
is endemic in Britain's sheep population.
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Belgian newspaper De Morgen reported that
European Union scientists are looking into the possibility that a
mad cow disease epidemic may afflict the continent's sheep flocks
as well. One scientist told Reuters the situation was ``a timebomb
that continues to tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no proof has emerged that sheep are in fact capable of
contracting the disease, let alone if humans could be affected by
eating sheep meat or milk products.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, shortly after the USDA ordered the Vermont sheep
killed, the Vermont Department of Health issued an alert for
consumers to avoid eating any cheese produced by the Freeman and
Faillace flocks. The department did not issue a recall of the
cheese, however, and one spokesperson said no such recall was in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Vermont simply issued a recommendation in a tone
of a precaution for people,'' spokesperson Nancy Erickson said.
``There is no state or national recall for those products, and I
don't foresee a change in that.''

`PHANTASM': THE LITTLE HORROR MOVIE WITH A LOYAL FOLLOWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Phantasm's'' notoriety _ or lack thereof _ can easily be
summed up by Steven Romano.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk up to people and say, `Ever heard of `Phantasm?'
They're like, `Huh?''' says Romano, organizer of a three-day
``Phantasmania'' convention held this spring in Austin, Texas.
``Then if you say, `It was the movie with that flying silver ball
that sucks your brain out,' they'll say, `Oh, yeah, I know that
movie. It scared the hell out of me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thus is the aura surrounding the 1979 horror/sci-fi movie
``Phantasm,'' written and directed on a shoestring budget by Don
Coscarelli. One of the first movies to successfully leave its
viewers hanging in is-it-a-dream-or-reality limbo, ``Phantasm'' was
also one of the first films to marry elements of science fiction
with traditional creepy-crawly terror.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Scrimm anchored the movie as the ``Tall Man,'' a menacing
funeral home undertaker who resurrected dead bodies to use them as
slaves on his home planet. A trio of guys _ brothers Michael
(played by Michael Baldwin) and Jody (Bill Thornbury) and their
pony-tailed pal Reggie (Reggie Bannister) _ caught wind of the
scheme and tried to put an end to it. Three sequels later, they
were still trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantasm'' was a mild success at the time, but a string of bad
sequels and subsequent horror movies with bigger budgets and better
special effects have all but erased the film from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there exists a circle of ``Phantasm'' fans and followers who
have kept the series alive. They organize and flock to ``Phantasm''
conventions. They run ``Phantasm'' Web sites. They eagerly await
the arrival of MGM's release of ``Phantasm IV'' and re-release of
``Phantasm'' on DVD, both out this week. And they pray for the day
another sequel will be made (one is in the works).
</P>
<P>
   All this fuss over a little horror movie? Out of all the
frightening flicks to come out over the years, what makes it so
special?
</P>
<P>
   Fans and those associated with the series say it's a combination
of good timing, shock-value originality and the series' strong
sense of family bonding.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantasm' is one of the most unique horror movies to ever
come out,'' says Tony Timpone, editor in chief of Fangoria, a
long-running magazine devoted to the horror and sci-fi industry.
``I think a lot of people were struck by the incredible,
unforgettable images _ the silver balls, the Tall Man. Coscarelli
really knew how to paint the screen with provocative images of
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pagliardo, of Ringwood, N.J., who runs a fan Web site
(members.aol.com/smallman666), says it's the
friendship/family-values facet that has attracted so many
``Phantasm''-ites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip away the horror/sci-fi aspect and you have an underlying
story of friendship and camaraderie that many people can identify
with,'' he says. ``The horror story plays a critical role, as do
the special effects, but the main attraction to the series is the
characters. They grow on you and make you care what happens to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does happen to them? In the first ``Phantasm'' movie,
the parents of Mike and Jody are killed in a car accident. It is
later revealed that Scrimm's Tall Man character murdered them.
Along with Reggie, the brothers hunt down the Tall Man, all the
while trying to keep the Tall Man from hunting them down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the brothers lose. Jody is killed. As is
Michael. And the Tall Man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or were they?
</P>
<P>
   The characters die, then come back to life at a hectic pace,
keeping viewers guessing. The deaths and rebirths are chronicled in
the many dream sequences, as well as flashbacks to the first
installment, that run rampant throughout the series, further
skewing what is real and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a beautiful dreamlike quality to it that really
unnerved me,'' says Fangoria's Timpone. ``It was the first film to
really weave in this whole ``Is it a dream?'' sequence into the
action. You gotta remember, this was six years before ``Nightmare
on Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Angus Scrimm, whose Tall Man character uses spiked silver balls
that drill holes into his victims' heads as his weapons of choice,
says that timing is the main reason ``Phantasm'' became popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1979, when `Halloween' and `Alien' were relaunching the
horror film,'' he says. ``The moment was right for an original
horror movie like ``Phantasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it struck a chord, particularly with boys and girls who
could identify with the character Mike,'' Scrimm says. ``Mike had
just lost his parents. He was fearful of losing his brother. A lot
of young people identified with that insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Scrimm says, those kids have grown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing how many people come up to me and say, `You
scared the blank out of me when I was 13 years old.' Writers, film
stars, people I meet at conventions, this is the movie that scared
them when they were young. `Phantasm' was remarkably constructed to
appeal to teens, and now those teens have grown up _ but they're
still fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has certainly made its mark in pop culture,
``Phantasm'' did not boost the careers of any of its stars. The key
actors are either not making movies or relegated to low-budget,
straight-to-video horror flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thornbury has abandoned movies and teaches music at a high
school in Fresno, Calif. Bannister has immersed himself in music
and various environmental causes. Baldwin tinkers with low-budget,
homemade movies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scrimm, he has been banished to the lowbrow-horror genre;
he appears in movies that go directly to home video, if they come
out at all. While ``Phantasm'' heightened his looming image, it has
also limited him.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantasm' gave me a certain awareness in Hollywood, but it
didn't do very much for my career,'' Scrimm says. ``It's a tough
battle, trying to scratch your way out of the horror-movie ghetto.
Hollywood looks at the horror-movie genre as one step above the
porno industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Phantasm'' universe is a comfortable place to exist,
Scrimm says. And interest in it continues. Roger Avary, who won an
Oscar for co-writing ``Pulp Fiction,'' is working on a script for a
fifth installment, Scrimm says. And Romano is developing a
comic-book series that has been endorsed by everyone in the
``Phantasm'' family.
</P>
<P>
   Both projects will tap into topics ``Phantasm'' fans have come
to expect: friendship, horror and, most important, mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantasm' exists without explanation. That's part of the
beauty of it,'' Scrimm says. ``It touches on psyche and fear, and
those are things we can all relate to.''

   Thanks to the combined efforts of film scholars, acclaimed
directors, private film buffs and professional archivists, great

come out,'' says Tony Timpone, editor in chief of Fangoria, a
long-running magazine devoted to the horror and sci-fi industry.
``I think a lot of people were struck by the incredible,
unforgettable images _ the silver balls, the Tall Man. Coscarelli
really knew how to paint the screen with provocative images of
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pagliardo, of Ringwood, N.J., who runs a fan Web site
(members.aol.com/smallman666), says it's the
friendship/family-values facet that has attracted so many
``Phantasm''-ites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip away the horror/sci-fi aspect and you have an underlying
story of friendship and camaraderie that many people can identify
with,'' he says. ``The horror story plays a critical role, as do
the special effects, but the main attraction to the series is the
characters. They grow on you and make you care what happens to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does happen to them? In the first ``Phantasm'' movie,
the parents of Mike and Jody are killed in a car accident. It is
later revealed that Scrimm's Tall Man character murdered them.
Along with Reggie, the brothers hunt down the Tall Man, all the
while trying to keep the Tall Man from hunting them down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the brothers lose. Jody is killed. As is
Michael. And the Tall Man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or were they?
</P>
<P>
   The characters die, then come back to life at a hectic pace,
keeping viewers guessing. The deaths and rebirths are chronicled in
the many dream sequences, as well as flashbacks to the first
installment, that run rampant throughout the series, further
skewing what is real and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a beautiful dreamlike quality to it that really
unnerved me,'' says Fangoria's Timpone. ``It was the first film to
really weave in this whole ``Is it a dream?'' sequence into the
action. You gotta remember, this was six years before ``Nightmare
on Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Angus Scrimm, whose Tall Man character uses spiked silver balls
that drill holes into his victims' heads as his weapons of choice,
says that timing is the main reason ``Phantasm'' became popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1979, when `Halloween' and `Alien' were relaunching the
horror film,'' he says. ``The moment was right for an original
horror movie like ``Phantasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it struck a chord, particularly with boys and girls who
could identify with the character Mike,'' Scrimm says. ``Mike had
just lost his parents. He was fearful of losing his brother. A lot
of young people identified with that insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Scrimm says, those kids have grown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing how many people come up to me and say, `You
scared the blank out of me when I was 13 years old.' Writers, film
stars, people I meet at conventions, this is the movie that scared
them when they were young. `Phantasm' was remarkably constructed to
appeal to teens, and now those teens have grown up _ but they're
still fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has certainly made its mark in pop culture,
``Phantasm'' did not boost the careers of any of its stars. The key
actors are either not making movies or relegated to low-budget,
straight-to-video horror flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thornbury has abandoned movies and teaches music at a high
school in Fresno, Calif. Bannister has immersed himself in music
and various environmental causes. Baldwin tinkers with low-budget,
homemade movies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scrimm, he has been banished to the lowbrow-horror genre;
he appears in movies that go directly to home video, if they come
out at all. While ``Phantasm'' heightened his looming image, it has
also limited him.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantasm' gave me a certain awareness in Hollywood, but it
didn't do very much for my career,'' Scrimm says. ``It's a tough
battle, trying to scratch your way out of the horror-movie ghetto.
Hollywood looks at the horror-movie genre as one step above the
porno industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Phantasm'' universe is a comfortable place to exist,
Scrimm says. And interest in it continues. Roger Avary, who won an
Oscar for co-writing ``Pulp Fiction,'' is working on a script for a
fifth installment, Scrimm says. And Romano is developing a
comic-book series that has been endorsed by everyone in the
``Phantasm'' family.
</P>
<P>
   Both projects will tap into topics ``Phantasm'' fans have come
to expect: friendship, horror and, most important, mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantasm' exists without explanation. That's part of the
beauty of it,'' Scrimm says. ``It touches on psyche and fear, and
those are things we can all relate to.''

HOSPITAL COMICS PRESCRIBE LAUGHTER TO BUOY PATIENTS' SPIRITS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Quackers, a hand puppet in a nurse's uniform
and a long curly blond wig, sneaks up on Horace Owen, 86, and
smacks him with a big duck kiss. Owen's face lights up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you can tell everybody a blond nurse crawled into bed
with you and gave you kisses,'' says Nurse Ducky, the mischiefmaker
who speaks for Quackers.
</P>
<P>
   Owen's smile turns to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to laugh, but they keep me medicated to contain my
pain so I can enjoy the show,'' he says, adding that he has been in
Harris Methodist Southwest hospital in Fort Worth ``eight weeks too
long,'' while undergoing three surgeries for an intestinal
blockage.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel White, 93, was in the hospital with complications from
surgery for a broken hip when her room was invaded by Nurse Ducky
and Quackers; Dr. Cat Scan, who checks for funny bones; Ima Green
Frog, who's ready to make anything that's ``bugging'' you disappear
with her magic scarf; Smiley Bubbles, who started carrying a
battery-powered bubble gun because her large nose interfered with
her bubble-blowing; and other clowns.
</P>
<P>
   White's beautiful laugh filled the hospital room and shook her
whole body when they sang ``Happy Ha Ha to You,'' then announced
that they had been practicing real hard and could now sing it
backward just for her. They turned their backs to her and repeated
the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was wonderful of those ladies, and they all work here,''
White says as the caravan moves on to the next room where they sing
the same song ``under water,'' with flower vases, pitchers and
drinking glasses held over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Ducky is Marcy Graves, and she says that clowning around
is her calling from God. It just happens to complement her real job
as director of cardiopulmonary and extended-care services at Harris
Methodist Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday afternoon, she slips on her ``old-fashioned''
white nurse's cap and uniform (trimmed in red hearts, rainbows and
rickrack), packs her ``Mirth Aid Kit,'' glues on a pair of huge
fake eyelashes, adds a red clown's nose, paints on her pouty lips
and grabs up Quackers to make hospital rounds with her crew of
merrymakers _ the HaHaS.
</P>
<P>
   Short for Health and Healing at Southwest, the HaHaS are
respiratory therapists, nurses, technicians and other hospital
staffers who are convinced that sometimes laughter is the best
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of my eyelashes catches a wind, I might just fly off,''
Graves says while putting on her makeup. She admits that she once
attached the lashes with her nose glue and couldn't open her eyes
until she ``melted'' the lashes with glue remover.
</P>
<P>
   Often a doctor or hospital administrator will drop by the
pulmonary department while the HaHaS are getting ready and say,
``I've got an hour, do you have an extra nose?''
</P>
<P>
   The HaHaS are always happy to expand the troupe that Graves
organized in February 1999, soon after seeing the movie ``Patch
Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves couldn't believe it, though, when Dr. Patch Adams called
her and invited her to join his clown tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   She and the legendary physician have a lot in common when it
comes to using humor in healing. She knew all about him from the
movie starring Robin Williams, but how did Adams know about her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was my husband, Mark,'' she says. ``I said, `OK,
honey, but I don't have time to talk with you right now. I'm in the
middle of some paperwork on a patient.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adams asked if she had caller ID, which she didn't, then
requested her fax number and told her to go check out the fax
machine as soon as she had a minute to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The message she received was printed on stationery from Adams'
Gesundheit Institute, inviting Graves to join the doctor and 30
other medical clowns for a 12-day trip to China, beginning Sept.
17. They will be spreading laughter, love and good health through
hospitals, orphanages, schools and retirement centers. She has
accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he learned about Graves by reading the abstract of a
paper Graves presented in full Nurse Ducky costume at a recent
meeting of the American Association for Respiratory Care in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, ``Is Laughter the Best Medicine?,'' reports on a
study examining the immune response of patients with pneumonia to
therapeutic humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him back, and he said, `I'd love it if you would come
along with us to China.' I was blubbering so bad I could hardly
talk. All I could think was, `Oh my God, this is so cool,' ''
Graves says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that since I'm the only theater/pre-med
major to ever come out of the University of North Texas, this is
probably my calling from God.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been clowning around at Harris Fort Worth and Harris
Southwest for 20 years. ``I got the idea for the HaHaS and talked
to people in administration at the hospital. They supported the
idea as long as it would not cost the hospital any money,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Graves set up protocols that include stopping at the nursing
station on each floor that is visited and checking to see if there
are any patients who should not be disturbed. The HaHaS also knock
at each door and ask permission to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume everybody will want to see us, but we check to be
sure,'' Graves says. ``Sometimes women in labor don't respond well,
and people on ventilators we leave alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday afternoon, they also avoided the emergency
room. A doctor told the HaHaS it was already a circus in there.

ON WEDNESDAY, CHENEY GETS CHANCE TO SAY WHO HE REALLY IS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ During the first two nights of the 37th
Republican National Convention, two retired generals _ both heroes
of Operation Desert Storm _ sang the praises of the vice
presidential pick and former defense secretary, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Cheney gets a chance to toot his own horn, and
more than likely he will try to smooth out some of the sour notes
produced by his very conservative voting record when he served in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, whose mission on Monday night
included reaching out to minority voters on behalf of candidate
George W. Bush and the GOP, chided his fellow Republicans for not
always embodying the spirit of the ``party of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell warned that Republicans can't just talk about inclusion
and diversity, especially only at election time; they must show
they mean it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be every day,'' he said. ``It must be for real.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Cheney's speech Wednesday night, and his appearances
over the next three months as the party's vice presidential
nominee, must tell us who he really is, and what he really thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a hard-nosed right-wing businessman who doesn't care much
about equal rights, the environment, the education of poor children
or rising oil prices? Or is he an astute public servant who will
not be bullied into supporting flawed ideas or legislation?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who already have launched a series of television ads
targeting Cheney's voting record, want us to believe the former.
Republicans would have us believe the latter.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Cheney is not a great speaker, but great
oratory is not what is needed or expected here. He must give a
speech that is convincing, and one that he can live with once it
comes under attack during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just after his congressional voting record came under attack,
the presumptive VP candidate refused to run away from it. He did
try to explain some of those votes, noting that, once any vote was
put into context, even critics could see there was more to his
though processes than simply being against the Head Start program,
the Department of Education, the school lunch program, the
environment or the release of Nelson Mandela from a South African
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on TV talk shows last weekend, Cheney indicated that
he might vote differently today on some of those issues of two
decades ago because some circumstances have changed.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got to be careful when he talks about changing his
votes or his mind. That's what the Republicans accuse Vice
President Al Gore of doing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republican ticket's significant bump in the polls
since Cheney's selection as Bush's running mate, Democrats still
believe they can make the voting record of the vice presidential
nominee an issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have to keep reminding themselves, and their
nominees, what Powell told them Monday night: You can't just talk
it, you must demonstrate these principles of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans have put plenty of ethnic minorities,
women and an openly gay congressman on the platform this week,
small things suggest there is still exclusion in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In his long, sometimes scolding benediction Monday night, a son
of famed evangelist Billy Graham ended the closing prayer in ``the
name of your son, Jesus.'' Afterward, I watched a delegate wearing
a yarmulke as he left the hall, and wondered if he really felt
included.

MILLIONS CLICK AWAY FROM GOP FESTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the Republican National Convention has been tailored
for television, viewers are so unimpressed that they tuned out by
the millions Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a certain dropoff was inevitable this year because
one of the three leading broadcast networks, NBC, chose not to
carry the first night of the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   But this was supposed to be the year when the all-news cable
networks _ CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC _ stepped into the
broadcast breach and played the convention-coverage role the old
Big Three _ NBC, ABC, and CBS _ are no longer willing to play. Yet
the three cable channels drew a combined audience Monday that was
less than half the 6 million viewers NBC did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the prime-time audience in 1996 for ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS
and CNN was around 20 million viewers. On Monday, the combined
audience in prime-time was just over 16 million for the networks
that aired any coverage at all: ABC (which devoted just an hour),
CBS (whose coverage was limited to a half-hour portion of its
newsmagazine), PBS, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, meanwhile, viewers voted thunderously with their
clickers: When ``Monday Night Football'' ended on WCVB-TV (Channel
5) and ABC's convention coverage began, two-thirds of the audience,
or 200,000 households, either changed the channel or turned off
their TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have noted the absence of drama at the Republican
convention, with the nominee and his running mate already known and
intraparty squabbling kept under wraps. Even the much-anticipated
speeches Monday night by retired General Colin Powell and Laura
Bush, wife of GOP candidate George W. Bush, couldn't pull in
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, to judge by the ratings for Monday night, viewers have
not yet made the transition from broadcast to cable for the
quadrennial display of political pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the combined audience for ABC, CBS and NBC on the first
night of the GOP convention was just under 17 million viewers. On
Monday, ABC was the only broadcast network to devote a full hour to
coverage, drawing 5.9 million viewers for the speeches by Powell
and Mrs. Bush that began at 10 p.m. That was a slight increase for
ABC from 1996, even though the network's ratings were actually down
a bit (the TV audience on which ratings are based is larger than it
was four years ago).
</P>
<P>
   CBS limited its convention coverage Monday to a portion of of
its newsmagazine ``48 Hours'': The program drew 6.3 million
viewers, an increase from four years ago. But, in the head-to-head
competition at 10 p.m., the decisive victor was NBC with a rerun of
a drama called ``Third Watch,'' which pulled in 10 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over on the all-news cable networks, CNN drew 1.2
million viewers Monday, enough to win the cable contest, but down
from 1.3 million four years ago. Partly, that was due to inroads
made by newcomers Fox News (676,000 viewers) and MSNBC (516,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service Tuesday was reveling in the fact
that its coverage Monday night drew more viewers than all three
all-news cable networks combined. But even PBS's ratings were down
slightly from four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So where did all the viewers go? Perhaps yet another number
offers a clue: In 1995, the average American home had 41 channels
to choose from; by this year, that number had climbed to 62. Or
viewers may have chosen to take their convention coverage with a
dash of satire, as on Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show,'' which
drew 480,000 viewers Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area viewers proved far more interested in the
Patriots-49ers matchup on ``Monday Night Football'' (and the debut
of comedian-turned-analyst Dennis Miller) than the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than 331,000 households were tuned in to Channel 5 for the
last 15 minutes of the football broadcast, even though the Patriots
had the game well in hand. But when convention coverage began at 10
p.m., Channel 5's audience dropped to barely 130,000 households.

KOLBE BREAKS GOP ANTI-GAY BARRIER &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep. Jim Kolbe's speech on
international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National
Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he
gave it at all.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz. is the House of
Representatives' only openly gay Republican. His pre-prime-time
talk on trade relations might have gone down as yet another
unmemorable convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly
anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday
objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed
extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second
evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a
Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe told the convention in prepared remarks that if elected
president, Bush would expand trade. ``He will work to launch an
ambitious new round of global trade talks, and he will enforce
trade agreements and trade laws,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe
took the podium. However, Cathie Adams, a Texas delegate from
Dallas, said that instead, she would bow her head during the speech
to pray for gays to give up their ``unhealthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Wildmon, vice president of the Mississippi-based
American Family Association, commented that ``the things that these
homosexual advocates push for are contrary to everything that 90
percent of Republicans stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it. When the Bush
campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee,
you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have
you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,''' he said in a
brief interview before the speech. ``The fact that it's a non-issue
is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush
campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he
says about being a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of
Kolbe's speech. ``We're pleased with the substance in the platform
on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the
Washington-based Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some
messages better than it's doing.'' He noted that while a gay person
_ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no
anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,''
said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
Republican organization.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is a future for gays in the Republican
Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is. The fact that I'm
speaking tonight is evidence of that''

 &HT;    'P' USES LATIN SIZZLE TO HEAT UP BUSH'S CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    By BRIAN E. CROWLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The ``little brown one'' has become a hunk. A
real hunk. The guy who has ``it,'' whatever ``it'' is. No less an
authority than People magazine _ the folks who know all about
``it'' _ named George P. Bush fourth in its list of America's 100
most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Behind George Clooney, Derek Jeter and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there's a Bush with sizzle, and no one is more
astonished by the attention than the 24-year Mexican-American who
is being called the Ricky Martin of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   He's so hot that the Philadelphia Daily News is running a ``hunk
watch'' column this week giving George's adoring fans daily tidbits
about the strikingly handsome son of Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and
his wife, Columba.
</P>
<P>
   He's so hot that he has been picked to address the Republican
National Convention here Thursday, shortly before his uncle accepts
the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, though, coming in a side door of the Loew's
Hotel in downtown Philadelphia, the soft-spoken former high school
teacher is feeling nothing like a hunk. Exhausted with the
attention and the demands on his time, George P. _ or just P., as
his family and friends sometimes call him _ would like nothing more
than a little time to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he is on a mission. His uncle is running for president and
long before People discovered him, George was quietly working last
year in New Hampshire stuffing envelopes and helping put up yard
signs. He also spoke to high school students, trying to excite them
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign moved him to California after the New Hampshire
primary, and it was there that George P. became a star.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him speak to Mexican-Americans, a key voting group in
that important state, his uncle's aides were astounded by how much
Latinos loved the young man. ``People would come up to him with
tears in their eyes and tell him that someday he will be the first
Mexican-American president,'' said a Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Serious, athletic and intensely proud of his Mexican heritage,
George Prescott Bush, grandson of a former president, thinks of
himself as ``someone of color.'' While his father's side of the
family is blue-blooded Yankee transplanted to Texas and Florida,
his mother was born and raised in Mexico and frequently visits
friends and relatives there. George P., who is fluent in Spanish.
grew up in Miami while his father was building a business and
political career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George, his sister, Noele, and brother, Jeb, got
unwelcome national attention when their grandfather, then the vice
president, introduced the grandkids to President Reagan as ``the
little brown ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were shocked by the statement, but the family knew
it was a loving remark. George P. is especially close to his
grandfather. He has spent summers with him, and between fishing and
palling around, his grandfather taught him the family's code of
conduct: Don't show off. Work hard. Stay close to friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   While being the grandson and son of politically successful
people has its own rewards and difficulties, George P. has not been
able to escape the prejudice that comes from being a ``brown one.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times, he says, when he goes into stores and ``the
attendant comes out from behind the counter and follows me
around.'' And he has gotten stares, not always friendly, in some
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He's been called a ``tar baby'' and a ``wetback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a bicultural experience and I'm very proud of
being a Mexican-American,'' he said. ``Our society makes
distinctions based on outward appearances. There are perceptions
made about people based on what they look like and how they
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Without getting specific, he acknowledges that the Republican
Party still has a way to go before it will feel like a party that
welcomes everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my uncle is going a long way to show people that this
is party of inclusion,'' he said. ``I don't agree with everything
that the Republican Party has ever done, but I see a lot of
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   George P. lives in California and travels wherever his uncle's
campaign sends him. When the campaign is over, he is off to law
school at the University of Texas. After that, he wants to be
involved in politics, but he's not sure whether that will
ultimately mean becoming a candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb, the proud dad, beams when talking about his son. He
compares his son's experience working for the presidential campaign
as similar to his own experience giving speeches as a young man for
his father's presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you lose the fear of humiliation. You realize
that, yes, I can get up before a large crowd and give a speech
without humiliating myself,'' Jeb Bush said. ``I can see the joy he
gets from being involved in a process that we all hope will make
people's lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons stop at ``hunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even close,'' Jeb laughs loudly. ``He's a lot
handsomer than I was, and I was already married.''
</P>
<P>
   With his family and friends constantly tormenting George P.
about his newly found hunkdom, dad is not worried about his son
taking himself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can keep him under control,'' he laughs. ``Besides,
when he goes to law school he's going to hit the wall with
studying.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with George P. who hopes that once the campaign is
over and he's in law school the intense interest in his every move
will quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that doesn't seem likely.

MILLIONS CLICK AWAY FROM GOP FESTIVITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the Republican National Convention has been tailored
for television, viewers are so unimpressed that they tuned out by
the millions Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a certain dropoff was inevitable this year because
one of the three leading broadcast networks, NBC, chose not to
carry the first night of the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   But this was supposed to be the year when the all-news cable
networks _ CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC _ stepped into the
broadcast breach and played the convention-coverage role the old
Big Three _ NBC, ABC, and CBS _ are no longer willing to play. Yet
the three cable channels drew a combined audience Monday that was
less than half the 6 million viewers NBC did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the prime-time audience in 1996 for ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS
and CNN was around 20 million viewers. On Monday, the combined
audience in prime-time was just over 16 million for the networks
that aired any coverage at all: ABC (which devoted just an hour),
CBS (whose coverage was limited to a half-hour portion of its
newsmagazine), PBS, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, meanwhile, viewers voted thunderously with their
clickers: When ``Monday Night Football'' ended on WCVB-TV (Channel
5) and ABC's convention coverage began, two-thirds of the audience,
or 200,000 households, either changed the channel or turned off
their TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have noted the absence of drama at the Republican
convention, with the nominee and his running mate already known and
intraparty squabbling kept under wraps. Even the much-anticipated
speeches Monday night by retired General Colin Powell and Laura
Bush, wife of GOP candidate George W. Bush, couldn't pull in
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, to judge by the ratings for Monday night, viewers have
not yet made the transition from broadcast to cable for the
quadrennial display of political pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the combined audience for ABC, CBS and NBC on the first
night of the GOP convention was just under 17 million viewers. On
Monday, ABC was the only broadcast network to devote a full hour to
coverage, drawing 5.9 million viewers for the speeches by Powell
and Mrs. Bush that began at 10 p.m. That was a slight increase for
ABC from 1996, even though the network's ratings were actually down
a bit (the TV audience on which ratings are based is larger than it
was four years ago).
</P>
<P>
   CBS limited its convention coverage Monday to a portion of of
its newsmagazine ``48 Hours'': The program drew 6.3 million
viewers, an increase from four years ago. But, in the head-to-head
competition at 10 p.m., the decisive victor was NBC with a rerun of
a drama called ``Third Watch,'' which pulled in 10 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over on the all-news cable networks, CNN drew 1.2
million viewers Monday, enough to win the cable contest, but down
from 1.3 million four years ago. Partly, that was due to inroads
made by newcomers Fox News (676,000 viewers) and MSNBC (516,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service Tuesday was reveling in the fact
that its coverage Monday night drew more viewers than all three
all-news cable networks combined. But even PBS's ratings were down
slightly from four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So where did all the viewers go? Perhaps yet another number
offers a clue: In 1995, the average American home had 41 channels
to choose from; by this year, that number had climbed to 62. Or
viewers may have chosen to take their convention coverage with a
dash of satire, as on Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show,'' which
drew 480,000 viewers Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area viewers proved far more interested in the
Patriots-49ers matchup on ``Monday Night Football'' (and the debut
of comedian-turned-analyst Dennis Miller) than the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than 331,000 households were tuned in to Channel 5 for the
last 15 minutes of the football broadcast, even though the Patriots
had the game well in hand. But when convention coverage began at 10
p.m., Channel 5's audience dropped to barely 130,000 households.

COMMENTARY: MAN WITHOUT A PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes you just have to concede defeat. I read the Republican
platform carefully, hoping to find some substance _ say, in the
section on retirement security. But there is no there there.
</P>
<P>
   So I turned instead to a working paper released in June by
Martin Feldstein _ the eminent Harvard economist, former chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers and adviser to George W. Bush _
and Andrew Samwick. The paper is a detailed discussion of how
Bush's proposal to allow individuals to divert part of their Social
Security contributions into personal retirement accounts might
work.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``might,'' because Bush has not been forthcoming on
specifics. Indeed, the paper contains a disclaimer: ``Although the
plan described here resembles the proposal of Governor Bush ... our
analysis is not of the `Bush plan' since Governor Bush did not
provide enough information with which to specify a `Bush plan.'''
Whew! I was wondering why I didn't understand the Bush plan, so
it's a relief to know that it's not my fault: There isn't any plan.
</P>
<P>
   The working paper, however, does contain a plan, and it makes
interesting reading. Actually, that's a lie _ the paper is quite
dull, even for economics. But the dullness is probably intentional,
because what it says might otherwise seem explosive.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Bush-like plans is this: If Social
Security contributions go into personal accounts instead of the
trust fund, where does the Social Security system get the money to
pay benefits? The Feldstein-Samwick paper offers two answers.
First, according to their plan, any money people make on their
personal retirement accounts will in effect be taxed at a 75
percent rate _ that is, every dollar you receive from your own
investments will be offset by a 75-cent reduction in your other
benefits. Since the authors assume that the high rates of return
earned by stock in the postwar years will continue forever _ an
assumption that has been refuted in recent papers by leading
experts on financial markets, but never mind _ they believe that
this will eventually save the system a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is still not enough. To balance the books the
authors go on to offer an elaborate and implausible explanation of
how the personal retirement accounts will increase government
revenue: Removing money from the Social Security system ``reduces
the likelihood that future Congresses or administrations would use
those funds to finance additional spending or additional tax cuts''
(gotta block those tax cuts!), which means more investment, which
means more corporate profits, which means more corporate profit tax
revenue, all of which will be used by future politicians _ the same
sort of people we can't trust to handle Social Security revenues
today _ to top up that trust fund 50-plus years from now. Oh, never
mind.
</P>
<P>
   What is really interesting, you see, is the timing. Even under
the peculiar assumptions of the Feldstein-Samwick paper, the stuff
that is supposed to save Social Security _ higher revenue,
redemptions of personal accounts that cut the system's outlays _
comes far in the future. Meanwhile the system is paying out more,
and taking in less. So what happens to the trust fund? Quite soon _
before 2010 _ it starts shrinking instead of growing. And the
system completely runs out of money _ the Social Security trust
fund disappears _ by about 2030. But don't worry, say the authors:
The system will just go into debt until the good stuff puts it back
into the black, sometime after 2050.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the plan: If you are 35 years old, and you wonder
where your benefits will come from when you are in your 70s, the
answer is that although the Social Security trust fund will have
disappeared by then, the retirement system will support you with
borrowed money _ which it will have no trouble doing, because bond
markets in 2040 will trust in the kindness of future politicians,
who will beef up the Social Security balance sheet by turning over
a large share of the corporate profits tax. Got it?
</P>
<P>
   Now let's be clear here: I'm not describing Bush's actual plan.
I'm only describing something that is the best indication available
about what his plan might look like if he did have a plan, which he
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that make you feel secure?

PINOCHET REPORTEDLY STRIPPED OF IMMUNITY IN SECRET COURT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean Supreme Court reportedly voted in
secret on Tuesday to strip Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his senatorial
immunity, according to local radio and Web site accounts. The
decision would remove the last legal obstacle to a full-scale
criminal investigation of the former dictator and would permit his
trial on charges of kidnapping, murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the court, Hernan Alvarez, said the justices
would release their opinion formally sometime next week. ``We are
not going to make any statements,'' said Alvarez, after the 20
justices consulted for four hours on Tuesday. ``The Supreme Court
has instructed me merely to say an agreement was reached.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither he nor any other court or government official
disputed the reports, all attributed to anonymous sources close to
the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, and all widely
disseminated among Chileans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, reported as 11-9, had been expected after the court's
11-9 rejection last week of a defense motion to proceed with
medical tests of the former dictator before ruling on his immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very content,'' said Juan Bustos, a lawyer for human
rights victims involved in the case against Pinochet. ``The report
surging through the courthouse is that we have won and General
Pinochet no longer has immunity from prosecution.'' There were no
public reactions from Pinochet's lawyers or family.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, the Supreme Court has apparently upheld a
ruling made in May by the Chilean Court of Appeals, which was also
revealed to many of the same news organizations more than a week
before it became official. Observers have theorized that the courts
and government are using the technique to try to soften reactions
and control the size of demonstrations supporting and opposing
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers arguing the case against Pinochet maintained that there
was enough evidence linking him to disappearances and other crimes
that he should be stripped of his senatorial immunity. Never
elected to the Senate, Pinochet took his life-time seat in 1998
under a constitutional provision written during his 17-year
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Pinochet gathered momentum here after he was
arrested in London in 1998 on a Spanish warrant for many serious
rights violations. He was freed for health reasons four months ago
and allowed to return to Chile, but his standing in society and
even among the military leaders and right-wing parties has
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   During the proceedings, no evidence ever linked the general
definitively to any single crime. But prosecutors are hoping that
his deteriorating legal status will encourage several retired
officers who are already imprisoned to testify that the former
dictator was aware of their crimes or helped cover them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning of the legal process and there will
need to be a long investigation to gather proof,'' said Ricardo
Israel, a political scientist at the University of Chile. ``For a
conviction, some eyewitness or document has to come forward,
otherwise the evidence is all circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel and many other experts say Pinochet, who is 84 and
suffers a variety of health problems, will probably die before he
can be convicted. But for many critics of his regime, the fact that
he could face justice in Chilean courts at all is a giant step
toward a full civilian-based democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Brett, the Human Rights Watch representative in Chile,
said the court's stripping of Pinochet's immunity would signify
``the most important decision in Chilean judicial history.'' He
added, ``It would show that dictators are not above the law in
their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is prosecuting the Pinochet case, is now
expected to force the general to answer a long series of questions
meant to link him to a case involving 19 people who disappeared
soon after the 1973 coup that brought him to power. The 19 are
believed to have been executed on the orders of top Pinochet aides.
</P>
<P>
   The general's lawyers say he is not guilty in the executions and
disappearances of more than 3,000 people. But during the Supreme
Court hearings last month they argued that he was not healthy
enough to stand trial because he was unable to direct his lawyers
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said any tests of the former ruler for mental
illness would be humiliating and unacceptable. That claim will
probably set up the next legal test, since under Chilean law all
criminal defendants over 70 must receive a medical examination
before trial, and mental illness may prevent legal proceedings to
go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's legal maneuverings appear designed to broaden
defendants' due-process protections to include physical illnesses
as well as mental health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite earlier rumblings from senior military officers, the
armed forces have remained silent on the Pinochet case since the
Court of Appeals ruling in May. Demonstrations that were fierce
after his arrest two years ago in London have gradually subsided.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republicans aren't throwing a convention.
</P>
<P>
   They're throwing a Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday's gospel choir songfest to Wednesday's Brooks and
Dunn country hoedown, the Republican Party's national convention is
more of a spectacle than a campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   All it needs is the Kilgore Rangerettes.
</P>
<P>
   This show even has two quarterbacks. U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who
played QB for Oklahoma, may never live down singing ``My Girl''
with the Temptations at a party Sunday night. Steve Young, formerly
the leader of the San Francisco 49ers, will lead the prayer
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Americans were urged to play strong safety and put
up a tough defense.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether anybody paid attention to the speeches. But
it was tough not to pay attention when bluesman Jimmie Vaughan of
Austin cranked up his Fender Stratocaster guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be paying attention when I come on stage,'' Vaughan
said yesterday, laughing as he came off stage after a sound check
in the First Union Center arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be blasting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' idea of convention entertainment used to be Lee
Greenwood singing ``God Bless the U.S.A.'' This week, the party
bands have included Blues Traveler (for U.S. Rep. Dick Armey) and
Earth, Wind and Fire. The arena has been rocked by the Greater
Exodus Baptist Church gospel choir and, now, blasted with Oak Cliff
blues.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan is part of the convention's not-your-father's-GOP
marketing, but he also has played before for Gov. George W. Bush.
He and his younger brother, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, played the
1989 inaugural ball for Bush's father, President George Bush,
invited by the late Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   It's that boomer thing. Vaughan is 49. Bush is 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George W. likes my music,'' Vaughan said. He denied
any political interest, saying he ``won't talk politics. If you
want to talk about Jimmy Reed, I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   He flew from Austin to perform one song, so he made it one of
his best: ``Boom-Bapa-Boom,'' a rocking number from a 1994 album.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said he isn't surprised that musicians from the heavily
Democratic entertainment industry are playing for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible exposure for anybody,'' he said. ``Millions of
people see you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not political. They called me, and this is what I do _ I
play guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   Even comedians get in on this Republican show. Comedy Central
host Ben Stein staged a skit Monday night. Later, the network
hosted a party, turning the Drexel University Grand Hall
administration building into a wild dance club filled with 12 bars,
eight food tables and a lighted dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, former Miami Hurricanes football player Dwayne
``The Rock'' Johnson of the World Wrestling Federation is supposed
to introduce the speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It's the world's first 4-day-long halftime show.

LAZIO'S VISIT TO GOP CONVENTION SHORT, BUT NOT VERY SWEET 
</HEADLINE>
  By   RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Rep. Rick Lazio stopped by his party's convention
for a few brief hours on Tuesday, seizing the chance to raise money
for his Senate campaign and to rally supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressman from Long Island also managed to try
to increase his visibility against his high-profile opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, by giving interviews on local and national
television at several events.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, he seemed unrestrained by the national
Republican efforts to steer clear of criticism of Clinton and her
husband. Instead, Lazio told New York delegates at a brunch several
miles from the convention hall that ``we've been here about a day,
probably longer than Hillary Clinton has been in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lazio was far more guarded, telling a mass of journalists
that he was taking the high road toward what he considered the
negativity of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And he attracted people curious to see the man who is in
political combat with the first lady, though more than a smattering
still were unsure who he was. ``Is that Lazio?'' asked one delegate
as he passed near the First Union Center. He did venture inside the
hall, though far from the podium, where some Republicans felt Lazio
belonged. He said he was ``excited to be here,'' but would stay
just a short while before doing more interviews and then attending
fund-raisers in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Republican party's platform, Lazio said, ``I
think the platform, frankly, has become largely obsolete.'' He did
cite the GOP's opposition to abortion as problematic (he opposes
public financing for abortions and late-term procedures).
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, later explained that Lazio
considered the concept of platforms obsolete, not the content.
McLagan was not sure what else in the platform Lazio opposed. Lazio
faced a long line of questions about the brevity of his visit, and
he reiterated that he would not be here Thursday for Gov. George W.
Bush's acceptance speech. Some have suggested that the Lazio
campaign was irritated that he was not offered a greater role,
especially given the prominence the first lady will have at the
Democratic convention in Los Angeles. Others, though, including his
aides, said that he wanted to avoid such a spectacle. Asked about
his lack of a speaking role, he said: ``My job is to get back to
New York. That's where the votes are. I'm not running for national
office here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his prominent Republican allies said they were
disappointed, including House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who
warmly hugged Lazio and called him ``one of my one or two best
friends in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, a conservative Texas Republican, said that despite his
occasional political differences with the more moderate Lazio, he
would have liked to see Lazio play a more high-profile role at the
convention. Organizers, Armey said, ``tried to allocate spots to
guys who needed the exposure. Rick doesn't really need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio told reporters he spent Monday in New York at seven or
eight events that aides later said were private fund-raisers, like
the one Tuesday night at a restaurant in Veterans Stadium, where he
was joined by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, said Lazio was
``trying to run away from his party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, Rick Lazio is proud to be a member of the
Republican leadership,'' Wolfson said, ``but in New York he tries
to hide the fact that he's a Republican at all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Fredric D. Price, the president of a
nutritional-supplements company, sought a partner to create an
online information company, NutritionU.com, he approached a
Columbia University professor, Dr. Richard J. Deckelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   He hit pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics might have run the other way, concerned about the
motives and standards in the emerging commercial market for
cybereducation. But Deckelbaum, director of Columbia's Institute of
Human Nutrition, was not especially worried; he viewed the Internet
as a way to reach a wider population.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia was interested, too. The venture fit neatly into its
strategy to turn more of its intellectual capital _ the knowledge,
research and teaching of its professors _ into financial capital.
It quickly forged an agreement with Price for fees and a share of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's eagerness to join forces with a start-up Internet
venture reflects a significant shift in an academic culture that
once saw itself driven only by intellectual curiosity and far
removed from commerce. While the change is occurring throughout the
academic world, few universities have moved to try to cash in as
aggressively as Columbia, which has a research capacity similar to
that of Harvard and Yale but without their endowments.
</P>
<P>
   As Columbia ventures further and faster than its peer
institutions _ it is collecting more in patents and royalties than
any other university _ it is the focus of both concern and envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a paradigm shift,'' said Cornelius W. Sullivan,
the vice provost for research at the University of Southern
California, who is trying to point his own university in a similar
direction. ``There was a time that this kind of work _ and the idea
of making money from your research _ was not acceptable at
universities, including ours. That has changed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Columbia earned nearly $100 million of its $1.5
billion budget from patents and royalties. This year it will
collect more than $160 million on products, like one technique that
allows animal cells to be used to manufacture proteins used as
drugs, and another that paved the way for eye drops used in
treating glaucoma. It is reinvesting much of that money in further
research to expand scientific discoveries and the money it makes
from them.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the faculty has not raised a fuss. The benefits to
them of collecting more money from research and other academic
activities are clear: more money to advance their work and less
dependence on the government. But there are concerns as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitris Anastassiou, a professor of electrical engineering at
Columbia, worries about the perception among some faculty members
that the university increasingly ``appears to be a for-profit
enterprise.'' He would like it to put more of a wall between
decisions about how the campus can make money, and decisions about
what research the university should support. Currently, both sets
of decisions are vested in the executive vice provost, Michael M.
Crow, who receives the university's income from patents and
royalties and decides how to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Krimsky, a science policy specialist at Tufts
University, worries about the impact on research when professors or
universities have a stake in the outcome of work they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more involvement you have by faculty, administrators and
students, the more likely you are to have conflicts,'' he said.
``It is a question not just of how many relationships you have with
business, but the nature of those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli M. Noam, a Columbia business professor who believes that
generating more revenue from intellectual property is legitimate,
still worries that ``long term, it will reduce the credibility of
universities and will probably reduce the willingness of society to
take care of these institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities have benefited from the perception that they are
outside the marketplace and have credibility because they are seen
as disinterested parties,'' Noam said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's provost, Jonathan R. Cole, acknowledges that there is
a revolution taking place in what he calls the ``means and modes''
of producing knowledge, but argues that it will be possible to
safeguard the underlying values of the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dominant values are predominantly the same as they
used to be,'' he said. ``The income is only a means to continue to
pursue our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motivation is to be entrepreneurial,'' Cole said. ``We've
been giving it away for generations. Now we want to get a fair
return, always so we can reinvest it. That is changing the
relationship of universities to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   The change began two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   To spur technological progress, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980
encouraged universities to commercialize the research they
conducted with support from the federal government. Columbia, like
other research universities, set up a technology licensing office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spinning academic discoveries into commercial riches, however,
turned out to be a slow, uncertain process. Even if a university
can find a company willing to license its discoveries, the odds are
only one in 20 that the company will make it pay off commercially,
said Lita Nelsen, director of the Technology Licensing Office at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She said that MIT
typically earns $15 million to $20 million a year in patent and
royalty fees, and that most university licensing offices do not
break even.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet, which traffics in information, has jolted
university officials into action. They see the Net as a gold mine _
providing a faster, larger payback than traditional research in
areas like biology _ if only they can figure out how to package
what their professors know.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies with deep pockets are already buzzing around
campuses, eager to enlist professors like Deckelbaum or Arthur R.
Miller, a widely known Harvard law professor who agreed to work
with a new online law school while he remained at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the competition, universities are trying to create
their own opportunities that will allow professors to expand their
reach and their incomes, and permit the universities to share in
the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia has been well ahead of the pack. The partnership with
NutritionU.com is just one of the deals it has announced in recent
months. In April, it announced the creation of Fathom.com, a
commercial online partnership with other prestigious institutions,
including the New York Public Library, the British Library and the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. These
institutions and others will offer information and classes on the
Web site. In May, the university announced that it was teaming up
with Cognitive Arts, a software designer, to offer continuing
education on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia was also the first university to join forces with
UNext.com, a start-up backed by Michael Milken, the former
junk-bond king, that is offering Internet college courses created
by elite universities. Columbia has already collected $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Crow, Columbia's executive vice provost, has been quarterbacking
the university's efforts to cash in on its intellectual property.
He has easy access to the provost and the president. And he has a
hefty bankroll: more than $40 million this year, money not subject
to the normal budget process or any faculty oversight.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the university's seriousness was its decision seven
years ago to give Crow the income from the university's research
royalties as his budget, rather than contribute it to the
university's general fund. At the time, the amount was small, about
$1 million. Today, it is about $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Crow thinks of the money as venture capital to be spent both on
academically promising projects and economically promising ones. In
recent years, his office has contributed $800,000 in seed money for
a child and family policy center, and $600,000 into the development
of an urban extension service. ``On the academic side, we are not
after economic return,'' he said. ``We are after academic or social
return.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he said, about $10 million went into various academic
initiatives. An additional $20 million went into building new
institutions, like a campus connected with Biosphere 2 in Arizona,
and the rest into miscellaneous projects, including digital media.
</P>
<P>
   The university has created a new structure, Columbia Media
Enterprises, to nurture digital projects. Although modeled on
Columbia's technology licensing office, Columbia Innovation
Enterprise, there is a key difference: it is a profit-making
company, albeit one wholly owned by Columbia. Columbia Media
Enterprises started last fall with one employee; today there are
15, including seven student ``sweepers'' who comb the university
for content to put on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of increased activity over the Internet,
Columbia pushed its faculty to consider how their interests should
be treated. Professors traditionally own the rights to the books
and articles they write, and their royalties represent perhaps 10
to 15 percent of book sales. Universities typically own patents
from research, and professors may get a quarter of the revenue.
(Each university's policy differs.)
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's Senate approved a new intellectual property policy in
June that gives the university rights to Internet projects that are
supported by university money or commissioned by the university, or
that make ``substantial'' use of university equipment and labor. In
these cases, professors share in the revenue, receiving anywhere
from a quarter to a half of the revenue after expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia says it has no plans to compel faculty members to
cooperate with its own ventures, but hopes to offer them as an
alternative to working with outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faculty are independent spirits, and we can't make them do
anything,'' Crow said. ``Their primary benefit is to create new
knowledge. The secondary benefit is to collect licensing income.
But it's a wondrous secondary benefit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The August issues of Esquire and GQ magazines have dueling babes
on their covers_ each model provocatively posed in a tight, white,
breast-hugging, belly-baring T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise. The publishers of men's magazines often use
actresses or models as cover subjects, knowing that men are
drooling idiots who are influenced by that sort of thing. We like
power tools, but we like chicks even more. (Hence the Rigid Tool
Calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   This time around, though, the cover subjects aren't models or
actresses _ they're jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis tart Anna Kournikova, the most downloaded female athlete
in the history of the Internet (literally thousands of Web sites in
dozens of languages are dedicated to worshipping her), is on the
cover of GQ, along with the caption, ``Don't Call Me Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. We'll call you ``Professor'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kournikova doesn't mind parlaying the Lolita routine
into $10 million in endorsement deals per annum, including a
billboard campaign with her in a sports bra and the caption, ``Only
the ball should bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic pentathlete Mary Beth Larsen is the Esquire cover woman,
in honor of ``Strength &AMP; Beauty, A Portfolio of America's 10
Sexiest Athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Larsen is on the cover of only some issues. Others
feature high jumper Amy Acuff, doing a Fosbury Flop while wearing a
black, shiny, Calvin Klein bikini, which I'm pretty sure is not her
usual high-jumping attire-though if it was the ratings for track
and field on TV would IMPROVE TREMENDOUSLY.
</P>
<P>
   I've also seen Esquire covers starring triathlete Lokelani
McMichael, jogging in a wet T-shirt; and kayaker Tamara Jenkins in
white shorts so tight you can see all the way to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Not all 10 of the athletes in the pictorial feature are at the
absolute top of their profession; however, all of them are
fabulously attractive, e.g., surfer Malia Jones, who could easily
slip into a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue as a model without
anyone blinking.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The same standard applies to Ms. Kournikova, by far the most
talked-about, written-about and lusted-after female athlete on the
planet. The 19-year-old Kournikova ain't on the cover of GQ because
she's the best player on the women's tour _ in fact, she's more
like the 15th or 16th best, a good but not great performer who has
never won a WTA event in her career.
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, like that neighborhood girl who flounces about
in tight outfits and then complains when the guy across the street
runs his power mower into a tree because he's so distracted by her.
She wears sexy outfits and she dates NHL players and she says
provocative things the boys love hear _ which leads to
embarrassments like the GQ story, with its cringe-inducing lead of,
``I am deeply in love with Anna Kournikova.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the GQ story is the most egregious example of a
magazine being bowled over by Kournikova's looks. That dubious
distinction belongs to the aforementioned SI, which caused a furor
earlier this year by putting Kournikova on the cover in a pouty
pose touting a story that had another 11 pictures, including two in
which she's actually playing tennis.
</P>
<P>
   As for the article itself, the normally level-headed Frank
Deford called called her ``Pornikova,'' ``Ground Strokin' Goddess''
and, believe it or not, ``Jezebel of Sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Well at least he didn't call her ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's sports organizations complained about the article and
op-ed columns ragged on SI for highlighting Kournikova over more
deserving players such as Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport or the
Williams sisters. At around the same time, 32-year-old Nathalie
Tauziat, the No. 6 player in the world, released a book (in French)
in which she referred to Kournikova as, yep, ``Lolita,'' and ``a
blond cash machine'' and mocks Kournikova's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for Kournikova; after all, it's her choice to pose
for GQ, a-posin' and a-poutin.'
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think Larsen, Acuff and company are more
impressive physical specimens. More grownup, more mature, less
bimbo-y.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I could make the politically correct claim that it's
a shame any of these great athletes have to dampen their T-shirts
and wear tight shorts just to get some play in national mainstream
magazines, but come on, who's using whom?
</P>
<P>
   Whether we're talking about the U.S. women's soccer team calling
themselves ``booters with hooters,'' American and Australian female
track and field stars doing nude calendars, volleyballer Gabrielle
Reece doing pinup posters or ice skating legend Katarina Witt
baring all for Playboy, an awful lot of top-level gal jocks are
celebrating their attractiveness on their own terms. If they want
to do stuff like that, who am I to get in their way?

WEDNESDAY'S SPEAKERS AT THE GOP CONVENTION

<P>
   Trent Lott
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator from Mississippi
</P>
<P>
   Combining firebrand conservatism and polished tactical skills,
Trent Lott, the majority leader in the Senate, has climbed the
ranks of the Republican Party. Lott, 58, a gregarious lawyer who
was once the party's House whip, vaulted over other, more senior
members to the party's top job in the Senate in 1994. His smooth
television performances and openly partisan manner won over many
young Republicans, as he shifted from the House to the Senate. He
is the first person to hold whip positions in both houses of
Congress. Lott, the son of a cotton farmer turned shipyard worker
and a teacher from Grenada County, Miss., began his political
career on the other side of the aisle, working for Rep. William
Colmer, D-Miss., in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Gilmore III
</P>
<P>
   Governor of Virginia
</P>
<P>
   James S. Gilmore III is at the epicenter of a Republican Party
in Virginia that had been left for dead just five years ago. But
for the first time in a century, Republicans now hold all three of
the top statewide elected offices. In 1997, Gilmore, 50,
orchestrated something of a tour de force, turning an underdog run
for governor into a rout. He picked a clear message _ cut the tax
on personal cars and trucks _ and he never waivered. Exit polling
indicated that this message, and his steadfastness, won over
voters. Gilmore, who was born in Richmond, Va., and still lives
there, served in the Army as a counterintelligence specialist in
Germany before receiving a law degree from the University of
Virginia. Along the road to the governor's mansion, he practiced
law, served as county attorney and was elected attorney general in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Riordan
</P>
<P>
   Mayor of Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   The first Republican mayor in more than 30 years of the largely
Democratic and liberal Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan is known for
fighting crime and municipal inefficiency. He won his race in 1993
largely on the strength of white voters in the San Fernando Valley
and elsewhere in the city as fears of a surging crime rate swept
the city and the race riots that followed the acquittal of four
white police officers who were accused of beating Rodney King were
a recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning his first term, he made millions as a venture
capitalist and investment banker, and was a philanthropist and Los
Angeles power broker. He is comfortable with politicians from both
parties and worked tirelessly to ensure that the Democratic
National Convention would be held in Los Angeles later this month _
often against the Democratically-controlled City Council. ``The
Democratic convention is a huge plus for the city of Los Angeles,
and that's my first love,'' he said recently. ``My first love is
not the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul J. Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   Technology Company Owner
</P>
<P>
   Raul J. Fernandez, 34, is one of the wealthiest men in the
country under 40. A former aide to Jack Kemp in Congress, he is now
chairman and chief executive of Proxicom, an Internet consulting
company based in Reston, Va. With $40,000 in savings, Fernandez
founded the company in 1991, three years after leaving Kemp's
office. The company reported revenue of $50.9 million for the
second quarter of 2000. The firm was founded as a systems
integration company called Proxima, but Fernandez changed the name
to Proxicom and the emphasis on Internet consulting in the
mid-1990s. As a young aide to Kemp, Fernandez researched tax
legislation and debated financing for rebels in Nicaragua while
working on the office's computer system. (As of November, Kemp
owned more than $2.3 million in Proxicom stock.)

RESPONSE TO STRESS IN ADULTHOOD LINKED TO CHILDHOOD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERICA GOODE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women who were physically or sexually abused in childhood show
exaggerated physiological responses to stressful events, a new
study has found. This abnormal stress response, the researchers
found, appears especially pronounced in women who also have
symptoms of clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   When exposed to mild stress induced in a laboratory setting,
women in the study who suffered from depression and had a history
of childhood abuse showed levels of ACTH, a hormone secreted by the
pituitary gland in response to stress, six times as high as those
in women without such histories. They also had higher levels of
cortisol, another stress hormone, and higher heart rates than women
who had not been abused. Women with a history of abuse who were not
depressed also showed hypersensitivity to the stress, but to a less
extreme degree.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings offer further confirmation that traumatic
experiences can have a profound effect on brain chemistry, and in
particular on the brain's response to stress, and they add to the
growing body of evidence that in exploring the origins of
psychiatric illness, nature and nurture cannot be easily
disentangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, here is an environmental event that causes changes in
the brain, and must interact with genetic vulnerability to
influence whether or not you get this syndrome of
hypersensitivity,'' said Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff, chairman of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of
Medicine and a co-author of the study, which appears in Wednesday's
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nemeroff said the research also underlined the importance of
addressing child abuse nationally. More than 3 million cases of
child abuse are reported each year, he said. ``And if, indeed, this
is a risk factor for developing mood and anxiety disorders,'' he
continued, ``this is a very large public health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Women were used in the study, he said, because they are more
likely to suffer from depression than men and are more frequently
the victims of sexual abuse. But he said there was no inherent
reason why men would not exhibit the same response.
</P>
<P>
   A history of childhood abuse, studies have shown, puts people at
higher risk for developing depression, anxiety disorders and other
emotional illnesses later in life. Abnormal stress responses,
Nemeroff and his colleagues suggest, might to some degree account
for this increased risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel Yehuda, professor of psychiatry and director of the
Traumatic Stress Studies Program at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, said the new study's findings ``support observations that
our group has made over a 10-year period about the exquisite
responsiveness of stress hormones in survivors who have sustained
trauma in both childhood and adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of studies, Yehuda and her colleagues have
documented abnormal stress responses in combat veterans, rape
victims, survivors of the Holocaust and others who have endured
traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence from animal studies also suggests that extreme stress
during early development might lay the groundwork for
hypersensitivity to stressful events later in life. Adult rats
separated from their mothers for a few hours each day soon after
birth show exaggerated cortisol secretion in response to stress,
researchers have found. Similar abnormal responses have been found
in adult monkeys reared by their mothers under stressful
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For their study, Nemeroff and his colleagues recruited 49 women
ages 18 to 45 as volunteers. Childhood abuse was defined, for the
purposes of the study, as repeated, severe abuse occurring at least
once a month for a period of at least one year. Independent
verification that abuse had occurred was obtained, when possible,
from court and medical records, and the recollections of friends
and family members.
</P>
<P>
   To induce mild stress, the participants in the study were asked
to give a speech and solve arithmetic problems in front of an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Charney, chief of the research program on mood and
anxiety disorders at the National Institute of Mental Health, said
the new study and others like it illustrated ``the proverbial
gene-environment interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are born with a certain genetic constitution to handle
many things, including stress,'' Charney said. ``But if the
developing animal or human is faced with an extraordinary amount of
stress, those systems are going to be changed in how they
develop.''

MARKET PLACE: CLASS WARFARE VS. RATIONALITY ON MIPS STOCK

 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an irrational world, a rational investor may be at a severe
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with MIPS Technologies, a semiconductor equipment
company whose share price has gyrated wildly this year. It fell
from a high of more than $111 on March 14 to a low under $17 on May
24 and has since rebounded to more than $46.
</P>
<P>
   Such swings are not all that unusual in this year's technology
yo-yo, in which companies go from beloved to hated and back faster
than a teen-ager can develop a crush. But MIPS stands out because
it has two classes of stock. What is amazing is not the absolute
prices of these shares, but their relative prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since the second class of shares began trading in late June,
they have traded at an inexplicable discount to the original
shares. More than a few clever investors, seeing that spread, have
tried to take advantage of it. Their strategy has been completely
rational. It has also been very unsuccessful. Against all reason,
the discount has widened. Rational investors who thought they saw a
sure profit now have substantial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting to the details, here are the basic facts: MIPS
used to be a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, which took the
subsidiary public through a 1998 initial public offering, and then
sold more shares to the public in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For tax reasons, Silicon Graphics wanted to keep 80 percent
voting control even though it owned only about 65 percent of the
stock after that second offering. So it put through a
reclassification that allowed its Class B shares to elect 80
percent of the board members, while Class A shares _ the ones in
public hands _ could elect only 20 percent of the board. Other than
votes, however, the shares were equal. They have equal rights to
dividends and to any other distributions by the company.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Silicon Graphics got out of MIPS entirely by spinning
off the Class B shares to its shareholders. Beginning June 21,
there were 25.1 million shares of Class B, trading under the Nasdaq
symbol MIPSB, and 13.4 million shares of Class A, trading under the
symbol MIPS.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, the MIPSB shares ought to be worth the same _ or
perhaps a bit more _ than the Class A shares, reflecting the
additional voting rights and the fact that more of them are in
public hands and available for trading. But when the shares began
trading in June, the Class B shares were trading at a small
discount of about $1 a share to the original shares.
</P>
<P>
   Such discounts are not unusual in the early days of a spinoff.
Shareholders of a parent company often sell the spunoff shares soon
after they arrive, particularly if they wound up with only a few
shares of the new company. That clearly could have happened in this
case _ only 13.86 shares of MIPS B were distributed for each 100
shares of Silicon Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that some investors tried to take advantage of the
discrepancy in the prices of the two shares by borrowing Class A
shares and selling them short while buying Class B shares. That
strategy guaranteed a profit if the price differential were
eliminated, as a rational investor would expect.
</P>
<P>
   But instead it widened. On June 27, the gap between the two
shares suddenly leaped to more than $3. It soon settled at $2 to
$3, but then grew again on July 12 to more than $5.
</P>
<P>
   With some fluctuation, the difference has remained about that
ever since. Yesterday, the gap stood at $5.625, or 12 percent, as
the MIPS shares closed at $46.6875 and the MIPSB shares ended the
day at $41.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Eichler, the chief financial officer of MIPS, said in an
interview that he was puzzled by the discrepancy. But he said one
possibility was that many individual investors had not yet grasped
that there are two shares of stock available. ``Without question,
there is more retail focus on'' the old shares, he said. ``They
just type in the symbol MIPS and don't know MIPSB.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence to support that view, since MIPS tends to
have more small trades than MIPSB.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work here than uninformed retail investors.
Nasdaq reports short interest _ the number of shares that have been
borrowed and sold short _ monthly, and those figures indicate that
the short interest in MIPS has soared. On June 12, shortly before
the spinoff, the reported short interest was about 1.7 million
shares. But by July 11, it had leaped to 3.1 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Class B shares would seem to offer greater liquidity, since
nearly twice as many of them are outstanding as are Class A shares.
But in fact they have traded at lower volume. Total volume for the
month of July in Class B shares came to 8.5 million shares, or
about a third of the shares outstanding. Total volume for Class A
shares came to 20 million shares, or about 1.5 times the number of
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   What may have happened is that some of the investors who
received Class B shares in the distribution from Silicon Graphics
were reluctant to sell them at the discount. Instead, they sold
Class A shares short.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gordon, the president of 21st Securities, a firm that
specializes in various forms of arbitrage, said he considered
shorting the Class A shares and buying the Class B ones but
concluded that the risk of a short squeeze was too great. In such a
squeeze, an investor who has sold a stock short is forced to buy it
back, often because it has become difficult or impossible to borrow
the shares.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon added that ``Anyone who owns MIPS Class A should
certainly sell it and buy MIPS Class B.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that is the rational thing to do. But so
far being rational has not been the same thing as being right in
MIPS.

   GOP-RDP (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: After an evening
projecting an image of a party that welcomes women, minority groups
and immigrants, the Republicans are poised to present a more
familiar focus at their convention, that of the party that embraces
and promotes military strength. Tonight, the podium will be
dominated by war heroes: Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, former Sen. Bob
Dole and Sen. John McCain. But the underlying message is the same:
The Republican Party under George W. Bush is united behind a single
message, relentlessly disciplined and focused on taking the White
House. By Richard L. Berke.

   SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ Preparing for a new round of
negotiations over how to reduce levels of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases that may be warming the climate, the United States has taken
the stance that using forests and farmer's fields to sop up carbon
dioxide, the chief warming gas, is just as important as cutting
emissions from smoke stacks and tail pipes. The position was stated

   CHINA-AIDS (Beijing) _ With the AIDS virus moving silently
through China, a number of China's leading medical experts have
begun to angrily complain that the government has done too little
define the epidemic and to prevent the virus' spread. Official
inattention and the lack of a national public education program
have already allowed HIV to transform from an fairly rare condition
among intravenous drug users in 1990, to a rapidly growing problem
that now effects an estimated 600,000 Chinese, the scientists say.
And in another 10 years, they warn, China will have one of the
world's largest populations of HIV carriers, unless the government
takes action. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

 &HT;    CORPORATE INTERESTS FUEL PARTY BOOM AT CONVENTION
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ You won't see any television commercials in this
particular campaign, but the race between Michael Oxley of Ohio and
Billy Tauzin of Louisiana is shaping up as one of the year's
fiercest _ and most entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The two congressional Republicans are vying to be chairman of
the House Commerce Committee next year, but their competition is
playing out at the Republican National Convention. Companies with
interests before the powerful panel have flocked to be sponsors of
parties in their honor, part of a tide of corporate money sweeping
over the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And these are no run-of-the-mill receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley's party featured the ageless Dick Clark, Frankie Avalon
and Chubby Checker. The entertainment harkened back to another era,
but the interests of the more than dozen companies that footed the
bill are firmly in the 21st century, including telecommunications
and electricity deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same companies were among the three dozen or so that
paid for the Tauzin party, a Mardi Gras bash Tuesday night at the
old Philadelphia Navy yard. Members of the Neville family provided
the entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Company, the parent company of Georgia Power and other
southern utilities, and Atlanta-based BellSouth are studiously
neutral in the race for chairman, and willing sponsors of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the politicians are and it's the job of our
lobbyists to establish relationships with politicians,'' said Bill
McCloskey, BellSouth's director of media relations.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is running a lounge with free refreshments for
reporters covering the convention, McCloskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyndall, a Southern Co. spokesman, said, ``They are both
well-respected individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has made $1.5 million in contributions to candidates,
political action committees and political parties in 1999 and 2000,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Southern
Company has given $732,000 so far, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   These convention parties fall within House ethics rules, which
otherwise place strict limits on what lawmakers may accept from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But the parties and the avalanche of political money at the
convention raises the ire of good government groups, which argue
that special interests get unparalleled access to politicians and
that the politicians are sure to remember their patrons.

   ``The system's broken. We are addicted to soft money,'' Sen.
John McCain told reporters Tuesday in criticizing both the parties
and contributions. Soft money technically refers only to the
unlimited contributions to political parties, but McCain was
speaking more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain added, ``The fact is, it's a bipartisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, McCloskey said that BellSouth is one of many
companies from many industries that have paid to rent Dodger
Stadium for a day during the Democratic convention later this
month. Delegates will have the chance to take batting practice and
shag fly balls, just like the big leaguers.

   The Oxley and Tauzin parties were just two of hundreds of
receptions and parties at the Republican convention. At the same
time that Tauzin was the guest of honor at his party, Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas were the stars of a party that
featured the band Blues Traveler. Coca-Cola, Continental Airlines
and Union Pacific Corp. were among the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Other sponsors of the Oxley event included: Philip Morris, which
has given $1.8 million; Merrill Lynch, $1.1 million; and the Edison
Electric Institute, $486,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies who paid for Tauzin's party included: Philip
Morris; SBC Communications, $2 million; Joseph E Seagram &AMP; Sons,
$1.2 million; Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co., $1 million; America Online,
$737,000; Walt Disney, $692,000; United Airlines, $604,000; Viacom,
$402,391; and News Corp., $401,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to parties, corporations and industry trade groups
have seized numerous opportunities to get their names and issues in
front of candidates, delegates and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, television viewers may see beach balls being
batted around the convention hall. The balls are being provided by
the National Association of Manufacturers and the Alliance for
Worker Retirement Security to push private Social Security savings
accounts. The balls bear slogans like ``Don't inflate the Trust
Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the official airline of the GOP convention, has a
hospitality suite in the First Union Center for big Republican
contributors. A pilot in uniform greets visitors at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters have placed their convention credentials in a
plastic holder supplied by the Lexis-Nexis research and information
service.
</P>
<P>
   And, as it has for many years, Kraft has given delegates and the
media boxes of macaroni and cheese in which the pasta is shaped
like an elephant, the Republican party mascot.

<P>
   A tightly scripted coronation, some call the Republican
convention; other commentators, looking for a unique angle, have
called it a coronation, tightly scripted. As one pundit said:
``There's a script for this coronation, and it's tight.''
</P>
<P>
   When the GOP convention sticks to a single theme, it's a
ham-fisted suppression of diversity. But when every member of the
media sings the same song, it's an amiable consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, but who needs spontaneity? The French Revolution consisted
of 10 years of spontaneity, and they're still washing the blood off
the Place de la Concorde. Spontaneity gets you events such as the
Shadow Convention, where a group of political infants was stunned
to hear John McCain endorse George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They heckled, threatened, barked and generally expressed dismay
that a pillar of the Republican establishment did not announce his
support for the Ralph Nader/Jello Biafra ticket. Ridiculous, yes --
but spontaneous!
</P>
<P>
   Over at the GOP convention, of course, spontaneity and diversity
have been banished in favor of a soulless parade of blow-dried
robots. A yahoo.com headline summed up the general nature of the
horror: ``Average GOP Delegate White Male, Married,'' it said, and
only the ``married'' part kept them from writing, ``Like Tim
McVeigh, Average GOP Delegate White, Male.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, black people somehow sneaked into the event. A
black gospel choir serenaded the delegates on the first night,
prompting an ABC radio news anchor to note that ``it's not the sort
of sound you expect to hear in this place.'' It's not expected, you
see, because the GOP delegates are all RACISTS who no doubt get
nervous when they see black people who aren't either tap-dancing,
shuffling along the road in shackles, or dressed up like the Cream
of Wheat mascot. Republicans, according to liberals, only attract
strange, damaged, self-hating black people.
</P>
<P>
   Let's review, then: Colin Powell, Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Al Sharpton, Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP convention had featured a Lutheran choir singing
room-temperature hymns, commentators would have warned darkly about
the role of the religious right. But a black gospel choir, exultant
in the throes of religious ecstasy, strikes the liberal ear as a
safe form of devotion. Gospel singers occupy the Good End of
demonstrative religion, the polar opposite of pale, eye-rolling,
buzz-cutted snake-handlers in short-sleeved shirts. Surely any God
who enjoys gospel music is pro-choice and anti-school-vouchers,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Since lack of spontaneity and unity are traits of the nasty old
GOP, we can expect that the script for the Democratic convention's
opening night looks like the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``FYI -- this is a rough draft, people, since unlike the other
guys, we are spontaneous and diverse!! Note to pyrotechnicians --
fireworks are usually left for the closing moments of the last
night, but feel free to shoot them off when you like. Likewise all
marching bands, floor demonstrations, etc. Follow your bliss!
Anyway, here's the schedule:
</P>
<P>
   ''7:00-7:05 -- Welcoming address by Dr. Laura. Working title is,
`You thumb your nose at God and I hold my nose at you.' Be nice.
Show our tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ''7:06 -- Dr. Laura's body dragged offstage (exact time subject
to change, but the cameramen need a window so they can set up
shots).
</P>
<P>
   ''7:07 -- Keynote speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton: `Tevye and
Me,' about her recollections of playing a czarist agent in a high
school production of `Fiddler on the Roof.'
</P>
<P>
   ''7:30-10:00 -- To Be Announced. Possible speeches include Bill
Bradley, whose two-hour slide show has an algebraic proof of his
superiority over Al Gore; Mario Cuomo might speak in Latin for two
hours (applause lines will be signaled by a wry waggle of his
eyebrows -- pay attention!!!); OR Miami Cubans might take the
podium to bitterly denounce us as tools of a homophobic, fascist
tobacco merchant named Fidel. Hey, it's anything goes at OUR
convention!''
</P>
<P>
   So that's the first night.
</P>
<P>
   And how will their convention end? Why, in the interests of
spontaneity and diversity, FDR's old wheelchair is nominated for
the presidency. ``From the Great State of Despair,'' a delegate
says, ``we nominate his empty wheelchair. Better the great man's
seat unfilled than warmed by the butt of that callow satyr's
vice-apologist!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a delegate would probably be a Republican -- but
no one would wonder how he got into the convention. In the
interests of spontaneity and diversity, anyone's welcome at the
Democratic convention. Unless, of course, you're not a Democrat.
Tsk, tsk: And here we thought they were the party of inclusion.

 &HT;    Gore spending vacation time at home of sporting goods
entrepreneur
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. - Vice President Al Gore is making a habit of
spending his
</P>
<P>
   vacation at the beach home of a North Carolina sporting goods
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who will accept the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination
</P>
<P>
   later this month, arrived Thursday at the home of Parker
Overton,
</P>
<P>
   founder of Overton's water sports mail order company based in
</P>
<P>
   Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third summer in four years that Gore, his wife, Tipper,
and
</P>
<P>
   family members have stayed at the home located on Figure Eight
Island, a
</P>
<P>
   private residential enclave north of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Overton's is a leading retailer of skis, sportswear and water
sports
</P>
<P>
   equipment. Overton's daughter, Kristi, is a world champion water
skier.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores first stayed at the four-story, six-bedroom,
seven-bath home in
</P>
<P>
   1997 after a mutual acquaintance recommended Figure Eight to the
Gores and
</P>
<P>
   helped make arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Overton, who charges the second family nothing for the stay,
said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   he expects no return favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president of the United States calls and he's used
your house
</P>
<P>
   and he enjoyed himself, you'd open your house up to him again,''
Overton said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville lawyer Tom Taft, a Gore supporter and former
Democratic
</P>
<P>
   representative in the North Carolina House, sold the Gores on
Figure Eight. He said they enjoy the North Carolina coast and
Figure Eight's privacy is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The island is a ``gated'' community, Taft said. Security guards
man the
</P>
<P>
   single bridge that connects it to the mainland. Secret Service
agents
</P>
<P>
   augment the existing security contingent when Gore visits, Taft
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's home on the island was too small to accommodate the
Gores, so he
</P>
<P>
   arranged the family's initial stay at the Overtons. The Gores
have called the Overtons
</P>
<P>
   directly since.
</P>
<P>
   Taft and the Overtons were invited to an official party at the
vice
</P>
<P>
   president's last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores are expected to leave Thursday, said Gore spokesman
Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was expected to spend a short time mulling his
vice-presidential pick,
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said. Two potential choices, Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana
and John
</P>
<P>
   Edwards of North Carolina, also have been vacationing on the
island at a
</P>
<P>
   home owned by Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' children, Kristen, Sarah and Albert, all have spent
time there
</P>
<P>
   during the week, Kennedy said. The couple's other daughter,
Karenna, also visited
</P>
<P>
   with her husband, Drew Schiff and their son, Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are having a great time here together,'' Kennedy said
Tuesday. They
</P>
<P>
   have been body-surfing, taking walks along the beach, playing
board games,
</P>
<P>
   reading books, watching videos and working a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Overton and his wife, Becky, took the Gores boating on Friday,
allowing
</P>
<P>
   both to steer their 38-foot, high performance vessel
</P>
<P>
   through the Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Overton is not active in the Democratic Party. In the past, he
has
</P>
<P>
   supported candidates from both major parties, including North
Carolina's
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Jesse Helms and Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   He has contributed to neither the Gore campaign nor that of GOP
candidate
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a
</P>
<P>
   nonpartisan group that tabulates federal election reports.
Overton would not
</P>
<P>
   say if he supports Gore's bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy calling myself friends with him, but I'm not a
political person. I'm a businessman,'' Overton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville native started Overton's Sporting Goods about 25
years ago
</P>
<P>
   in his father's grocery store. He began selling water skis
</P>
<P>
   and equipment while cutting meat at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has built the business into a multimillion dollar
catalog
</P>
<P>
   and Internet company. In addition to its corporate headquarters
in
</P>
<P>
   Greenville, the company has a showroom and warehouse facility
here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office also said the Overton friendship is not
</P>
<P>
   political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is deeply appreciative of the hospitality
shown by the
</P>
<P>
   Overtons and he enjoyed the time he spent with them, but it's
strictly a
</P>
<P>
   private matter,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores are constantly in the public eye, Overton said, so
he's glad to
</P>
<P>
   let them use the home if it grants them some respite. He said he
will allow
</P>
<P>
   them to use the house again if they want to, whether or not Gore
is president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good people,'' Overton said. ``And like you, me or
anybody else,
</P>
<P>
   they need to get away and have some time to enjoy themselves. If
they
</P>
<P>
   want to come back, they're welcome.''

<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It might not be the biggest or best recruiting
class that Georgia coach Jim Donnan has signed in his five seasons
in Athens, but several newcomers could make a significant impact
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is expected to welcome 14 freshmen to campus today,
including three quarterbacks and a pair of highly regarded running
backs. The group includes three players _ receivers Reggie Brown
and Tavarus Morgan and defensive lineman Johnathan Sullivan _ who
signed with the Bulldogs in 1999, but failed to qualify
academically.
</P>
<P>
   Three more junior college transfers could join the Bulldogs as
early as next week. Georgia Military College defensive end Nic
Clemons and defensive backs Demetric Moore and Horace Willis are
completing final exams this week. The players must pass their
required core courses to transfer to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Georgia's more decorated freshmen are running backs
Albert Hollis of Sacramento, Calif., and Musa Smith of
Elliottsburg, Pa. Hollis, a Parade All-American this year, rushed
for 2,053 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior. He also was one of
the nation's top prep sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who at 6 feet 2 and 210 pounds is bigger than Hollis,
rushed for 2,041 yards and 32 touchdowns as a senior. Hollis and
Smith will challenge junior Jasper Sanks and redshirt freshman
Bruce Thornton for the starting tailback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a feeling I'll be playing this season for sure,''
Hollis said. ``I think they'll be able to use my speed in the
backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers also include quarterbacks David Greene of South
Gwinnett High School, Sean Jones of Westlake and Matt Redding of
Madison, Fla. One of those new signal-callers should emerge as
starter Quincy Carter's backup during preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Parade All-American at Carrollton High in 1999, will
give Georgia much-needed speed in its receiver corps. Brown, who
had 62 catches and 10 touchdowns as a senior, enrolled at Georgia
in January, but couldn't participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan has called Sullivan ``the best (defensive) lineman we've
signed at Georgia.'' Sullivan, a graduate of Griffin High, spent
last year at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lost tight end Andre Zellner of Mary Persons High to
academics. Zellner will enroll at Hargrave and said he'll sign with
the Bulldogs in February.

<P>
   From the start, Republican officials said it would be a
different sort of affair. They would offer up a new, moderate face
for the party, appeal more energetically to independent voters and
present the most fully wired, Internet-capable political convention
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fine.
</P>
<P>
   Unplug the television. Turn off the radio. Pull down the shades.
Let's crank up that computer and see what it was actually like
Tuesday to experience Day Two of the 2000 Republican National
Convention solely as a surfer on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com was offering continuous streaming video from the
convention, as was c-span.org (basically, a Web version of what was
showing at around the same time on the cable channel, maybe a
minute delayed), so you didn't have to miss a minute. Be warned,
special plug-ins are often required to view some of this material,
and it can take a half-hour or more to download. As always, plan
ahead. The reward: A small, talking postage stamp of a screen with
a continuous, herky-jerky view of ebullient Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Web, it was a grab bag of smart-aleck
commentary, quizzes, bogus polls, Web cams, sarcastic features,
chat rooms and live talk-backs.
</P>
<P>
   CNN.com thoughtfully provided users with a list of ``things to
watch'' during the day's events, basically an attempt to inject
some drama into a convention that has been proudly lacking in it.
One should watch for ``party poopers,'' it said, particularly to
see if Sen. John McCain of Arizona said some intemperate things
during his evening speech. Or keep an eye out for ``negativity,''
to see if the teeth-clenched Republican activists could keep
themselves from bashing President Clinton for another full day.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal's Web site, in keeping with its more
serious, inside-the-Beltway bent, offered up-to-the-minute rundowns
of the day's national polls, which seemed to agree that Bush was
ahead of Vice President Gore by 5 to 8 percentage points. There was
also a poll, commissioned by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, that showed that Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., who has been
on the job for exactly one week, is rated as doing an ``excellent''
or ``good'' job by 68 percent of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   In its daily convention commentary, ``A Crowd Bored to Cheers,''
the Journal decided that ``there is utterly no tension at the
convention in Philadelphia, no drama, no sideshows at all.''
</P>
<P>
   No sideshows? How about Johnny Rotten's visit to a march in
downtown Philadelphia in support of the homeless? ``Hello, poor
people!,'' said John Lydon, who was known as Johnny Rotten when he
sang with the punk rock band, the Sex Pistols, and who now has a
Web talk show on eYada.com. The meeting of Lydon and the homeless
was recorded on salon.com. ``I'm Mr. Rotten and I'm here because
I'm amused by American politics,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com and MSNBC were offering a real-time rating of each
convention speaker. Web users could sign up and then manipulate a
little bar on the screen to show how they were rating each speaker
at each moment in the speech. The verdict from Monday night's
speeches? ``Messages aimed at female voters appear to have hit
their target.''
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, incidentally, also had a helpful chart showing how many
hours and minutes of the official convention proceedings had been
shown on the various broadcast and cable networks, to give some
idea of who was providing the most fulsome coverage. And the winner
was ... C-Span! Yes, out of seven hours and 49 minutes of official
proceedings on Monday, C-Span showed seven hours and 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slate offered a diary from a Philadelphia caterer about how
difficult it was to stage Speaker Dennis Hastert's Fishing
Tournament on Tuesday morning. It seems the invited guests were
roused from their beds at 5 a.m. and stuffed onto a bus where they
were fed ``a teeny fruit salad and croissant'' to keep them quiet
while they were bused to Valley Forge National Park in the
Philadelphia suburbs. There, a ``full buffet in the middle of a
field'' awaited them. The problem was that it had rained buckets
for hours and so the whole thing was a little soggy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal, in a piece headlined, ``Fat's Where it's
At,'' detailed every single morsel of food that one Maryland
alternate delegate put in his mouth in one day at the convention, a
truly awesome stream of saturated fats and raging cholesterol. They
quoted another caterer, Susan Lacz, as noting that Republicans
``traditionally spend more and have higher taste buds.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were plenty of chat rooms and talk-backs Tuesday,
featuring such prominent characters as Bush domestic adviser Steve
Goldsmith and ABC's Sam Donaldson (who is threatening to talk back
every single night of the convention). Tuesday morning, Fox News
offered up their own anchor, Brit Hume, who didn't seem to have
such a high opinion of his colleagues. ``The media in general, and
the broadcast media in particular, don't have much use for
Republicans,'' Hume wrote in response to a user's question.
``That's not news, of course. But there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But what did he eat yesterday?

NOTEBOOK: A NEW CHANCE FOR NEW MUSIC  
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Philharmonic's courtship of the conductor Riccardo
Muti has ended, amicably, it appears, but with no success. It had
been no secret that the orchestra was hoping to entice the
perfectionist Italian maestro to take over the music director's
post when Kurt Masur steps down in 2002. But Muti, who has a sure
sense of his own desirability, was playing hard to get. He was
essentially unwilling to scale back his European commitments,
especially as the artistic generalissimo of La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Philharmonic decided that for all Muti's
brilliance and renown, the orchestra needed a full-time music
director. Whatever one may say about the strengths and shortcomings
Masur has brought to the job, no one has ever questioned his
devotion to the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Now the orchestra must restart its search. And with major music
director posts also up for grabs in Philadelphia and Boston, the
process will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Conductors these days frequently have relationships with several
orchestras at once. Still, that the Philharmonic was interested in
someone, however illustrious, who indicated from the start that he
would treat this important directorship as only one of several
demanding posts says a lot, some of it troubling, about how the
orchestra views the job. What can be learned from what happened?
How might the orchestra adjust its thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A music director's job has two major components, especially in
an international music center like New York. Obviously, the
Philharmonic must have a brilliantly skilled and musically
top-notch conductor, the kind of probing interpreter who can keep
the players involved, especially in the standard repertory that
audiences want to hear regularly. And if the candidate already has
a well-known name and an extensive discography, as Muti does, that
obviously makes the marketing department happy.
</P>
<P>
   But a music director in a big city should also be a dynamic
artistic leader, someone who can forge ties with other performing
and educational institutions, someone on close terms with living
composers, an adventurous musician who treats performing new music
not as some weighty obligation but as a bracing activity, a natural
part of what musicians do.
</P>
<P>
   I have long felt that orchestras, especially in America, place
too much emphasis on the brilliant conductor aspect of the music
director job, when what is crucially needed are vibrant artistic
leaders. Perhaps because America is still nursing a cultural
inferiority complex, orchestras keep going after foreign
heavyweights and older eminences, passing over younger, energetic
Americans who could wake up a cultural community.
</P>
<P>
   Why not have a younger, idealistic and preferably American
artistic director to run the orchestra day to day, a strong
conductor, of course, but someone who could really galvanize the
institution, conceive stimulating programs, commission worthy
composers and reach out to the larger urban area? Then bring in the
eminences and heavyweights as guests to perform the great repertory
they are steeped in by cultural heritage and long advocacy. Sir
Colin Davis serves this latter role well at the Philharmonic, as no
doubt Masur will and should when his directorship ends.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras would be wise to take more chances. Leonard Bernstein
wasn't ``Leonard Bernstein'' when he was appointed to the
Philharmonic post. He was a dynamic, not-yet-40 gamble, which is
probably why for his first season, 1957-58, he was a joint
principal conductor with Dimitri Mitropoulos, and only the next
season was given the job for himself, becoming the first American
music director of a major orchestra in the United States. Obviously
the gamble paid off. Of course, by some accounts, for all the
excitement that Bernstein engendered, the playing of the orchestra
slipped during his tenure. Recordings from the Bernstein era
suggest otherwise. And, unlike every foreign-born conductor in an
American post today, Bernstein did not need an artistic adviser on
staff to tell him what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Philharmonic feels it got burned by its experience
with Zubin Mehta, who was 42 and hot when he was brought in to give
the orchestra some pizazz after its noble experiment with the
formidably intellectual Pierre Boulez, Bernstein's successor. But
Mehta was not too young and hip; he was too flashy and superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Masur was recruited in 1991 to bring order to an orchestra that
had grown unruly, to raise standards and to provide rigorous
interpretive insights into the core repertory. He has succeeded on
all counts. Yet the dismayingly conventional programming he has
planned for next year suggests that he is creatively spent.
</P>
<P>
   He will begin the season with a mini-festival of Mendelssohn, a
composer to whom he has a special claim, having directed the
Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, which Mendelssohn himself conducted
for 12 years. Though this promises to be distinguished music
making, it would be more welcome if the rest of the season were not
so fixed in the Central European mainstream. There will be lots of
Brahms, Schumann, Dvorak and Mozart. A concert in October,
conducted by Leonard Slatkin, billed as ``honoring the memory of
Leonard Bernstein,'' offers only one work of his, the ``Jeremiah''
Symphony; the bulk of the program is devoted to Mendelssohn's G
minor Piano Concerto and Dvorak's Eighth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Masur will acknowledge the 75th birthday of the
important German composer Hans Werne Henze with the American
premiere of his Ninth Symphony and Beethoven's joyous ``Choral
Fantasy'' as a curtain raiser. But for the most part when a new or
recent work is performed (for example, a premiere by Oliver
Knussen), it is sandwiched between crowd pleasers (in that case
Bruch's Violin Concerto and Strauss's ``Also Sprach Zarathustra'').
So don't be scared when you learn that Masur will conduct the New
York premiere of Bright Sheng's ``Red Silk Dance'' for Piano and
Orchestra; Emanuel Ax, the soloist in that work, will also play
Liszt's Second Concerto on a program dominated by Brahms's Second
Symphony. The message indirectly conveyed is that the orchestra is
so afraid of trying something a bit daring that it must be packaged
with reassuring favorites.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Muti is a conductor of great stature. I will not soon forget the
three concerts he presented last year at Carnegie Hall with the
Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The programs were traditional, the
most recent work being Shostakovich's famous Fifth Symphony. But
the playing was incomparable. Muti's authoritarian approach is
suited, it would seem, to this virtually all-male, tradition-bound
orchestra. Yet to his credit, Muti also got some exciting results
from the New York Philharmonic in recent appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of artistic leader would he have made over the
long term? It is hard to imagine what New York cultural or
educational institutions Muti would have formed natural alliances
with. It's equally hard to cite a modern composer with whom Muti
has been associated the way, say, Esa-Pekka Salonen, the excellent
young Finnish-born conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony, has been
linked with Gyorgy Ligeti and Witold Lutoslawski. Salonen's
artistic leadership has not drawn across-the-board praise. Many
West Coast composers complain that in commissioning composers from
his own generation, Salonen has favored Europeans he knows, which
shows the major drawback of not having an American in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The word is that the Philharmonic musicians strongly wanted
Muti. If true, it's curious. What were they thinking? Perhaps
something along the lines of, ``Maestro Masur has raised the level
of our Beethoven and Bruckner to a new high, and Maestro Muti will
take it higher still.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, in comparison, how Michael Tilson Thomas has turned
concert night at the San Francisco Symphony into a cultural must
for young and old alike. His programs are alive with new and recent
works and neglected 20th-century repertory. Yet his audiences get
plenty of Mahler and Brahms. At the opening concert of the
orchestra's ambitious Stravinsky festival last summer, the audience
could have been mistaken for a movie crowd in New York on Saturday
night. Thomas is a great match for San Francisco, with a palpable
connection to American music and strong ties to local composers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spano, 38, a superb technician and orchestra builder,
might have been the kind of exciting, younger, thinking artistic
director I'm calling for. Imagine the Philharmonic with Spano as
its adventurous leader, someone with big ambitions but
self-confident enough to regularly welcome eminent conductors as
guests. Unfortunately, Spano knew that he was probably too young
and too local (as the conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic) to
get the Philharmonic job or any of the other major posts about to
be vacated. So he accepted the Atlanta Symphony, a good orchestra,
though perhaps not the best fit: Spano's innovative programming may
be a hard sell for its conservative subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Philadelphia Orchestra is looking hard at the
41-year-old American conductor David Robertson. Though no
celebrity, he would be an exciting choice. Robertson honed his
conducting skills with complex modern music as an associate of
Pierre Boulez in France. Two years ago he conducted thrilling
performances of daunting works by Elliott Carter and Boulez with
the New Juilliard Ensemble. As music director of the Orchestre
National de Lyon, he has covered the standard repertory thoroughly.
He has also conducted opera impressively, including Janacek's
``Makropoulos Affair'' at the Metropolitan. If the Philharmonic
would adjust its thinking, Robertson could be an inspiring choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, among the names being leaked are two more foreigners
with established reputations: Mariss Jansons, 57, the Latvian-born
music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony and the associate
principal conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia,
and Christoph Eschenbach, 60, the German chief conductor of the NDR
Symphony in Hamburg. Both are perfectly fine conductors and solid
musicians who would bring indisputable skills to the post. Neither
would seem to be a lively risk-taker who might reach out to
composers and invigorate the city's culture.
</P>
<P>
   Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's new executive director, is said
to be high on both men. My guess is that either would be presented
to the public as a conductor steeped in the European tradition and,
though not as famous or dynamic as Muti, quite distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   True. But perhaps ``distinction'' has been overvalued in
recruiting music directors to American orchestras. Just by being
appointed to lead the New York Philharmonic, a less-well-known
American would acquire instant distinction. And it would be
refreshing to have someone truly imaginative and exciting, someone
who respects the European tradition but is not cowed by it. It's
something to think about. And now that Muti is out of the picture,
there is time to do just that.

U.S. IS PROPOSING AGRICULTURAL APPROACH TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preparing for renewed international negotiations on cutting
levels of heat-trapping gases that may be warming the climate, the
United States is proposing that countries get just as much credit
for using forests and farmer's fields to sop up carbon dioxide, the
chief warming gas, as they would for cutting emissions from smoke
stacks and tail pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for decades that trees and other plants
absorb carbon dioxide as they grow and that some soils do as well.
In theory, pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere would allow
countries to emit some heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases without
adding to the overall problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and some scientists said
Tuesday night that incentives to plant trees and to farm in ways
that lock away carbon is an essential part of any strategy to
stabilize the climate. In addition, they said, bringing farmers and
foresters into the battle is likely to be essential if the Senate,
which has so far firmly opposed ratifying any international climate
treaty, is to change its view.
</P>
<P>
   But the position is being criticized by some private
environmental groups that have focused on cutting the burning of
coal and oil, which caused most of the buildup of carbon dioxide.
They point to uncertainties about how long plants and soils could
continue to absorb carbon and contend that reducing emissions is by
far the safer course.
</P>
<P>
   And the proposal is at odds with the stance of the European
Union which, given its relative lack of open land for
tree-planting, would be at a disadvantage should the approach be
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department laid out the United States' approach in
documents filed Tuesday night with a U.N. office that is overseeing
talks aimed at carrying out the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an
international agreement aimed at averting any dangerous climate
warming. Thirty-eight other industrialized countries were scheduled
to file their proposals Tuesday night as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto agreement has been signed by the United States and
more than 100 other countries, but has not yet been ratified. Many
details remain to be ironed out, with two rounds of negotiations
coming in September and again in November.
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement is ratified, the United States will commit to
cutting its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2010 to 7 percent below
where they were in 1990. Given the growth in the economy and fuel
use since 1990, administration officials say, the only way to come
anywhere near that target is by adopting every possible strategy,
including the agricultural approach.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was deeply involved in crafting the Kyoto
treaty and any deadlock in talks would be a blow to him. On the
other hand, although Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has said he
believes global warming is a significant problem, he opposes
ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would unfairly burden
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Gore was being appraised of the
proposed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a
private group, said that whatever program finally emerges in the
next rounds of talks, it must not allow any country to get too much
credit for things it is already doing, such as, for example,
planting trees on land that was clearcut several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done well, credit for forests and farming could help jumpstart
a solution to the global warming problem,'' Oppenheimer said.
``Done poorly, it could undermine the credibility of the whole
Kyoto agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   David B. Sandalow, the assistant secretary of state for oceans
and environmental affairs, said the United States would not want
any final climate plan to permit loopholes allowing clearcutting or
other bad land practices to get credit in the climate fight.
</P>
<P>
   But, taking a position at odds with some environmental groups,
he added that the country's position would be to try to get credit
for most of the carbon dioxide being absorbed by the country's
trees and crops _ about 300 million metric tons a year is the
projection for that tally by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with the projected total emissions of more than
2.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year from industry,
cars and other sources if current energy trends continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that keeping some focus on farming and trees will keep
the cost of fighting global warming down. Estimates are that it
will be much cheaper for a country to absorb pollution than to
reduce the output of these gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need strong incentives for parties to adopt practices that
protect the atmosphere at low cost,'' Sandalow said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to several Japanese news services, the Japanese
government on Tuesday night also submitted plans similar to those
of the United States, anticipating a large role for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
   Some private environmental groups are vigorously opposing this
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Morgan, the director of the climate change campaign at
the World Wildlife Fund, an international group, said that forests
and soils are, at best, a temporary storehouse for carbon, and one
that can broken open by later changes in practices or by unforseen
forces like wildfire, droughts, or insect infestations _ all of
which could abruptly unlock millions of tons of banked carbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soil can be a great absorber of carbon, but if you plow too
deeply two years in a row, you can release it all back into the
air,'' she said. ``We need to find the most secure way of reaching
these goals, and that is to focus on cutting emissions from things
like power plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night a White House official said that some
environmental groups _ historically focused on cleaning pollution _
were being too inflexible on the issue. ``Carbon is carbon,
right?'' the official said. ``Some of these groups have been locked
in a philosophical approach as opposed to a practical or scientific
one.''

KOLBE BREAKS GOP ANTI-GAY BARRIER &HT;    (EDS: ADDS 4 grafs of background on Kolbe at end of story)
 &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep. Jim Kolbe's speech on
international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National
Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he
gave it at all.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz. is the House of
Representatives' only openly gay Republican. His pre-prime-time
talk on trade relations might have gone down as yet another
unmemorable convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly
anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday
objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed
extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second
evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a
Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe told the convention in prepared remarks that if elected
president, Bush would expand trade. ``He will work to launch an
ambitious new round of global trade talks, and he will enforce
trade agreements and trade laws,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe
took the podium. However, Cathie Adams, a Texas delegate from
Dallas, said that instead, she would bow her head during the speech
to pray for gays to give up their ``unhealthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Wildmon, vice president of the Mississippi-based
American Family Association, commented that ``the things that these
homosexual advocates push for are contrary to everything that 90
percent of Republicans stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it. When the Bush
campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee,
you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have
you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,''' he said in a
brief interview before the speech. ``The fact that it's a non-issue
is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush
campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he
says about being a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of
Kolbe's speech. ``We're pleased with the substance in the platform
on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the
Washington-based Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some
messages better than it's doing.'' He noted that while a gay person
_ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no
anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,''
said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
Republican organization.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is a future for gays in the Republican
Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is. The fact that I'm
speaking tonight is evidence of that''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1984 in a district stretching from Tucson to the
U.S.-Mexico border, Kolbe was the Republican point man on the 1993
North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada
and Mexico, as well as other international trade proposals on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he voted with Republicans for the Defense of Marriage
Act, which stated that states are not required to recognize
same-sex marriages performed in other states. The vote prompted a
gay publication, the Advocate, to prepare an article outing Kolbe.
In advance of the publication, Kolbe went to the media and outed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He disavowed any interest in being a gay rights advocate, saying
his performance in Congress should not be judged on his sexual
orientation. He won re-election in 1996 and 1998 in part because
although his district has a slight Democratic tilt, it also
embraces a libertarian conservatism associated with the late Sen.
Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bogard, a Democrat and a Tucson public interest lawyer
who is a longtime friend of Kolbe, said the libertarian idea is
that government ``should have nothing to do with your private
life.'' He added that ``Jim is not one to wave the flag about it,
but he's not ignoring the fact that he's gay.''

BUSH'S CONFUSING MESSAGE ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush wants credit for improvements in education
in Texas. But his message has been confusing.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bush has portrayed himself as a consensus leader who
has built upon the reforms of predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those programs resemble those supported by his
opponent in the presidential race, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So to appear more confrontational and conservative, Bush also
has posed as a savior of Texas' failing public schools. In the
campaign for president, Bush has advocated more ideologically
conservative approaches to education, like vouchers or ``character
education,'' that had nothing to do with Texas' success.
</P>
<P>
   Until he sorts out these messages, we can't know what kind of
education president he hopes to be.
</P>
<P>
   Scores on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills have risen,
overall and for minorities. State officials now intervene in
schools when students fail to show progress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are skeptics. Some argue that higher test scores have
led to a narrowing of the curriculum, with teachers doing drills
only intended to improve test scores. Some say more minority
students are dropping out after failing the assessment test. But
others counter that the test is so easy, students are not learning
much.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on these critiques. But there is better
evidence from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a
test given by the United States Department of Education to a
representative sample of students nationwide. Since 1990, the
national assessment test has made possible comparisons of state
educational systems.
</P>
<P>
   The test avoids many of the flaws in the Texas assessment test.
It has multiple choice questions but also asks for written answers
to gauge original thinking. There are no student, school or
district (only state) scores, so there is no pressure to drill and
the test can disclose what students really know.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has excelled on some sections of the national test. In
1996, the most recent year for math scores, fourth-grade students
who were African-American or white scored higher than in any other
state. Hispanic fourth graders scored higher than in any state with
significant minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-grade math scores for these same groups were also in the
top tier.
</P>
<P>
   With more minority students who score lower, on average, than
whites, the state's overall scores are below those in many states
where minorities are few. But a new report from Rand, a policy and
research group, showed that, when students from similar families
are compared, Texas' achievement was already good in 1990, and
posted greater gains from 1990 to 1996 than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Grissmer, an author of the report, attributed this to
a strong accountability system and to big investments in resources,
both supported by Texas business and political leaders. For
example, 22 percent of fourth graders in 1992 and 1996 had attended
public preschool, far more than in any other state (New York had 9
percent). In 1996, 24 percent of Texas fourth-grade teachers spent
more than 35 hours in math seminars, again more than in any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took office in 1995, so he can't take credit for scores
already high in 1990, or for gains that began then.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if any Texan deserves praise here, it is Ross Perot. In
1983, he led a group of business leaders who demanded
accountability and new money for schools serving the poor. It was
in 1984 that Texas first required preschool for low-income
4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strengthened accountability, with an emphasis on early
reading skills. He increased financing for education to 49 percent
from 42 percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   He also threatened the reform consensus in Texas when he urged
vouchers for private schools. The plan was defeated when business
lobbyists opposed sending public money to private schools that were
unwilling to administer the state assessment test or be held
accountable for results.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bush has acknowledged a debt to his predecessors, but
at others does not.
</P>
<P>
   He says that in 1994, ``there were so many goals, there were no
goals,'' making Texas schools ineffective. His campaign Web site
said until recently that when he was elected governor,
``regulations were stifling. . . . Accountability and curriculum
were focused on process not student results. The state education
bureaucracy was growing unchecked. Teachers faced the menace of
out-of-control, disruptive students.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican National Convention neared, these claims were
removed from the site. Perhaps the campaign realized that if Texas
schools were such a mess in 1994, they could not have been the best
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can take credit, not of rescuing a failed system,
but of strengthening a bipartisan consensus to combine more money
with more accountability. He has led an education system that
rejected vouchers while following some strategies Gore supports
(like preschool for disadvantaged children and higher standards and
salaries for teachers).
</P>
<P>
   But it is still unknown whether as president, Bush would do as
he actually did in Texas, or take a more ideological approach, as
he often does in the campaign.

BUSH LAUDED BY FORMER WAR HEROES AS IDEAL COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF &HT;    (EDS: Quotes from Sen. McCain are embargoed until delivery,
expected around 10:30 EDT)
 &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A triumvirate of war heroes praised Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's qualifications to be commander-in-chief Tuesday
night, with former POW John McCain telling the Republican National
Convention: ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who defeated Bush in seven GOP primaries earlier this
year before bowing out of the race, sought to reassure voters that
the untested Bush ``will confidently defend our interests and
values wherever they are threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that former President George Bush served as a naval
aviator in World War II under McCain's grandfather, an admiral who
commanded aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's
brave subordinate,'' McCain said, adding that Bush was a leader of
``courage and character.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Navy carrier pilot, McCain was shot down in 1967 during the
Vietnam War and spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war.
He was introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., another decorated
veteran of the Vietnam War and a McCain ally on campaign finance
reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Tuesday night's convention session was national
security and foreign policy and allowed Bush to bask in the
reflected glow of some of the nation's most well-known decorated
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCain, former Sen. Bob Dole and retired Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of allied forces in the Persian
Gulf War, praised Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a decorated World War II veteran and the 1996 GOP
presidential nominee, told the delegates that the nation looks to
Bush and Dick Cheney, Bush's choice for the vice presidential
nomination, ``to raise our sights and to restore honor and civility
to public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, speaking via satellite from the USS New Jersey
battleship docked in the nearby Delaware River, , said the Clinton
administration had allowed U.S. military readiness to dip. He cited
enlistment and re-enlistment shortfalls, the declining preparedness
of Army divisions and the increasing number of military personnel
who receive food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf praised the governor's father for his leadership
during the 1990-1991 Gulf War, then asked, ``Wouldn't it be great
for our armed forces and for America if we could have another
commander-in-chief named George Bush with Dick Cheney on his
team?'' Cheney was Bush's secretary of defense during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, who retired from the U.S. Army in 1991 as a
four-star general, is active with numerous charitable activities
and conservation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Condoleeza Rice, a former national security
specialist in President Bush's administration and now a senior
advisor to Gov. Bush, told the convention that the younger Bush
already has a deep understanding of when _ and when not _ to employ
the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the numerous peacekeeping missions that
Clinton has committed U.S. troops to, Rice said Bush does not view
the military as ``a global police force. They are not the world's
911,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas for the last five years, Bush has met with
leaders from Russia, South Africa and Mexico, she said. ``I know
that he understands the complexities of our relationship with
China,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Bush would make good on Republican efforts to
deploy a missile defense shield, known as National Missile Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent polls indicated the voters believe Bush would do the
better job handling defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll released Monday by the Los Angeles Times, Bush led
Vice President Al Gore 61 percent to 24 percent on the question of
who would do a better job of handling national defense. And an
ABC-Washington Post poll had Bush leading Gore 45 percent to 40
percent on the question of who would best handle foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to a rally in Charleston, W.Va., on his way to
the convention, sounded the same defense theme and criticized
Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore,''
he told a rally in Charleston, W.Va. ``This nation wants somebody
who will restore the military strength of the United States of
America.''

NEW NUCLEAR REACTOR SHEDS ONLY SOME LIGHT ON BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The southeastern region of Brazil felt a
surge of nuclear power a few weeks ago. This was notable because
the surge had been awaited for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   After what seemed like interminable delays, the country's second
nuclear reactor, Angra II, came online with a generating capacity
of 1,300 megawatts of badly needed electricity, about a third of
that used by the city of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Angra II is part of the government's plan for meeting the
country's desperate need for new sources of electric power. But it
is only a fraction of the estimated 26,000 megawatts of new
electricity that will be needed in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   And with Brazilian hydroelectric facilities threatened by low
rainfall, and plans for gas-run power plants still in the initial
stages, Brazilian energy troubles are worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is going to have a crisis in the electricity sector
because it didn't make investments when they should have been
made,'' said Luiz Pinguelli Rosa, deputy director of the
postgraduate engineering program at the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro and one of the strongest critics of the government's
energy program.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's power problem became painfully apparent one evening in
March last year, when the entire southern region of the country
went dark, much of that populous and industrial. The blackout,
which affected three states and the federal district, was caused by
weakness in the electricity grid, which was and still is working
near full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in electricity stopped once the Asian economic crisis
struck in 1997. For the next three years, financing for electrical
projects in the region was paralyzed, and the government, which was
busy containing damage to the entire financial system, could
provide little help.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, in order to maintain current plants while investing in
new generating, transmission and distribution facilities, the
country needs about $6 billion annually. The government says it can
only provide about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, at least, officials say they have pulled together
enough sources of energy to meet new demand of about 4,500
megawatts. Besides Angra II, Brazil has purchased 1,000 megawatts
of electricity from Argentina with an option to import 1,000
megawatts more.
</P>
<P>
   The government also announced last month that it was negotiating
with Paraguay to buy its entire share of the energy from Itaipu, a
joint-venture hydroelectric dam that straddles their border.
``Brazil has always muddled through,'' said David Hurd, Latin
American electricity analyst at Deutsche Bank. ``It's the way the
country operates. Between imported energy coming out of Argentina
and the makeshift increases in hydro capacity, they'll make due.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, Hurd added, will be in following through on
plans to build the gas-powered thermoelectric plants that are meant
to reduce dependence on hydroelectric power, which now provides 97
percent of the country's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   A drought in the south and southeast has aggravated Brazil's
vulnerability to hydroelectric problems
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to grant concessions to industry to build
49 thermoelectric plants. But thermoelectric plants have their own
problems. They are costly to operate, and Brazil's regulatory
structure does not yet provide companies with a safe source of
returns. Without a certain profit stream, experts say, financing
for the projects will be difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that at least nine of the plants can be up
and running in the next 18 months. Pinguelli and others say the
process will take, at the least, two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could perhaps save ourselves this year if it rains a lot,''
he said. ``Next year, I think we are going to have rationing.''

 &HT;    BUSH AGREES WITH POWELL THAT GOP MUST IMPROVE OUTREACH TO
MINORITIES
 &HT;    EDS: Recasts lede with updated Bush remarks; minor editing
throughout
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush Tuesday said he
agrees with retired Gen. Colin Powell that the Republican Party
needs to do a better job of reaching out to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a stirring speech Monday during the opening night of the 37th
Republican National Convention, Powell urged the GOP to do more to
live up to its legacy as the party of Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday if he agreed with Powell's criticism of the GOP's
stand on affirmative action, Bush told reporters in Charleston, W.
Va.: ``I agree with Colin Powell that Republicans need to do more
to reach out to minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' Bush said. ``And I agree with
him that I'm the man to do it for the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is to arrive Wednesday morning in Philadelphia, where GOP
convention delegates will officially select him as their
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his impassioned speech Monday night, Powell praised Bush for
improving the educational performance of students in Texas,
particularly minorities, and said that Bush can help ``bridge our
racial divides'' if he wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell had some sharp criticism for their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but you hardly hear a whimper from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with preferences
for special interests,'' Powell told delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not seen Powell's speech in advance but that
Powell called him Monday to tell him that he would ``talk about
these issues.'' Powell, the only African-American to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of the speakers
helping the GOP convey Bush's ``compassionate conservative''
campaign theme during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what specific policies he had in mind,'' Bush
said. ``In my state of Texas we took a very positive step toward
ensuring (that) the racial mix of Texas universities reflected the
nature of our population.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas's 10 percent plan, students of any race who graduate
in the top 10 percent of their classes are automatically admitted
to state colleges and universities. Bush signed the plan into law
after a federal appeals court disallowed the use of race or
ethnicity as a factor for admittance to Texas colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush supports what he
calls ``affirmative access.'' He opposes race-based quotas because
``he believes quotas divide and Balkanize our society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought his delegates and the large, enthusiastic
crowds that have greeted him on his six-state pre-convention tour
are mostly white, Bush said: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the makeup of the crowds in Texas but I got
nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote and I'm not so sure the nature of
the crowd necessarily is going to reflect the nature of the vote,''
he said. ``But we've got a lot of work to do, no question about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Bush may have won as much as 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote during his 1998 gubernatorial re-election,
although some voting groups have cast doubts that he did that well.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was nuanced in his response to Powell's speech, Bush
was loud and clear about recent criticism from President Clinton.
At a fund-raiser late last week, Clinton mocked the Bush campaign
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how bad could I be?'' Clinton, playing the role of
Bush, told Democrats in Rhode Island. `` I've been governor of
Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has been stepping up his criticism of Clinton
throughout his pre-convention tour, reminding audiences almost
daily that his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
``knows what the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' _ a reference to
Clinton's deposition in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech Monday at the convention, Laura Bush promised that
her husband would renew a time when children could respect the
president of the United States. Traveling with her husband to West
Virginia Tuesday, Mrs. Bush said she was not referring to Clinton,
and Bush added: ``I don't think I've ever mentioned President
Clinton's name on the stump recently.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he has been talking about the president
when he uses the ``is is'' line. Almost daily, Bush recounts
stories of people coming to him with pictures of their children,
imploring him to restore respect to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was talking about him then,'' Bush said. ``I sure was,
but in the context of having somebody who's going to shoot straight
with the American people...When people walk up and hold pictures of
their children, they're the ones doing that. And we're just
reflecting what we see. ``

TALENT _ AND ROMANCE _ CATAPULTING EUROPEAN OPERA DUO INTO
LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN ROCKWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ Until last month, the names of the
young opera singers Marijana Mijanovic and Kresimir Spicer were
virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are ``the couple of the summer,'' according to the
Marseille newspaper La Provence. That is partly because of their
performances as Penelope and Ulysses in the new production of
Monteverdi's ``Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria'' at the noted opera
festival here.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also because they are a real-life Romeo and Juliet:
she is Serbian, he is Croatian, and they live together in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Beaune, France, where they had
gone to sing in a concert performance of the opera, they seemed
determined not to exploit the drama of their relationship. Nor,
since they still must present their formal graduation recital this
fall at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, do they wish to be
prematurely compared to a better-known opera couple, the Romanian
soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the French tenor Roberto Alagna. Yet
their gifts may be comparable, and their lives are the stuff of
high operatic drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great story,'' said Spicer, 24, with boyish
enthusiasm. Through different routes, both arrived in Amsterdam in
1994: he from Slavonski Brod via Zagreb, a mid-size Croatian
industrial city, she from Valjevo via Belgrade, a smaller,
central-Serbian town. They came to study with Cora Canne-Meijer, a
respected Dutch teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of a mid-level factory worker, although he added
that his family was rich until World War II. Her father is a highly
placed engineer and inventor.
</P>
<P>
   They met at the height of the tension, not to say outright
hatred, between Serbs and Croats. The Serbs had seized control of
30 percent of Croatia in 1991, and it was not until 1995 that the
Croats could drive them out. Interethnic romantic relationships,
common enough before the hostilities, had become nearly
unthinkable, although Spicer and Mijanovic (his name is pronounced
KRE-shi-meer SHPIT-zer; hers, Mar-YAN-a Mee-YAN-o-vich) said that
in their circles at home, casual relations were not quite so
fraught. Each came to Amsterdam separately: he with the aid of a
Dutchman who visited Croatia, bringing humanitarian aid; she after
an aunt in the Netherlands said she could live at her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our first group class in the fall,'' Spicer recalled,
``our teacher called up and said, `There is student in the class,
and there may be a problem: she is Serbian.' I said, `There is no
problem.' She had called Marijana and warned her, too. We spoke
English in class, but I greeted her in our language. We were
friends right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the Romeo and Juliet parallel developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite a bad time in our country, a strange time,''
Mijanovic, now 28, recalled in an understatement. ``Both Kresha and
I were different then. Your minds are closed; you're constantly
bombarded with media. Then you come outside, and you realize there
is something else. This boy opened the door and he spoke my own
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship did not flower into love at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took time, for both of us,'' Mijanovic explained. ``In that
first year, there was no question that I was even going to think
about him as a boyfriend.'' The two began living together in 1996,
but marriage is still difficult to contemplate. While they each
visit their families regularly, they have not traveled home
together, let alone sung in Croatia or Yugoslavia. ``Until this
year, it was not quite safe,'' she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had quite a few problems and crises at first,'' Mijanovic
continued. ``The two families have still not met. But they accepted
our relationship. Now, if we broke up, both families would be
surprised. But marriage _ it's still a bit too complicated at this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just their personal drama, but also their professional
artistry that has captivated the operatic world. Le Monde called
them ``revelations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mijanovic is a commanding low mezzo with a spectral stage
presence that made the sometimes mopey Penelope, waiting for years
for the return of her husband from the Trojan War, into the
haunting figure Monteverdi intended: the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung praised her ``secret, strange, distant aura.''
</P>
<P>
   Spicer is a heroic tenor in the making _ a young Jon Vickers,
said Eva Wagner-Pasquier, the festival's artistic adviser and a
leading candidate to take over her great-grandfather's Bayreuth
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner-Pasquier added that the couple had been inundated with
offers from agents and opera-house managers, but that Mijanovic and
Spicer seemed sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big fuss now,'' Mijanovic said. ``We are already
overburdened by offers. They say this role is good for you, and
that role is good for you. But we are very realistic people. When
you come from our country and have lived what we've lived through,
you become very down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   As the elder of the pair, Mijanovic seems the more fully formed
artist, one whose rich low mezzo is likely to grow in strength and
assertion over the years. Right know, she is concentrating on the
Baroque and Handel, although she and Spicer recently sang Mahler's
Romantic ``Das Klagende Lied'' in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, for a young singer,'' she said. ``We love
different kinds of music; we don't like to put ourselves in a
Fach,'' she added, using the operatic term for vocal category.
Although she and Spicer have undertaken a joint recital tour, her
heart is clearly set on opera. ``It's not just voice and
musicianship, but something else: you can share yourself with your
audience, and I love that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner-Pasquier was not alone in noting a kinship between Spicer
and Vickers in his youth. Like Vickers, the great Canadian tenor of
the 1960s and '70s, Spicer has a voice that is baritonally
anchored, with ringing high notes that drop to soft (yet always
tonally sustained) quiet passages, and a complex, even
idiosyncratic way of phrasing. But while Spicer is being offered
parts like the title role in ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' and Rodolfo
in ``La Boheme,'' with maybe Wagner down the line, he is proceeding
almost as cautiously as the notoriously cautious Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice grows all the time,'' he said, objectifying his
instrument in the time-honored manner of singers. ``When I sing an
aria now after singing it a year ago, it's completely different. My
brother bought the first Three Tenors record for me, and I could
always sing all the top notes. When I first started with Cora
Canne-Meijer, though, she wondered if I was really a heroic
baritone. But every year, I get one more high note.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the couple said they look forward to pairings like
Carmen and Don Jose or even Kundry and Parsifal, they are prepared
for separate engagements as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to sing together, but we know it will not always
be possible,'' Spicer said. The ``Ulisse'' production here is
finished for the summer, and the couple have no recordings (a duet
CD may be in the works), but curious opera lovers will be able to
hear them in several productions of ``Ulisse'' in Europe next
season, and most likely at the Brooklyn Academy of Music next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as their career opportunities abound, attention keeps
circling back to the drama of their personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why people look at us in this way,'' Mijanovic
said. ``But it doesn't say on our foreheads, `Serb,' and `Croat.'
If people like the fact that we are together, I don't have anything
against that. But after this interview, we don't want to speak
about it. I look at Kresha not as a Croat but as the man I love.''

GOVERNMENT INATTENTION FURTHERS SPREAD OF AIDS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ During all the years that Yang Zhiyin was selling his
blood, he had never heard of AIDS. All he knew was that he was
desperately poor, and selling blood on the black market was what
farmers did in his village when they needed cash. For much of a
decade, Yang said, he rolled up his sleeve to the blood dealer's
needle ``many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those times, Yang, now 37, became infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. Because illegal blood rings often use
unsterile collection methods, poor peasants like Yang are routinely
exposed to blood-borne diseases, scientists say. And after Yang
contracted the virus, he presumably spread it unwittingly to dozens
of others, who for the most part still do not know that they are
infected _ or even that HIV exists.
</P>
<P>
   With the AIDS virus skipping silently through China, a number of
China's leading medical experts have begun to complain angrily that
the government has done too little to define the epidemic and to
prevent the virus' spread. Official inattention and the lack of a
national public education program have already allowed HIV to go
from a fairly rare condition among intravenous drug users in 1990,
to a rapidly growing problem that now infects as many as 600,000
Chinese, the scientists say. And in another 10 years, they warn,
China will have one of the world's largest populations of HIV
carriers, unless the government takes action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spread of AIDS is accelerating rapidly and we face the
prospect of remaining inert against the threat,'' states an
extraordinarily blunt report by a committee of eminent experts that
was sent to China's leaders earlier this year. ``Owing to
government indifference, AIDS prevention and control is gravely
ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been no national screening for HIV, so that
the government has little idea of how and where the disease is
spreading, for example. The total budget for AIDS prevention last
year was under $2 million _ far less than those of much smaller
countries like Vietnam and Thailand. Local officials often refuse
to screen for the virus, for fear high rates will reflect badly on
their governance. In many cities, billboards promoting AIDS
awareness or prevention through condoms have lasted only days
before they were declared ``indecent'' and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached the point that if we don't wake up, it will be a
national disaster,'' said Zeng Yi, a leading AIDS researcher who
was on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over how China should handle AIDS generally pits
government scientists concerned with a simmering health epidemic
against socially conservative propaganda, education and health
officials, guardians of China's image and its moral values. The
scientists protest that these conservatives have stymied their
efforts to confront the disease, preventing frank discussions of
sex and drug addiction, for example, and even attempting to
camouflage China's HIV problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central government doesn't seem to realize how serious
this is,'' said Qiu Renzong, a bioethicist at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, with clear exasperation. ``We have not yet had
an effective risk-reduction strategy, because some departments are
very conservative. They think chastity is more important than
condom use. They say that the only way to prevent HIV transmission
is to rely on China's traditional values.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members like professor Qiu say they intended their
report to be a jarring wake-up call _ arguing for national AIDS
education, condom use and needle exchanges for drugs addicts, for
example. And some have been encouraged by the government's initial
response: appointing Deputy Prime Minister Li Lanqing to oversee
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government attitude is changing,'' said Zeng,
hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   But others remain skeptical: ``Yes, there's been big progress,
but compared to the speed at which HIV is spreading it's not
enough,'' said Wan Yanhai, a former government health worker, who
said he was fired in the mid-1990s for speaking too frankly about
HIV. ``Part of the reason there hasn't been a survey is that they
don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are now 17,000 people known to carry the AIDS
virus in China, government officials say that the real figure is
probably closer to 500,000 or 600,000. The number is still small
compared to China's overall population, which exceeds 1.2 billion,
but scientists say rates are extraordinarily high in some groups
and in some locations. They add that the number of cases is now
growing by 30 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say that intravenous drug users probably
account for more than 70 percent of the HIV in the country. Zeng
and many other experts believe that blood sellers like Yang may
well be the second-largest group.
</P>
<P>
   But the first estimate may be skewed because it is based on the
forced testing of drug addicts under arrest. And there is almost no
hard information on blood sales, which are officially banned.
Prostitutes and gay men are also considered at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   These limited surveys have found extremely high rates in some
localized populations: In the early 1990s more than 80 percent of
drug addicts arrested near the Myanmar border were infected, Zeng
said. More recently, a survey in Henan found rates as high as 16
per cent in locales where illegal blood selling was common _ until
local officials blocked further testing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to extrapolate from these pockets of high
infection to the larger population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we haven't done the screening that needs to be done,
we don't really know the size of the problem,'' said Zeng. ``That
means that when the government confronts it, they think the
problem's not too big.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wan said, some of the more worrisome data are often
kept secret. He noted that outbreaks of HIV in the countryside are
not publicized and that drug addicts are not always told that they
are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still feel quite safe _ they think HIV is a
disease of foreigners,'' said Wan, who now runs a Web site about
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The true picture will never be clear without very aggressive
government intervention, experts said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Individuals from high-risk groups have little incentive to be
tested since there is no treatment for the disease in China.
Western treatments for AIDS are expensive and not licensed for use
in China, and traditional medicines have not proved effective.
</P>
<P>
   Also, although laws prohibit discrimination against people with
HIV, harassment is the rule, prompting most to hide their disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV is like having leprosy in the 1930s,'' said Yang, the
former blood seller who contracted the virus, and who said he would
only speak if his home province was not identified. ``I have only
told my immediate family.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest obstacle is that local officials do not
want to admit that prostitution, drug abuse or blood selling are
occurring on their watch. ``Even many provincial officials have no
idea how many HIV-infected individuals are in their province _ and
they don't want doctors to come and do the tests'' said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
   They are particularly resistant to surveys of blood sellers,
scientists say, since the practice was outlawed in 1997. Still,
blood sales continue and government scientists estimate there are 5
million Chinese who regularly provide blood for pay.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that HIV in this group is probably very high because
of the collection methods commonly used by the blood gangs, who buy
the blood from farmers and then sell it to individual patients or
small-town doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, blood is collected from a number of peasants with the
same blood type at one time. The blood is then pooled and spun down
to separate out the components needed for medical use, and the
remainder is divided up and re-infused into the original donors. In
this way, people like Yang are exposed to the blood of six to 12
others every time they sell, experts say. Wan said that in one
preliminary survey in Shanxi Province, 132 of 134 people with HIV
were found to be blood sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to hospitalized patients is probably not great, Zeng
said, because hospitals generally screen blood products for the
virus _ although in emergencies or in rural hospitals and clinics,
there is evidence that the system can break down.
</P>
<P>
   Song Pengfei, 18, one of the few AIDS patients in China who has
spoken out about the difficulties of living with the disease, was
infected during emergency surgery at a rural hospital after his
family purchased a transfusion from a blood gang in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While a number of researchers and even government bureaus have
attempted projects to educate Chinese about HIV, these are often
privately funded and nationwide efforts have been hampered by lack
of money and a strong puritanical streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When HIV became a problem in the West, there were huge
education campaigns,'' said Zeng, who has himself paid for and
organized a large traveling scientific exhibition on HIV. ``We talk
about it one day a year _ on Dec. 1 _ International AIDS Day. That
is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 1, for example, the State Family Planning Commission
unveiled new television advertisements promoting the use of condoms
to thwart HIV. By the next day they were ordered off the air by the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which said they
violated a law against advertising sex-related products.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a billboard advocating condom use in Wuhan was ordered
removed just 22 hours after it was posted. Bus ads in Guangzhou
last year met with a similar fate. And although condoms are widely
available in drug stores in Beijing and Shanghai, an effort to
install machines on university campuses was abandoned after intense
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you promote condoms among youth, it would lead to a great
deal of sexual license and abandonment of sexual morality,'' said
Zhu Qi, a government consultant who believes that the best answer
to HIV is chastity. ``So this is not just about AIDS, it's about
our overall cultural and spiritual development.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an attitude that exasperates Qiu.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an old Chinese saying,'' he said. ``People don't shed
tears until they see the coffin.''

HEAT WAVE IN CALIFORNIA BRINGS STATE CLOSE TO DECLARING POWER
EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A lingering heat wave throughout the West drove
demand for electric power in California to near-record levels on
Tuesday and brought the state close to a full-scale power emergency
that could have prompted rolling blackouts as power administrators
sought to keep the state's giant, overburdened electricity grid
from crashing completely.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the California Independent System
Operator, which controls about 75 percent of the state's electric
power grid on behalf of private utilities, declared a statewide
Stage Two emergency at midday. In a Stage Two emergency, power is
curtailed to commercial and industrial users who receive discounted
power rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down when asked to do
so in times of high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Officials warned that a Stage Three emergency, which has never
before been declared, was possible because a stubborn high-pressure
system stretching from Mexico to Canada had kept temperatures so
high that air-conditioning systems were working harder and longer
throughout the entire region. In a Stage Three alert, ``rotating
blackouts'' to small portions of communities are imposed to keep
the overall system up and running.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which began deregulating the electric power
industry four years ago, and around the nation, a decade of
economic growth and under-investment in new power plants has left
power reserves at the lowest levels in decades. Early on Tuesday,
officials warned that overall demand in California was expected to
exceed 46,245 megawatts, breaking the previous record of 45,884
megawatts set just last year.
</P>
<P>
   But at 3:30 p.m., the system was handling 43,400 megawatts, and
had already cut off about 1,800 megawatts to industrial users as
part of the Stage Two alert. That left the system with a reserve
capacity of about 3 percent more power than the demands on the
system. A Stage Three alert is automatically called if reserves
fall below 1.5 percent. Because the heat wave is so widespread,
California has been unable to import enough power from other
states.
</P>
<P>
   If a Stage Three event works as planned, ``We'd have to impose
rotating outages to small portions of communities across all our
service area,'' said Tom Boyd, a spokesman for Southern California
Edison, which supplies power over 50,000 square miles in Central
and Southern California, including much of suburban Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles itself, the city's municipal utility, the
venerable Department of Water and Power, which built the Owens
Valley aqueduct that allowed the growth of the modern city,
controls its own independent electric power source and was not
expected to be affected by the statewide alert.

TEEN - AGERS' USE OF ECSTASY DRUG RISING, SAY OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as casual drug use has dropped nationwide,
some of the nation's most prominent drug experts warned Tuesday
that the use of a psychedelic drug known as ecstasy has risen
sharply, particularly among young people, raising fears that a
major new front has opened in the government's efforts to curb
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 months alone, agents for the U.S. Customs Service
have seized a record 8 million doses of the drug at the nation's
airports and other ports of entry, far exceeding the 750,000 doses
or tablets seized in 1998 and the 3.5 million confiscated last
year, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials gathered at a conference in Washington to
discuss how to deal with the drug acknowledge that the seizures
represent only a fraction of the total amount of ecstasy that has
been smuggled into the country and, in turn, channeled into major
cities like New York, Los Angeles and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the drug, which increases energy and is reputed to
foster a sense of well-being, has gained alarming popularity among
teen-agers on the nightclub circuit and at all-night dance parties
known as raves.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of the so-called club drug has been fueled by
highly organized drug traffickers who authorities say have begun to
expand their sales operations into the increasingly lucrative
ecstasy market, where a single pill can be manufactured for as
little as 50 cents and then sold for as much $40.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was once ad-hoc smuggling among small-time dealers and
users has mushroomed into organized trafficking among criminals,''
said Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs Service.
``They have the money and the muscle to market ecstasy beyond the
club scene in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. We now see it
surfacing all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The seizures, along with evidence of the drug's increasing use,
have prompted such widespread concern that law enforcement
officials and drug policy experts from across the country have
gathered this week in Washington at a conference organized by the
Drug Enforcement Administration to discuss strategies on combating
it.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's drug policy director, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,
Tuesday warned that the drug was posing a particularly serious
threat to children. He cited a nationally recognized survey showing
a sharp rise in the number of high school seniors who said that
they had used ecstasy in the previous month, from 1.5 percent in
1998 to 2.5 percent the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of ecstasy has skyrocketed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the concerns raised, law enforcement officials at
the conference and elsewhere seemed at a loss over how to confront
the problem. McCaffrey said Tuesday that his office would spend $5
million on a national advertising campaign warning against the
drug. But he offered no other major initiatives specifically
tailored to deal with the ecstasy problem.
</P>
<P>
   In what was described Tuesday as a victory in the government's
war against drug traffickers, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
the arrest of 140 people who were accused of participating in a
nationwide ring that supplied clandestine methamphetamine
laboratories with the basic ingredient needed to make the drug. The
arrests capped an eight-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who made the announcement at the ecstasy drug conference,
said that federal agents had seized 10 tons of pseudoephedrine, a
compound found in diet pills and nasal decongestants, but which
bootleggers use to make methamphetamines, a stimulant nicknamed
meth, crank, ice and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is a bitter white powder that is also known as MDMA,
short for 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine. It is a chemical
variation of mescaline, a hallucinogenic drug obtained from the
mescal plant, and amphetamine, or speed, a drug that stimulates the
central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   It enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the early 1970s as a
substitute for methylenedioxy amphetamine, or MDA, which was
outlawed in the late 1960s. But it was not until the early to
mid-1980s that ecstasy gained a regular following in both Europe
and the United States on the nightclub and party scene.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the drug's popularity has grown at a rate that
has alarmed authorities in the United States, though it is
difficult to say exactly how many people are experimenting with the
drug. It has become one of the illicit drugs that law enforcement
officials consider the most troubling because of its widespread
use.
</P>
<P>
   Many users are drawn by its ability to reduce inhibitions,
promote euphoria, produce light hallucinations and suppress the
need to eat or sleep. One pill's effects can last up to six hours,
but users build up a tolerance, and an overdose can cause
accelerated heartbeat, high blood pressure, fainting, muscle cramps
or panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts consider ecstasy psychologically addictive and
maintain that it can cause paranoia and psychosis. It has been
linked to a handful of deaths nationwide in recent years, along
with a spate of injuries. The government reports that 1,042 people
sought emergency-room help in 1998, compared with 637 people a year
earlier, because they abused the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is largely manufactured in laboratories in Belgium and
the Netherlands, where it is sold for as little as 50 cents, and
then smuggled into the United States. For the most part, Israeli
organized crime syndicates have been implicated as the main source
of the distribution of the drugs in the United States, the
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis Rice Jr., the special agent who heads the DEA's New
York division, said the potential for large profits has led other
drug organizations to enter into the ecstasy trade. ``In the decade
of the 1990s, we didn't see that much of this drug,'' he said.
``But traditional cocaine organizations are starting to look at
ecstasy as the new drug to market and sell.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ At a breakfast on Monday for Wyoming's delegates
to the Republican National Convention here, Dick Cheney looked
uneasy when it came time to pose for a photograph with the crowd
from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   When the group burst into a rousing rendition of ``Ragtime
Cowboy Joe,'' the University of Wyoming fight song, everyone
reveled in the pageantry. Everyone, that is, except Cheney, who sat
stiff and silent in the front row, a pained smile fixed on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, has lived in the bubble of public life for more than
a quarter-century, as White House chief of staff, congressman and
secretary of defense. He presided over the military in the Persian
Gulf war in 1991. But he has not run for office since 1988, in his
last bid for re-election as Wyoming's lone House member. As Gov.
George W. Bush's running mate, he is in many ways a neophyte on the
national campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   He seems utterly at ease giving short, serious speeches to
crowds, and fielding searing political line drives from Sunday
television talk show hosts. But give him a crowd and a rope line,
and Cheney rushes through, visibly relieved when he's finished.
Give him a bank of television cameras at a campaign rally, and he
looks the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick did fine tonight, and he'll get better,'' Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania said after Cheney's four-minute speech at his debut
rally on Sunday, a well-received, if sober, recitation of his
conservative record and the campaign's central themes. ``Remember,
Dick has not been on the political stump in a long, long time, and
like everything else, he'll get into a rhythm,'' Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates here, who like Cheney are more conservative than most
registered Republicans, almost universally applaud his selection,
more for bringing sure-footed experience to the ticket than any
campaign sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bouncing up and down about Cheney, but sometimes
substance is better than show,'' said Bill Caster, a commissioner
in New Hanover County, N.C., and Republican delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush has gently poked fun at his partner's dry campaign
style, but he continues to praise Cheney and brags that picking him
as a running mate was a ``presidential decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush campaign advisers argue that vice presidents don't
need to be galvanizing campaign figures. Jack Kemp, for example,
was supposed to jazz up Sen. Bob Dole's lagging campaign in 1996,
but it made no difference. So with The Secretary _ as many campaign
aides call Cheney _ preparing to give the speech of his life to the
convention on Wednesday night, the Bush camp's strategy has been to
let Cheney be Cheney, with a few tweaks here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man of Secretary Cheney's stature and experience came here
prepared,'' said a Bush campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush advisers conceded that no one planned or anticipated
that Cheney would spend much of his week defending his voting
record in Congress after appearing on last Sunday's talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the Cheney quotes raised some eyebrows among swing
voters,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``Votes that
played well in the West didn't go over well in the Philadelphia
suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The same concerns about Cheney's votes against the Head Start
education program and a ban on armor-piercing bullets gave other
Republicans pause. ``There are a number of votes that seem strange,
but I try to put them in perspective with the times and the
circumstances,'' said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, one of Miami's two
Cuban-American House members.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers played down the controversy. Tom Rath, a
Republican National committee member from New Hampshire who advises
the campaign, said: ``The Democrats' attempts to make Cheney a
scary figure are not going to work, because he's not a scary
figure. The base is very content with him, and if the base is
content, then you can work on the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the lone black Republican in
Congress, urged Cheney not to appear to pander to individual
groups. ``My advice to Dick Cheney is just to continue doing what
he's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates agree that Cheney's seriousness is his biggest asset.
``He isn't a snake-charmer by any means, but he'll bring a
stabilizing force,'' said Pat Cross, 68, a Republican delegate from
La Quinta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cheney hasn't said much about any of this. Since
arriving here on Sunday, he has kept a low profile and has seemed a
little uneasy with all the adulation that is stock fare at a
political convention. He allowed himself to beam just a bit on
Monday night when his old friend and ally, Gen. Colin L. Powell,
the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, praised him
lavishly from the speaker's podium.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney paid a private visit today to former President Gerald
Ford, who brought him to the White House, and his wife, Betty. He
later attended a lunch honoring House Speaker Dennis Hastert, where
he told the 1,000 attendees that running for vice president ``was
not an assignment I volunteered for'' but one that he accepted
because ``it was an important thing to do for the country.''

A DANCER DISCOVERS   A WORLD OF PROFIT   AND DAREDEVIL FEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By ANN DALY  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb introduced
herself with considered clarity: ``Ten years ago I thought of
myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think of myself
as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments in a show
that I sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Streb, artistic director of Streb, has never been a typical
choreographer. More like a daredevil, she gained recognition in the
mid-1980s for her gravity-baiting feats of physicality using
trampolines, gyroscopic belts and bungee cords. But like a true
postmodernist, she hated music (``too bossy'') and rejected
narrative. Her focus was on the abstract properties of pure
movement _ time, space and the body.
</P>
<P>
   For her new show, ``Action Heroes,'' parts of which will be
performed on Friday and Saturday at Vanderbilt Hall in Grand
Central Terminal, Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a
music-sound score and at least the semblance of a story. During the
70-minute show, the eight performers career through more than a
dozen episodes, including crashing though a pane of glass and
bouncing off walls. Streb has gone Vegas. Or, at least, that's
where she's headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action Heroes'' embeds new and familiar stunts into a
music-video-style format that pays homage to Streb's early
inspirations, like Evel Knievel, the motorcycle showman, Cannonball
Richards (he caught them in his gut) and Annie Edson Taylor, the
first person to survive Niagara Falls in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Action Heroes,'' Streb leaves the dance world behind, at
least in economic terms. Her technical ambitions for its ultimate
development will be too costly for dance venues, so she is turning
to public spaces, commercial ventures and an earned-income business
model.
</P>
<P>
   The company's self-contained metal performance structure, a box
truss nearly 20 feet tall, is considered an exemplar of
market-driven strategies for nonprofit arts institutions by the
Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which financed the portable stage
in 1998. The performance space _ complete with its own lighting,
moving walls, video screens and sound _ lets the company set up
cost effectively in any context. No longer limited to large,
traditional theaters, Streb productions can be marketed to broader
audiences and potentially yield more earned income.
</P>
<P>
   The line between performance and entertainment has blurred
considerably in the last few years. Riverdance, Matthew Bourne's
``Swan Lake'' and most notably the teaming of the experimentalist
Julie Taymor with Disney to produce Broadway's ``Lion King'' have
forged significant links between art and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Streb, herself a hybrid of working class roots and MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grant'' credentials, cites Ringling Brothers
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey, Cirque du Soleil, Stomp, ``Bring In da Noise,
Bring In da Funk'' and Zingaro as precedents. The franchise scheme
used by Blue Man Group, the sly East Village trio that has
organized outposts in three other cities, she says, ``is radical
and very inspiring to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Streb was one of a number of downtown performance artists who
approached the Blue Man operation in the early 1990s, after it had
managed to break through to the mainstream media. Manuel Igrejas,
the press representative for Blue Man and now for Streb, had
learned that the public was ready for exciting new work. ``It was
starved,'' he recalls, ``for entertainment that moved it on a
fundamental level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of artists want to move out of the
not-for-profit zone. I think there is a funding ceiling that can
keep artists at a certain level. It takes a lot of courage to turn
down the beneficence _ which is arduously sought _ of a kindly
Uncle Funder. Blue Man Group has created the template for artists
to be self-sufficient and self-producing, to make work the way they
want to and make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Derfner, president of C.W. Shaver &AMP; Co., Inc., a
consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, agrees. She advises
her clients, including the Paul Taylor Dance Company, to ``start
thinking their way out of the scarcity model of economics that the
not-for-profit management system is based upon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial artists and cultural executives are figuring
out that they produce something with real value in the marketplace
and are taking more control over their destinies,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before Grand Central, Streb was seen on MTV, at Coney Island and
under the Brooklyn Bridge. The company performed during a baseball
game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. Now, she wants to follow Blue
Man, Cirque du Soleil and the new vaudevillians Penn and Teller to
what Igrejas calls the ``new frontier in entertainment'': Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my next dream,'' says Streb, who is 50 and retired from
performance. Las Vegas offers her an appealing scale: more people,
more space, more equipment. ``I am very interested in what I would
make if money were not an issue,'' she says. ``Well, what artist
wouldn't? So right now it's `Las Vegas or Bust.'''
</P>
<P>
   She now conceives of her art as a series of events in public
places, not as a repertory dance company. Public space, she adds,
is not tame territory. During the monthlong residency at Grand
Central Terminal, people wandering or hustling through the hall
gave her instant and uncensored feedback. They told her if they
didn't get it, didn't like it or couldn't believe she got paid for
doing it. The terror of receiving such uninhibited (and
instructive) commentary from complete strangers enthralls her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it's how we look, the unitards and all?'' she
says. ``I try to analyze all of the private symbols and secrets we
employ _ choices we made way back when. They are so automatic that
we don't notice them any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, her artistic goal remains the same: to take her
audiences on a ride, inducing their own physical experiences and
spatial confusion. To ``amaze, even shock, worry and surprise''
them, she says. But not to alienate them. So for ``Action Heroes''
she has integrated video projections and music as narrative devices
to remind the audience that the performers are real people, not
cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like music and need to be told a story,'' Streb says.
``Me, too. It's a welcome relief from having to experience real
work. It's the sherbet moment that cleanses the palate. So I am
using music and story to mitigate the brutality of what we do and
its eventual numbing effect on audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible story _ more associative than narrative _ is
Streb's own story. ``This is the action whence I hail,'' she says.
``The action heroes I emulated as a kid growing up. It was at the
circus that I actually witnessed transgressive, outlawed and untidy
action in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Fortunato's ``video rodeo'' brings Evel Knievel, pole
sitters, monster trucks, Harry Houdini and bull riders right into
the ring. Using a layered mix of live cameras, pure geometric forms
and prerecorded images like old newsreel footage or cloud
formations, Fortunato, a video, installation and performance
artist, evokes the spirit of action heroes past and present.
</P>
<P>
   The projections sometimes function as moving scenery, as when
drifting clouds give the swan-diving dancers an expansive sense of
flight. The images are sometimes referential, as in ``Squirm,'' a
Houdini tribute, which features a clip of the escape artist
wriggling out of a straitjacket. ``All the while I am controlling
his movements live, in time and to the music,'' Fortunato says.
``The result is something like Houdini break-dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The music similarly ranges from the abstract to the emblematic,
including the company's aural trademark: the amplified sounds of
the performers' bodies colliding with floor and wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Streb's free fall into music comes with an immediate caveat. ``I
am not actually interested in music,'' she says. ``Music is the
true enemy of dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer and sound designer, Miles Green, explains: ``Often
music is used to provide propulsion to dance. Elizabeth's movement
has so much thrust that the music has to be carefully constructed
to not get in the way. The score is more about mood than drive.''
He has created a palette of organic and human sounds, taking his
cue from the pioneering daredevils themselves, who ``dealt with
really basic elements: water, air, wood, breath and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Green also uses popular songs to suggest the genealogy of
Streb's action vocabulary. A vintage 1920s recording of ``Happy
Days Are Here Again,'' for example, leads into the pole-balancing
sequence, but then the mood darkens, with composed music that
conveys the drama of the danger-seeking desperados.
</P>
<P>
   By placing the performers in historical context, Streb hopes to
defuse any questions that might distract her spectators. ``If
someone asks, `But why do you dive through the glass?' I have
failed. If the event I construct does not take over the physicality
of the person watching, then it is not an integral enough moment.
Well, perhaps now it will be clear why we do it. We are
transgressive action maniacs and have no other choice but to do the
move right now this second.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We have monthly meetings that have
turned into monthly beatings. Last month two people thrashed me
publicly in the meeting. I informed the department head that if
this happens again, I will leave the meeting. One of the people
complaining at the meeting has a 10-year friendship with the
department head. What do you advise? S.H.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Threatening to walk out of the meeting if the dynamic
duo decides to use you as a punching bag again is simply letting
them continue to get away with this nonsense. The fact is this
behavior has to stop, and that is what you need to tell both
perpetrators as well as your department head. If your department
head cannot bring it to a halt, perhaps there is someone above this
person who can.
</P>
<P>
   The fact one of the perpetrators is a buddy of the manager
certainly does not make this situation any easier for you. However,
the real problem is not the two attackers but rather the department
head. When there are attacks in a meeting, an effective leader
stops them and then follows up with a combination of discussion,
meditation, and counseling to prevent these outrageous acts in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem continues, you should look to senior levels in
the company for help. Unless the topsiders are totally out to
lunch, there has to be someone up there who realizes only weak
leaders tolerate bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was at a party and met someone who would be a great
customer. We hit it off very well, and he told me to call him at
work, which I did three days ago. I left him a voice-mail message,
and he has not called me back. I don't want to seem overeager, but
I don't want to lose this lead. Any thoughts on what to do next?
K.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: You may indeed have met a hot sales prospect at this party,
but you also may have heard little more than the party line. At the
same time, maybe he is a great prospect who is just too busy right
now to get back to you. Or, perhaps his voice mail is broken.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there is no way to know what may be causing the
delay. After hearing nothing for at least three days, you should
call him back. This is not excessive eagerness. Being overeager is
calling more than once a day starting the day after your initial
call.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem is how to get around his voice mail. You can
try calling at off hours, such as in the early morning, early
evening, and weekends, as some people are inclined to pick up their
own lines during these periods.
</P>
<P>
   If he is always shielded by his voice mail, then you should try
to make your next voice-mail message more enticing. If there are
some special programs, incentives, or developments, mention them
without going into too much detail. The idea is to grab his
interest so he will grab the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am going for a job interview at a high-tech company. The
attire there is pretty casual, but I am wondering if I should wear
a tie to the interview. C.K.
</P>
<P>
   \ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: As attire in the workplace has gone casual, the same trend is
being mirrored in job interviews. Even the most conservative firms
are realizing that if they want to attract talent in this tight
labor market, they need to have dress code flexibility, which would
have been unthinkable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going for a job interview in a company that you know
has casual dress standards, you do not need to wear a tie. In fact,
one interviewee for a job in a firm with casual attire was
half-jokingly told by the interviewer that the only question about
his suitability for the job was the fact he wore a tie to the
interview. Of course, one has to wonder about the use of the word
``suitability'' in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean your wardrobe should come from the cast of
``Survivor.'' Try to get an idea of the attire being worn by the
people in the department where you would be working and come to the
interview wearing something that one of the more conservative yet
casual dressers would wear.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's dress codes have little to do with dresses or
codes, if you go to a job interview in a casual setting while
sporting a tie, it's probably not going to hurt you, unless you've
tied it too tight.

 &HT;    FPL competitors unfazed by word of Entergy mega-deal
 &HT;    By Deborah Circelli
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Two out-of-state electric companies
expect heightened competition from the goliath utility that would
result from FPL Group's deal for Entergy Corp., but that isn't
dissuading them from wanting to set up shop in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change our mind to come there. We are still very
interested in meeting the needs of Florida,'' said Rick Rhodes,
spokesman for Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., which along with
Dallas-based Panda Energy has unsuccessfully tried to build power
plants in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is just an example of how quickly things are
moving in our industry,'' Rhodes said. ``Competition is going to
increase as there continues to be a need for additional electricity
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Juno Beach-based FPL Group announced Monday that it intends to
buy New Orleans-based Entergy in a $13.9 billion deal that would
create the nation's largest utility, serving 6.3 million retail
customers in Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to shareholder, regional and federal
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say FPL would benefit from Entergy's skills dealing
with deregulated retail environments in Texas and Arkansas. In
those states, power companies compete for customers. FPL and other
Florida power companies are government-regulated monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to learn from their experiences, and they will
be able to learn from ours,'' said Bill Swank, a spokesman for FPL.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush has appointed a commission to study the power
business in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Panda Energy officials hope FPL's deal will make it more
receptive to opening Florida to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will bring further deregulation enlightenment
to the state,'' said Peggy Striegel, spokeswoman for Panda.
</P>
<P>
   Panda and Duke want to build so-called wholesale plants near
Fort Pierce and Port St. Lucie. Such plants sell power to other
utilities. But they have been blocked by FPL and other Florida
utilities. Panda and Duke, as well as other interested companies,
are waiting to see whether the state Supreme Court will grant a
rehearing on its April decision that state law doesn't allow
wholesale plants.
</P>
<P>
   The FPL-Entergy combination, valued at $27 billion, with more
than 48,000 megawatts of capacity, would be a strong competitor to
Atlanta-based Southern Co., which serves 3.9 million retail
customers in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and the Florida
Panhandle. But a Southern spokesman said Tuesday that FPL's deal
isn't costing the company any sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it as a threat,'' said Mike Tyndall. ``We have a
very focused growth strategy we are implementing. This doesn't
change that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Southern's territory would be flanked by the
combined FPL-Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size, the combined company, which has not been
named, would have more leverage to keep its suppliers' prices down
_ which could help keep customer rates low and make it attractive
in competitive markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination will definitely make them one of the big
players in the South,'' said Marybeth Flater, vice president of
utility research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   William Liggett, an analyst with the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, said increased competition has spurred utilities to
cut costs and consolidate. Since 1992, investor-owned electric
utilities have been involved in 26 consolidations, and 16 more are
pending, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   FPL's stock (NYSE: FPL) rebounded Tuesday, to close up $2.06 to
$50.31 a share. After the deal was announced Monday, the stock
dropped to $48.25, down from Friday's close of $52.81. Entergy's
stock (NYSE: ETR) also rebounded Tuesday, gaining $2.88 to close at
$30.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of uncertainty whether it will get approved, so
as long as this merger is pending, FPL will probably be a flat
stock,'' said Zach Wagner, energy analyst for Edward Jones in St.
Louis, which has downgraded the stock to a hold.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service announced Tuesday it placed the
securities of FPL Group Capital and FPL under review for possible
downgrade while it determines whether FPL's Florida Power &AMP; Light
subsidiary will be able to maintain ``strong cash flow'' under the
new company. The service also said it was changing the ratings
outlook for Entergy's six subsidiaries to positive from stable.

 &HT;    GAY REPUBLICANS SEE KOLBE SPEECH AS VICTORY
 &HT;    By BOB DART and MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Homosexual Republicans rejoiced, but religious
conservative delegates sat in silent protest Tuesday as their
party's only openly gay congressman addressed the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona did not mention sexual orientation in
his three-minute speech on free trade. But gay delegates and their
supporters said his presence on the podium in prime time was proof
that presidential candidate George W. Bush is serious about making
the GOP more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The gay Republicans are also heartened that the GOP presidential
campaign seems to be welcoming Mary Cheney, 31, the openly lesbian
daughter of vice-presidential pick Dick Cheney. She appeared with
her father in the convention hall on Monday night to the cheers of
the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty vivid reminder that gays are part of the
American family,'' said Kevin Ivers, communications director for
the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' David Catania, an openly gay delegate and
councilman from the District of Columbia, said of Kolbe's speech.
``This is something that means a great deal to gay Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But other delegates disapproved of Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to
claim victory for their agenda,'' Texas GOP chair Susan Weddington
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of delegates in the Texas delegation sat with their heads
bowed and eyes closed as Kolbe spoke. One held up a sign saying,
``There is a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform opposes gay marriages, gays in the
military and express legal protection for sexual orientation.
Applause for Kolbe was restrained in comparison to the raucous
reception given to most speakers. The muted reaction was as close
to dissention as the convention has come in two evenings devoted to
showing a new, more tolerant face of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   After years of political rejection, gay Republicans and their
backers said the choice of Kolbe as a convention speaker furthered
the message of inclusion that Bush is sending through the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to see changes taking place at our convention,''
said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
In 1992, there were two openly gay GOP delegates, he recalled,
while this year there are 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party that's trying to expand its base,'' said
Catania, who was among a dozen gay Republicans who met with Bush in
Austin in April. That meeting ended with disagreement on a lot of
issues, he conceded, ``but the governor agreed to keep an open
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great step in the right direction,'' said Fred
Ronstadt, Linda's cousin and a Tucson city councilman whose wife
works on Kolbe's campaign. ``Our party needs to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, Kolbe
stressed he was chosen to speak because of his economic views and
not his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew there was such an interest in trade by the
media,'' joked Kolbe, as TV crews jostled for position in the
packed room. ``I want to thank Governor Bush for sending a message
of inclusion because I had been a McCain supporter.''

   Kolbe, 58, acknowledged being gay in 1996, but has not been an
outspoken activist on gay issues. As chairman of an Appropriations
subcommittee, he has led overseas trade missions. In recent
sessions, he pushed for approval of the North American Free Trade
Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China.

   For the convention, ``he was well chosen to be the spokesman for
free trade,'' said Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md.

SYRIA IS SUED BY FAMILY OF MAN KILLED BY BOMB IN JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family of an Israeli-American man killed in a
1996 terrorist attack in Jerusalem filed suit in New York on
Tuesday against Syria, contending that it provided critical support
to Hamas, the militant Palestinian group whose members carried out
the suicide bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to hold the government of Syria, the Syrian
Defense Ministry and two Syrian officials legally responsible for
the attack in which 24 people were killed, including Ira Weinstein,
a 53-year-old butcher who lived in Israel for the last decade of
his life, and whose family is bringing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The two Syrians are Mustafa Tlass, the defense minister, and
Ghazi Kanaan, the commander of Syrian forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, the Weinstein family says that Syria is liable for
Weinstein's death and the suffering that he and his family endured
because Syria provided Hamas terrorists with ``material resources''
and training to carry out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Other American victims of terrorist acts have won monetary
damages against Iran and Cuba, but have been unable to collect them
because those nations' assets in the United States have been
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Syria has appeared on the State Department's list of
state sponsors of terrorism for decades, the State Department says
it has not been directly engaged in terrorism since 1986. Rather,
it says, Syria gives indirect support, by letting Hamas and other
groups run bases and take refuge in Damascus or in the Bekaa region
in Lebanon, which is under Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   With that decision from the State Department, Syria is not
subject to sanctions as severe as those imposed on Iraq, Iran and
other designated state terrorism sponsors. And trade is permitted
between the two countries. Therefore Syria has assets in the United
States that could be seized if a jury ruled against Syria, the
family's lawyers assert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will prove that Syria has supported terrorist actions
perpetrated by Hamas,'' said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an Israeli
lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Susan Weinstein, Ira's
Weinstein's widow, and their children, Jennifer, 34, Joseph, 31,
and David, 17. ``And we hope to dissuade Syria and others from
hosting and helping terrorist groups by showing them that the price
paid for doing so is far too high.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Syrian Embassy in Damascus denied that Syria
condones or supports terrorism and deplored the killing of
civilians throughout the world. ``We respect human rights and
reject any allegation that we tolerate or sanction terrorism
anywhere,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Weinstein family are seeking $330 million and
punitive damages in compensation for the suffering the family
endured when Weinstein was mortally wounded on a bus that was blown
up by a Hamas suicide bomber in Jerusalem in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ira Weinstein did not immediately die from the bombing,''
states the complaint, provided to The New York Times by the
family's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   With burns over much of his body, severe lung damage, shrapnel,
kidney failure and amputation of both legs, the complaint says,
Weinstein suffered ``excruciating and conscious pain for seven
weeks before dying.'' His daughter, Jennifer, a nurse in the ward
at the hospital where her father was treated, ``witnessed her
father's injuries and agony for the entire seven-week period.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint accuses Syria of providing substantial aid to
Hamas at the time of the bombing, including training, weapons and
explosives storage, safe haven, lodging, means of communication and
equipment and financial services. The lawyers said that Hamas'
involvement in the suicide bombing was later confirmed by Hassan
Salamah, a Hamas member, in statements to an Israeli court that
convicted him of helping to plan the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Miller, co-administrator of the Weinstein estate and
the family's New York attorney in the lawsuit, said the family
filed the suit in state Supreme Court in Nassau County on Long
Island under a 1996 law that permits American victims of terrorism
to sue to recover monetary damages from states that sponsor
terrorism or provide ``material support or resources'' to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   He said the law does not require his plaintiffs to show that
Syria carried out or encouraged the specific bombing that killed
Weinstein, but only that it provided ``material support'' to the
group whose members carried out the act.

 &HT;    Duke bedeviled by a lack of depth
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. - Carl Franks saw life from the other side of the
tracks last year, and he didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, an assistant to Steve Spurrier since 1987, helped coach
winning football teams 12 years in a row. He was offensive
coordinator at Florida for four years before taking the head job at
his alma mater, Duke, last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Devils stumbled to a 3-8 record in Franks' debut
season as a head coach. Franks' brought his own version of
Florida's fun-and-gun offense to Duke, but it didn't turn out being
much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils threw for 2,584 yards but completed only 46.6
percent of their passes. Meanwhile, the rushing game was pathetic,
just 811 yards in 11 games, an average of 73.7 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But Franks isn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what I was getting into,'' he said. ``If
everything was perfect, the job wouldn't have been available. As I
remember, Ohio State and Michigan weren't offering. This was my
shot, and I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks is upbeat about the 2000 season. He will have seven
starters returning on offense, led by senior quarterback Spencer
Romine. When Romine, a medical student with a 3.9 grade-point
average, was healthy, he was outstanding. He threw for 1,638 yards
and six touchdowns in seven games. The trouble was, he missed four
games because of injury. Romine has yet to make it through a season
without injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a very good track record of staying healthy,''
Franks said. ``I just hope we don't have to play three quarterbacks
again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils lost both of their starting wide receivers from
last year. Scottie Montgomery and Richmond Flowers caught 93 passes
between them, so Duke will be inexperienced at wideout. ``It's
tough to run a passing game with question marks at receivers,''
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Moore, who caught 11 passes last year for 113 yards, is
listed as one starter, and Ben Erdeljac, who had 19 receptions for
268 yards, is the other. Duane Epperson, the Devils' leading rusher
with 324 yards in nine games, returns at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Duke finished last in the ACC in total defense and last in
scoring defense, allowing 422.3 yards and 33.0 points per game.
Eight starters from that unit graduated and, of the 11 starters on
the depth chart, eight are underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the mistakes we made last year is we didn't play enough
guys on defense,'' Franks said. ``This year, everybody knows
they're going to get to play more.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks points to the fact that the Blue Devils had a chance to
win several other games. They lost two in overtime and played a
potent Georgia Tech team well in losing 38-31. Their three wins
were all conferenc they beat Maryland, Virginia and Wake Forest,
and the latter two were bowl teams.
</P>
<P>
   But with an out-of-conference schedule that features East
Carolina, Northwestern and Vanderbilt, Duke might have a tough time
winning three this season.

ANALYSIS: THE CAMPAIGN GETS PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The former president had been biting his tongue,
sacrificing his anger to his heir's ambitions. The current
president had been rocking on his heels, letting his disciple fight
his own battles.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with a volley of words that unearthed genuine emotion
amid a contrived spectacle, two leaders who had pledged to let the
2000 election be about the future are demonstrating how much of it
is about the past _ about lingering animosities, dueling legacies,
competing claims to vindication and rivals with the names Bush and
Clinton, not Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on NBC's ``Today'' show Tuesday
morning, former President Bush put President Clinton on warning,
telling him that if he persisted in belittling Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the former president's eldest son, he would be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tempted to get off the reservation,'' Bush told Jamie
Gangel, as he took at least a half-step across the line. ``But I'll
tell you what I'm going to do: I'm going to wait a month. Now, you
give me a call; I'll give you the home number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he continues that,'' he went on, referring to the
president who usurped him, ``I'm going to tell the nation what I
think about him as a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was responding to a swipe that Clinton had taken at the
Texas governor last week, when Clinton said that ``the message of
the Bush campaign is just that, `How bad could I be? I've been
governor of Texas, my daddy was president.'''
</P>
<P>
   But President Bush was also proving how thoroughly he had come
to hover over this race in the last few weeks, pulled back into it
by those who think his memory will do them good and by those who
think his memory will do their opponent harm.
</P>
<P>
   His son's choice of Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary,
as a running mate seemed to mark a kind of turning point in the
Texas governor's campaign. While Gov. Bush had for months kept his
father at a political distance, he now seems to be hugging him
tight. In interviews and conversations with reporters in the days
after he formally announced the selection of Cheney, Gov. Bush
gushed and gushed about Dad.
</P>
<P>
   And Dad himself loped back into the picture, sitting down with
Gangel and sitting front and center at the convention on Monday
night. Nearby was Cheney, who served in his administration. Up on
stage was retired Gen. Colin Powell, another member of the Beltway
brigade who waged the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, has unleashed himself. To rally the Democratic
faithful at fund-raisers over the last few weeks, he has repeatedly
denigrated the man who not only preceded him in the Oval Office
but, as Clinton tells it, left America in shambles in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was in the ditch,'' Clinton said in Boston on
Friday. ``And the politics of Washington, D.C., was like watching,
I don't know, `Wayne's World' or something to most of us who lived
out here in the world, the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the juncture in a presidential election when
each man's heir is supposed to be coming into his own. But the two
presidents are overshadowing the process by giving newly candid,
newly bracing glimpses into how much they dislike each other, an
antipathy that frames how their would-be successors see each other
and sell themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prime-time hour of the first night of the
Republican convention here was largely about Clinton, even though
no one uttered his name.
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Bush, the Texas governor's wife, talked about all the
parents who tell her husband that they want their children to be
able ``to respect the president of the United States,'' the ghost
in that sentence was Clinton, and he was plenty visible to members
of the audience, who cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell said that Gov. Bush ``comes from a family with a
generations-long tradition of public service'' and would ``bring
character and integrity to the Oval Office,'' the obvious point of
contrast was Clinton, not Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Texas governor, campaigning in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, went further and, like his father, took Clinton on
directly, saying that the president's recent insults showed that he
was ``so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore
elected, he'll say anything.'' The subject, yet again, was not a
would-be president's agenda but a will-have-been president's
self-conscious place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides expressed delight at the turn of events, saying
that President Bush's Today show interview rooted out the
bitterness beneath all the sweetness of the convention, disrupted
the intricate choreography and cast the Texas governor as too
feeble to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the whole thing tells people a lot about George
Jr.,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's advisers and supporters agree that the elder Bush is
a window into the younger one, but they have a different take on
what it shows: carefully nurtured values of honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be betting, more and more, that voters will
share that vision: The convention Tuesday night featured a video
tribute to the former president, prominently showcasing his face
and voice. Not so long ago, his eldest son's stump speeches had
only the most oblique reference to him, a line about the Texas
governor being the beneficiary of ``some pretty good training'' for
the office he was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist said that as soon as the Texas
governor hooked up with Cheney, there could no longer be any
pretense that President Bush was not a part of his political
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official who sometimes advises the Bush campaign
said that the Texas governor had reached a point in his campaign
where he had proved his mettle, and that he could now acknowledge
his parents more openly. Polls have shown that a sizable majority
of voters have favorable opinions of the former president and the
former first lady.

HIGH SCHOOLERS GET THE REALITY TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this rate, we'll all end up living in little TV communes,
videotaping ourselves and hoping we're good enough for an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``American High'' serves up the latest batch of
common-folk stars Wednesday, this time high school kids in suburban
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-nominated filmmaker R.J. Cutler (``The War Room'') spent
the 1999-2000 school year supervising two film crews at Highland
Park High School as they chronicled the tumultuous lives of 14
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The kids also got a chance to be auteurs, taping themselves in
``video diaries'' to supplement Cutler's footage.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the first and most pungent impression is made by
the most outspoken and troubled teen in the group, Morgan Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 17 when the school year began, has bedeviled his parents
since infancy _ he calls them ``pricks'' after one family flareup _
and he opens Wednesday night's premiere with a provocative,
profanity-laced tirade.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are years that you are supposed to go (bleeping) wild,
blame it all on your parents or society, not have to suffer
consequences, have unprotected sex, go do drugs, drink alcohol,
watch porno, rent porno movies, get porno magazines,'' he riffs
into his camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Andy Hardy planning a backyard carnival and
struggling to please his stern ol' dad, Judge James Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porno, porno, porno,'' Morgan continues. ``Do whatever the
hell you want. Go pick fights, stay out all night ...''
</P>
<P>
   And then: ``These are your teen years. And what are you sitting
at home having to do? Homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha. After busting out of the opening credits like a runaway
truck, Morgan reveals a softer side by night's end. He finds
contentment working with disabled children. Maybe he won't become a
comedian or movie star after all; maybe he'll end up a
special-education teacher and ``become the people that I dread _ a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler's early focus is also on a gay senior, Brad, awash in a
heterosexual world on Chicago's North Shore; Brad's best friend
Robby, the quiet and reassuringly sensitive captain of the lacrosse
and soccer teams; Robby's younger girlfriend Sarah, who muses that
``I just turned 17 and I've already found the love of my life'';
and Kaytee, a sparrowish senior who writes and trills humorous love
songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a get-acquainted premiere. But Wednesday's hour, the
first show in a seven-week run, does eventually revolve around
eternal teenage themes _ fears, fun and the urgent quest for
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan fears he'll fail to make a splash in the larger world.
Sarah fears she'll lose Robby when he leaves for college. Brad
fears sexual isolation. Anna, a dark-haired beauty, fears she'll
never find a boyfriend. Mike, who calls himself ``Kiwi,'' is a
football star who fears missing field goals.
</P>
<P>
   So ``American High'' pulsates with the painful self-awareness of
late adolescence. Morgan's ``porno, porno, porno'' outburst may
shock, but some things don't change. It's Kiwi, I think, who
reviews his countenance in the mirror one morning and mutters that
``a pimple ruins the day in a teenager's life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American High'' probably won't get the buzz that attends CBS'
contrived ``reality'' contests this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But after succumbing to the TV temptation to smack viewers in
the face to capture their attention, Cutler seems to be on course
to remind us that teenagers think big within confined
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Also that they feel big, aspire big, and are sometimes
dreadfully alone.

KOLBE BREAKS GOP ANTI-GAY BARRIER &HT;    (EDS: Complete writethru: adds quotes, details on Texas
delegation)
 &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep. Jim Kolbe's speech on
international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National
Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he
gave it at all.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz., is the House
of Representatives' only openly gay Republican. His prime-time talk
on trade relations might have gone down as yet another unmemorable
convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly
anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday
objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed
extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second
evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a
Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe told the convention that if elected president, Bush would
expand trade. ``He will work to launch an ambitious new round of
global trade talks, and he will enforce trade agreements and trade
laws,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe
took the podium. Instead, about 10 people from the Texas delegation
removed their signature cowboy hats and bowed their heads in
prayer, holding their hats over their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   One held up a hand-written sign saying: ``There is a way out. We
(love) U.'' Bob Reese, a delegate from Canton, Texas, said he was
``just praying. I believe (in) appeal to a higher authority for
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it. When the Bush
campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee,
you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have
you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,'' he said in an
interview before the speech. ``The fact that it's a non-issue is
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush
campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he
says about being a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of
Kolbe's speech. ``We're pleased with the substance in the platform
on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the
Washington-based Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some
messages better than it's doing.'' He noted that while a gay person
_ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no
anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,''
said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
Republican organization.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before his speech whether there is a future for gays in
the Republican Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is. The
fact that I'm speaking tonight is evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1984 in a district stretching from Tucson to the
U.S.-Mexico border, Kolbe was the Republican point man on the 1993
North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada
and Mexico, as well as other international trade proposals on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he voted with Republicans for the Defense of Marriage
Act, which stated that states are not required to recognize
same-sex marriages performed in other states. The vote prompted a
gay publication, the Advocate, to prepare an article outing Kolbe.
In advance of the publication, Kolbe went to the media and
announced that he is homosexual.
</P>
<P>

MCCAIN SUPPORTS BUSH IN CONVENTION SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADLPHIA _ Arizona Senator John McCain took a giant step in
his long journey back to the fold Tuesday night. The former
contender for the Republican presidential nomination delivered a
convention speech supporting Texas Governor George W. Bush that was
as full of hope and faith in his former nemesis as the senator's
campaign speeches were of fiery disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe patriotism is more than a sound bite, and
public service should be more than a photo-op, then vote for
Governor Bush,'' McCain said. ``I support him. I am grateful to
him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in that audience found it very hard to hear those words,
particularly the delegates who had lost sleep and optimism and
friends over the often bitter primary battle between the two
Republicans. But McCain himself has long said this day would come
if he failed to win the nomination. He always said he would support
the nominee of his party.
</P>
<P>
   And this despite the fact that McCain has long been considered a
thorn in that party's side. During his primary campaign, and long
before, he decried the current system of campaign financing,
accusing both parties of being enslaved to special interests. That,
combined with his sometimes irascible nature, did not endear him to
many of his Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of campaign finance reform, which has defined
McCain for so long, and which earned this veteran Washington
insider a reputation as a truth-telling maverick, was completely
absent from the prepared text of Tuesday night's speech. And while
they might not have liked it, even the most bitterly disappointed
supporters had to concede that, in supporting a candidate he often
said epitomized the worst of modern politics, the Senator was
taking the only path open to him.
</P>
<P>
   But this speech was as much about the future as the past, as
much about improving the Senator's prospects as healing his
breaches. He may long have acted as if he needed no one but voters,
but McCain is in the business of making friends in higher places
these days.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tributes to Bush were sprinkled throughout his speech
on the theme of national security, in which the Arizona Senator and
former Vietnam POW urged Americans to think of themselves as
guardians of the world.
</P>
<P>
   McCain edged a little closer to his provocative themes when he
decried the ``cynicism'' that is ``suffocating the ideals of many
Americans, especially among our young. And with cause, for they
have lost pride in their government.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't name what he has always said is the prime cause of
that cynicism: the corrupting influence of money. His rhetoric on
the issue has always been so clearly directed at members of the GOP
establishment that it would have spoiled Tuesday night's party, and
chipped away at the theme of unity which has become this
convention's organizing principle. And McCain has long known his
political survival depends on his burying the hatchet with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, whether he likes it or not in his deep soul, has
an obligation to do and say all the right things,'' said Richard N.
Bond, former RNC chief and a friend of the Arizona senator's.
``That's his nature and that's his job, to close ranks. It would be
political suicide not to, and McCain knows it, and his top advisers
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will campaign with Bush next week, and later in the year. He
will even have the Texas governor and his wife Laura stay at his
house near Sedona, Ariz. And he will campaign for close to 100
Republicans who hope to keep, or win, Congressional seats come
November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ventures reluctantly into discussions of his prospects
should Bush lose November's election to Vice President Al Gore.
When pushed, he deflects questions about that scenario by saying he
thinks it would be hard to recapture the ``lightning in a bottle''
responsible for his success this time around.
</P>
<P>
   He might be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``To manufacture that kind of excitement two cycles in a row is
difficult,'' said Dean Spiliotes, a political scientist at
Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan built a groundswell gradually over several
election cycles before he became President, Spiliotes said, but
McCain's candidacy was probably more like that of Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot's than Reagan's. The former California
governor gradually became central to his party, he said, taking
control of the establishment. McCain's appeal, like Perot's in
1992, lay in his opposition to that establishment. And, as Perot's
much poorer showing in 1996 demonstrated, that kind of appeal can
be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in case it is not, McCain will have laid the groundwork for
a much stronger candidacy than he had this time: he will likely
start the season with more than three percent in the polls, and he
will probably not have virtually every member of the House and
Senate arrayed against him as he did this time.
</P>
<P>
   And he will still be able to count on people like Bobbie Coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, who watched McCain from the convention floor Tuesday
night, had never worked on anybody's political campaign before she
mailed position papers and made cookies for McCain's. When she
first signed on _ Memorial Day Weekend, 1999 _ McCain was garnering
single digits in the polls, but Coffin said she'd always admired
him.
</P>
<P>
   She watched the first trickle of support grow into the giant
wave that swept McCain to a 19-point win in her state. Coffin and
her son were driving to McCain's victory party in Nashua when the
news came over the radio that he'd opened a double-digit lead over
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' she recalled. ``I felt, `He's launched.
He's on his way.' Nobody will forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pain of defeat in South Carolina, ``a viciously negative
campaign,'' followed less than three weeks later. ``And the rest,''
Coffin said, ``was history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to accept it,'' she said sadly Tuesday.
``We're trying to follow the Senator's lead. Of course we're
disappointed. You can't work like that for a candidate and believe
in him. I can't change horses that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But change horses she did. Like McCain, she is trying to be a
good Republican. Though a handful of the other delegates, from
Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have been loath to give up their
candidate, requiring last minute interventions by McCain aides to
convince them to cast their ballots for Bush, Coffin understood why
she should follow McCain's wishes instead of her heart. She now
sports a ``Straight Talkers for Bush'' pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think he's in an impossible position,'' she said, of
McCain. ``He can't act as others have acted, stamp his foot and
leave the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean she has to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put on a different hat,'' she said finally. ``I'm
not going to pretend it isn't.''

NHIS DEATHS PROMPT NASCAR KILL-SWITCH RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the deaths of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. in similar
accidents eight weeks apart at New Hamsphire International
Speedway, NASCAR officials announced rule changes Tuesday to help
drivers avoid stuck throttles.
</P>
<P>
   While NASCAR has not found any conclusive evidence of the cause
of the two accidents, it was widely thought in the garage area that
Irwin's fatal crash July 7 was the result of a stuck throttle.
Likewise, that was thought to have been the problem in Petty's May
12 crash.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials instructed Winston Cup teams to install a stop
on the throttle assembly of their cars plus an engine-kill switch
on the steering wheel within reach of a driver's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are changes I can't see anybody disagreeing with,'' said
driver Jeremy Mayfield. ``They don't take anything away from the
race cars, they don't affect competition, but they can save you
from a pretty hard crash. You have to applaud NASCAR for taking
steps like these.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this totally solve the problem of a throttle sticking?
Probably not, but this will give the driver something he can do to
help make it less of a problem if it comes up. I'd just as soon
never have it happen, but I feel a little better about the
consequences if it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations, said the safety
measures will take effect Thursday, when teams begin preparations
for Saturday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to look at things, to go through things and talk
to people,'' said Triplett. ``It's a difficult thing to re-create
following an accident what happened because of damage to this piece
of the car and that piece of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   However, said Triplett, discussions with drivers, crew chiefs,
and owners brought a consensus on what changes to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to find something that was effective across the
board and comfortable across the board, these were the two areas
that could be done, and easily be done, before this weekend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, the 19-year-old son of Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty and
grandson of stock car legend Richard Petty, was killed during a
Busch Series practice at Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, 30, of Indianapolis, was killed during a Winston Cup
practice at the 1.058-mile oval, striking the wall in the same
corner where Petty died.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers were said to have been traveling in excess of 150
miles per hour when they entered Turn 3 and were unable to
negotiate it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Andrews, crew chief for driver Steve Park, said at the time
of Irwin's crash that a stuck throttle could have resulted from any
number of circumstances:
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be something on the floorboard, it could be from a
malfunction on the carburetor, it could be something in the air
cleaner. Several things could make a throttle stick; it doesn't
matter where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver Ricky Rudd said he once experienced a similar problem _
but not at NHIS, where the track's configuration (long
straightaways that funnel into tight corners) leaves little room to
react to a stuck throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 'em stick before and it's not like there's a whole
lot a driver can do about it,'' Rudd said. ``If you get off the
gas, you might get the car settled, but it's still going wide open.
You've got to get your foot on the brake, and that's about all you
can do. But when the motor is wide open and you get on the brakes,
though, it doesn't slow you down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mayfield, ``Let's face it, it's not how fast you go, it's
how fast you stop. If you can hit something at a slower speed,
that's got to be good. If you have more time when you're having
problems _ say you're aimed at the wall or something like that _ to
correct it a little bit, then this is a good thing. Even if you hit
at a better angle, then that's got to be good, too.''

PROTESTERS INCREASE EFFORTS TO DISRUPT GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Scores of protesters were arrested in a running
cat-and-mouse contest with police across downtown thoroughfares on
Tuesday as they sought to disrupt the Republican National
Convention with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The evening rush-hour traffic was turned into gridlock around
City Hall as hundreds of young demonstrators, some of them masked
with bandanas, blocked a main entrance of the interstate highway
and strutted as they pleased at key points in the city, clogging
intersections with only selective interference from police.
</P>
<P>
   With the city intent on maintaining an upbeat convention gleam,
the police clearly worked to avoid the sort of full-scale,
baton-wielding clashes with street demonstrators that occurred last
winter at the World Trade Organization conference and blackened
Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly
worked to steal the media spotlight and create street scenes of
nonstop political protest.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, 3 miles away, remained unfazed. But delegates
increasingly watched the local TV coverage of protests out beyond
their meeting through the slower parts of their pro-forma agenda.
Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around
protest-clogged streets to reach the convention arena in South
Philadelphia. But none were heard demanding a more hard-edged
response from city authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that more than 100 people had been taken into
custody and that four officers were injured and 20 patrol car
windows smashed during the day of increasing disruption. A score of
demonstrators, chanting denunciations of capital punishment, were
arrested after blocking the westbound entrance to the interstate
Vine Street Expressway north of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching!'' they screamed, echoing the
protest of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators on the chaotic streets
around the Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the police seemed well aware of who was watching.
They carefully read arrest warnings three times, then gingerly
arrested the sit-in demonstrators while five news helicopters
hovered overhead and a platoon of reporters and photographers stood
within a few feet of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors representing a score of causes seemed energized by
the day, the most tense and chaotic thus far in the convention
week. They vowed to extend their street tactics further over the
next two days in the downtown blocks around major convention
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' one delegate angrily muttered outside the
Doubletree Hotel south of City Hall as his path was momentarily
blocked by a swirl of demonstrators, police and news workers tying
up Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just rebels without a cause,'' declared Erik Lipson, a
38-year-old resident with tickets for the evening convention
session. He watched a two-hour standoff at Broad and Spruce Streets
between police and protesters and was ultimately branded
``bourgeoisie'' by one demonstrator. ``A bunch of spoiled suburban
kids,'' Lipson continued as demonstrators attracted more and more
attention. ``Not a single poor person in that line.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union charged that the police
precipitated the uglier street mood on Tuesday by raiding a West
Philadelphia warehouse where protestors were preparing props and
puppets for passive resistance demonstrations planned for Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The police, to the contrary, said the warehouse was raided
because it was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal
disruptions of the convention week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet
gloves to show the iron fist,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director
of the state ACLU. He referred to the contrast between the
increasing tensions Tuesday and the scene Monday when police chose
to escort rather than confront an illegal march of welfare
protestors for 3 miles down Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the
police said it was necessary. At the same time, Presser deplored
reports of some demonstrators resorting to vandalism and setting
trash fires as they raced through the streets. ``The whole city
loses if this situation deteriorates,'' Presser warned.
</P>
<P>
   For all the day's traffic disruptions, there was no large-scale
property damage and no outright clashes between the police and the
main clots of protestors as they marched and darted to different
points in the city.

GOP SAYS THEY'RE ABOVE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING, BUT NOT ABOVE
COMPLAINING ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For all its focus on a nicer, blander image,
there is one thing the Bush campaign wants to be negative about _
negative campaigning from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush complained about attacks on
Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney ``coming out of
the bowels of the Democratic National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, Ohio, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the prospective
Republican presidential nominee, said, ``Americans are sick and
tired of the politics of tearing people down.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, W.Va., the governor said, ``This nation is
looking for an administration that will appeal to our better
angels, not our darker impulses. This nation does not want four
more years of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi told a youth
group at the Republican National Convention, ``We're not trashing
our opponents, we're not looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monday night the prospective nominee's wife, Laura Bush,
told the convention her husband ``sets a tone that's positive and
constructive, a tone that is very different from the bitterness and
division that too often characterizes Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said this
consistent message was not derived from polls or focus groups, but
from the candidate's ``heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But a prominent Republican operative, Frank Luntz, said it
matched the strategy his focus groups dictated.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said, ``Voters don't like political attack dogs, and they
have complained for two decades about the negativity of politics.''
Only now, he said, were they beginning to vote against sponsors of
negative ads. So, he added, ``Once you destroy the messenger, you
destroy his message.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the first Democratic ad attacking
Cheney's voting record in the House over Head Start, the school
lunch program and the Clean Water Act seemed to work against Cheney
among independents.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication here at the University of Pennsylvania, said, ``I
think they misunderstand what the electorate believes to be
appropriate campaigning.'' She added, ``If the public believes it's
accurate, the likelihood is that because it's a low-key ad, the
public is likely to accept it as legitimate campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said the tactic of negative
campaigning against negative campaigning depended on the original
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes back to the charge. If you prove the charge is false,
then negative campaign against negative campaign is fine. But if
the charge is true and relevant, all the bellyaching and all the
campaigning cannot hide one's voting record.'' In this case, he
said, ``they are a squealing extra loud on something they have no
way of refuting.''
</P>
<P>
   But while his arguments matched the general line, there was a
singular intensity to former President Bush's comments, made on
NBC's Today show in an interview that was tape recorded late on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He called the criticism of Cheney, his former secretary of
defense ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to say when you get a great, outstanding
choice like Cheney, who's widely respected?'' he continued.
``They've got a carping _ they've got a little minion sitting there
with their dark glasses, you know, digging up dirt on someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want that anymore. But let them try. Cheney's
much bigger than all that, more proven than all that. And if
something ever happened to George when they were elected, he'd make
an outstanding president of the United States. So I don't worry
about that opposition research crowd digging. `Hey, look what I
found,' some little nerd sitting there in the Democratic National
Committee. It doesn't make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, responded, ``It
tells you a lot about George junior that he has to send his father
out to defend himself.'' He said, ``Someone's record is a
legitimate issue. It's hardly improper to criticize someone's
record.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that Bush was no innocent when it came to negative
campaigning, noting that his first defense of Cheney, was a hostile
comparison to President Clinton. Bush said of Cheney, ``He's a man
who understands what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Clinton's evasive testimony in August
1999, when prosecutors asked him whether he was lying in January of
that year when he denied there was any sex in his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush's campaigning against what he calls
``Clinton-Gore'' is not blunt _ or as direct as the advertisements
about Cheney's votes or Bush's record on health care in Texas _
there is nothing deeply subtle about the governor's constant
pledge: ``When I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only
uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor and
the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me
God.''

CONVENTION DIARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the convention podium, Colin Powell launched a salvo at
monied special interests. On the street, the police massed loudly
in expectation of protesters against all manner of capitalistic
evils.
</P>
<P>
   But in elegant Rittenhouse Square, where lobbyists and
politicians gathered Tuesday afternoon, an eight-piece swing band
drowned out the noise, and white tents insured that the business of
business could carry on uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of you can vote for me,'' a Senate candidate from Nevada
announced to the crowd during a break in the music, ``but your
checks will surely be welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatism by night, liberal lobbying by day.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA-Palooza! was thrown by the financial services industry
to honor members of Congress who helped win a vote on increasing
retirement account limits. But it was like scads of other parties
and receptions given by those with policy interest (and money) and
those who seeking policy advice (and money).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you six words why you should back me with your faith
and your financial support,'' Paul Rappaport announced confidently.
``I'm running against Paul Sarbanes.'' No rolls of coins came
flying his way, but he said his appeal to help defeat Maryland's
veteran Democratic senator has struck a chord at other receptions
he's gone to this week. ``People are just handing me checks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech Monday night, Powell contrasted some
Republicans' criticism of affirmative action ``that helped a few
thousands black kids'' with their silence on ``affirmative action
for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with preferences for
special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists bravely brushed off the flesh wounds. ``It was a nice
rhetorical flourish,'' said Steve Bartlett, the president of the
Financial Services Roundtable. ``But it's mixing two issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Various business representatives pointed out that raising IRA
limits was supported by legislators in both parties and by millions
of working people around the country. ``I don't believe I represent
a special interest,'' said Bruce Thompson, a Merrill Lynch vice
president for government relations. His company did sponsor a few
other parties this week, not to mention its contribution to the
Philadelphia host committee organizing the convention.
</P>
<P>
   One of those parties it helped organize honored the House
commerce committee ``which just happens to have jurisdiction over
the financial services industry,'' he said. ``Just as an aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Asides aside, none of the lobbyists were willing to take on
Powell, by name. ``I'm not here to get any glory,'' explained one
lobbyist. Not that any was going around.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, the high priestess of the right wing and the
anti-abortion movement, has been to every Republican convention
since the last one in Philadelphia in 1952. Boy, were they a sight
better in the old days, she says. This one is a snoozefest,
according to Schlafly, looking trim and ready for action at 75,
wearing plastic pearls the size of gumballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is boring, boring, boring,'' she complained over coffee
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1952, Eisenhower was seven or eight votes away from the
nomination. No one knew who the vice president was going to be. It
was terribly exciting. There were floor fights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ... '' she sighed, waving her hands dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   As that was not bad enough, she said, convention hall security
confiscated a set of knitting needles two days ago from Gail
Ruzicka, a staff member for Schlafly's Republican National
Committee For Life, had her knitting confiscated two days ago.
Security guards worried the needles were dangerous, Schlafly said.
``So they snapped them in half and ruined her knitting,'' Schlafly
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent is so rarely heard among the Republican delegates that
you would think it's barred by local ordinance, both inside and
outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates have each been given written instructions to stick
to happy talk when speaking to reporters. The mandate is not to
attack anyone, even Al Gore, and to relentlessly praise George W.
Bush's talents as a unifier.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanie Bonner, an alternate delegate from East Hartford,
Conn., just couldn't help herself.
</P>
<P>
   Although she dutifully hopped on the Bush bandwagon, Bonner said
she wished her man, John McCain, were giving the acceptance speech
on Thursday night instead of Tuesday night's defense policy
address.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner said that if he were the nominee the convention would
surely have a different feel. ``We'd have so much more of a
cross-section of people in terms of race and class,'' she said,
looking out over a sea of delegates that is 98 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   The attack-free zone also extends to the booths selling
convention memorabilia. In Houston in 1992 and San Diego in 1996,
the hottest-sellers were anti-Clinton buttons, books and T-shirts.
In Philadelphia, these items are hard to come by. One of the only
negative buttons on display at the Pennsylvania Convention Center's
political bazaar, where most delegates are buying their convention
goodies, was a 1952 ``Let's Clean House With Ike and Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the tables were covered with sedate, black Bush-Cheney
buttons, emblazoned with American flags. Way in the back, there
were a few lonely anti-Hillary T-shirts and stop Gore buttons.
</P>
<P>
   A 1960 thank-you note from Mamie Eisenhower, priced at $300,
drew a larger crowd of shoppers on Tuesday afternoon than a booth
filled with copies of Barbara Olsen's ``Hell to Pay,'' one of
several recently published anti-Hillary tracts.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the Republican afterlife? Whatever it is, it
must have something to do with steak and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Or so Tuesday's birthday lunch for Alfonse D'Amato, the
loquacious former senator from New York, seemed to prove.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato celebrated his 63rd birthday at Mortons steak house
Tuesday, on Philadelphia's Walnut Street. Among the first guests to
arrive was Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential candidate,
who has parlayed his presidential bid into a career touting
treatment for erectile dysfunction and who Tuesday night was
scheduled to begin his career as a political commentator on Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   After giving D'Amato a manly hug, Dole asked: Have you broken
any furniture yet?
</P>
<P>
   A passel of D'Amato's former senatorial colleagues were on hand
to fete him, as well as New York Gov. George Pataki, who was once
D'Amato's protege.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski shouted from the back
of the room: ``We miss you, Al!'' It looked for a moment as if
D'Amato might burst into tears. Murkowski shouted again: ``And we
miss Mama D'Amato! D'Amato's mother is known for her terrific
Italian cooking. D'Amato brightened. Then he shot back: I'll send
her down with Lazio!''

MCCAIN SUPPORTS BUSH IN CONVENTION SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Arizona Senator John McCain took a giant step in
his long journey back to the fold Tuesday night. The former
contender for the Republican presidential nomination delivered a
convention speech supporting Texas Governor George W. Bush that was
as full of hope and faith in his former nemesis as the senator's
campaign speeches were of fiery disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe patriotism is more than a sound bite, and
public service should be more than a photo-op, then vote for
Governor Bush,'' McCain said. ``I support him. I am grateful to
him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in that audience found it very hard to hear those words,
particularly the delegates who had lost sleep and optimism and
friends over the often bitter primary battle between the two
Republicans. But McCain himself has long said this day would come
if he failed to win the nomination. He always said he would support
the nominee of his party.
</P>
<P>
   And this despite the fact that McCain has long been considered a
thorn in that party's side. During his primary campaign, and long
before, he decried the current system of campaign financing,
accusing both parties of being enslaved to special interests. That,
combined with his sometimes irascible nature, did not endear him to
many of his Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of campaign finance reform, which has defined
McCain for so long, and which earned this veteran Washington
insider a reputation as a truth-telling maverick, was completely
absent from the prepared text of Tuesday night's speech. And while
they might not have liked it, even the most bitterly disappointed
supporters had to concede that, in supporting a candidate he often
said epitomized the worst of modern politics, the Senator was
taking the only path open to him.
</P>
<P>
   But this speech was as much about the future as the past, as
much about improving the Senator's prospects as healing his
breaches. He may long have acted as if he needed no one but voters,
but McCain is in the business of making friends in higher places
these days.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tributes to Bush were sprinkled throughout his speech
on the theme of national security, in which the Arizona Senator and
former Vietnam POW urged Americans to think of themselves as
guardians of the world.
</P>
<P>
   McCain edged a little closer to his provocative themes when he
decried the ``cynicism'' that is ``suffocating the ideals of many
Americans, especially among our young. And with cause, for they
have lost pride in their government.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't name what he has always said is the prime cause of
that cynicism: the corrupting influence of money. His rhetoric on
the issue has always been so clearly directed at members of the GOP
establishment that it would have spoiled Tuesday night's party, and
chipped away at the theme of unity which has become this
convention's organizing principle. And McCain has long known his
political survival depends on his burying the hatchet with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, whether he likes it or not in his deep soul, has
an obligation to do and say all the right things,'' said Richard N.
Bond, former RNC chief and a friend of the Arizona senator's.
``That's his nature and that's his job, to close ranks. It would be
political suicide not to, and McCain knows it, and his top advisers
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will campaign with Bush next week, and later in the year. He
will even have the Texas governor and his wife Laura stay at his
house near Sedona, Ariz. And he will campaign for close to 100
Republicans who hope to keep, or win, Congressional seats come
November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ventures reluctantly into discussions of his prospects
should Bush lose November's election to Vice President Al Gore.
When pushed, he deflects questions about that scenario by saying he
thinks it would be hard to recapture the ``lightning in a bottle''
responsible for his success this time around.
</P>
<P>
   He might be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``To manufacture that kind of excitement two cycles in a row is
difficult,'' said Dean Spiliotes, a political scientist at
Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan built a groundswell gradually over several
election cycles before he became President, Spiliotes said, but
McCain's candidacy was probably more like that of Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot's than Reagan's. The former California
governor gradually became central to his party, he said, taking
control of the establishment. McCain's appeal, like Perot's in
1992, lay in his opposition to that establishment. And, as Perot's
much poorer showing in 1996 demonstrated, that kind of appeal can
be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in case it is not, McCain will have laid the groundwork for
a much stronger candidacy than he had this time: he will likely
start the season with more than three percent in the polls, and he
will probably not have virtually every member of the House and
Senate arrayed against him as he did this time.
</P>
<P>
   And he will still be able to count on people like Bobbie Coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffin, who watched McCain from the convention floor Tuesday
night, had never worked on anybody's political campaign before she
mailed position papers and made cookies for McCain's. When she
first signed on _ Memorial Day Weekend, 1999 _ McCain was garnering
single digits in the polls, but Coffin said she'd always admired
him.
</P>
<P>
   She watched the first trickle of support grow into the giant
wave that swept McCain to a 19-point win in her state. Coffin and
her son were driving to McCain's victory party in Nashua when the
news came over the radio that he'd opened a double-digit lead over
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' she recalled. ``I felt, `He's launched.
He's on his way.' Nobody will forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pain of defeat in South Carolina, ``a viciously negative
campaign,'' followed less than three weeks later. ``And the rest,''
Coffin said, ``was history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to accept it,'' she said sadly Tuesday.
``We're trying to follow the Senator's lead. Of course we're
disappointed. You can't work like that for a candidate and believe
in him. I can't change horses that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But change horses she did. Like McCain, she is trying to be a
good Republican. Though a handful of the other delegates, from
Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have been loath to give up their
candidate, requiring last minute interventions by McCain aides to
convince them to cast their ballots for Bush, Coffin understood why
she should follow McCain's wishes instead of her heart. She now
sports a ``Straight Talkers for Bush'' pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think he's in an impossible position,'' she said, of
McCain. ``He can't act as others have acted, stamp his foot and
leave the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean she has to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put on a different hat,'' she said finally. ``I'm
not going to pretend it isn't.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - In a ballroom, in a museum and behind the closed
doors of hotel rooms, two Georgia Republicans with senatorial
ambitions began a Southern game of ``chicken'' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. senator and ambassador Mack Mattingly and aviation
entrepreneur Lewis Jordan met face-to-face, then sent lieutenants
to work in efforts to persuade the other guy to drop out of a Nov.
7 special election to challenge newly named U.S. Sen. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``In four days, we'll have a decision. Anybody can run. But all
of us know if we're going to hold the Senate seat, it's going to be
one of us. It can't be five of us. It can't even be _ possibly _
two,'' said U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood introduced Jordan, a political neophyte and founder of
ValuJet Airlines, to Georgia delegates at the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told them he would bring two essential qualities to the
race: a fresh face and $3 million of his own money. ``You need to
know that I'm prepared to do things in a big way,'' said the
56-year-old major shareholder in AirTran Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The race, officially nonpartisan, will determine who will fill
out the term of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell. A tribute to the GOP
leader, who died of a stroke last month, was held at a downtown
Philadelphia art museum on Tuesday, amid jazz, wine and full-length
portraits of George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican contenders for Coverdell's seat attended the
tribute Tuesday afternoon and huddled in a backroom in a meeting
arranged by Mattingly. It was his third conversation with Jordan
about the race, Mattingly said, but he was not successful in
persuading the newcomer to leave the field.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican chairman Chuck Clay confirmed he had polled
some of the party's executive committee by phone, and they
indicated a preference for ``the fresh face'' _ Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jordan-Mattingly meeting, Clay appeared increasingly
resigned to the fact that he might not be able to accomplish the
difficult task of unifying the party behind one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not going to have just one Republican, why not have
four or five?'' the state chairman said. Some Republicans have
argued that a larger field increases the likelihood of a runoff, in
which it might be easier for a survivor to pick off Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying starts today and ends Friday. Jordan intends to be
among the first to sign up, said delegate John Sours of Smyrna, a
Jordan supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly said he plans to remain in Philadelphia at least one
more day.
</P>
<P>
   While Mattingly and Jordan say they're in the race to stay, core
supporters say the ballot isn't big enough for both, if Miller, a
Democrat, is to be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   So the Philadelphia gathering of Georgians has become an
unofficial primary for a ``unity candidate'' _ one of the few
unscripted stories arising from the presidential nominating
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much support that one candidate will receive from the
national party is somewhat in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the race against Miller an uphill fight, Sen. Mitch
McConnell , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said, ``I'm not committed to funding any race that's not
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's morning appearance was for many Republicans their first
look at the businessman, and his reception was not as hearty as the
one given Mattingly a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan brought with him the endorsement of half of Georgia's
Republican congressional delegation. In addition to Norwood, Reps.
John Linder, Saxby Chambliss and Mac Collins have lined up behind
Jordan. Norwood said they would make the case for their favorite
over the next four days.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Bob Barr and Jack Kingston have declared their support for
Mattingly, who stood in the back of the hotel ballroom as Jordan
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   After approaching Jordan to shake hands, Mattingly, 69, spent
most of his day speaking one-on-one to delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nathan Deal and Johnny Isakson have not publicly backed
either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was met by a crush of reporters and TV cameras when he
left the delegation meeting. The former airline executive was
circumspect when it came to discussing issues and asked for a
two-day grace period before he laid out specific positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure when I first articulate to you my positions,
what I believe in, that I state it precisely,'' he said. Jordan
briefly described himself as a ``Coverdell'' Republican and a major
fund-raiser for the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.). But he readily acknowledged that he has given financial
support to Democrats as well, including U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one who can claim to be a real, no-kidding, fresh
face in politics who can bring some new electricity to this, and a
willingness to significantly fund my campaign,'' Jordan said.
``I've seen nothing in the last few days that tell me that I should
do anything other than (run).''

NON-NEWS EVENT MAY BACKFIRE ON REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The broadcast networks have not given the Republican Convention
one minute more than they have to, and they are absolutely right.
The most telling television image, after all, has been that of
Peter Jennings against a blank blue screen. As he has several times
during ABC's coverage, Tuesday night Jennings gave audiences full
disclosure that whenever he looks as if he is in a skybox, he is
really in a small room on the convention floor, projected against
video of the crowd outside the room.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's head of special news events, Marc Burstein, explained that
this not only saved the network several hundred thousand dollars,
by not converting their skybox to an anchor booth; it also allowed
their anchor to report from the convention floor, then scoot
quickly to a more peaceful interview space.
</P>
<P>
   But the blue background conveys more than anyone intended. The
void behind the anchorman is the perfect symbol for the nothingness
that the networks have been embarrassed into dropping by to cover,
and that the all-news cable channels have blanketed, with deadly
dullness. Even for those of us fascinated by politics, Tuesday
night was the perfect time to catch up on that rerun of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican Conventions are such acknowledged
non-news circuses that Dan Rather on CBS, using a popular cliche
attached to this convention, called it an ``infomercial.'' Politics
has become show business, so the networks are reviewing the show,
and analyzing message it means to send. Tuesday, Jennings, in his
daily e-mail to viewers of ``World News Tonight,'' defended the
coverage in just those terms: ``The challenge is to see the way the
party presents itself, and try to get you at home to match the
image with the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever scraps of enlightenment there were came from poking
holes in the slick packaging. Most conspicuously, every channel and
nightly newscast contrasted Monday's minority-loaded Republican
show with the overwhelmingly white make-up of the convention
itself. And Tuesday night, planned by the Republicans as National
Security Night (there's a catchy show title) was full of women,
offsetting any possible macho tone. The speakers included
Condoleeza Rice, the African-American woman who is George W. Bush's
foreign policy adviser, Elizabeth Dole and a ``surprise''
appearance (widely reported in advance) by Barbara Bush. On cable,
there was enough hot air to knock a viewer unconscious. Tim
Russert, on MSNBC, heralded the importance of Tuesday night's
speakers by speculating that if Bush wins, Rice might be his
national security adviser. (Or not.) This is surely the
find-the-silver-lining approach to an non-event. PBS, the only
broadcast network to offer full evenings of the convention this
week, was just as soporific.
</P>
<P>
   The dullness of the Republican show may justify the networks'
near absence, but that doesn't let them off the hook. Viewers are
being shortchanged, not because they are missing the convention,
but because no one replacing that lost prime time with more
substantial, inventive ways to report on the campaign. NBC,
offering less broadcast time than the other networks because it has
complete coverage on its cable channel, MSNBC, is pointing to the
future. But that idea is a bit premature; networks still reach a
far larger audience than cable and the much-hyped internet
combined. Campaign coverage on the network evening news programs is
down 33 per cent from the 1996 campaign, according to a study
released this week by the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   What is left has been shunted to the margins, to the morning
news and Sunday talk programs. In fact, look beyond prime time and
you see how the Republicans' careful convention planning has
backfired. John McCain may have lost the nomination but he has
gotten a victor's share of air time, almost dominating the past
three days as he gave interviews (NBC's ``Today,'' CNN's ``Larry
King Live'' and the ``CBS Evening News'' only begin the long list)
leading up to his prime-time speech Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But speeches themselves seem backward looking in this age of the
soundbite. Many anchors expressed nostalgia for the old days (four
years ago) when the roll call of states voting for the nominee took
place in one long session. In a quaint way, the roll call was fun
to watch, but it belongs to a time when there was such a thing as a
captive television audience. Today, a flick of the remote can send
viewers from a Schwarzkopf speech to ``Seinfeld,'' which means no
one has to sit still for silver-lining coverage.

IS BUSH'S CAMPAIGN FOR BLACK VOTES A SUBTLE APPEAL TO WHITE
SUBURBANITES? 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Tuesday night, for the second night in a row, one
of the principal speakers at the Republican National Convention was
a black person. Tuesday night, it was Condoleezza Rice, the chief
national security adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas; on
Monday night, it was Colin Powell, who may be secretary of state if
Bush is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this was no happenstance. In this convention, whose
sole mission is the glorification of Bush, happenstance just
doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Equally obviously, neither Rice nor Powell was on the dais as
window-dressing. Both are eminent figures, whose success in the
academic and military worlds speaks volumes about the achievements
of black Americans in the last couple of decades. But there was
window-dressing as well, in the form of black singers, black
choirs, black candidates for lesser offices and black children
seated at school desks in the rather contrived backdrop to the
speech of the prospective nominee's wife, Laura, a former
schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   The question occurs, what is all this about? Granting that Bush
has demonstrated in his brief political career a considerably
greater sensitivity to minority concerns than the average
Republican, what political purpose lies behind the image-making?
</P>
<P>
   Does he really think he can do better among blacks than his
father, who took 12 percent and 10 percent of the black vote in
1988 and 1992, respectively, and better than Bob Dole, who took 12
percent in 1996? Or is it a three-cushion shot, a subtle play for
the votes of white suburbanites, a pivotal voting block that
includes many voters for whom civil rights remains a high priority?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no chance of getting any significant African-American
vote,'' said David Bositis of the nonpartisan Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies. ``This is not even about that. It's
about the suburbs, and about moderate swing voters all across the
country. There's no better way to distance himself from Tom DeLay
and Dick Armey and the other hard-liners in Congress than showing
that he's friendly to blacks and Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the cold facts are these: The Democrats are a
multiracial party, with large numbers of blacks in leadership
positions. The Republicans are largely a monoracial party. Since
World War II, only three African-American Republicans have been
elected to Congress, including Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said bluntly that there was widespread ``cynicism in the
black community'' towards the Republican party, based in part on
its opposition to affirmative action, reaffirmed in this year'
platform. He challenged the Republicans to reach out to blacks and
other minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``And not just during an election-year campaign,'' he continued.
``It must be a sustained effort. It must be every day. It must be
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he thought Powell was right and acknowledged that ``we
have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats expressed skepticism that it would ever get done.
Speaking at the Shadow Convention here in Philadelphia, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson praised Powell but said that his speech was part of a
``sham.'' Noting that this is a largely white convention _ only 4
percent of the delegates are black, about the same as in 1972 _
Jackson added, ``You got Powell making speeches but you got Trent
Lott making policy'' _ a reference to the Senate majority leader, a
conservative from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium of television networks and The Associated Press, Bush
took 27 percent of the black vote in his re-election contest in
1998. That may have been a exaggeration of his true strength,
because his Democratic opponent, Tony Mauro, was never seen as a
viable alternative. Bush did much less well against Ann Richards in
1994, winning 15 percent of the black vote then.
</P>
<P>
   During this year's campaign, he made a point of appearing before
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
something Dole declined to do four years ago. But in the South
Carolina primary, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona was pressing him
hard, Bush was unwilling to condemn the flying of the Confederate
battle flag on the statehouse in Columbia, and he campaigned at Bob
Jones University in Greenville, which banned interracial dating at
the time of his speech there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also described Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia,
dyed-in-the-wool conservatives whose very names are anathema to
many blacks, as model Supreme Court justices, even though Thomas is
himself black.
</P>
<P>
   To many African-Americans, those actions seemed of a piece with
Richard Nixon's southern strategy, which built a lasting base for
the Republicans among Southern white voters. It was not explicitly
anti-black, but it was grounded in racial apprehensions. Ever
since, the GOP has had, to a greater or lesser degree, a white
southern core, and its leadership on Capitol Hill has been and
still is largely southern.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, has emerged as the most popular
president among African-Americans since Lyndon Johnson, who signed
the Voting Rights Act, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who espoused
their cause in the depths of the Depression. When Clinton's
fortunes were at their nadir, during the acrimonious impeachment
battle in the House, blacks were among his staunchest advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends see him as a kind of God,'' said a black
Republican delegate here, who asked that his name not be used.
``Some of that rubs off on Al Gore, and it makes Bush's job in
November terribly difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken between July 20
and 22, suggested how difficult a job the governor faces in
courting black votes. In a two-way race, Gore won the support of 84
percent of African-Americans to Bush's 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush signaled Tuesday that he was confident of doing better
than that. As he wended his way toward Philadelphia, he was asked
whether he was discouraged to see so few black faces in the crowds
at his rallies, even after Monday night's multiracial television
production. He answered, ``We'll see on Election Day, won't we?''
</P>
<P>
   At a first glance, blacks would seem to be ripe for conversion
to Republicanism. In nationwide telephone surveys conducted by The
Times and CBS News since 1976, between a quarter and a third of
black voters have described themselves as conservatives, but only 6
percent to 11 percent have described themselves as Republicans.
Even making allowances for those who use the word ``conservative''
in its social rather than political sense, and apply it to
themselves because they are regular churchgoers, for example, the
Republicans should have an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, moreover, more and more blacks have reached the
middle class, have moved into prosperous suburbs and have joined
the professions. According to a new study called Black America
2000, the income levels of black households have tripled in the
past 24 years, and the number of black-owned businesses more than
doubled in number between 1987 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When other groups have undergone such changes, significant
numbers among them have migrated to the Republican party. But so
far, that pattern has not held for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, things are going well for Bush among white
suburbanites. The same Times/CBS poll showed him well ahead of the
vice president among that group, 52 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Bositis and a number of Republican tacticians suggested,
Bush's real aim in appealing to blacks is to solidify his support
among white moderates, he would not be the first Republican nominee
to try that ploy. In 1980, Ronald Reagan made much of his
endorsement by the civil rights leaders Ralph David Abernathy and
Hosea Williams. His black support barely budged; but that was not
the point, as one of his strategists, Richard Wirthlin, later
explained. The target, Wirthlin said, was white suburbanites.

CIVIL SUIT AGAINST EX-LEADER OF BOSNIAN SERBS UNDER WAY IN NEW
YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trial of a civil lawsuit against the former
leader of the Bosnian Serbs began in a federal courtroom in
Manhattan on Tuesday with a witness fainting on the stand as she
described her captivity, rape and torture during the Balkans
conflict in the summer and fall of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a Bosnian Muslim, told of being dragged from her
house by soldiers, including a former neighbor from her town in
northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   She said the men, who wore photographs of the Bosnian leader,
Dr. Radovan Karadzic, told her she was being singled out because
she was a Muslim. They took her and her two young children to a
mountainside shack, she said, where they locked her inside and
repeatedly raped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not resist, I could not fight against them,'' the
witness, a woman identified as N.S., testified. ``I could not
resist because the others were holding me while my children were
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic has been indicted for genocide by the international war
crimes tribunal in The Hague but has not been apprehended and is
believed to be in hiding in Bosnia. Although neither he nor his
lawyers appeared in the courtroom Tuesday, they submitted documents
vigorously contesting the right to hold a civil trial in the United
States for offenses the plaintiffs claim were committed overseas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The woman testified that her abductors ``started slapping me in
the face, saying there was nothing and no one to save me, ever.''
She added: ``It was their state and they could do as they pleased.
There was no way for me to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   While tales of atrocities have become familiar in accounts of
the conflicts during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the
testimony Tuesday was among the first heard on the subject by
American jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in 1993 on behalf of a group of
women and children, seeks millions of dollars in damages from
Karadzic, who the plaintiffs say masterminded a campaign of
genocide, rape and torture in the area in the early 1990s. Lawyers
for the women said that in addition to experts and witnesses to
more widespread violence, 11 witnesses were expected to testify to
attacks made against them.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, the case has moved from the U.S.
District Court to the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, as lawyers
for both sides argued whether U.S. courts could exercise
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The courts ruled that the case could be brought in the United
States under federal laws against torture, and under a 1789 law
allowing damage claims made for offenses against ``the law of
nations or a treaty of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Judge Peter K. Leisure of the U.S. District Court
entered a default judgment in the women's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Maria T. Vullo, one of the lawyers representing the women, said
Tuesday that although ``the case obviously has an important message
in it,'' her clients fully intended to collect damages from
Karadzic's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in Manhattan, which is expected to last about two
weeks, will determine the amount of money he will be ordered to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Karadzic did not return telephone calls. But in a
letter to the court written in 1997, Karadzic rejected the U.S.
courts' ability to sit in judgment on his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you really hope to find truth, or do justice, or protect
rights of people in distant nations?'' Karadzic wrote. ``Do you
really believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy
around the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a
step toward peace or justice?''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Karadzic said he would ``have to look to history,
or to courts with real access to the events, the witnesses,
documents and the parties for my vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has offered $5 million for information on
the whereabouts of Karadzic and several other wartime leaders
accused by the war crimes tribunal.

CAR SALES RISE, EXCEPT AT GM AND CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said on Tuesday
that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to
reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks
and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers
announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not
quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk
enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force
in the American economy during July.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some signs of moderation, although the industry is
running at a healthy pace,'' said Bill Lovejoy, GM's group vice
president for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark M. Cornelius, an auto statistician in West Olive, Mich.,
calculated on Tuesday evening that sales rose 2.1 percent from a
year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.2 million cars
and light trucks. He used estimates for sales of Mazda, the only
automaker not reporting Tuesday. The auto industry sold 17 million
vehicles last year, its best ever.
</P>
<P>
   GM posted a 2.6 percent drop in sales for July from its record
level a year ago, as a 22.8 percent jump in sales of small Saturn
cars failed to offset weak sales of minivans, small pickup trucks
and large sport utility vehicles. Paul Ballew, GM's sales analysis
director, blamed inadequate factory production for the weaker sales
of large sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said sales fell 12.2
percent in July, dragged heavily by a 29 percent plunge in sales of
minivan sales, a market segment that Chrysler essentially invented
in 1983 and has dominated ever since. Chrysler will unveil
redesigned minivans later this month and in early September, and
customers have proved loath to buy the older models, despite
increasingly lavish rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep sales dropped 15 percent and sales of Dodge Durango large
sport utility truck fell 3 percent. But Americans continued to snap
up Chrysler PT Cruiser small vans as fast as the company could
build them.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the year, automakers seek to keep a 60-day
inventory of vehicles at dealerships and on the way to dealerships.
But at the end of July, when they are phasing out old models, they
would prefer somewhat smaller inventories of 55 to 58 days.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GM said late Tuesday afternoon that its supply of
unsold cars and light trucks equaled 68 days of sales. Chrysler
said that it had a 78-day supply. Both automakers said that they
did not have separate inventory figures Tuesday for cars and for
light trucks, which encompasses minivans, sport utilities and
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Chrysler both had very large inventories of light trucks
and small numbers of cars at the end of June. Nicholas Lobaccaro,
an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that the two companies'
sales and production figures in July suggested that this pattern
had persisted, particularly at GM, and that the companies' overall
inventory figures masked huge backlogs of minivans, sport utilities
and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their car inventory is too low, but you don't make any money
on cars, and their light truck inventory is too high, and you make
money on light trucks,'' he said. ``You just can't go forever
building more than you sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler officials acknowledged that their large inventories
reflected an enormous supply of minivans. That situation stems at
least partly from the company's determination not to run out of
minivans this year as it did in 1995 when it shut its two minivan
factories for nearly three months to retool them for a new
generation. Chrysler ran short of minivans, posted a huge quarterly
loss and watched as many loyal customers deserted to rival brands.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Chrysler built lots of extra minivans in the spring
and figured out a way to convert one factory over to the new model
in two weeks this summer and the other in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first factory is now in production and cranking out the new
minivans quickly while the old models are selling slowly. James
Holden, Chrysler's chief executive, said last week that discounts
would be needed to dispose of the older models.
</P>
<P>
   GM's inventory is more complicated. In a telephone conference
call with reporters Tuesday afternoon, Ballew, the sales analysis
director, dismissed widespread rumors in Detroit that GM was about
to slow output at some factories because of excessive inventories.
The automaker's supply of vehicles looks large only in comparison
with last summer, when the company was short of many models, he
said. He added that the industry's sales might slow slightly next
year with weaker economic growth. Gas prices have had little affect
on sales, Ballew said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford announced on Tuesday that its sales inched up six-tenths of
1 percent from an extremely strong performance a year ago. The
company had roughly a 50-day supply of cars and about a 60-day
supply of light trucks at the end of July, said George Pipas, a
market analyst at Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign automakers fared better in July. Honda had its best
month ever in the American market as sales rose 11.6 percent, led
by strong results for the Civic compact car, the Odyssey minivan
and the CR-V small sport utility vehicle. Mitsubishi's sales jumped
28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's sales climbed 4.8 percent, while Toyota's sales
crept up 1 percent and Nissan's sales edged up by two-tenths of 1
percent.

MAJOR RECORD LABELS MOVE TO OFFER THEIR MUSIC ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At least three major record labels plan to begin
selling songs over the Internet in a subscription format by the end
of the year, enabling users to listen to or download a range of
tracks for a flat fee, a move which may fundamentally change the
way recorded music is packaged.
</P>
<P>
   An executive from EMI Recorded Music said on Tuesday that the
label expects to have a subscription service available by the end
of September. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment
should have a similar service in place by the end of the year, said
Bruce Hack, vice chairman at Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be getting in with a subscription model by the end of
the year,'' Hack said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' statements came on the same day Universal
announced it will begin selling individual songs online for
downloading. Starting later this week, the label will make 60 songs
available on a dozen affiliate Web sites for $1.99, a price that
includes the song, images of the artists and text of the lyrics.
The songs are sold in an encrypted format that Universal says will
prevent anyone but the purchaser from listening to them.
</P>
<P>
   Other major labels are involved in similar trials, including
EMI, which recently began selling 100 albums for downloading on
July 18 from music retail sites. But critics of the industry
consider the efforts an insufficient, desperate scramble to catch
up with an underground Internet music economy they say threatens to
pass the record labels by.
</P>
<P>
   The labels, critics point out, are selling a handful of titles
online for $2 or so a song, while some 20 million people who have
downloaded the software of Napster, the embattled online music
start-up, are exchanging hundreds of thousands of songs free. Last
week, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction ordering the
effective shutdown of Napster, which the recording industry accuses
of contributory copyright infringement. But an appeals court panel
on Friday stayed the injunction pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, record companies have suggested a
subscription service might borrow heavily from the look and feel of
Napster, offering Internet users a search engine to find songs to
download, but effectively adding a cash register, and with the
songs encrypted to prevent their free and unfettered exchange.
</P>
<P>
   This would be distinct from a pay-per-song model in which users
pay to download or listen to tracks on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal said they were
exploring a subscription model. Hack said the subscription service
planned to launch by the end of the year will be a product of that
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many issues are unresolved, Samit said. For example,
he said the labels need to go back to artists and rewrite their
contacts to permit their music to be included in a
subscription-based service.
</P>
<P>
   One record industry executive said the contractual issues aside,
the labels would likely only have to make 5,000 to 10,000 of their
200,000 title libraries available to meet consumer demand, which is
concentrated among a few artists.

 &HT;    ``DANGEROUS'' HOSPITAL BEDS LACK STANDARDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death certificates have a grim sameness going
back a decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, usually a woman over age 60, rolls over in a
hospital or nursing home bed and becomes entrapped in the space
between the side rail and mattress. Too frail or too disoriented to
free herself, she suffocates.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 200 people, and almost certainly many more, the
beds that were supposed to protect them turned into death traps.
Dozens more people have been seriously injured when they tried to
climb over the railings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who first began to recognize the problem in the
early 1990s, have issued warnings and advisories to the nation's
health care facilities. But they have yet to establish safety
standards for the beds and railings.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the frustration of experts in the field, deaths and
injuries have continued.
</P>
<P>
   In the period between the first safety alert issued by the Food
and Drug Administration in August 1995 and late May of this year,
federal records show at least 28 deaths across the country. Florida
and Minnesota had the most, with four reported deaths each.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety commission has also recorded
dozens of injuries, including more than 30 cases during the first
five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The actual numbers are thought to be much higher, since federal
reporting rules are laxly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that were reported, a 74-year-old woman in Sunrise,
Fla., became wedged between the bed rail and mattress and was
asphyxiated in June of last year. A 78-year-old man in Minneapolis
died after his head became trapped between the mattress and side
rail last December. And in 1997, a 29-year-old woman in Lubbock,
Texas, was found suffocated in her home after she became stuck
between the mattress and rail of a hospital-type bed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the alarm over hospital beds and side rails is
perplexing to families of patients, said Sarah Burger, an advocate
for nursing home residents. ``There's been an acceptance that bed
rails were there for safety,'' she said. ``There's been a lot of
rethinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But not enough, according to Burger, who works with the private
National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. She noted
that the federal government set standards more than 25 years ago
for cribs to keep infants from trapping their heads between the
side rails.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade after problems surfaced for the elderly,
government agencies are still debating what to do about hospital
beds and even who bears the responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bed frame and rails are labeled ``medical devices,''
they are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).
</P>
<P>
   However, the mattresses are often the major contributing factor
in these tragedies. Facilities often buy replacement mattresses
that are too small for the bed frames, leaving a gap where patients
can become trapped and asphyxiated. And because mattresses are not
considered to be medical devices, they fall into the domain of the
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the issue, an inter-agency federal working
group was set up 15 months ago that includes FDA officials, Health
and Human Services Department officials, and private experts as
well as industry representatives. No members from the safety
commission were included.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we've mostly been focused on the bed and bed
design,'' said Joan Todd, an FDA consultant who is working with the
working group. She said that ``it is our intention'' to seek help
from the safety commission later.
</P>
<P>
   The working group has no target date for proposing new safety
standards, Todd said. She blamed the slow progress on a lack of
funding and added, ``I think they're doing a great job, because all
these people are volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   A former member was more critical. ``The FDA panel was supposed
to come out with a final report in December of last year,'' said
Dr. Steven H. Miles, a geriatrics professor at the University of
Minnesota, who is credited for being one of the first to spot the
dangers of hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eight months later, and these deaths have been occurring
for a very, very long time,'' he said. Miles, who left the panel
for an unsuccessful race for the U.S. Senate, accused manufacturers
of ``having an undue influence'' in delaying action.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would be hard pressed to identify another device that has
caused (as many) deaths where the industry has not been forced to
come up with a design modification,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said many facilities are taking more precautions, but he
traced the improvement more to recent lawsuits by angry families
than to government efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pioneering attorneys in this area, Jeff E. Rusk of
Austin, Texas, four years ago won a $900,000 award and promises of
reform from a New Mexico nursing home, plus $4.5 million from the
bed manufacturer, Everest &AMP; Jennings of Earth City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Rusk later reached a settlement that reduced the bed maker's
payment in exchange for a promise to send out thousands of warning
letters to customers detailing the potential dangers of using rails
for weak or confused patients and urging the use of more padding.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas attorney has also taken the case of 71-year-old Sarah
Hitz, who died at Boca Raton's Manor Care nursing home in November
of 1996. The lawsuit in Palm Beach County's Circuit Court charges
the nursing home with ``gross negligence'' for allowing her to
become trapped in her bed rails.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by her son, Alexander Hitz of West Palm
Beach, cites two prior such incidents in the chain of more than 300
facilities run by HCR-Manor Care Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the case but said
that the company's current policy is to perform ``an assessment on
all patients'' and use side rails only when ordered by a physician.

VENEZUELA PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL CRUSH POLITICAL FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ President Hugo Chavez said Tuesday that he
would use troops to crush street protests and to remove an
opposition party governor who has accused the governing party of
fraudulently altering the outcome of elections last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be nothing more than a little spat, but we
are obliged to guarantee order and prevent these groups from
spoiling the beautiful process that we have concluded,'' Chavez
said Tuesday afternoon, referring to the vote held across Venezuela
on Sunday. ``If they lost, they lost,'' he added dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from the national and local balloting, in
which Chavez and 165 members of a new National Assembly were also
elected, gave victory to the incumbent governor in the western
state of Merida, William Davila, a leading opposition figure. But
6,000 ballots, most cast for Davila, were declared invalid for
reasons that are still not clear, and the pro-Chavez candidate was
declared the winner Tuesday, by a margin of less than 1,800 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there was a fraud, which the people of Merida
reject,'' Davila said in remarks broadcast on national television
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidates in five other states also made similar
accusations about fraud in their races. Preliminary results had
given Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition 12 of the 23
governorships at stake in the election in this oil-rich nation of
23 million people, but Tuesday afternoon Chavez said that his
candidates had actually triumphed in 16 states and warned that he
would not tolerate ``anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are consolidating our victory, and as in any battle, you
have to fight for every inch of territory,'' he said. He minimized
the protests as ``a mob with a few rocks and sticks'' and said that
``four or five canisters of tear gas ought to get them out of
there,'' referring to the government offices where Davila has taken
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two international observer groups, one led by former
President Jimmy Carter and the other sent by the Organization of
American States, had pronounced the balloting here clean and fair.
Sustained opposition complaints of fraud in the tabulation of votes
began in earnest only Tuesday, though, after the observer groups
had begun to close down operations here.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup
attempt in 1992, announced the dispatch of troops Tuesday afternoon
during a three-hour news conference at which he also discussed
issues ranging from his government's foreign policy to his plans to
reactivate the Venezuelan economy. His most significant comments,
though, came in a response to a question about oil prices, which
have recently soared to near-record highs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Venezuela has been the leading supplier of the
oil imported by the United States, and the country's energy
minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, was designated president of the
Organization of Oil Exporting Countries, or OPEC, this spring.
Chavez made it clear that he was delighted with the jump in oil
prices and reiterated his position that he sees no reason to take
any action to bring them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just defending our position,'' Chavez said. ``It's not
that prices are high. They are fair and just.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the oil bonanza, Venezuela's economy contracted by more
than 7 percent last year, and now that the election is over, Chavez
is under pressure to take steps to end that recession.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated his admiration for the Cuban and Chinese
revolutions, saying those countries' economies ``have good things''
and have produced social benefits. But he then added that it is not
his intention to ``try to import models from abroad,'' and said
that his own revolutionary government welcomes foreign investment,
so long as it is ``productive, not speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a skeptic about U.S. policies in the region, Chavez
expressed concern about the $1.3 billion emergency aid package for
neighboring Colombia that President Clinton approved last month. He
said that while his government is ``willing to cooperate'' with
Colombia and the United States, he hoped that the military aid
would ``not be used to Vietnamize the Colombia conflict'' or
contribute to an increase in the fighting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope this doesn't happen,'' he said. ``We are paying
close attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez reserved his most critical comments for his domestic
opposition, saying that some of his adversaries ``refuse to
recognize Chavez as president'' and warning that he will not
hesitate to use his expanded powers to bring them to heel. ``If
they don't understand that or don't cooperate, we will apply the
constitution to them,'' he warned.

PRICELINE IS SELLING $190 MILLION STAKE TO INVESTORS  
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal as complex as his patented method of selling airplane
tickets, Jay S. Walker, the founder of Priceline.com, agreed
Tuesday to sell $190 million of his shares to Paul G. Allen's
Vulcan Ventures and John C. Malone's Liberty Media Group.
</P>
<P>
   The sale can be seen as quite a loss for Walker. Last November,
he bought 2.1 million Priceline shares from Delta Air Lines for
$59.93 a share. Now he has agreed to sell 8 million shares at
$23.75 each. After taxes, he said, he will wind up with about $125
million, which he will invest in Priceline's WebHouse Club, its
affiliate that sells groceries and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   After this sale, Walker will still own some 50 million shares,
worth about $1.2 billion. But those shares were worth six times
that in April 1999, about a month after Priceline's initial public
offering. And the stock has been in free fall since March _ sliding
from $104, to $23.625 Monday. On Tuesday, however, the share price
rose $1.31, to $24.94, as investors considered the deal a vote of
confidence by Liberty and Vulcan rather than as a bearish signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not taking the money and running,'' said Mark J. Rowen,
an analyst with Prudential Securities. ``He's putting it back into
WebHouse.'' Rowen had downgraded Priceline's stock last week
because he was concerned that the company's grocery business was
not growing fast enough to compensate for the slowing growth in its
travel sales.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, notable for its ubiquitous advertising featuring the
labored crooning of William Shatner, allows customers to name their
own price for airline tickets, hotel rooms and an increasing number
of other products.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he was reluctant to sell his shares at this low
price and that he had held off completing the deal with Vulcan and
Liberty in hopes that the market would be buoyed by Priceline's
second-quarter earnings, which were released last week. Despite an
operating loss that was only a penny a share better than analysts
had expected, the company's shares continued their decline.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase by Liberty and Vulcan is organized as a forward
sale in that Walker receives the payment now, but he does not
deliver the shares to Liberty or Vulcan for a year or two. That
way, investors can be assured that the shares will not be sold in
the market the moment that Priceline's stock ticks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want the market to feel I was putting pressure on
Priceline's shares,'' Walker said. ``The last thing that
Priceline's stock needs is more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The effective price Walker is receiving is less than $23.75,
because he also granted Liberty and Vulcan an option to buy an
undisclosed portion of his share in Walker Digital, a company that
is devoted to thinking up and patenting new ideas for businesses.
The options give Liberty and Vulcan the right to buy the shares
from him at a price that values Walker Digital at $1.5 billion to
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who has accumulated a portfolio
of companies involved in the Internet and cable television, already
owns about 5 percent of Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, a tracking stock of AT&AMP;T, is an independent investment
vehicle of Malone's that owns interests in a number of media and
technology companies, including smaller stakes in Priceline and
WebHouse.
</P>
<P>
   While WebHouse appears to be an integral part of Priceline,
linked to its Web site and using Shatner as a spokesman, it is
owned by Walker, Walker Digital and a group of investors. Priceline
owns no shares in WebHouse, but has an option to buy a controlling
interest.
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse, in many ways, is far more elaborate and expensive to
build than Priceline itself, because customers bid for products on
the Internet, pay for them with a credit card, then pick them up at
stores and gas stations with a special card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as complicated as Visa,'' Walker said. ``We are
building a system that connects 80,000 cash registers in 7,000
stores. Last week we priced 2 million grocery items. I'll do that
for 100 million transactions next year.''
</P>
<P>
   WebHouse has already raised $200 million from a group of
investors and is currently raising another $145 million, including
Walker's $125 million. Walker said that the company would need to
raise more money before the system was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, WebHouse is meant to offer manufacturers an
alternative to paper coupons to get potential customers to try
their products. But while it has many of the biggest supermarket
chains participating, leading manufacturers like Procter &AMP; Gamble
and Lever Brothers have not. As a result, WebHouse is selling goods
for less than it pays for them.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rowen, the analyst who downgraded Priceline's stock,
argues that selling $2 jars of peanut butter for $1.50 may just be
smart. ``Priceline is not a typical consumer business,'' he said.
``Their model is they first have to get the consumer demand. Then
they sell the demand, in essence, to the highest bidder.'' &QL;

NEW YORK'S GIULIANI ENDORSES RICK LAZIO FOR SENATE AT REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani behaved like a good
Republican Tuesday as he went to a fund-raiser for Rep. Rick Lazio,
held a joint news conference with Lazio and gave interviews to two
networks _ all while attending his first national political
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very strongly support Rick Lazio and urge everyone that at
least wants to listen to me to vote for him,'' Giuliani said at the
joint news conference, which lasted 10 minutes. Later, at the
fund-raiser, which the mayor attended with his friend, Judith
Nathan, Giuliani thanked the crowd for ``supporting Rick and for
making certain that I don't have to spend the last year that I'm
the mayor of New York City with Hillary as the senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the mayor who had endorsed a Democrat for
governor _ Mario Cuomo _ and then barely endorsed a Republican for
president _ Bob Dole _ showed such disdain for his party's national
convention in San Diego that he was not even invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't allow Gov. Wilson to speak, haven't allowed Gov.
Weld to speak, and they tried to constrict Pataki's remarks to such
a degree that he didn't want to speak,'' Giuliani told reporters at
the time, referring to the Republican governors Pete Wilson of
California, William Weld of Massachusetts and George E. Pataki of
New York. ``So I think I made the right choice in terms of sticking
to my job and trying to do the best I can to be really a mayor that
reaches out to both political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani withdrew from his Senate race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton in May after announcing that he had prostate cancer
and was seeking a separation from his wife, his appearance here
Tuesday _ as a New York delegate _ suggests that he has not ruled
out running for office again. And although he is still distrusted
by many in the New York state Republican party, he has nonetheless
spent the last two and a half years traveling across the United
States to raise his political profile in the national party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his advisers have said he has always had his eye on the
presidency, while others say that what he really wants is to run
for governor of New York in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Giuliani said he believed his place in the
world of Republicans had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, I didn't know an awful lot of people,'' he said at
New York City Hall on Monday. ``Now I probably know people from at
least more than half the states that I've worked with, done things
with, that I've helped, that have helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Republican convention allowed him to ``get
them all in one place'' to say thank you to such helpers, and that
``several of these events allow you to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what events Giuliani was talking about was unclear,
since his aides at City Hall have declined to say when the mayor
arrived at the convention Tuesday, whether he will be staying
overnight and what events he may be attending.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was expected late this afternoon at a party given by
the dress designer Nicole Miller at her boutique in central
Philadelphia, but had not turned up by 5 p.m., although his former
communications director, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, had. Miller is
a political supporter of Giuliani and a friend of both him and his
estranged wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani grew testy when reporters asked on Monday about his
plans for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy myself, have fun, and I'm going to have you
leave me alone as much as possible,'' he said. ``And you'll see me
when I want you to see me, and not when I don't want you to see
me.''

ANALYSIS: FOR 2000, THE GOP SEES EDUCATION IN A NEW LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seated in a mock classroom in front of the stage, 20 children
banged out a beat on their desks, chanted multiplication tables and
rapped, ``Read, baby, read.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprising opening night symbol for the Republican
National Convention, which just four years ago called for the
abolition of the Department of Education and declared public
schools all but beyond repair. Now, Republicans are not only
embracing children and classrooms _ long icons of Democratic
political imagery _ but are also talking about how the federal
government can ensure equity in educational opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a remarkable transformation going on,'' said James
Guthrie, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University.
``We are very slowly, awkwardly, hesitantly, reluctantly, lurching
toward a national system of education.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican and Democratic parties rush to respond to
polls that show education is a top concern for voters, the
distinctions between their positions are fading. Having chosen as
their presidential candidate the governor of a state that has been
among the leaders in education reform efforts in the past decade,
the Republicans find themselves with a strong hand on the issue for
the first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas accepts his party's
nomination this week and fleshes out details of his education
agenda this fall, he must grapple with an internal contradiction in
his Republican philosophy: How can education be a national priority
while remaining the responsibility of local governments?
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans in Congress have long tried to curtail federal
financing for schools or provide money in block grants rather than
for specific programs, Bush has proposed withholding money from any
state that does not administer annual achievement tests and break
out the results by students' race and class. He also wants to
expand financing for Head Start, a popular target for Republicans
opposed to federal involvement in education, and start a $5 billion
national reading program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush believes that his experience reforming education in Texas
can be refracted on the whole country,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr.,
an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.
``In his view, the federal government is sort of like a magnifying
glass _ it takes energy originating elsewhere and focuses it and
concentrates it.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the shift in the Republican Party is a natural
outgrowth of the movement by governors and business leaders over
the last decade to improve student achievement through rigorous
standards and high-stakes testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coalescing around the standards agenda has brought the
parties a lot closer,'' said Susan Fuhrman, director of the
Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``You can go from state to state and look at the
reforms and be hard pressed to tell whether there was a Democrat or
Republican governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The change was fueled by the failure of the Republicans'
anti-public schools message in 1996. Shortly after that election,
Bush worried aloud at a meeting of Republican governors that the
Democrats' dominance on education had cost his party crucial votes
among women, announcing, ``Republicans must say that we are FOR
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in education has only escalated since; even among the
conservative delegates at the Republican convention, a quarter
named education as a top priority, compared with 2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal government providing only about 7 cents of
every dollar spent on education, a president's influence on the
issue comes largely from the bully pulpit. Exhibit A was making
education the theme of the convention's first night.
</P>
<P>
   But what is even more striking is that the Republicans,
including Bush's wife, Laura, chose not to talk about school choice
and vouchers that allow parents to use public money for tuition at
private schools _ issues that separate them from the Democrats _
but to focus on standards and accountability, topics on which the
two parties largely agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last I checked, there are no Republican kids and
Democratic kids,'' said David Levin, co-founder of the Knowledge is
Power Program, the school in Houston whose students were
spotlighted Monday at the convention. ``We're hoping that we get
invited to do the Democratic convention as well.''

 &HT;    McCain, Ohio's DeWine foster support for Bush
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican National Convention belongs to
George W. Bush, but Tuesday provided one final opportunity for
Ohio's Mike DeWine and thousands of other John McCain supporters to
cheer on the Arizona senator who, however briefly, rocked both the
Republican establishment and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that John McCain's running
made George Bush a better candidate, a stronger candidate. We get
tougher, we get stronger usually when we deal with adversity,''
DeWine, Ohio's senior U.S. senator, said as he prepared to hear
McCain address the convention Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has urged his followers to fall in line behind Bush.
Americans don't like sore losers, McCain has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, from Cedarville in Greene County, has taken McCain's
advice with a vengeance. He campaigned this week with Bush both in
Cincinnati and Dayton as the Texas governor made his way to the
convention through battleground states he will need to carry in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is the kind of person who should be in the White
House. He is a man of integrity and a man of honor,'' said DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, of course, did not always shower Bush with such
accolades as they battled through New Hampshire, South Carolina,
Michigan, Ohio and other states in pursuit of the nomination Bush
will claim this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the harsh rhetoric that remains with DeWine, one
of only four Republican senators to endorse McCain.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is the reception that McCain _ the Navy pilot who
was shot down in the Vietnam war and survived brutal beatings in
prison to emerge as a political leader _ received from other
veterans who thronged to see him along the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most memorable scene was watching the older
veterans. They came up to him and they had tears in their eyes,''
said DeWine. ``They really connected. They connected in a very
nonpolitical way.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other scenes worth remembering, too, said DeWine. At
a bookstore in the suburban Cincinnati, hundreds of McCain fans
lined up for McCain to sign copies of his book, ``Faith of Our
Fathers.'' McCain signed them all, DeWine remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform, McCain's signature issue, is not part
of the Republican platform. DeWine did not even support the McCain
version of finance reform. McCain's effort, however, provided the
party with a needed reminder, said DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the messages that people got from all of this
is that our party should stand for reform, should stand for change.
That's not a bad thing to say, that you're the party of Theodore
Roosevelt,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, the loyal political soldier, has joined other
Republicans in heaping praise on Dick Cheney, the former Wyoming
congressman and defense secretary, whom Bush picked as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, also would have been a good choice for that
job, said DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would have been a good idea,'' DeWine said.

 &HT;    CHRISTIAN COALITION CHEERS PAT ROBERTSON WHO BLASTS EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT, CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By ALAN BERNSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Countering the conciliatory mood of the
Republican National Convention, speakers at a Christian Coalition
of America rally here Tuesday denounced pop culture, the U.S.
Department of Education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelist and commentator Pat Robertson, founder of the
coalition, also asserted that the organization has been wrongly
written off as a force in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of reading stories saying the Christian Coalition is
dead,'' Robertson said. ``We're just warming up, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, one of several Republican
officeholders who addressed the audience as warm-up acts for
Robertson, revived a phrase that often fills GOP strategists with
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, stoked by applause from about 1,800 people packed
into a hotel ballroom, criticized violence in the mass media and
urged religious voters ``to engage in the great cultural battle for
the soul of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the 1992 Republican convention in Houston,
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan declared ``a religious war .
. . for the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Buchanan's rhetoric was so corrosive
that it damaged efforts by President Bush and the Republican Party
to win over moderate voters. The 1992 speech is being cited here
this week as the type of approach the GOP has abandoned in its push
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the 2000 election is no time to be dainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a convention of sweetness and light,'' he said.
``Nobody wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Robertson said, he wants the nation to know that, for
example, he doesn't want his tax money spent on ``dirty pictures or
Planned Parenthood.'' It was an apparent reference to federal
funding for the arts and for sex education.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson called for the dismantling of the Education
department, saying he could do a better job with the agency's money
by educating children through private, religious projects.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush made sure that the party dropped its
long-running call for the department to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan,'' Robertson said. ``I
think they should do away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky rocked another boat
Tuesday in his role as the Senate's leading foe of legislation that
would place further limits on the way candidates and parties
finance their campaigns with contributions from individuals and
special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear the three words `campaign finance reform,' some
liberal is trying to shut you up,'' McConnell said. ``No matter how
you dress up that turkey, it still won't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation would blunt the Christian Coalition from
pooling its financial resources to ``amplify'' its messages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain's advocacy of campaign finance reform
boosted him into the runner-up position in the Republican
presidential primary won by Bush. The issue is getting sparse
mention, if any, from the podium of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond discussion of their favorite issues, the ``Faith &AMP;
Freedom Celebration,'' which featured patriotic music, was the
Christian Coalition's assertion that it remains relevant to the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bush is a born-again Christian who opposes
abortion and is running on a ``pro-family'' agenda shows that the
coalition is on the verge of its goal to have such a person in the
White House, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told the audience that the media
have declared the death of groups such as the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was any more religious right, if you read
the press,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it has weakened, the coalition has faded from the
scene partly because Robertson, a 1988 candidate for the GOP
presidential nomination, has taken a relatively quiet approach to
this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than get behind a single candidate for this year's
nomination, such as conservative Gary Bauer, Robertson told
reporters in early 1999 that Bush, Elizabeth Dole and several other
candidates all seemed acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he also agreed with Bush's effort to soften the GOP
image by applying the ``compassionate conservative'' label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought conservatism had to have a hard edge,'' he
said then.
</P>
<P>
   Rice University professor William Martin, author of a book on
the evolution of the religious right, said groups such as the
coalition have become pragmatic and less raucous while continuing
to represent about a sixth of the national electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the religious right was overestimated, and now it
is being underestimated,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The rally conducted by the Christian Coalition during the 1996
Republican convention in San Diego was a roomier, outdoor event
that drew about 1,000 more people than Tuesday's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas convention delegate at the rally, Myrna McElroy of
Gonzales, said this year's convention has not muted the voices of
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Citing religious-oriented musical entertainment and video
presentations at the convention, McElroy remarked, ``I think this
convention is showing me that godly people are going to be involved
in the selection of our leaders.''

MCCAIN LEADS SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story will update.) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain shed his rebellious image to
play the admiring party stalwart at the Republican National
Convention Tuesday night, commending Gov. George W. Bush to
independents and Democrats and _ addressing one of the governor's
most pronounced vulnerabilities _ saying he would ably defend the
nation's interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him,'' McCain said in his prepared remarks, trying
to erase tensions from a primary battle that had been so raw that
McCain waited two months to reluctantly endorse Bush. ``I am
grateful to him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech anchored an evening whose overarching objective
was to assemble several faces, old and new, to assure the national
viewing audience that Bush could be trusted on the international
stage despite his failure to serve in Vietnam and the fact that, by
his own admission, his foreign policy experience does not stretch
beyond Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the chorus in the other high-profile speech was
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser who,
as an African American, also underscores Bush's pledge to put
minorities in consequential roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George W. Bush I know is a man of uncommonly good
judgment,'' Rice, a national security council official in former
President Bush's administration, said in her prepared remarks. ``He
is focused and consistent. He believes that we Americans are at our
best when we exercise power without fanfare or arrogance. He speaks
plainly and with a positive spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches were testimonials to the personal ability McCain,
Rice and the other speakers perceived in Bush, but offered little
on specific policies or countries.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to shore up Bush's record, a cavalcade of
speakers reminded the public of Republican presidents like Ronald
Reagan and George Bush who were known for eliciting respect for
America abroad and for their emphasis on national security.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war, appeared via satellite from a battleship,
reminding the convention that ``10 years ago tomorrow, Iraq invaded
Kuwait.'' He asked: ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces,
and for America, if we could have another commander in chief named
George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago who was wounded
in World War II, asked the audience to ``join me in saluting the
greatest generation of veterans and every generation of our armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who had a starring role at the convention in
1996 when she spoke reverentially of her husband, said that
``timeless values form our first line of defense.'' Bush, she said,
``will put an end to the smash-mouth politics of recent years and
to the name-calling that tarnishes our trust and alienates so many
real people whose real problems can never be solved in a focus
group or soothed by a spin doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the theme of military might, there was a video
tribute to World War II veterans and a musical medley of military
service anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's popularity afforded him the freedom to play to a broader
audience outside the hall by giving a speaking slot (albeit not in
prime time) to an openly gay congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, who spoke about international trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all the way there with our party,'' Kolbe, speaking
of his party's policy toward homosexuals, said on ``Political
Points,'' the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ``The
Democratic Party isn't all the way there yet either in terms of its
treatment of minorities and other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gauzy, smiling images of moderation from the stage,
there were stirrings of resentment among some conservatives who
voiced concerns that the convention did not truly reflect their
views. At a crowded Christian Coalition rally at a downtown hotel,
delegates seemed thrilled to hear some of the conservative, red
meat rhetoric missing from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a convention of sweetness and light,'' Pat
Robertson, the coalition's founder, declared to the crowd. ``Nobody
wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the evening was clearly dominated by McCain. The Bush
campaign's decision to give a vanquished rival such a prominent
role on the second night of the convention marked a striking
departure from the last several Republican conventions. At the
convention four years ago, the prized Tuesday night slot was given
to then Rep. Susan Molinari, who had been one of Dole's most loyal
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's decision to give McCain such a high profile
underscored not only that McCain has emerged as an influential
force in his party but also that Bush is so popular among
Republicans that he does not have to worry that McCain would draw
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain clearly recognized that there was no
political upside to stirring up trouble for the Texas governor and
that he could score points by playing the loyal trooper.
Strikingly, he was so determined to fall in line behind Bush that
he did not even raise his signature issue of campaign finance
reform, something he relentlessly brings up every chance he gets.
He even played down his achievement of winning the New Hampshire
and Michigan primaries, calling himself ``a distant runner-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Tuesday night led some of McCain's most ardent
backers to privately grouse that he was being too adulatory, and
abandoning his greatest attribute _ his maverick nature.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who drew a potent following from independents and
Democrats during the primaries, implored his followers to rally
behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent,''
he asserted, ``if you believe America deserves leaders with a
purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote
for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a
soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op, then
vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said McCain knew it was
not in his interest to be a political menace at the convention.
``He has a great future with the party,'' Simpson said. ``You never
want to be known as a poor loser. He wants to be loved like all of
us. He wants to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   In a notable contrast to the play for moderates from the hall,
Pat Robertson, at the Christian Coalition gathering earlier in the
day, delivered a rousing speech about the stakes in this election
for religious conservatives, focusing on the Supreme Court. ``Five
people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if two or three of those unelected officials are
getting ready to retire or go on up to that great court in the sky.
The next president is going to have the ability to select two or
three judges on the Supreme Court,'' he added, to cheers and
applause. ``We need to have the election of a man who will appoint
righteous judges to the court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan. I think we
should do away with the federal Department of Education.'' This, of
course, put him distinctly at odds with Bush, who fought hard
against that position in the platform process _ and prevailed.

SMALL GROUP PROVIDING BIGGEST GOP DONATIONS _ TWO-THIRDS OF SOFT
MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republican officials insist that their financial
base is primarily small donors, but the party has received more
than $90 million from a relatively small pool of wealthy
individuals and corporations, some of whom have shielded their
generosity from public view.
</P>
<P>
   An elite cadre of 739 contributors, writing much larger checks
than in the past, has provided two-thirds of the party's $137
million in so-called soft money, the unrestricted party gifts. Some
of these donors have been directed by party officials to make their
gifts in ways that disguise their identity and the degree of their
largess, according to a top Republican fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The party's top-level sponsors are the Republican Regents, a
group of 139 people and corporations that party officials say have
each given at least $250,000 to the party since January 1999.
Two-thirds of the Regents are individuals, the rest are
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Federal Election Commission records, the membership
includes Lawrence Kadish, a New York real estate developer; Kenneth
Lay, the chairman of Enron Corp.; Jerrold Perenchio, the chairman
of the Univision television network; and Alex Spanos, a developer
and investor based in Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Federal Election Commission records show only 54
corporations and individuals as having given that much to the party
because some donors have split their donations into smaller checks,
at the suggestion of party officials. That effectively makes the
donors' contribution totals harder to trace.
</P>
<P>
   Some contributors have also written checks to state party
committees, the records of which are not filed with the Federal
Election Commission and are difficult to obtain. Several party
fund-raisers also acknowledged that some donors have been told by
finance officials to make their contributions in the name of more
obscure corporate subsidiaries that cannot always be easily linked
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party press secretary, said he was
not aware that there was a deliberate plan to direct large
contributors to send checks to state party committees as a way of
disguising the size of their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But fund-raisers said big-dollar political donors were willing
to write numerous checks to different party committees in an effort
to preserve their privacy. Some have asked for suggestions from
party officials for ways to disguise the level of their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's broken up,'' said a longtime Republican fund-raiser who
asked not to be identified. ``A man gives some, a spouse gives, an
investment company gives, a subsidiary gives. People want
anonymity. The party doesn't care; they're getting their money.''

MEXICO'S PRESIDENT-ELECT MAY CREATE OFFICE OF BORDER CZAR  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL RILEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President-elect Vicente Fox's foreign policy
experts said Tuesday that his transition team is considering
creating an office of a border czar that would deal with
drug-trafficking, immigration, pollution and other issues along
Mexico's international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   They indicated that Fox, who defeated Francisco Labastida of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party on July 2, would
discuss his ideas for the office and other issues when he meets
with President Clinton during a two-day visit to Washington on Aug.
24
</P>
<P>
   Fox also will confer with Vice President Al Gore, the presumed
Democratic presidential nominee, said the aides, Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser and Jorge Castaneda. The Mexican leader will travel to
Dallas where he will meet with Gore's Republican opponent, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, and with state business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The officials disclosed few details about a border czar office.
But they said that while it would deal with Mexico's southern
border with Guatemala as well as with its northern border, the
priority would be Mexico's 2,000-mile boundary with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The officials reiterated Fox's commitment for an open
U.S.-Mexican border, the free-flow of labor between Mexico and the
United States, and the reshaping of the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, they said, wants to transform NAFTA, which will tightly
link the economies of the three nations, into a sweeping political
and economic partnership modeled after the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Mexican leader will ask Clinton to scrap the
U.S. drug certification program, which is widely unpopular among
Mexican and other Latin American politicians. U.S. law requires the
administration to annually certify whether countries have taken
measures to control the flow of narcotics to the United States.
Nations that fail to be certified as drug-war allies face loss of
U.S. aid and other economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Fox's proposals are not likely to be greeted with
enthusiasm in Washington. But others may get a warmer response,
including hints by the Fox transition team that the president-elect
would be willing to trade a crackdown by Mexican law enforcement on
illegal immigration for more of so-called ``guest worker'' visas
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. economy continues to grow, there is a real
possibility a deal like that could happen,'' said Delal Baer, of
Washington's Center for International and Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``American industry is growing at a rapid enough rate that we
clearly have high demand for unskilled labor,'' she said. ``It's
just a matter of how you regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's overseas trip will also include two days in Canada, where
he will meet with Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The North American
visit is part of series of foreign trips Fox will make before
taking office Dec 1. The president-elect also will travel to South
and Central America and Europe, meeting with leaders of the
countries important to Mexico's political and economic interests.

   Six or eight left fielders. A passel of spare infielders. A few
no-name pitchers camping out in pup tents in the bullpen. Even Tino
Martinez, whom Joe Torre felt the need to sedate on Sunday with the
parting words, ``I'll see you Tuesday.'' Tino Martinez, for
goodness' sakes.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst all this rampant job insecurity, there was one guy who
hadn't really sweated it out. The Yankees need arms _ particularly
arms with functional heads in the vicinity _ and for the moment,
Dwight Gooden fits that description.
</P>
<P>
   The improbable Yankee, the accidental tourist, Gooden was on the
mound Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium against Kansas City, holding
the fort as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   While some Yankees reported to the stately old castle in the
Bronx with a sense of relief, Gooden showed up with the same huge
smile he sported in days of old. It was summertime and the living
was easy, at least until game time. Doc started with a perfect 3-0
record and an earned run average of 2.05 in his four appearances in
his astonishing return from the edge. He pitched seven innings
Tuesday night, after giving up one earned run on four hits. He
walked one and struck out four _ not vintage Doc, but good enough
to give the Yankees a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to get imaginative about it, Doc's grin was so
all-encompassing that it included a bit of a smirk at the
ludicrousness of it. He was putting something over on the world,
which is always fun for a powerball pitcher who suddenly discovers
it is just as cool to see hitters splat one into the ground as it
is to see them strike out lustily.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was more surprised than Joe Torre, who, when presented
with Gooden last month, said he had been told by Tampa (the
nearer-my-Steinbrenner-to-thee bunker in Florida) that Gooden was
the best pitcher available, not exactly strong praise.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Gooden had bought time for the Yankees to regain first
place, Torre was seeing the humor in Gooden's emergence as a
pitcher of poise and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure,'' Torre was saying Tuesday night. ``This
is a lark for him. It's like it was for me when I got fired from my
last job.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre recalled being let go by St. Louis in the summer of 1995
and being hired, somewhat surprisingly, by the Yankees for the 1996
season, and how he was in Cincinnati, his wife's hometown, and his
friends _ his friends, mind you _ were faxing him the ravings in
the tabloids calling him Clueless Joe and other niceties. What the
heck, Torre was back in the major leagues, the way Doc Gooden is
now back in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got released by his last club, a club under us,'' Torre
said. ``That's got to make you stop and think. He's going to enjoy
this ride as long as he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre admitted he was ``as surprised as anybody else'' when he
was handed Gooden to start the Queens portion of that eccentric
bicounty doubleheader with the Mets on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc has to thank his lucky stars we were rained out,'' Torre
said. ``If it wasn't for that doubleheader. ... It gave him a
chance to have an adrenaline rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could have envisioned Gooden's being so cerebral in
his major league comeback, Torre responded with an emphatic ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched for Cleveland last year, he pitched for Houston and
Tampa Bay this year,'' Torre recited. ``It was the same. He'd get
deep into the pitch count. He kept trying to have you not hit the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're throwing 86 or 106,'' the manager
said, alluding to velocity. ``You still have to throw strikes. It
really works against you if you're always 2-1 or 3-1 instead of 1-2
or 0-2. Now the hitter has to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate on why he was so surprised at Gooden's
transformation, Torre said: ``I'd watched him pitch. I knew he had
the ability to change, but I didn't know if he would. I'm pleased
for him. Baseball is still big in what he does. It's great to see a
smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   There will probably be other starts for Gooden. David Cone is
still in Florida on his Boss-mandated sabbatical, studying at the
feet of the guru, Billy Connors. El Duque Hernandez started in the
minors last night and may be back soon, or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for a manager to be faced with six starters,'' Torre
said, knowing he needs four at most for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Doc has the capability to come out of the bullpen, it
gives us more flexibility,'' said Torre, smiling quite a bit, but
not nearly as much as Dwight Gooden.

STRIKING ACTORS GO ON FAST

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Hoping to up the ante in the 14-week-old
commercial actors strike, five union actors went on a ``rolling
fast'' Tuesday, swearing off solid food indefinitely to publicize
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Screen Actors Guild officials said union members, through
persistence or substitutions, would keep up the fast until a new
contract is reached with the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about martyrdom or starvation, it's about
education and inspiration for all members of the union,'' said
union member James Arone, who relocated his wife and three children
from their Burbank house so it could be used for ``ACT FAST.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest commercial actors strike in union history is nowhere
near resolution; both sides refuse to budge from their positions
and no new talks are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are deadly serious about this,'' strike
coordinator Michael Brennan said on behalf of the SAG and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. ``They see no
other way to resolve this, considering that the other side made it
painfully clear in the last two attempts at negotiation that they
don't want to talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the advertising industry did not return
repeated calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Actors want to be paid residuals for ads on cable television, as
they are now paid for network spots. They also want jurisdiction
over commercials shot for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want to eliminate the residual system and instead
pay actors a flat fee for all commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has cost the Los Angeles County economy an estimated
$70 million in lost wages and support services, according to county
economic experts.
</P>
<P>
   Arone is being joined in the fast by S.A. Griffin, Peaches
Johnson, Raymond O'Connor and Jeri Zucchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Day One,'' Arone said, while refusing to say how long
he would go without food. ``I plan on personally going more than
one day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Television ratings for the first night of the Republican
National Convention indicated that only a small fraction of the
total television audience watched the prime-time portion of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC and CBS, the two broadcast networks that offered just an
hour of prime-time coverage each on Monday, only about 13 million
total viewers tuned in, or about 15 percent of the total television
audience. And on CBS, which interrupted its convention coverage for
a repeat of a segment of its newsmagazine ``48 Hours,'' on the
subject of medical experiments on human patients, about half the
audience left when the network shifted to pure convention coverage
at 10:30 p.m. The convention coverage on both ABC and CBS was
beaten by a repeat episode of the show ``Third Watch'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.5 million watched PBS, which had three hours of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   On the three all-news cable channels, a total of 2.4 million
viewers watched the evening convention events. CNN had the biggest
audience, 1.2 million, compared with 676,000 for Fox News and
516,000 for MSNBC.

ROBERTSON SAYS CHRISTIAN COALITION `JUST WARMING UP' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Countering the conciliatory mood of the
Republican National Convention, speakers at a Christian Coalition
of America rally here Tuesday denounced pop culture, the U.S.
Department of Education and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelist and commentator Pat Robertson, founder of the
coalition, asserted that the organization has been wrongly written
off as a force in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of reading stories saying the Christian Coalition is
dead,'' Robertson said. ``We're just warming up, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, one of several Republican
officeholders who addressed the audience as warm-up acts for
Robertson, revived a phrase that often fills GOP strategists with
regret.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, stoked by applause from about 1,800 people packed
into a hotel ballroom, criticized violence in the mass media and
urged religious voters ``to engage in the great cultural battle for
the soul of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the 2000 election is no time to be dainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a convention of sweetness and light,'' he said.
``Nobody wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson called for dismantling the U.S. Department of
Education, saying he could do a better job with the agency's money
by educating children through private, religious projects.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush made sure that the party dropped its
long-running call for the department to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan,'' Robertson said. ``I
think they should do away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky rocked another boat
Tuesday in his role as the Senate's leading foe of legislation that
would place further limits on the way candidates and parties
finance their campaigns with contributions from individuals and
special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear the three words `campaign finance reform,' some
liberal is trying to shut you up,'' McConnell said. ``No matter how
you dress up that turkey, it still won't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation would blunt the Christian Coalition from
pooling its financial resources to ``amplify'' its messages.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond discussion of their favorite issues, the ``Faith &AMP;
Freedom Celebration'' was the Christian Coalition's assertion that
it remains relevant to the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   That Bush is a born-again Christian who opposes abortion and is
running on a ``pro-family'' agenda shows that the coalition is on
the cusp of its goal to have such a person in the White House,
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice University Professor William Martin, author of a book on
the evolution of the religious right, said groups such as the
coalition have become pragmatic and less raucous while continuing
to represent about a sixth of the national electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the religious right was overestimated, and now it
is being underestimated,'' he said in a telephone interview.

BLACK EMPLOYEES AT COKE MAY FILE SEPARATE DISCRIMINATION SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Exclusive)  By   CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former Coca-Cola benefits manager who has criticized the
company's treatment of black workers said on Tuesday that he would
urge those workers to retain lawyers to help them determine whether
they should accept a settlement reached in June between Coke and
four black employees who sued the company or file their own suits.
The terms of the settlement have not yet been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Larry Jones, plans to hold a news conference on
Friday in Atlanta. He said on Tuesday that he would tell his former
colleagues not to wait until October, when the terms of the
settlement are scheduled to be announced, to assess whether they
would be better off as part of the agreement, which covers all
black salaried employees from 1995 to the present. Jones said he
was arranging to have lawyers, other than those already involved,
help employees decide what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers would look at their individual cases and talk to
them about the pros and cons of going after individual claims,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in April 1999 in federal court in Atlanta,
contends that black employees at Coke were denied promotions,
raises and other benefits because of their skin color. Coke has
denied that any discrimination took place. Many of the employees
say they are unsure of how to proceed, particularly because the
specifics of the settlement are still secret. ``I'm very
frustrated,'' said Yvette Frierson, a former employee. ``They're
telling us, `Oh, we've reached a decision,' but they aren't giving
us any details. As far as I'm concerned, they haven't reached a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the lawsuit has taken a complicated turn, resulting
in confusion for many of the employees who would be affected by the
settlement. After a dispute over the settlement's financial terms,
four of the eight plaintiffs split off from the original legal
team, led by Cyrus Mehri, a Washington lawyer. They signed on with
Willie E. Gary, a Florida personal-injury specialist who became
involved with the case in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, who is chairman of a cable television channel that
recently signed a large advertising contract with Coke, filed a
$1.5 billion lawsuit in Georgia state court in June, the day the
settlement of the federal suit was announced. His clients in that
lawsuit are four black women who formerly worked at Coke. Gary has
said that he has no conflict of interest despite Coke's business
dealings with his cable channel. His co-counsel on the lawsuit is
Johnnie L. Cochran, who defended O.J. Simpson at his murder trial
in 1995.

 &HT;    NASCAR sets two safety rules in wake of fatal crashes
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Winston Cup teams support NASCAR's new safety rules,
calling them ``a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport's governing body issued technical bulletins Tuesday
that mandate two safety devices: an independent stop on a car's
throttle assembly and an ignition on-off switch within the reach of
the driver's thumb. The changes will take effect immediately,
beginning with Saturday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The two modifications are NASCAR's initial technical reactions
to the recent deaths of drivers Kenny Irwin and Adam Petty at New
Hampshire International Speedway. The investigations are
incomplete, but both drivers appeared to be hindered by stuck
throttles that sent their cars smashing into the outside-retainer
wall at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are changes I can't see anybody disagreeing with,''
driver Jeremy Mayfield said. ``They don't take anything away from
the race cars, they don't affect competition but they can save you
from a pretty hard crash. You have to applaud NASCAR for taking
steps like these.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teams, including the No. 36 Pontiac of Atlanta-owned MB2
Motorsports, had already been using the safety devices for the past
two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great move by NASCAR _ just another step
they are taking to make the sport safer,'' said Sammy Johns, crew
chief for Ken Schrader. ``(But) we're still looking for other ways
to make it even safer for our driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Makar, who works for Winston Cup points leader Bobby
Labonte and is considered a dean of the crew chiefs, said the
modifications are ``definitely a move in the right direction'' and
``certainly, any action that can be taken is better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Makar, and Tommy Baldwin, crew chief for Ward Burton, are among
many teams studying the automatic throttle-kill systems used in
NASCAR's modified series. The system, which is sensor-based and in
the engine's linkage, already has been approved for Winston Cup
teams to use voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things out there to go a step further than (the two
new changes) that we're looking at right now, even though they
aren't quite ready to use in our cars,'' Makar said. ``We're
getting them worked on and tested. If it works, we'll put it in the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty was killed in May and Irwin in July at the Loudon, N.H.,
oval.

COMMENTARY: NEW CENTURY, OLD GRUDGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ OK. Now we're in business.
</P>
<P>
   After an icky evening of Republican kissy-face and
blaxploitation (``Affirmative Action, the Musical''), Poppy
unleashed Chiang!
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing Chiang, in the loopy Bush family patois used in golf
and tennis, means giving the ball a good whack.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of President Clinton taunting W., saying that the
Republican candidate's message was merely ``My Daddy was
president,'' Daddy lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he continues that, then I'm going to tell the nation
what I think about him as a human being and a person,'' the former
president threatened on NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Our summer of torpid politics suddenly came alive with the
freaky spectacle of two presidents trash-talking. The race turns
out to be what we thought it was all along: President Bush vs.
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   George Senior is determined to prove once and for all that Bill
Clinton is a tacky hick who defiled the presidency. Bill Clinton is
determined to prove once and for all that George Senior is an
irrelevant aristocrat who thinks the presidency is a family
heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   Two intensely competitive chief executives, who had been trying
not to meddle too much in the campaigns of their proteges, bolting
off the reservation in a bid for vindication.
</P>
<P>
   George Senior is fighting for the second term he feels he was
gypped out of by Bill Clinton. And Bill Clinton is fighting for the
third term he needs to launder his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   W. and Al are alternately bystanders and stand-ins in the big
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though the tape of the '92 election, on pause all these
years, has started rolling again.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential hissy fit is driven by class rage. Edith
Wharton would have savored this drama of manners.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have been privately steaming that Gore/Clinton have
not abided by Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the
Republicans to enjoy their nomination party without any Democrats
throwing a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Pere believes his manners toward his successor have been
impeccable, and that he has been discreet out of loyalty to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's been more gracious and charitable to Bill Clinton, even
during Lewinsky?'' asked the former president's old friend, former
Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bushes felt the gentlemanly rules of order were broken
over the last week when the Democrats put out an ad attacking Dick
Cheney's conservative record and two more attacking W. on health
care and the environment, and when Bill Clinton repeatedly mocked
W. as a coddled daddy's boy at fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was in the ditch,'' Clinton said in Boston last
Friday, talking about '92, comparing the Bush White House to a
ditzy ``Wayne's World.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gave Clinton, who never knew his own father and who had
to stand up to an abusive, alcoholic stepfather, a solid gold key
to success. And he clearly thinks Al Gore, another regent raised to
be president by a famous political father, is not up to the
challenge of gutting the Bushes on the entitlement issue.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be galling to Clinton that Americans don't seem
inclined to reward his vice president for the purring economy. And
he is surely fed up with the Republicans acting as if his two terms
were merely  &UR; Bushus Interruptus &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that this class war has caused everyone
to reverse roles. In '92, W. was the vindictive one who lashed out
when his father was criticized. Now dad has taken junior's role.
And while it is usually vice presidents who serve as hatchet men,
now Bill Clinton does that for his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Simpson says that the Bushes avoided publicly
criticizing Clinton about Monica Lewinsky, that is in fact the
subtext of W.'s campaign _ restoring ``honor and dignity'' to the
White House. Clinton thinks a rejection of Gore would be a
ratification of the Bushes' contention that he sullied the White
House. The president can also see that it is hard for Al Gore to
attack, because even people who agree with Gore find him
insufferable on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   W. and Gore will probably keep campaigning, but we all know it's
not about them anymore. Maybe it never was.

HOPEFULLY, HUGGINS VETO WILL LEAD TO PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm heartened to read that as many as 50,000 demonstrators are
expected to converge on the Staples Center at mid-month to protest
the goings-on inside.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time somebody turned up the heat on the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers owner Donald Sterling hit a new low this week. The most
humiliating of his many humiliations unfolded in two stages: He
offered $2 million a year for four years to a college coach without
a national championship to gloss up the resume; then the college
coach said no thanks, you can keep your $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   This was reality slapping Sterling in the face. With any luck
Sterling was taking a look in the mirror at the time. It might take
such a combination of metaphors to show this guy what's wrong with
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't attract a ``name'' coach like Bob Huggins this
summer, they'll never do it.
</P>
<P>
   Things have been looking up: The Clippers are out of the
despised Sports Arena and comfortably ensconced in the Staples
Center, where they are no worse than the third-ranking tenant. They
are teeming with talented rookies after their smartest draft in
years, and the innocents are pledging to stay together and build a
contender. Their top free agent, Maurice Taylor, is as good as
gone, but you take the bad with the good in this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The arena and the rookie class are the positives that would
cause somebody like Huggins, the University of Cincinnati coach, to
give the Clippers a look.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Sterling still has those midcourt owners' seats,
which is the kind of negative that would cause somebody like
Huggins to give the Clippers the brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins announced his decision to stay in Cincinnati by saying:
``I took a lot of things into consideration and I think the thing
for me to do at this point in time is to stay here and continue
what we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice arena, improving roster, same old owner. Let's see: Reading
Huggins' mind, which of the things he took into consideration might
have dissuaded him?
</P>
<P>
   There's simply no future in the Clippers as long as Sterling is
signing the checks.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Clippers' search for a head coach to replace the
fired Chris Ford will stretch into a seventh month. Closer to the
start of next season than the end of last season, they are the only
NBA team without a coach.
</P>
<P>
   They'll likely end up hiring somebody like Alvin Gentry, John
Lucas or Dennis Johnson, and it'll be a return to the glorious eras
of Don Casey, Mike Schuler and Bob Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling and the Clippers have been late-night monologue jokes
for so long _ 19 seasons, of which one was a winning season and one
was a .500 season _ that you wonder if the owner realizes the team
has fans who are seriously disappointed in its lack of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any hope of persuading the businessman who never sells
anything to sell the Clippers to somebody who won't scare coaches
and players away? Let's consider how this might be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   A public boycott of Clippers home games? Not likely to be
effective, since for most Clippers home games the difference would
be undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   A public boycott of Sterling property? Not likely to be adhered
to because if half of Beverly Hills is declared off-limits, where
would we purchase our mink coats?
</P>
<P>
   No, it appears a full-scale demonstration is the best solution.
So as long as thousands of activists are massing at the borders in
preparation for nonviolent protests during a political party's
convention the week after next, perhaps we can persuade a few to
carry placards for a new cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sterling Must Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Down With the Clippers' Oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice for All, Not Only Lakers Fans.'' &QL;

HEALTH GROUP SAYS FILES SHOW TOBACCO COMPANIES FOUGHT ANTISMOKING
EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Exclusive)  By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tobacco industry documents show that cigarette makers took part
for years in a broad-sweeping campaign to influence and undermine
the World Health Organization's antismoking efforts worldwide, the
agency contends in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accuses the leading tobacco companies of using a
network of front organizations and groups with industry ties to
thwart WHO. The study adds that industry consultants obtained
positions at WHO-affiliated groups and that new rules are probably
needed that would require the agency employees, consultants and
advisers to disclose their industry ties.
</P>
<P>
   The special report, a copy of which the World Health
Organization provided to The New York Times in advance of its
release on Wednesday, is based on industry documents, including
those uncovered by states during lawsuits against the tobacco
industry. Some have been previously cited in news reports. But
others shed new light on the biggest cigarette maker, Philip
Morris, and the role apparently played a decade ago by its chairman
in devising ways to undercut the World Health Organization. The
report includes some documents and citations to others.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being issued as international health groups like
the World Health Organization are trying to keep attention focused
on smoking after settlements in lawsuits under which major
cigarette makers agreed to restrict advertising and finance
antismoking campaigns. Those accords do not extend outside the
United States, and antismoking groups have maintained that
producers will operate under different rules abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody who is working in the area of tobacco control is
surprised that tobacco companies are trying to limit our
influence,'' said Dr. Thomas Zeltner, a top Swiss public health
official who headed the panel that oversaw the report. ``But,''
Zeltner said, ``the surprise is how elaborate and well financed
this whole activity was.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, an official of Philip Morris, David Davies, did
not dispute the report's contents but said that the decade-old
documents that it cited reflected a different time in the company's
history and that the company had changed its practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal today is to create a different environment, one of
less rancor, where there can be real progress in resolving
important issues relating to the regulation of tobacco,'' said
Davies, a vice president of the international tobacco subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Prideaux, a spokesman for British-American Tobacco,
another company cited in the report, was more critical. ``It is
very sad that the WHO, of all people, have succumbed to the
plaintiffs' obsession with old documents,'' Prideaux said, ``rather
than how we might work together constructively to move things
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on documents that extend from almost a
decade ago, when the suits were filed, and is thus largely focused
on the manufacturers' activities at a time when producers felt
little pressure from the threats of suits or public condemnation.
In 1988, top officials of Philip Morris gathered in Boca Raton,
Fla., to develop a broad strategy for undermining antismoking
efforts and other threats to the industry, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was overseen by Geoffrey Bible, who was then head of
the company's international tobacco division and is now its
chairman. Executives at the meeting identified 26 threats to
tobacco, foremost of which was international health agencies like
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The report says officials then devised a set of
``redirection/containment strategies,'' though it said it was
difficult to determine how many of them Philip Morris carried out
because company documents were incomplete. But in one memo sent to
Bible, a subordinate wrote, ``The antismoking movement is now so
intertwined and interrelated that chopping off one arm, or the
head, should not be viewed as a quick fix to containment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the company, Elizabeth Cho, said Bible was not
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the report say the industry tried to use front
organizations or surrogates to influence the World Health
Organization. One section details industry dealings with Paul
Dietrich, a lawyer who is also head of the Institute for
International Health and Development, a research group in
Alexandria, Va. According to the report, Dietrich attended the
meeting in Boca Raton and subsequently wrote opinion pieces for The
Wall Street Journal and The International Herald Tribune that
attacked WHO without disclosing that he and the institute had
received money from the tobacco industry. In 1990, Dietrich was
named to a committee of the Pan American Health Organization, a
group that is a WHO regional office, and sought to lower tobacco as
a priority for the agency, the report asserted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Dietrich disputed the findings, calling
them ridiculous. He said he had been critical of WHO because he
believed that the agency was wasting its money on ineffective
antismoking efforts rather than concentrating on major health
initiatives in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my speeches, I talked about vaccination programs and
childhood health,'' Dietrich said. ``I never mentioned tobacco. My
mantra was we have `x' amount of dollars, and that needs to be
spent on the diseases that were killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich has denied that the industry financed his writings. But
he acknowledged that British-American Tobacco hired him as a
consultant in the mid-90's, when he was also an official of the Pan
American organization. Dietrich said he agreed to prepare a report
for the company that would be an overview of the World Health
Organization and the issues it confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about disclosing his work to the Pan American
organization, Dietrich said he had not and added: ``I didn't feel
like it related to anything we were doing with tobacco. So there
was no conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the World Health Organization, David Nabarro,
said some of the report's findings raised concerns that the agency
and related United Nations organizations needed better safeguards
from industry interests, including a review of guidelines on
disclosing possible conflicts of interest.

PGA PRO DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN WOODS, DUVAL OR ELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a daily source of confusion in an industry that employs
more than 25,000 nationwide and nearly 1,500 in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Greatswing is introduced as a PGA professional and almost
immediately will be asked something about play on the pro tour.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Gunn, teaching professional at Moorpark's Tierra Rejada
Golf Course, has the bottom-line answer for that one. It's an old
joke in the industry but also way too accurate for too many of the
golf professionals who make up the world's largest working sports
organization:
</P>
<P>
   ``The old saying among PGA professionals is PGA stands for `Put
your Golf clubs Away,''' said Gunn, one of the fortunate few in his
profession who gets to occasionally sample life at the tip of the
pro golf iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the PGA Tour, which represents less than two
percent of the golf professionals in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stems from the names: the PGA of America, founded
in 1916, and the PGA Tour, which began in 1968 when the Tournament
Players Division split off from the PGA of America and took charge
of tour play.
</P>
<P>
   ``PGA Tour players have one job and that's trying to get the
most out of their golf game, period,'' said Gunn. ``A PGA golf
professional for the most part is running a pro shop _ making sure
the carts are running, the merchandise is ordered, the food and tee
times and greens superintendent and course is set up, and it goes
on and on and on. The PGA professional wears many hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it's not one he's seen wearing on weekend television.
But there have been notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, a former assistant pro at Wood Ranch in Simi Valley,
went from teaching golf to ruling it in less than a decade,
advancing from club instructor to winning the British Open
championship and being named PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was a classic case, and there are a few of them,'' Gunn
said, ``where you look at a guy and say, `What's wrong with him _
why isn't he on tour?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the answer is, not a thing is wrong. He's good enough to
be out there doing great. Jeff Freeman (the SCPGA champion who won
last year's national club pro championship and nearly won this
year's Nissan Open) is another. Whatever life circumstances bring _
maybe they missed a cut in tour school or whatever _ they're off
the tour when they might actually have the ability to be on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it comes down to job security. Brad Gallagher, who
once recorded eight consecutive birdies to set a Canadian Tour
record but also failed PGA Tour qualifying school nine times, has
settled for a full-time job at Robinson Ranch. The tour might have
its allure, but steady pay has its own benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the big difference,'' Gunn said. ``If a
professional player doesn't play well, he basically doesn't get
paid. It's a much more stable existence for a PGA professional. I
couldn't believe the first time I started getting paid for lessons
whether I thought the lessons went well or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunn, who formerly instructed at Lake Lindero Country Club in
Agoura, is accomplished enough as a golfer to have played in two
U.S. Opens _ most recently the 1997 national championship at
Congressional Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He was wandering outside the ropes at this year's centennial
Open at Pebble Beach, wishing he were inside playing but also
remembering his thought process during a reality check practice
round with Lehman at Congressional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took ten bucks from him,'' Gunn said, ``and the whole time
I'm thinking, `Thank God I'm not playing this guy for my
mortgage.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's that consistency of quality that keeps PGA Tour players in
golf's top league, Gunn said. The club pros might be able to
compete with a touring pro on any given day, but only the best can
do it consistently _ in which case they generally move on to the
tour. Other notable club pros to make that switch with great
success were Sam Snead and Ralph Guldahl, the 1939 Masters winner
and two-time U.S. Open champion who concluded his golf career at
Tarzana's Braemar Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some wonderful success stories out there,'' Jeff
Johnson, director of golf operations at the PGA of Southern
California Golf Club at Oak Valley, said of club pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a distinction (between PGA Tour players and
PGA professionals),'' Johnson said, ``but it's an allied
association. We're looking after the business of the game of golf
and growing the game of golf, and those great players on tour are
inspiring more people to take up the game. It's really a win-win
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And while a PGA professional deals with issues ranging from
event planning to merchandising to agronomics to fund-raising to
rules arbitration and much, much more, the most-rewarding part of
the job _ apart from a steady paycheck _ might be the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn, who does only that at Tierra Rejada, cites golf newcomer
Beau Gooliak as an example. Gooliak took up the game only a year
ago and shot 80 in his first tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction of that accomplishment left both of them
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always fun to see when it happens to a friend, if you
will,'' Gunn said, ``because they become friends after a while.
That's about as good as it gets.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MASS ARRESTS AS PROTESTERS DISRUPT PHILADELPHIA
 &HT;    By JIM GALLOWAY and ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Roving crowds of protesters clashed violently
with police Tuesday, paralyzing large sections of the city's
downtown as delegates tried to make their way to the second night
of the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishes were the first large-scale confrontations of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m. (ET), more than 300 protesters had been arrested or
detained, and traffic had resumed to something close to normal.
Republican officials reported a number of state delegations
delayed, but none were prevented from making it to the GOP meeting
several miles away at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on injuries to protesters weren't immediately available.
Lt. Dennis Konczyk of the Philadelphia Police Department said one
female police officer was injured when an unidentified liquid was
thrown in her face.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, some wearing black bandanas or ski masks over
their faces, were protesting a wide variety of issues ranging from
the death penalty to U.S. involvement in a ``drug war'' in Colombia
to the expense of AIDS medication.
</P>
<P>
   Police acknowledged that the protesters were marginally
successful in their effort to disrupt both delegates and local
rush-hour commuters. ``I call today a wash,'' Konczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of mostly peaceful demonstrations, protesters had
promised there would be disruptions on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters were demonstrating against what they said was
corporate influence on the major political parties and the
government. Some chanted: ``Capitalist pigs go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Falls, a 23-year-old who traveled to Philadelphia from
Michigan, said that she was protesting ``everything''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is dominated by corporations. We are the
richest country in the world and still cannot provide health care
or good education for the poor,'' Falls said. ``I'm not protesting
just about the Republicans, I'm protesting against both parties
since they are run by the same corporate sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters dressed up in costumes with goats as heads,
calling themselves ``the goats with the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Fitzpatrick, 29, from Philadelphia, said that the
``goats'' were protesting ``the two party system that is backed by
the same corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is run by just one party _ the corporations,''
said 21-year-old student Justin Leto, who lives near Philadelphia,
shortly before he was arrested for blocking a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   There were even a group of protesters dressed up as clowns who
claimed to be protesting the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the protesting clowns,'' said Melanie, an 18-year-old
from Philadelphia, who did not give her last name but insisted on
being called Snogg. ``We are protesting about protest, but us
clowns are protesters at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the clowns, other protesters wore cardboard horse
heads.
</P>
<P>
   The worst exchanges came near the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel
where Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be staying Wednesday and
Thursday. Protesters began slashing the tires of police vehicles,
dumping orange paint on other police cars and spray-painting
obscenities on others. A short time later, police responded with
batons after protesters hit them.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest crowds gathered around City Hall, where police
responded with phalanxes of horses and squads of officers on
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Over city blocks that spanned miles, demonstrators and police
played a rush-hour game of cat-and-mouse. Demonstrators would often
sit or stand in the street, their arms inter-linked and their hands
clasped in plastic pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Once lines of police horses began to push them back, the
demonstrators would retreat to another location.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators and homeward-bound workers outnumbered protesters at
some locations. Sometimes they found their routes home blocked by
police lines and demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get home on the R-7,'' Winifred Simmons complained
to police, pointing to her subway stop.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, 58, was loaded with 72 rolls of toilet paper. ``These
people making the demonstrations need to cool out.''

 PHILADELPHIA: their money''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind closed doors here this week, the Regents are getting
suitably royal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. on Monday, Tiffany &AMP; Co. closed early so it could hold
a private reception for 200 consisting of Regents and their
spouses. The Regents sipped soup from mock Faberge eggs as a string
quartet played. Joan Specter, the wife of Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, designed the table arrangements, which included rare
orange Gerber daisies and matching roses. Each Regent was given a
signature blue Tiffany box containing a crystal bowl, inscribed
with George W. Bush's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Some Regents played golf Tuesday morning with Republican elected
officials and former cabinet members at the White Marsh Valley
Country Club in Lafayette Hills, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   These events have been strictly off limits to reporters, and
credentials are carefully checked at the door. Several Regents
asked the Republican National Committee to send extra party workers
to guard their events from media interlopers. (Party officials
refused, and suggested the club hire its own security guards.)
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials declined to disclose the Regents'
membership list or a complete convention agenda, but The New York
Times obtained a carefully guarded list of the Regents'
Philadelphia itinerary from a member. On the calendar, the events
are listed ``REGENTS ONLY.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, the donor elite was Team 100, a group of
$100,000 contributors that began in 1988 to help elect President
George Bush. The club, now dedicated to the election of his son
George W., the governor of Texas, has grown to 600 members and
accounts for more than $60 million of the $137 million in soft
money that the party has raised since January 1999. In
Philadelphia, some Team 100 members have complained that their
events are too crowded. One Regent crowed that Team 100 members
were packed like sardines in their party suite, while the $250,000
club members had ``room to stretch our legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay a little more, you get a little more,'' Mel Sembler,
the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said that while they were grateful for the
support of big donors, the core of the party was its 600,000 small
contributors. The average donation to the party is $99.63, party
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of small donors who represent grass-roots
America,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party.
``We're pleased with the outpouring of support we've seen in recent
weeks, particularly since Gov. Bush announced his selection of Dick
Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the party's biggest donors have also written large
checks to state Republican Party chapters, which do not appear in
Federal Election Commission records. For example, 17 top donors to
the national party also appear as donors to the Indiana party,
according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Sam
Fox, the chairman of the Harbour Group, a Missouri manufacturing
company, and the Republican Party's largest individual donor, is
credited in state records with giving the Indiana party $275,000.
But he said in an interview Tuesday that he did not write a check
to the Indiana state party. A Republican National Committee
official said he could not explain the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   The institute found that 10 top national party contributors also
gave a total of $367,000 to the New York party. A Republican
fund-raiser said that contributors were given credit for
contributions to state parties when determining their
qualifications for the Regents and Team 100 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts criticized the Republican Party Tuesday
for what they said appeared to be efforts to hide large
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary development,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
an advocate of revisions in federal campaign finance law and the
president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit lobbying organization based
in Washington. ``These efforts to raise soft money secretly are an
outrageous evasion of disclosure laws. Large soft-money
contributions are disappearing underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1999, Bush has raised $93.2 million in checks of
$1,000 or less, much of it raised by a network of fund-raisers
called the Pioneers. He has promptly listed his donors and the
amounts they have contributed on his campaign Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported rapid public disclosure of campaign
contributions as a healthy campaign finance reform,'' Bush said in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Sembler, a Florida shopping center magnate and former ambassador
to Australia, created the Regents last year, coining the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it had a lofty sound to it,'' Sembler said in an
interview earlier this year. But some Republicans do not like the
name, saying it hardly hides the fact that a small donor group gets
royal treatment from the party.
</P>
<P>
   This week's highlight event is a ``Regents only'' reception that
precedes Wednesday's Republican gala lunch at the Philadelphia
Marriott. The Regents will get the opportunity to meet privately
with Bush and his wife, Laura; Cheney; and Bush's brother, Jeb, the
governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would allow a reporter to attend a Regents
event, Sembler laughed. ``Write me a $250,000 check,'' he said,
``and I'll open the door for you.''

 &HT;    NBA's Day 1 big deal lands Eddie Jones in Miami
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - A funny thing happened to Tuesday's Day 1 gold rush in
the NBA: not as much as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The news was that Pat Riley obtained Charlotte's Eddie Jones in
a nine-player deal that could give the coach his first trip to the
Finals with the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Miami with Jones were Anthony Mason, Ricky Davis and
Dale Ellis. The Hornets got Jamal Mashburn, P.J. Brown, Tim James,
Otis Thorpe and Rodney Buford.
</P>
<P>
   But the free-agent news Tuesday mainly centered on second-tier
players.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was that the Orlando Magic convinced Grant Hill and
Tracy McGrady that it would be best to hold off signing until
today. Either way, the players get deals worth about $9.6 million
each in the first year. McGrady is expected to get a six-year deal
worth an estimated $72 million. Hill wants only four years, worth
$44 million, to bring him to a 10-year level that allows a much
higher salary structure.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is trying to clear room for Clippers forward Maurice
Taylor. The Magic was shopping former Georgia Tech star Matt
Harpring during the day. In the Miami-Charlotte deal, Jones took a
career deal worth about $86.3 million over seven years from the
Heat in a sign-and-trade. It was $20 million more than the Chicago
Bulls could offer in a six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Turned down by all top free agents, the Bulls apparently will do
no better than much-traveled Ron Mercer, who has gone from Boston
to Denver to Orlando at a dizzying pace. The Bulls also might sign
the Hornets' backup center, Brad Miller, for $5 million a year,
about $1 million more than the league average Charlotte is allowed
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Mason is one of several players who had persistent legal
problems in Charlotte. Mason played his best basketball for the
Knicks when Riley was the coach there. He played point forward, at
one stage of his career and moves into P.J. Brown's forward slot.
</P>
<P>
   Hornets executive Bob Bass, who helped the Lakers win a
championship when he dealt Glen Rice to Los Angeles,
unintentionally might have helped Miami reach that level. Jones and
Mason are much more versatile than Mashburn and Brown, the
principal players shipped north to Charlotte. Only five years ago,
the Heat acquired Alonzo Mourning from Charlotte for Rice and Matt
Geiger, who plays now for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Hawks declined a deal from the Lakers that would have sent
Rice to Atlanta for power forward Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Austin Croshere (Indiana) and Cuttino Mobley (Houston) were
not swayed by the prospect of playing for Lenny Wilkens in Toronto.
They agreed to remain with their original teams, Croshere with a
seven-year, $51 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Backup point guard Bobby Jackson is leaving Minnesota for
Sacramento for five years and $13.4 million. Jackson arrives as
Kings reserve guard Tony Delk leaves. Delk, a free agent, agreed to
contract terms with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Former Knicks and Warriors guard John Starks said he is
signing with Utah to replace retired Jeff Hornacek, and guard
Derrick Anderson apparently will leave the Clippers. He might sign
with the Spurs.

DEMOCRATS AND THEIR ALLIES ATTACK BUSH IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Accusing the Republican Party of using its
convention to mask Gov. George W. Bush's stands on controversial
issues, Democrats and groups with close ties to them are unleashing
commercials that criticize his record in Texas as well as his
positions on gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The groups _ Planned Parenthood, Handgun Control and the Sierra
Club _ are all running commercials singling out Bush in a week in
which Republicans are staging a convention that was intended to
sidestep divisive topics like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest barrage is coming from the Democratic National
Committee, which has been releasing at least one new advertisement
each day, and plans to continue doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the committee unveiled a 30-second commercial, to be
broadcast in 17 crucial states from the Pacific Northwest to New
England, that accuses Bush of favoring ``the big drug companies,
the HMOs and the insurance industry'' over Texas residents.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic staff members, including one of the party's national
chairmen, Joe Andrew, have set up shop here to reinforce their
contention that the Republicans are glossing over what they view as
Bush's deeply conservative agenda in an effort to appeal to
moderate Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to create an illusion that they are something
other than they are,'' Andrew said, adding that his party has more
than 20 staff members and a bus, called the Rolling Donkey, that
ferries reporters to the news conferences it is holding in Sheet
Metal Hall, a couple of miles from the First Union Center, where
the Republicans are meeting. ``We knew they were going to try to
set up this Vegas lounge act, and not tell people who they are,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have injected a bit of partisan invective into an
otherwise thoroughly upbeat, stage-managed week in Philadelphia. It
is a reminder that though the campaign has been a fairly
understated affair, it could get a lot tougher fast.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said that with all the mass communication techniques _
the party is running seven anti-Bush Web sites _ it may sound as if
the strategy is novel. ``But it's not,'' he said. ``It's actually
old-fashioned. We're back to making sure people know what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say the Democrats' strategy is a sign of
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats look at Governor Bush's inclusive style
and they've gone into full party panic,'' said Ari Fleischer, a
Bush spokesman. ``The more they attack, the more people don't like
Al Gore's manner of campaigning. They are sick and tired of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest commercial follows a theme that forces allied with
Democrats have been returning to again and again: Bush's record in
Texas. This one compares the governor's commitment to health care
unfavorably with Gore's. ``George Bush: His plan protects special
interests instead of working families,'' the announcer says as the
screen shows a black and white portrait of an utterly forlorn woman
in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The special interest groups say their goal is to ensure that
like-minded voters who might be misled by the convivial tone of the
convention and the campaign understand that on issues like health
care and abortion rights, Bush is out of step.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, said focus groups found that many women who identified
themselves as moderate to conservative and who supported abortion
rights were not aware of Bush's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assumed he was pro-choice because he appears moderate,''
Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt said the advertising campaign, which began last month and
is running on cable television stations around the country, is the
first on the presidential level for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has been extraordinarily successful at obfuscating, at
fuzzying around the edges of issues, especially on reproductive
health and rights,'' she said. Additional advertisements are
planned after the party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that the Democrats' efforts only pointed up
Gore's own fuzziness on issues like gun control; Bush is considered
a reliable ally of the National Rifle Association, a group Gore
regularly attacks but did work with on issues when he was in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd stay on one position long enough on the question of
guns,'' Fleischer said, ``he'd be subject to criticism as well.''

BRUCE JAMES ENNIS, DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU, DIES AT 60 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., N.H., Ill., Calif., Mo.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce James Ennis, a First Amendment lawyer and former legal
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, died on Saturday at
a hospital in Boston, where he was taken from his summer home on
Martha's Vineyard. He was 60 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from leukemia, Paul Smith of the
Washington law firm Jenner &AMP; Block said. Ennis was a senior partner
there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ennis appeared as counsel in some 250 cases
before the U.S. Supreme Court, representing litigants as well as
friends of the court. The National Law Journal has listed him among
the country's 100 most influential lawyers since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He became known nationally for his work to protect the mentally
ill and retarded. More recently he dealt chiefly with First
Amendment matters involving the print media, cable television, the
Internet, communications laws and related Constitutional law
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He came to prominence with the first case he argued in the
Supreme Court. Known as the Donaldson case, it ended in the court's
unanimously ruling in 1975 that nonviolent mental patients had
important rights, including the right not to be deprived of liberty
and the right to sue state hospital officials for damages if that
right is violated.
</P>
<P>
   One case in the 1990s, ACLU et al. vs. Reno, helped clarify the
constitutionality of government regulation of free speech on the
Internet. While he was on the staff of the ACLU he successfully
defended The Progressive magazine when the federal government tried
to suppress an article about the hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Knoxville, Tenn., Bruce Ennis graduated cum laude
from Dartmouth College in 1962. He received a doctor of laws degree
in 1965 at the University of Chicago, where he was elected to the
Order of the Coif and served on The Chicago Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the ACLU as a staff lawyer in 1968. He was its lead
counsel in the notorious long-running Willowbrook case in the
1970s, exposing one of the world's largest and most squalid
institutions for the mentally retarded, on Staten Island. The
exposure resulted in sweeping reforms statewide.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1982 he served as the organization's legal
director, heading a national staff of 26 lawyers and coordinating
strategies with thousands of cooperating lawyers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He then was a founding member of the Washington law firm Ennis,
Friedman, Bersoff &AMP; Ewing. The firm was merged into Jenner &AMP; Block
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis is survived by his wife, Emily Newhall Ennis; two teen-age
sons, Alexander and Bradley; his mother, Jane Burgin of Kansas
City, Mo.; and a sister, Elizabeth Ennis-Thomas of Corte Madera,
Calif.

IOC COMMISSION APPROVES NEW DRUG TESTS AT OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The medical commission of the International Olympic Committee
Tuesday approved the use of a combination of urine and blood tests
to detect the use of the performance-enhancing drug EPO at the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   If the new test is endorsed as expected by the IOCs legal
commission and executive board later this month, between 300 and
700 out-of-competition tests will be conducted randomly in Sydney
from Sept. 2, when the Olympic Village opens, until the conclusion
of the Games on Oct. 1, said Dr. Patrick Schamasch, the IOCs
medical director. Out-of-competition tests, which are administered
without notice, are considered the only reliable way to catch drug
cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Erythropoietin, known as EPO, is produced naturally by the
kidneys and stimulates the production of red blood cells. A
synthetic version can be a wonder drug for those who suffer from
anemia and AIDS and those who are undergoing chemotherapy. In elite
sport, however, EPO is believed to be used widely and illicitly to
increase oxygen-carrying capacity in endurance sports such as
cycling, distance running and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   EPO was at the center of the Tour de France drug scandal in
1998, which led to enormous pressure by international governments
for the IOC to develop a reliable method to detect the drug's use.
For the Sydney Games, scientists intend to use an
Australian-developed blood test in combination with a urine test
developed by French researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Each test has its strengths and weaknesses. The blood test can
detect the use of EPO over several weeks, but only indirectly. The
urine test can detect direct use of EPO, but only for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions remain about an EPO test for Sydney, scientists
and drug-testing experts said Tuesday. Has the fast-tracked test
undergone sufficient peer review? Can it withstand legal scrutiny?
Will a significant number of so-called false positives ruin
athletes' reputations unfairly? How much of a deterrent will the
test actually create in Sydney, after athletes have already
benefited from the training advantages provided by EPO?
</P>
<P>
   Even with the detectability of EPO, the use of
performance-enhancing drugs is likely to be extensive at the Sydney
Games. There will be no tests to detect substances like
human-growth hormone, insulin-growth factor and products that work
essentially as artificial blood. Drug use has become so
sophisticated that athletes use topical steroid gels that flush
from the system in hours. Some drug-testing experts also believe
that the introduction of an EPO test will simply lead athletes to
return to undetectable blood doping, in which blood is removed from
a particular athlete and later reinserted to increase
oxygen-carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, however, athletes who use EPO now face the
possibility that they could be caught while at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we achieved a major step,'' Schamasch said in a
telephone conference call from IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the drugs that remain undetectable, he said: ``It's
a step you know. Paris wasn't built in one day. The final victory
against doping needs to be done step by step. Many steps build a
stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a professor of medicine at New York
University and an expert on performance-enhancing drugs, said that
although he believed the introduction of an EPO test was
significant, he wished there had been more time to validate the
test for athletes who live at various altitudes and with respect to
sex and race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the issues that always surface when someone tests
positive,'' Wadler said. ``The lawyers are going to feast on
whether this has been validated sufficiently by an independent
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion, who will head
an independent American drug-testing agency after the Sydney Games,
said an EPO test was a ``huge step'' in the fight against drug
cheats. But, he added, simply instituting the test in Sydney would
create only a mild deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC is serious about treating the issue as a drug problem
instead of a public-relations problem, Shorter said, it would begin
using or threatening to use the EPO test immediately, saving urine
and blood samples of athletes taken now and through the Sydney
Games. Thus, cheating athletes would be worried that they might be
caught now or later, and a real deterrent would be created for the
Summer Games, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is an opportunity to shift the psychological advantage
from cheaters to clean athletes,'' Shorter said. ``Let's not fall
asleep now.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor who is an authority on
performance-enhancing drugs and a longtime critic of the IOCs
drug-testing procedures, reacted skeptically. ``Nothing's changing
here,'' he said. ``Somebody tell me why athletes won't go back to
blood doping. These Games are going to be as drug laden as the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis said he was concerned that what he called the
``short-circuiting'' of the scientific method to approve an EPO
test might result in innocent athletes being accused unfairly. He
said the test ``smacked of public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After four decades of pathetic behavior, the stench of
hypocrisy is overwhelming,'' he said, noting that the IOC had
fallen years and millions of dollars behind in research for drug
tests. ``If they expect me to get warm and fuzzy feelings, sorry,
I'm burned out after four decades of disingenuous behavior.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: COLORIZING THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The African-Americans and Latinos being paraded
across the stage at the Republican Convention are intended to give
a hip, multicultural feel _ and dispel the pervasive notion that
the GOP is largely a party of, by and for white Americans. But
subtract the minority props _ the break dancers and the gospel
choir and the beaming schoolchildren _ and what you have is the
same ultra-white party that shocked many Americans' sensibilities
at the 1992 and 1996 conventions. The deluge of black and Latin
faces on display in Philadelphia is deceptive, given that the
party's delegates and senior managers are as white as they have
ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the realization among the party fathers that Americans
have grown uncomfortable with unremitting whiteness is a
breakthrough in itself. The problem for the GOP is how to move from
patronizing spectacles like this one, in which blacks and Latinos
serve as props, to a state of affairs where minority Americans are
both welcomed and actively recruited into the party as full-fledged
participants. Given the party's recent history of code words and
writing off the minority vote, it will take more than break dancers
on the convention stage to change this picture.
</P>
<P>
   This seemingly colorized convention in Philadelphia is in fact
very white, with black voters accounting for 4 percent of the
delegates and Asians about 2 percent. It may seem difficult to
believe, but the Philadelphia convention is whiter than the
convention of 1992, whose whiteness provoked many voters to reject
the GOP in favor of the multicultural Democrats. The Philadelphia
convention is whiter even than the convention of 1912, when 6
percent of the delegates were black. That gathering sent William
Howard Taft into his doomed re-election run and resulted in the
worst defeat ever experienced by an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the party, angered that Taft had defeated the comeback
effort of their favorite, former President Theodore Roosevelt,
engineered a change in the rules. This undercut the strength of the
South, where most black voters, many of whom were Republicans,
still lived. The 6 percent figure for black delegates has been a
high-water mark since then.
</P>
<P>
   Black people were pushed further and further away, beginning in
the 1960s, when the GOP adopted its famed Southern strategy and
sought to portray the Democrats as hostile to white Southern
interests. This alienation reached its zenith in the 1980s, when
the party used divisive tactics as a way of getting out the white
vote.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy was helpful in the short term. But it ignored
demographic and attitudinal changes that would soon make it
self-defeating. First, white Americans, who make up about 80
percent of the population today, are a steadily shrinking majority,
losing ground to Americans of Latin, Asian and African descent. The
inevitable ``browning'' of America is happening fastest among
school-age children, where nonwhites will become the majority by
the year 2050. The Democrats went where the votes were, and by now
their party enrollment shows it. The Democratic National Committee
is 21 percent blacks, with blacks and Latinos in the highest
positions throughout the party.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has given lip service to correcting this imbalance,
awarding blacks and women largely symbolic positions in the party,
typically through auxiliaries like the New Majority Council, where
black people are isolated in outreach efforts, with little or no
effect on policy. The Republican National Committee, for example,
has few black members, most from the Virgin Islands and only one
from the mainland United States.
</P>
<P>
   The stage in Philadelphia is brimming with minority faces. But
among the delegates and in the convention hall the crowds are
unremittingly white. Black people have been strategically placed
throughout the hall to show up on television, next to George and
Barbara Bush, for example, or near other important Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As at the last convention, the Oklahoma Republican J.C. Watts is
omnipresent, this time as the master of ceremonies, but close
viewers of these events are beginning to notice that he is the only
black Republican elected official of any national standing involved
in these proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   For many African-Americans, this strategic deployment of blacks
as props and symbols suggests a symbolic form of minstrelsy, with a
Republican Party that has historically dismissed black voters as
irrelevant now seeking to erase that history by dressing up in
blackface.
</P>
<P>
   The truth here is that the party has written off black voters
for this election and is directing its entreaties to the white,
moderate suburbanites who abandoned the party in the last two
elections to vote for Bill Clinton. The ploy of cosmetically
colorizing the GOP could work once, but it is unlikely to work
forever. As the nation browns, the Republican Party will either
brown with it or be swept away.

 (ATTN: Kan., Conn.)   By MEL GUSSOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Showalter, a prolific character actor in movies and theater
and on television, died July 30 in Middletown, Conn. He was 83 and
lived in Chester, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In his long and varied career, Showalter acted in two movies
with Marilyn Monroe (``Niagara'' and ``Bus Stop''), and also worked
with Mary Martin, Susan Hayward, Lucille Ball and Bo Derek (in
``10,'' starring Dudley Moore). He had his longest run as Horace
Vandergelder in ``Hello, Dolly!,'' on tour and on Broadway, playing
opposite Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Betsy Palmer, Marilyn Maye and
Carol Channing.
</P>
<P>
   During his days in Hollywood in the 1950s, he acted under the
name Casey Adams. He appeared in more than 1,000 television shows
and on Broadway in ``Make Mine Manhattan'' with Sid Caesar. In 1976
he played Captain Andy in ``Showboat'' at the Jones Beach Theater
in Wantagh, N.Y. He also toured with a one-man show in which he
played the piano and reminisced about his life in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter composed scores for seven musicals, including
``Harrigan 'n' Hart,'' on Broadway in 1985, and the Christmas
musical ``Touch of the Child,'' performed at various theaters in
Connecticut. He also wrote special material for nightclub acts. He
painted as well, and had several one-man shows.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was born in Caldwell, Kan. After appearing in many
plays at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, he made his Broadway
debut in 1938 in ``Knights of Song,'' directed by Oscar Hammerstein
II. His second musical, Jerome Kern's ``Very Warm for May,'' was
directed by Hammerstein and Vincente Minnelli. When he was in the
Army during World War II, he performed in ``This Is the Army.''
While that show was on tour, Irving Berlin wrote a song for him,
``Kick in the Pants.''
</P>
<P>
   His first film was ``Always Leave Them Laughing'' in 1949 (with
Milton Berle and Bert Lahr). That was followed by dozens more,
including ``With a Song in My Heart,'' ``What Price Glory'' (with
James Cagney), ``Night People,'' ``Summer and Smoke,'' ``The Music
Man,'' ``Sex and the Single Girl,'' ``Fate Is the Hunter,'' ``Lord
Love a Duck,'' ``Sixteen Candles'' and, in 1984, ``Racing with the
Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, as Casey Adams, he acted with Doris Day and Jack Lemmon
in ``It Happened to Jane'' on location in Chester, and became
attached to the area. Many years later, he decided to move there
and bought an 1830s farmhouse. He was active in local theaters in
Connecticut, including the Goodspeed Opera House and the Eugene
O'Neill Theater Center. He left his collection of letters and
memorabilia to the Goodspeed Library of Musical Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Ann Philpott of Fresno, Calif. &QL;

TV SPORTS: MILLER AND `MONDAY' LAG EARLY IN GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ABC wanted to generate a buzz by bringing Dennis Miller to
``Monday Night Football,'' it got it.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave came in June when the network hired the comedian.
</P>
<P>
   The second came with his debut Monday night from Canton, Ohio,
where the New England Patriots played the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today placed the Miller story atop its front page Tuesday,
and employed a six-person reporting team to record reaction in New
York, Seattle, Philadelphia, Cheney, Wash., and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn of Miller Time was judged more important at the
national newspaper than the Republican National Convention or the
failure of a no-confidence vote in the Israeli parliament against
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Miller's political gibes won him USA Today's top spot: he
called the Democrats and the Republicans ``4-12 teams'' and said
George W. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee,
possessed the same ``deer-in-the-headlights look'' shown by the
49ers' backup quarterback, Giovanni Carmazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people cared enough to register their opinion about
Miller, a profane and witty comic whose trademark is a topical rant
on his weekly HBO program, which he has parlayed into best-selling
books.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Web sites conducted Miller polls. In a survey of
70,000 America Online members, 29.6 percent said Miller was ``fine
and adds something to the telecast,'' but 25.9 percent said he was
``bad'' and suggested that ABC find someone new.
</P>
<P>
   But 37.2 percent said the new ``Monday Night'' threesome of
Miller, Al Michaels and Dan Fouts was ``no better or worse'' than
last year's Michaels-Boomer Esiason team. Esiason was fired in
March. The fans' favorite ``Monday Night'' crew? Howard Cosell,
Frank Gifford and Don Meredith, with 36.2 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   At ESPN.com, 38.4 percent of more than 158,000 online voters
gave Miller a B for his performance, while 25.6 percent graded him
a C. Eleven percent flunked him.
</P>
<P>
   At CNN/SI.com, 45 percent of the 12,584 who voted dubbed Miller
great, but 26 percent sent a loud message: ``Bring Boomer back.''
The Web site augmented its survey with a digest of eight newspaper
critiques of Miller's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports said about 50 newspaper critics weighed in on Miller,
focusing on a single subject the way they do only for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The most withering assessment came from Leonard Shapiro of The
Washington Post: ``Hired last month to act as a lightning rod for
what has become a tranquil telecast, Miller's presence created
barely enough electricity to power a flashlight, let alone
jump-start ABC's marquee pro football attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks can't orchestrate such interest _ and since hiring
Miller, ABC has worked to reduce expectations by refusing interview
requests for him _ especially for a comedian analyzing a preseason
game.
</P>
<P>
   But seven weeks of anticipation of what Miller would say and how
he would behave guaranteed more attention than ``Monday Night'' has
garnered in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is banking that he will be a 21st century version of Cosell
_ or will at least be a reliable voice of outrageousness. At XTRA,
a sports radio station in San Diego, Lee Hamilton, a talk show
host, said a large majority of callers viewed Miller negatively,
some complaining that his commentary was sacrilegious to the church
of ``Monday Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's debut spurred at least 150 viewers to leave messages
overnight _ more than the usual 90 _ mostly to register their
displeasure. Adam Freifeld, a spokesman for ABC Sports, said that
most of the calls to ABC are routinely negative, and these followed
suit. Another 25 to 30 e-mail messages were received.
</P>
<P>
   But one measure of interest slipped. The rating for the New
England-San Francisco game tumbled 28 percent to a 7.3 from a 10.1
last year when Cleveland played Dallas in a close overtime game.
ABC started Monday's game at 7 p.m. Eastern, an hour earlier than
last year, a shift that lost viewers. The rating peaked with a 7.8
rating from 9 to 9:30.  &QL;

THE DEFENSE DEBATE BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention in Philadelphia set aside its
nurturing themes about children Tuesday night and returned to the
traditional GOP territory of defense policy and military strength.
Popular war heroes like former Senator Bob Dole and Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf implied that the Clinton administration had let
veterans down and allowed defenses to erode. But a strangely
wistful note was left by the keynote speaker, Sen. John McCain, the
self-described ``distant runner-up'' whose generous praise of Gov.
George W. Bush was leavened with intimations of his own mortality.
His address seemed designed to echo Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
farewell and perhaps to suggest a subtext of ``I shall return'' if
Bush falters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speeches are usually aimed at firing up the crowd with
partisan attacks. McCain's subdued approach was in keeping with the
placid mood decreed for this convention by Bush. How many
Republicans will be convinced by his praise of the prospective
nominee as ``my friend'' remains to be seen. Moreover, McCain, a
former prisoner of war in Vietnam, linked his own identity with the
Texas governor by means of a convoluted generational and military
framework. Noting that Bush's father had served in the Navy under
his own grandfather, Adm. John McCain, he said: ``Now it is my turn
to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the podium Tuesday night seemed like a kind of
class reunion for the gulf war had pitfalls as well as advantages
for Bush. Like the choice of former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
for vice president, the evening reminded the audience that the war
was the high point of Bush's father's term in the White House,
without offering much of a suggestion about the policies of another
Bush presidency. Some listeners might also recall that as a senator
from Tennessee, Al Gore broke with many Democrats and supported the
war. The idea that military spending suddenly declined under
President Clinton is also based partly on myth. The Pentagon budget
began declining under President Bush and has risen in recent years
under Clinton and his Republican defense secretary, William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Convention speeches are not things to be confused with subtle
foreign policy pronouncements. But there has been a certain
confusion about Republican declarations on foreign policy that Bush
will eventually have to clear up in the presidential campaign. The
most extensive statements on the subject have come from the
governor's main foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who also
spoke at the convention Tuesday night. Her criticism of the
administration is that it has spent too much time on trivial
``humanitarian'' interests and failed to cultivate major allies or
deal seriously with potential rivals like China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As it has in all things, the Republican Convention has papered
over cleavages within Republican ranks on foreign policy. Bush had
to repudiate his own congressional leadership early this year when
he called for support of American peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo.
Working cooperatively with American allies sounds good in
principle, but Bush seems determined to embark on a risky missile
defense system that major European allies regard as unworkable.
Sorting these issues out will come only when Gore gets a chance to
challenge Bush after the conventions. All that Americans learned
Tuesday night was the importance of military strength. How that
strength is to be used will have to be elucidated in the campaign
to come.

CHRISTIAN COALITION PRAISES BUSH'S NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   PHILADELPHIA _ Not gone and not
forgotten was the message of the Christian Coalition of America
during a rally of more than 2,000 supporters at a downtown hotel
Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coalition leaders said Tuesday they are pleased with the
Republican ticket and mostly happy with the GOP platform, which
includes an unwavering stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition founder Pat Robertson, who sought the White House in
1988, commended nominee George W. Bush in a speech to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our candidate,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition did not have a clear favorite for president early
in the campaign. Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft courted the group's
favor in his exploratory White House bid, and Pat Buchanan defected
to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican convention delegates attended the rally, which
organizers said was larger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the Christian Coalition was dead,'' Robertson said.
``I tell you, they ought to tell the Fire Department here that the
largest ballroom in the Downtown Marriott Hotel is jammed packed
with corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was preceded by a series of speakers from Congress,
including Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas. Brownback said historic
Philadelphia ``is a great place to reflect'' on American values and
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let's look at the other party and where they are going to
be celebrating,'' Brownback said, alluding to plans for a
Democratic event at the mansion of Playboy magazine publisher Hugh
Hefner during its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, they will celebrate not liberty, but license, not
virtue but vice,'' Brownback said. ``The values of the Playboy
mansion do not belong in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft did not attend the rally. An organizer of the event
said he would have been welcome but had schedule conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Sigerson, a Nebraska delegate and chairman of his state's
party, said he is happy with what he called a ``pro-family''
platform. He was on the Family and Community Platform committee in
1996 and again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tense doing the platform in 1996,'' Sigerson said.
``No one felt good when it was done. This time there were smiles on
everyone's face.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at the rally want the party to follow up on its
anti-abortion platform by letting someone speak on the issue at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Said Colleen Parro, a Texas abortion opponent, ``...it is the
pro-life movement's responsibility to raise the issue and keep it
before the campaign and the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority and a
leader of religious conservatives, said in an interview on the
floor of the GOP convention that the anti-abortion forces need to
focus on winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura Bush is clearly pro-life,'' he said, and vice
presidential candidate Dick Cheney is more staunchly anti-abortion
than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be quiet,'' he said. ``We need to pray for him
(Bush). And we need to keep our big mouths shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Christian right at the rally wanted the
platform to make a stronger statement on education and immigration,
preferring more local and family control of schools and more
restrictions on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   But moderation of the platform in those respects is not all bad,
said Kevin Denidon, a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to just be the party of upper middle-class white
men,'' he said. ``The basic philosophy is to talk to a wider
audience.''

JUDGMENT IN FLORIDA TOBACCO LAWSUIT HAS READERS FUMING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A miraculous thing
happened after a recent column decrying the $145 billion
punitive-damage verdict against cigarette makers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of more than 50 e-mails and calls, more than 90 percent voiced
enthusiastic agreement with the contention that the award revealed
runaway tort law abuse for the fraud it is. About three-quarters of
those in agreement identified themselves as nonsmokers or former
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The positive response was remarkable because it was the opposite
of previous reactions to commentaries perceived as taking up for
Big Tobacco. In the past the retorts were almost all outraged
disagreement of the ``Dear Sir: You Cur'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a succinct sampling of the tone of most replies:
</P>
<P>
   - It's about time someone told the truth about the tobacco
lawsuit. Everyone wants something for nothing these days.
</P>
<P>
   - When you consider the lead plaintiff is a PHYSICIAN, the claim
that plaintiffs didn't know (of smoking's) risks is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   - Though I am not a smoker and do not care for (secondhand)
smoke, I think the verdict is truly an injustice. ... What's next?
Alcoholics suing liquor companies ... diabetics suing (candy
companies)? Give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   - It is worse than you describe. ... The ``secrets'' about
smoking and addiction//health effects were knowable by anyone with
a library card.
</P>
<P>
   - It seems as if our court system has lost touch with reality. I
feel I'm watching the parade of the emperor wearing no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   - I don't always agree with you, (but) I liked your column. Who
don't we sue to get some sensible jurors? The problem is we are
unwilling to accept responsibilities for our actions.
</P>
<P>
   - With all the taxes government collects (on tobacco sales), I
do not agree that smokers are costing the government.
</P>
<P>
   - Your question (``Why shouldn't smokers sue those involved in
tobacco lawsuits for the economic damage suffered by skyrocketing
cigarette prices?'') is an excellent idea.
</P>
<P>
   - I have criticized your column, but (this one) was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   - In my 65 years of life, the biggest injustice I have seen (is)
the states' class action against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   - I fully agree. ... I (have smoked) for many years (and) am 89
years old. No one ever induced me to smoke. I have always been
warned to NOT smoke.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted this apparent reversal of attitude concerning
legal abuse of Big Tobacco? Although microcosmic in nature, it
seems significant given past reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Americans have always been noted for their
fair-mindedness, even though their sense of fair play has often
abandoned them during the continuing demonization of the tobacco
industry in the pursuit of legal plunder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wretchedly excessive immorality of the exercise is
becoming too grotesque for people of otherwise good conscience to
ignore. As The Economist recently editorialized, it's ``high time
Americans abandoned their misguided attempt to `punish' the
industry through lawsuits'' and instead formulated a rational
scheme for regulating a product that's obviously ``never going to
disappear.''

DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA HELPS FOUND ONLINE EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Got milk? Post it on
the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That is what Kansas City-based Dairy Farmers of America and
seven other dairy organizations expect to happen with the creation
of Dairy.com, an Internet exchange for buying from and selling to
the U.S. dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy consortium joins a wave of other groups with plans for
business-to-business exchanges. They expect the exchanges to lower
costs by joining widespread buyers and sellers and reducing
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Farmland Industries announced that it and five other
large meat companies were creating a meat exchange. In February,
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler said they
would create an exchange to buy from parts suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission as a cooperative is to improve the efficiencies of
our 24,000 members, to help them streamline their enterprises and
make them more profitable,'' said Agi Schafer, spokeswoman for
Dairy Farmers of America. ``Eventually we expect it to be a
one-stop shop. The farmer coming off the field cannot only check
commodity prices but do some comparative shopping for supplies. We
think the information on this site will lower their input costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other founding members of Dairy.com are Dannon Co., Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream, Kraft Foods, Land O Lakes, Leprino Foods,
Schreiber Foods and Suiza Foods. Each has made an equity investment
of $500,000 to $4 million, Schafer said. ``DFA is committed to the
maximum,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dairy Farmers and the other founding members are
financing the start-up of the exchange, it will be open to any
producers or companies in the dairy industry that want to join,
Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is scheduled to open by April 1, 2001, with live
trading of milk, cream and some other commodities. Schafer said the
group is looking for a chief executive for the for-profit company.
It has not yet been decided where the company will have its
headquarters. In the interim, the company is being led by Gregg
Engles, chairman and chief executive of Suiza Foods. Other founding
members will contribute other people and services until the company
is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   The investors expect to generate financing for the operation
through fees paid on transactions made through the exchange. Some
services will carry subscriber fees, Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a dairy farmer might pay a subscription fee for a
management tool that would calculate which cows to keep and which
to sell based on how much feed they consume and how much milk they
produce, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy industry is perfect for this kind of exchange because
many milk products have a short life, Schafer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our products are fresh and perishable. When you need it, you
need it now, and when you have too much, you need to get rid of it
now,'' she said. ``We all are spending hours on the phone looking
for buyers and sellers. This will save us all time, and time is
money.''

VENEZUELA'S POWERFUL PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The voters of Venezuela, craving radical change, have reaffirmed
their confidence in Hugo Chavez, a president who promises a
``peaceful revolution.'' Chavez flattened the country's traditional
political parties in elections in 1998, vowing to end the
corruption and economic mismanagement that have brought a
once-prosperous country to misery. His election this week under a
new Constitution to a full six-year term _ the first of two, he
hopes _ capped his efforts to strengthen presidential authority.
But Venezuelans should be suspicious of how he plans to use his new
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is a former army paratroop colonel who served a jail term
after attempting a military coup in 1992. His charisma,
identification with the poor and revolutionary rhetoric won him the
presidency through the ballot box instead. Once in office he
established an assembly that sacked hundreds of allegedly corrupt
judges, stripped Congress of its powers and rewrote the
Constitution. That document gives him the right to run for a second
consecutive term, reduces civilian oversight of the armed forces
and weakens state and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's political changes have won overwhelming approval from
voters in several elections and referendums, the last of which took
place on Sunday. Besides Chavez's personal victory, his followers
took most state and local government posts. Although they fell
short of the two-thirds majority in the legislature that would in
effect allow him to rule by decree, Chavez supporters still make up
60 percent of the congress. Now, after 18 months of permanent
campaigning, Chavez says that at last he can begin to make real
changes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is reason to doubt that this accumulation of power
will be used to benefit Venezuela. His record on the economy has
been disappointing. The price of oil, Venezuela's mainstay export,
has more than tripled since he took office. But last year the
economy contracted by more than 7 percent. Oil revenues,
disastrously mismanaged in the past, have been no better used under
Chavez. His aggressive anti-business rhetoric has helped inspire
the flight of at least $8 billion to overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also promises to fight corruption, and he has swept out
of office many judges and legislators widely viewed as tainted. But
some of his lieutenants have themselves fallen under suspicion. In
addition, Chavez seems to choose aides not for their effectiveness
but for their loyalty. His emphasis on personal authority undercuts
the construction of institutions that can check official power and
expose abuses _ a necessity for clean government. It would be
ironic and unfortunate if the sweeping authority that Chavez has
accumulated to change Venezuela prevents him from truly breaking
with the past. &QL;

 LIVING IN THE LAP OF BANKRUPTCY, FINANCIER IS CHARGED WITH FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE EATON with ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in the early 1980's when many Americans first
started putting their money in the stock market, Robert E. Brennan
was probably the most prominent pitchman drawing them in, inviting
television viewers across the country to take a flyer on hot,
little-known stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the clatter of his helicopter he shouted, ``Come grow with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Us'' was First Jersey Securities, which a
federal judge in New York later ruled was not a brokerage house,
but a fraud factory; and a New Jersey judge called Brennan not a
fabled financier, but ``a big crook.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Brennan, 56, who had managed to outwit federal and
state securities investigators for decades, was arrested and
charged with criminal fraud and, for the first time, could face a
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal prosecutors say that less than a month after
declaring bankruptcy in 1995, he cashed in $500,000 in gambling
chips and kept the money rather than turning it over to a
court-appointed trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan denied the allegations. Though he has lost or settled
civil complaints and owes $200 million in fines and restitution to
defrauded investors, he had never been charged with a crime until
Tuesday. Until recently, when penny stock fraud exploded, criminal
prosecutors seldom brought securities fraud cases involving penny
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictments were a signal moment in a tangled tale of
financial intrigue that has played out over a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980's, Brennan became a power in New Jersey politics, a
celebrated philanthropist, and a racetrack magnate who tried to buy
the Meadowlands sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed a well-oiled machine for selling cheap stocks
in often dubious companies in which he had an interest. The stocks
were sold by more than 1,000 salesmen making cold calls and reading
from sales scripts. And he taught other ambitious young men how to
conduct the convoluted stock frauds that in recent years have cost
Americans billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Even after First Jersey was shuttered, and Brennan publicly
disgraced, he continued a gold-plated standard of living that
involved traveling from his beachfront home in Florida to Monaco,
Cannes, Paris, London, Istanbul, Thailand and Tahiti, all on a
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Those trips, in fact, prompted both state and federal
prosecutors to ask for bail of $1 million in each court. Brennan
``poses a serious risk of flight,'' said Assistant United States
Attorney Henry E. Klingeman, citing Brennan's penchant for
luxurious living, his French girlfriend, his trips by private jets
and helicopters, and allegations that he has money hidden overseas.
``This defendant has the means to travel in ways that most
defendants don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He was released on $250,000 bail on the state charges, and was
given two days to raise $500,000 bail on the federal charges.
Meanwhile, he is under house arrest, and forbidden to travel except
on scheduled airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Magistrate Stanley R. Chesler in Federal
District Court in Newark, Brennan said he had only $15,000 to
$20,000 in the bank and was restricted by other court orders to
drawing down only $5,000 a month from that amount.
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising a bit in exasperation, he added, ``My lawyers
are probably going to kill me for saying this, but this case might
be a blessing that God sent down so that we can bring all these
allegations that I have secret money all over the world and am
living this extravagant lifestyle to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan had not been expecting his arrest, said his lawyer,
Michael Critchley, noting that law enforcement agents picked him up
about 6:30 Tuesday morning, while taking a shower at an apartment
he maintains at Due Process, his onetime horse farm, which is now a
private golf course.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, Brennan has always been a high roller
in a world whose players generally stick to the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan did not simply squirrel away the money he made; he used
millions of it to buy racehorses, to donate bulletproof vests to
state troopers, and to buy a plane and houses in Brielle, N.J.,
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Juno Beach, Fla. He became chairman of
the board of Seton Hall University; he still owes it millions of
dollars in unfulfilled pledges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he took over a New Jersey brokerage house with
regulatory troubles and renamed it First Jersey Securities. Within
five years, federal securities watchdogs had sued Brennan and his
firm, alleging that they manipulated the shares of several obscure
companies. But because the Securities and Exchange Commission does
not have criminal powers, these were civil suits that did not carry
serious penalties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Brennan technique, as outlined in many civil suits in the
intervening years, has since become familiar to thousands of
Americans who have lost money speculating in the low-priced shares
known as penny stocks. Indeed, the cold-calling salesmen pushing
no-name stocks over the phone have even been depicted for the
noninvesting public in the movie ``Boiler Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, regulators and prosecutors contend, Brennan and his
colleagues controlled all of the shares in a small company, shares
which they pumped up through fake trades and false publicity.
Brokers pushed customers to buy shares, but ignored orders to sell
them, which might depress the price.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shares soared, the stock promoters and dealers would
unload their shares on the unsuspecting public. Then, after they
had cashed in, they would stop supporting the stock price; hapless
investors were usually left holding worthless shares.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, regulators forced First Jersey to sell its brokerage
operations and Brennan seemed to devote himself to horse-racing and
philanthropy. In fact, New Jersey prosecutors say, he was busy
controlling two other penny stock firms that used boiler-room
tactics similar to those at First Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he went on trial in Federal District Court in
Manhattan, facing civil charges of securities fraud brought by
federal regulators. In that case, Judge Richard Owen found him
guilty of a ``massive and continuing fraud'' that hurt thousands of
investors and netted Brennan $75 million in ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Brennan filed for bankruptcy protection, to
keep from having to disgorge his profits. The fight over his assets
has dragged on for years; this spring, Brennan agreed to turn over
the golf course to the bankruptcy trustee in return for more time
to recover money that investigators believe he has hidden in trusts
in places like Gibralter and the island of Nevis.

MCCAIN SOUNDS NOTE OF HARMONY, ENDORSES BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush offered a video salute to his
former rival, Sen. John McCain, calling his vanquished primary
rival a hero as the Arizona senator finally prepared to exit the
presidential campaign stage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain in turn planned a ringing endorsement of Bush, and
steered clear of the campaign finance reform issues that catapulted
the Arizona senator to political prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing speech to the second day of the Republican
National Convention, the senator sought to heal the wounds
inflicted on the party by his primary challenge to Bush. Sounding a
note of harmony, he called on his GOP colleagues to ``build a party
as big as the country we serve,'' according to an advance text of
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for your kindness to a distant runner-up,'' the
senator said. ``I am proud to join you this evening in commanding
to all Americans the man who now represents your best wishes and
mine for the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some among the delegates McCain won in the primary, whom he
released earlier this week, felt regret for what might have been
had McCain's maverick bid for the presidency managed to upset the
well bank-rolled Bush juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senator's supporters seemed upset that their hero
appeared before them to speak not as a reform-advocate but as
Bush's vanquished foe, offering one of the most lavish endorsements
yet of this convention.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected a strongly worded endorsement, since the
senator is still, after all, a loyal Republican. But they had hoped
for the same kind of rousing reform-pushing message that helped
McCain attract so many independents and crossover Democrats in the
primary races and that alienated so many in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Watson, a strident McCain supporter and the minority
leader of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, described the
speech as ``a bittersweet moment'' signaling the final end to
McCain's quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is a bridge-builder. He's using his appearance to
support and unite the party,'' Watson said. ``This is George Bush's
convention, and John McCain is a loyal Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech text, McCain made a point of calling on both
independents and Democrats to join in the effort to elect Bush,
who, he said, ``believes in the greatness of America and the
justice of our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the
country we serve,'' McCain told the convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But absent from his remarks was any direct reference to the
government reform issues that drew 7 million voters to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear that many of those voters will not support the
GOP ticket in November with the senator out of the race. But Watson
predicted that enough would shift their support to Bush to make the
difference in the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain brought a lot of independents and Democrats to the
party. That's his legacy, the new faces and the new blood,'' Watson
said. ``And for him to try to transfer their support to George
Bush, that's a very gracious and proper thing for him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, McCain talked about the greatness of
American and how its strength is built on a ``cause greater than
self-interest.'' He returned to that theme in his endorsement of
the man he once described as a ``phoney reformer'' and a status quo
Republican whose close ties to the right wing elements of the party
would be divisive to the country.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the man who a few months ago was not
qualified to be president in McCain's view, had become a healer
instead of a divider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not
color. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our
politics. He wants us to live for American as one nation.,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him.''

CONTROVERSIAL DEVELOPER SENTENCED FOR PLOTTING TO KILL PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abe Hirschfeld, the flamboyant parking garage
developer, has never been one to go quietly. Nor did he Tuesday
when a Manhattan judge sentenced him to one to three years in
prison for plotting to kill his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the sentence, Hirschfeld asked for and was granted
permission to kiss his wife, Zipora, but he refused to do so while
handcuffed and kicked at court officers who would not free him.
While he was being led away, he lavished a final obscenity upon the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Hirschfeld, 80, has courted trouble and defied
crisis. In 1998, he offered Paula Jones $1 million to settle her
lawsuit against President Clinton. Last year, after his trial on
tax evasion charges ended with a deadlocked jury, he paid jurors
$2,500 each for their work.
</P>
<P>
   And three years ago, according to evidence presented in the
current case, he paid an intermediary $75,000 to hire a hit man to
kill his associate Stanley Stahl, then 72. The two men had
survivor-takes-control agreements covering many of their
properties.
</P>
<P>
   A jury found Hirschfeld guilty of criminal solicitation on June
16.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Hirschfeld praised his own intellect and
legacy in grandiose and disjointed remarks before he was sentenced.
Judge Ira F. Beal of Criminal Court said, before he imposed
sentence, ``This was a mean-spirited crime by a very wealthy man _
out of greed,'' and added, ``The community has a right to see some
form of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was not killed, but died in August after a stroke. But
Stahl's wife, Charisse, said Tuesday in court, ``He is as
responsible as if he shot a gun himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl's life changed the day that he learned of Hirschfeld's
intention to kill him, his wife said. He hired bodyguards, wore a
bullet-proof vest and rode in a bullet-proof limousine. His health
also declined, as he suffered from heart problems and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, she tried to keep him from seeing an article in New
York magazine about Hirschfeld and his plot against Stahl. But on
Aug. 5, he finally read it. ``After he got over being angry,'' she
recalled, ``he said, `I'm so happy to be home.''' Then he went to
the bathroom and fell to the floor, she said. He had suffered a
stroke and died 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Looking gaunt and pale, Hirschfeld challenged Stahl's
statements. He said Stahl did not ride in a bullet-proof limousine,
because he had never listed it as a business expense. He also
denied having plotted to kill Stahl and said he had no financial
incentive. ``No one benefits from dying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he said he had brought a copy of his own will. ``I am not
going to leave my wife or child anything,'' he said. ``I'm going to
build an immigrant hall of fame,'' in which he would feature
himself.

PROTESTERS INCREASE EFFORTS TO DISRUPT GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs 5th graf to update number of protesters arrested) By
FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Scores of protesters were arrested in a running
cat-and-mouse contest with police across downtown thoroughfares on
Tuesday as they sought to disrupt the Republican National
Convention with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The evening rush-hour traffic was turned into gridlock around
City Hall as hundreds of young demonstrators, some of them masked
with bandanas, blocked a main entrance of the interstate highway
and strutted as they pleased at key points in the city, clogging
intersections with only selective interference from police.
</P>
<P>
   With the city intent on maintaining an upbeat convention gleam,
the police clearly worked to avoid the sort of full-scale,
baton-wielding clashes with street demonstrators that occurred last
winter at the World Trade Organization conference and blackened
Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly
worked to steal the media spotlight and create street scenes of
nonstop political protest.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, 3 miles away, remained unfazed. But delegates
increasingly watched the local TV coverage of protests out beyond
their meeting through the slower parts of their pro-forma agenda.
Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around
protest-clogged streets to reach the convention arena in South
Philadelphia. But none were heard demanding a more hard-edged
response from city authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that at least 280 people had been
taken into custody last night. The police said that four officers
were injured and 20 patrol car windows smashed during the day of
increasing disruption. A score of demonstrators, chanting
denunciations of capital punishment, were arrested after blocking
the westbound entrance to the interstate Vine Street Expressway
north of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching!'' they screamed, echoing the
protest of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators on the chaotic streets
around the Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the police seemed well aware of who was watching.
They carefully read arrest warnings three times, then gingerly
arrested the sit-in demonstrators while five news helicopters
hovered overhead and a platoon of reporters and photographers stood
within a few feet of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors representing a score of causes seemed energized by
the day, the most tense and chaotic thus far in the convention
week. They vowed to extend their street tactics further over the
next two days in the downtown blocks around major convention
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' one delegate angrily muttered outside the
Doubletree Hotel south of City Hall as his path was momentarily
blocked by a swirl of demonstrators, police officers and news
workers tying up Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just rebels without a cause,'' declared Erik Lipson, a
38-year-old resident with tickets for the evening convention
session. He watched a two-hour standoff at Broad and Spruce Streets
between police and protesters and was ultimately branded
``bourgeoisie'' by one demonstrator. ``A bunch of spoiled suburban
kids,'' Lipson continued as demonstrators attracted more and more
attention. ``Not a single poor person in that line.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union charged that the police
precipitated the uglier street mood on Tuesday by raiding a West
Philadelphia warehouse where protestors were preparing props and
puppets for passive resistance demonstrations planned for Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The police, to the contrary, said the warehouse was raided
because it was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal
disruptions of the convention week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet
gloves to show the iron fist,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director
of the state ACLU. He referred to the contrast between the
increasing tensions Tuesday and the scene Monday when police chose
to escort rather than confront an illegal march of welfare
protestors for 3 miles down Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the
police said it was necessary. At the same time, Presser deplored
reports of some demonstrators resorting to vandalism and setting
trash fires as they raced through the streets. ``The whole city
loses if this situation deteriorates,'' Presser warned.
</P>
<P>
   For all the day's traffic disruptions, there was no large-scale
property damage and no outright clashes between the police and the
main clots of protestors as they marched and darted to different
points in the city.

 &HT;    McCAIN SUPPORTS BUSH AS 'FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY'
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain, a reformer who earlier this
year branded George W. Bush as a snapshot of what's wrong with
politics, hailed him Tuesday night as ``the man who now represents
your best wishes and mine for the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''
McCain, who had been Bush's prime and bitter foe for the GOP
presidential nomination, told Republican National Convention
delegates who rose to their feet and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's warm words for Bush came on a night when the convention
concentrated on national defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As commander in chief, I will rebuild America's military and
strengthen our alliances,'' Bush told delegates in a remote hookup
from Gettysburg, Pa., where he campaigned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, delegates saluted former Presidents Gerald Ford,
Ronald Reagan (who was represented by his wife, Nancy) and George
Bush. The elder Bush also appeared in a video presentation, saying
his son's record ``can stand all the scrutiny in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-presidents were honored on a day when the tightly
choreographed convention was threatened by disruption from
protesters on the streets and delegates in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north of the First Union Center, the sports arena
housing the convention, Philadelphia police arrested at least 230
people as protesters clogged downtown streets where many delegates'
hotels were located, sprayed graffiti on city hall and clashed with
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the streets,'' death penalty foe Sue Kelly of
Richmond said during a downtown march and blockade. ``We just don't
like Republicans and what the ruling class stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the arena, a threatened walkout during a free-trade
speech by Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay Republican
in Congress, didn't materialize. About a third of the Texas
delegation, which includes members whose religious beliefs tell
them homosexuality is a sin, prayed silently during the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to pray for Mr. Kolbe to be consistent with the values
of the party,'' said Larry Stevens of Fort Worth, who said a
walkout might have embarrassed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Texas GOP Chair Susan Weddington, who did not join the silent
prayer, said Kolbe should not have been allowed to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to
claim victory for their agenda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's speakers included retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole, his wife, Elizabeth, and Bush
foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, speaking on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that led to Operation Desert Storm,
praised Bush as a man who can restore military might and morale.
</P>
<P>
   The retired general spoke from the USS New Jersey, docked in
nearby Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces and for America if
we could have another commander in chief named George Bush with
Dick Cheney on his team?'' he said, referring to Bush's running
mate, who served as secretary of defense during Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Vietnam POW, used his military background to
make his link to Bush. He noted that the candidate's father served
in World War II under McCain's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's
brave subordinate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remote appearance, Bush returned the kind words from his
new ally, saying McCain's ``straight talk and strong convictions
are admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech offered only mild shot at the political system
he believes is fatally compromised by cash. He coupled it with a
theme often pushed by Bush, who believes partisanship _ not
political money _ is the root of Washington evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, those who hold a public trust have failed to set
the necessary example,'' said McCain, drawing applause. ``Too
often, partisanship seems all consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator offered a stronger campaign finance message
Sunday, when he addressed a so-called ``shadow convention'' at
which he was booed when he mentioned Bush. Prior to his Tuesday
speech, McCain said he was perturbed by the flow of
special-interest money at the convention, which is supported by a
long list of high-dollar donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system's broken. We are addicted to soft money,'' he said,
calling it a ``bipartisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, following a primary battle that grew increasingly
bitter, McCain, calling himself a ``distant runner-up'' and getting
an enthusiastic welcome from the floor, offered a no-holds-barred
endorsement of his ex-foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and
selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to
remember the difference. Tomorrow, our party nominates such a
leader,'' said McCain. ``George Bush believes in the greatness of
America and the justice of our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain got prolonged applause with this line: ``I say to all
Americans; Republican, Democrat or independent, if you believe
America deserves leaders with a purpose more ennobling than
expediency and opportunism, then vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far different tone that McCain adopted in winning seven
primaries, including a New Hampshire contest that changed the tone
of the race, before being ousted in March. When the GOP field
narrowed to Bush and McCain, each man took shots at each other.
McCain accused Bush of being the darling of the religious right and
a candidate tainted by the kind of wealthy special interests who
make politics a fixed game.
</P>
<P>
   After a wealthy Bush friend of Dallas paid for $2.5 million
worth of ads assailing McCain's environmental records, McCain urged
voters in March, ``Do not let the Bush campaign and their cronies
hijack this election with negative ads and $2.5 million of their
dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, McCain called Bush ``a Pat Robertson
Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush fired back in kind, noting that McCain solicited the kind
of special-interest donations he damns. Bush also blasted the
McCain campaign for trying to portray Bush as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later endorsed Bush, who said he would have considered
McCain as a running mate if the senator had not said he didn't want
the job.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP continued a convention aimed at attracting support
from independents and minorities, Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway
criticized the event as a ``masquerade ball _ designed to conceal
the real identity and special interest agenda of the same old
party.'' He noted a New York Times delegate survey that found that
one in five delegates here put their net worth at more than $1
million. Eighty-three percent are white.

PROTESTERS INCREASE EFFORTS TO DISRUPT GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs 5th graf to update number of protesters arrested
Tuesday night) By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Scores of protesters were arrested in a running
cat-and-mouse contest with police across downtown thoroughfares on
Tuesday as they sought to disrupt the Republican National
Convention with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The evening rush-hour traffic was turned into gridlock around
City Hall as hundreds of young demonstrators, some of them masked
with bandanas, blocked a main entrance of the interstate highway
and strutted as they pleased at key points in the city, clogging
intersections with only selective interference from police.
</P>
<P>
   With the city intent on maintaining an upbeat convention gleam,
the police clearly worked to avoid the sort of full-scale,
baton-wielding clashes with street demonstrators that occurred last
winter at the World Trade Organization conference and blackened
Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly
worked to steal the media spotlight and create street scenes of
nonstop political protest.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, 3 miles away, remained unfazed. But delegates
increasingly watched the local TV coverage of protests out beyond
their meeting through the slower parts of their pro-forma agenda.
Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around
protest-clogged streets to reach the convention arena in South
Philadelphia. But none were heard demanding a more hard-edged
response from city authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that at least 280 people had been
taken into custody on Tuesday night. The police said that four
officers were injured and 20 patrol car windows smashed during the
day of increasing disruption. A score of demonstrators, chanting
denunciations of capital punishment, were arrested after blocking
the westbound entrance to the interstate Vine Street Expressway
north of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching!'' they screamed, echoing the
protest of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators on the chaotic streets
around the Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, the police seemed well aware of who was watching.
They carefully read arrest warnings three times, then gingerly
arrested the sit-in demonstrators while five news helicopters
hovered overhead and a platoon of reporters and photographers stood
within a few feet of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors representing a score of causes seemed energized by
the day, the most tense and chaotic thus far in the convention
week. They vowed to extend their street tactics further over the
next two days in the downtown blocks around major convention
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' one delegate angrily muttered outside the
Doubletree Hotel south of City Hall as his path was momentarily
blocked by a swirl of demonstrators, police officers and news
workers tying up Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just rebels without a cause,'' declared Erik Lipson, a
38-year-old resident with tickets for the evening convention
session. He watched a two-hour standoff at Broad and Spruce Streets
between police and protesters and was ultimately branded
``bourgeoisie'' by one demonstrator. ``A bunch of spoiled suburban
kids,'' Lipson continued as demonstrators attracted more and more
attention. ``Not a single poor person in that line.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union charged that the police
precipitated the uglier street mood on Tuesday by raiding a West
Philadelphia warehouse where protestors were preparing props and
puppets for passive resistance demonstrations planned for Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The police, to the contrary, said the warehouse was raided
because it was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal
disruptions of the convention week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet
gloves to show the iron fist,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director
of the state ACLU. He referred to the contrast between the
increasing tensions Tuesday and the scene Monday when police chose
to escort rather than confront an illegal march of welfare
protestors for 3 miles down Broad Street.
</P>
<P>
   Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the
police said it was necessary. At the same time, Presser deplored
reports of some demonstrators resorting to vandalism and setting
trash fires as they raced through the streets. ``The whole city
loses if this situation deteriorates,'' Presser warned.
</P>
<P>
   For all the day's traffic disruptions, there was no large-scale
property damage and no outright clashes between the police and the
main clots of protestors as they marched and darted to different
points in the city.

TOYS `R' US PLANNING 100,000-SQUARE-FOOT SUPERSTORE ON TIMES
SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an expensive bid to re-establish itself as the top
retailer in its field, Toys ``R'' Us announced Tuesday that it
would open the world's largest toy store amid the tourist-choked
streets and neon-infused ballyhoo of Times Square in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-enclosed, 101,000-square-foot superstore at the
northeast corner of Broadway and 44th Street will feature a
60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel offering customers panoramic views
of the stuffed toys, action figures, dolls, science kits and
electronic games available on three floors, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives who have seen the company's plans said
Toys ``R'' Us would spend about $35 million to build the store,
which will sit opposite the MTV music studios and ABC-TV's studios
for ``Good Morning America.'' They said the company would pay about
$12 million a year in rent for the store and the animated video
screens and billboards overhead.
</P>
<P>
   It would be not only the largest toy store in the world, but
also the largest retail outlet in Times Square, one-third larger
than the Virgin Megastore one block north. The company is hoping
that the flagship store, scheduled to open next summer, will be so
dazzling and media friendly that toy manufacturers will flock to
the site to unveil new products, much the same way music groups
introduce new songs at the MTV studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the center of the toy universe,'' John Eyler, chief
executive of Toys ``R'' Us, said Tuesday. ``We expect to draw over
20 million visitors a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The company described the new flagship store as one step in the
company's campaign to regain its position as the No. 1 toy
retailer, which it lost to Wal-Mart two years ago, and to develop
the same kind of cachet as its smaller but more upscale rival,
F.A.O. Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   It could be an expensive gamble, some retail experts said. Theme
restaurants, entertainment centers and movie theaters have moved to
Times Square in recent years. But many traditional retailers have
been put off by the enormous rents, as much as $300 per square foot
on the ground floor, more than twice as much as in many other areas
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Gap and the Virgin Megastore moved to Times Square well
before the once-dowdy area rebounded in the late '90s and rents
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, will customers brave streets crammed with tourists,
teen-age music fans, office workers and theatergoers to buy toys?
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that's going on in Times Square, I think they'll do
well there,'' said Jeffrey Winnick, a retail consultant. ``People
are buying records, Warner Brothers and Disney products. Why not
toys? They'll have foot traffic and it'll be great P-R for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyler, who joined Toys ``R'' Us as chief executive in January,
said he had been seeking a flagship location in Times Square, but
it was hard to find a large enough space. Brad Mendelson, a broker
with Insignia/ESG, eventually took the company to 1514 Broadway,
the former home of the Roundabout Theater, which offered big floors
with 38-foot ceilings and few columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we can do things three-dimensionally,'' said Eyler,
who plans to include a cafe in the store.

   McCAIN DELIVERS SOLID BUSH ENDORSEMENT, MUCH TO DISMAY OF
EX-McCAIN BACKERS
</P>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD
</P>
<P>
   c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush offered a video salute to his
former rival, Sen. John McCain, calling his vanquished primary
rival a hero as the Arizona senator finally prepared to exit the
presidential campaign stage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain in turn planned a ringing endorsement of Bush, and
steered clear of the campaign finance reform issues that catapulted
the Arizona senator to political prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing speech to the second day of the Republican
National Convention, the senator sought to heal the wounds
inflicted on the party by his primary challenge to Bush. Sounding a
note of harmony, he called on his GOP colleagues to ``build a party
as big as the country we serve,'' according to an advance text of
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for your kindness to a distant runner-up,'' the
senator said. ``I am proud to join you this evening in commanding
to all Americans the man who now represents your best wishes and
mine for the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some among the delegates McCain won in the primary felt regret
for what might have been had McCain's maverick bid for the
presidency upset the well financed Bush juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senator's supporters seemed upset that their hero
spoke not as a reform-advocate but instead offered one of the most
lavish Bush endorsements of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected a strongly worded endorsement, since the
senator is still, after all, a loyal Republican. But they had hoped
for the same kind of rousing reform-pushing message that helped
McCain attract so many independents and crossover Democrats in the
primary races and that alienated so many in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Watson, a strident McCain supporter and the minority
leader of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, described the
speech as ``a bittersweet moment'' signaling the final end to
McCain's quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is a bridge-builder. He's using his appearance to
support and unite the party,'' Watson said. ``This is George Bush's
convention, and John McCain is a loyal Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech text, McCain made a point of calling on both
independents and Democrats to join in the effort to elect Bush,
who, he said, ``believes in the greatness of America and the
justice of our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the
country we serve,'' McCain told the convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But absent from his remarks was any direct reference to the
government reform issues that drew 7 million voters to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear that many of those voters will not support the
GOP ticket in November with the senator out of the race. But Watson
predicted that enough would shift their support to Bush to make the
difference in the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain brought a lot of independents and Democrats to the
party. That's his legacy, the new faces and the new blood,'' Watson
said. ``And for him to try to transfer their support to George
Bush, that's a very gracious and proper thing for him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, McCain talked about the greatness of
American and how its strength is built on a ``cause greater than
self-interest.'' He returned to that theme in his endorsement of
the man he once described as a ``phoney reformer'' and a status quo
Republican whose close ties to the right wing elements of the party
would be divisive to the country.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the man who a few months ago was not
qualified to be president in McCain's view, had become a healer
instead of a divider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not
color. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our
politics. He wants us to live for America as one nation,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''

HOLYFIELD DEFLECTS JABS ON TITLE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield has spent a lifetime building a reputation as
a warrior, a true champion. But as he pursues another title in his
long career, he finds himself answering questions of just how
worthy his pursuit is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will try to capture the heavyweight crown for the
fourth time when he takes on John Ruiz for the vacant World Boxing
Association championship in Las Vegas on Aug 12. But the belt they
are fighting for was taken away from Lennox Lewis this year when
Lewis refused to defend the title against Ruiz, who is ranked as
the No. 1 contender, and opted instead to take on Michael Grant,
whom he beat handily.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Holyfield and Ruiz fighting for the belt, but
Holyfield had a hard time convincing inquisitors on Tuesday that he
deserved a chance to lay claim to the belt that he could not take
from Lewis in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't feel that it's tainted,'' said Holyfield, who also
has a long-range goal of taking Lewis' World Boxing Council and
International Boxing Federation titles. ``Because I look at what
this game's always been: when you don't follow rules and
regulations, you lose your title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would be the same question with Lennox, how he got
his first belt. A lot of people didn't beat the champion. I look at
that and say, `Why does it have to be different with me?' I chose
to go by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I feel I should be the champion now, but the
decision didn't swing my way,'' Holyfield said. ``I decided to keep
fighting, and the guy who was the best didn't follow the
regulations and he forfeited his belt. I don't feel ashamed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has maintained his belief that the Nov. 13, 1999,
decision he lost to Lewis that cost him his IBF and WBA titles was
tainted, with the judges making up for a perceived slight against
Lewis in a draw against Holyfield eight months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody that watched the fight knows that in that
fight I did beat Lennox,'' Holyfield said. ``They bring up the
first fight, but in the first fight they didn't take it from
Lennox, either. The next fight people say they corrected and made
it right, but they didn't. But that's no complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to fight because I believe in my ability to take it
again. I have a goal, to be undisputed champion of the world. I
fight for reasons. I have a goal. I believe that I'm the best even
if I don't fight a guy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who will turn 38 shortly after the fight, has
compiled a 36-4-1 record in a career filled with highlights.
</P>
<P>
   But this fight, originally scheduled for June 10 before an
injury to Holyfield caused a postponement, will be hard-pressed to
be seen as one of them.
</P>
<P>
   For Ruiz (36-3), his biggest fight came four years ago when he
faced David Tua and was knocked out in just 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I answer that?'' Ruiz said rhetorically. ``I put
myself on the line so many times. First of all, I wanted to fight
Michael Grant, then he decides to sign up with Lennox Lewis for a
fight. Lennox totally avoided me. What am I to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically going out there, going by the rules and I'm the
No. 1 contender in the WBC and WBA, which I earned. Nothing I can
say is going to change minds. I've definitely got a lot to prove,''
Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think much about Lennox Lewis. He's done a lot
in his career, but I feel he'll never be the great champion like
Holyfield, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think when his career is done he'll be put in with
those names. I feel that he just doesn't want to give a young guy a
chance and follow the rules, basically.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' Task at Hand  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas is also having a hard time keeping his attention
on the task at hand, having to make his way past Ross Thompson
(24-3-1) on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas before he can take on Felix
Trinidad on Dec. 2, the fight he is looking forward to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get up for fight like this, to be honest with
you,'' said the 22-year-old Vargas (19-0), the IBF junior
middleweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get up for it, because I know after I get through
this fight I've got Trinidad. That's my main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get this one out of the way fast. I want to look
great. I'm training hard. I feel this is my big fight right now,
not Trinidad.'' &QL;

ROGER BATZEL, 78, NUCLEAR CHEMIST, LIVERMORE DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Idaho)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Roger E. Batzel, a nuclear chemist and former director of
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, died July 29 at a
hospital in San Ramon, Calif. He was 78 and had homes in Danville
and Mount Shasta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He had a major heart attack five days earlier, the laboratory
said.
</P>
<P>
   Batzel was the laboratory's sixth director, serving for more
than one-third of its history, from 1971 to 1988. Livermore is now
operated by the University of California for the U.S. Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Batzel joined the staff in 1953, a year after Livermore opened,
and was both a manager and a researcher throughout his career.
High-energy nuclear reactions were among his principal interests.
</P>
<P>
   He was named head of the chemistry department in 1959. As an
associate director, he led, in turn, nuclear testing, space
reactors and biomedical sections for Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a crucial role in the growth and transition of our
lab from a defense and nuclear facility to a multiprogram
institution dedicated to solving the important scientific issues of
our time,'' said Dr. Bruce Tarter, the current director.
</P>
<P>
   When Batzel took over as director, the laboratory had 5,400
employees and a budget of $128 million. When he retired in 1988,
there were 8,000 employees and a budget of $815 million.
</P>
<P>
   Founded at the site of the former Livermore Naval Air Station,
the laboratory was part of the U.S. response to the Soviet nuclear
weapons program. Recently it has turned to applying its work to
fields like ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Elwood Batzel was born in Weiser, Idaho. He graduated in
chemical engineering from the University of Idaho in 1947 and
received a Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry from the University of
California at Berkeley in 1951. His mentor at Berkeley was Dr.
Glenn T. Seaborg, who shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry that year
and later served as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Batzel is survived by his wife of 54 years, Edwina Grindstaff
Batzel; two daughters, Stella L. Batzel of Washington and Stacy L.
McMillan of San Ramon; a son, Roger E., of Davis, Calif.; a
brother, Larry, of Seattle; two sisters, Naomi Blacker of Moscow,
Idaho, and Delpha Noble of Ogden, Utah; and two grandsons.

ANALYSIS: THE CAMPAIGN GETS PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add two grafs at end.)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The former president had been biting his tongue,
sacrificing his anger to his heir's ambitions. The current
president had been rocking on his heels, letting his disciple fight
his own battles.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with a volley of words that unearthed genuine emotion
amid a contrived spectacle, two leaders who had pledged to let the
2000 election be about the future are demonstrating how much of it
is about the past _ about lingering animosities, dueling legacies,
competing claims to vindication and rivals with the names Bush and
Clinton, not Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on NBC's ``Today'' show Tuesday
morning, former President Bush put President Clinton on warning,
telling him that if he persisted in belittling Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the former president's eldest son, he would be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tempted to get off the reservation,'' Bush told Jamie
Gangel, as he took at least a half-step across the line. ``But I'll
tell you what I'm going to do: I'm going to wait a month. Now, you
give me a call; I'll give you the home number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he continues that,'' he went on, referring to the
president who usurped him, ``I'm going to tell the nation what I
think about him as a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was responding to a swipe that Clinton had taken at the
Texas governor last week, when Clinton said that ``the message of
the Bush campaign is just that, `How bad could I be? I've been
governor of Texas, my daddy was president.'''
</P>
<P>
   But President Bush was also proving how thoroughly he had come
to hover over this race in the last few weeks, pulled back into it
by those who think his memory will do them good and by those who
think his memory will do their opponent harm.
</P>
<P>
   His son's choice of Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary,
as a running mate seemed to mark a kind of turning point in the
Texas governor's campaign. While Gov. Bush had for months kept his
father at a political distance, he now seems to be hugging him
tight. In interviews and conversations with reporters in the days
after he formally announced the selection of Cheney, Gov. Bush
gushed and gushed about Dad.
</P>
<P>
   And Dad himself loped back into the picture, sitting down with
Gangel and sitting front and center at the convention on Monday
night. Nearby was Cheney, who served in his administration. Up on
stage was retired Gen. Colin Powell, another member of the Beltway
brigade who waged the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, has unleashed himself. To rally the Democratic
faithful at fund-raisers over the last few weeks, he has repeatedly
denigrated the man who not only preceded him in the Oval Office
but, as Clinton tells it, left America in shambles in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was in the ditch,'' Clinton said in Boston on
Friday. ``And the politics of Washington, D.C., was like watching,
I don't know, `Wayne's World' or something to most of us who lived
out here in the world, the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the juncture in a presidential election when
each man's heir is supposed to be coming into his own. But the two
presidents are overshadowing the process by giving newly candid,
newly bracing glimpses into how much they dislike each other, an
antipathy that frames how their would-be successors see each other
and sell themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prime-time hour of the first night of the
Republican convention here was largely about Clinton, even though
no one uttered his name.
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Bush, the Texas governor's wife, talked about all the
parents who tell her husband that they want their children to be
able ``to respect the president of the United States,'' the ghost
in that sentence was Clinton, and he was plenty visible to members
of the audience, who cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell said that Gov. Bush ``comes from a family with a
generations-long tradition of public service'' and would ``bring
character and integrity to the Oval Office,'' the obvious point of
contrast was Clinton, not Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Texas governor, campaigning in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, went further and, like his father, took Clinton on
directly, saying that the president's recent insults showed that he
was ``so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore
elected, he'll say anything.'' The subject, yet again, was not a
would-be president's agenda but a will-have-been president's
self-conscious place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides expressed delight at the turn of events, saying
that President Bush's Today show interview rooted out the
bitterness beneath all the sweetness of the convention, disrupted
the intricate choreography and cast the Texas governor as too
feeble to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the whole thing tells people a lot about George
Jr.,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's advisers and supporters agree that the elder Bush is
a window into the younger one, but they have a different take on
what it shows: carefully nurtured values of honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be betting, more and more, that voters will
share that vision: The convention Tuesday night featured a video
tribute to the former president, prominently showcasing his face
and voice. Not so long ago, his eldest son's stump speeches had
only the most oblique reference to him, a line about the Texas
governor being the beneficiary of ``some pretty good training'' for
the office he was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist said that as soon as the Texas
governor hooked up with Cheney, there could no longer be any
pretense that President Bush was not a part of his political
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official who sometimes advises the Bush campaign
said that the Texas governor had reached a point in his campaign
where he had proved his mettle, and that he could now acknowledge
his parents more openly. Polls have shown that a sizable majority
of voters have favorable opinions of the former president and the
former first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But several people close to the former president said that his
remarks about Clinton and the amount of attention they garnered
were not a political plot. It was all much more personal, President
Bush's friends said, and it betrayed a simmering ire that his son's
big moment and his son's big party were being crashed by a man who,
in the former president's view, had no manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Clinton beat him,'' said one of these friends,
trying to explain President Bush's perspective. ``It's that Clinton
has no respect for the presidency.''

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Former President Bush threatened Tuesday to end
his self-imposed silence about President Clinton's character if he
persists in mocking his son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait a month ... and if he continues that, then
I'm going to tell the nation what I think about him (Clinton) as a
human being and a person,'' the former president said on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was driven from the White House by Clinton eight years
ago, has kept a low profile in George W. Bush's bid for the
presidency and has no formal role in this week's GOP convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush said Tuesday they want
to remain on the sidelines but find it hard as Clinton and others
criticize their oldest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is a great man,'' Barbara Bush said. ``He'll
take care of it. He doesn't need his mother, although she's dying
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the former president faced his share of criticism while in
the White House, he said, ``it's much worse when they criticize
your son.''
</P>
<P>
   What stirred their ire were recent assessments by Clinton about
George W. Bush's campaign and why he is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strategy is to talk about compromise and all that and
it's a brilliant strategy, a pretty package, and they're hoping if
they wrap it tight enough nobody will open it before Christmas,''
Clinton said in Tampa, Fla., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Clinton said Bush was running because his father
had been president. ``Nearest I can tell, the message of the Bush
campaign is just that, `How bad could I be? I've been governor of
Texas. My daddy was president. I've owned a baseball team,'''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family reaction is another sign the GOP candidate still
lives in his father's shadow, said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you something about George Jr. He has to send his
father out to defend him,'' Lehane said. ``People are starting to
wonder, does he have what it takes?''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said he welcomes Clinton's criticism. ``It's
amazing to me the president of the United States would spend time
trying to be a political pundit,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so desperate to have his legacy intact by having Al Gore
elected he'll say anything, just like Al Gore will,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush says he does not speak ill of Clinton or Gore, he
was reminded Tuesday that he has told several audiences that his
running mate, Dick Cheney, is a man who knows what the definition
of the word ``is'' is.
</P>
<P>
   The wordplay is a reference to one of President Clinton's early,
obtuse explanations of his affair with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was talking about him then, I sure was,'' Bush
acknowledged, adding that the remark was ``in the context of having
somebody who is going to shoot straight with the American people,
and Dick Cheney is a straight-shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also is not directing his comments at Clinton when
he talks about restoring morality to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people walk up and say, `Don't let us down,' we're just
reporting what's happening. I don't think I've ever mentioned
President Clinton's name on the stump recently,'' Bush told
reporters in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than an hour later in Charleston, W.Va., Bush said
the ``nation is looking for an administration that will appeal to
our better angels, not our darker impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore,``
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later told reporters he had been ``riled up'' by questions
about Clinton's comments and his name had just slipped out.
</P>

   Chronicle reporter David Ivanovich contributed to this story.

 &HT;    McCAIN SUPPORTS BUSH AS 'FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY'
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain, a reformer who earlier this
year branded George W. Bush as a snapshot of what's wrong with
politics, hailed him Tuesday night as ``the man who now represents
your best wishes and mine for the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''
McCain, who had been Bush's prime and bitter foe for the GOP
presidential nomination, told Republican National Convention
delegates who rose to their feet and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's warm words for Bush came on a night when the convention
concentrated on national defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As commander in chief, I will rebuild America's military and
strengthen our alliances,'' Bush told delegates in a remote hookup
from Gettysburg, Pa., where he campaigned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, delegates saluted former Presidents Gerald Ford,
Ronald Reagan (who was represented by his wife, Nancy) and George
Bush. The elder Bush also appeared in a video presentation, saying
his son's record ``can stand all the scrutiny in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-presidents were honored on a day when the tightly
choreographed convention was threatened by disruption from
protesters on the streets and delegates in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north of the First Union Center, the sports arena
housing the convention, Philadelphia police arrested at least 230
people as protesters clogged downtown streets where many delegates'
hotels were located, sprayed graffiti on city hall and clashed with
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the streets,'' death penalty foe Sue Kelly of
Richmond said during a downtown march and blockade. ``We just don't
like Republicans and what the ruling class stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the arena, a threatened walkout during a free-trade
speech by Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay Republican
in Congress, didn't materialize. About a third of the Texas
delegation, which includes members whose religious beliefs tell
them homosexuality is a sin, prayed silently during the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to pray for Mr. Kolbe to be consistent with the values
of the party,'' said Larry Stevens of Fort Worth, who said a
walkout might have embarrassed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Texas GOP Chair Susan Weddington, who did not join the silent
prayer, said Kolbe should not have been allowed to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to
claim victory for their agenda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's speakers included retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole, his wife, Elizabeth, and Bush
foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, speaking on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that led to Operation Desert Storm,
praised Bush as a man who can restore military might and morale.
</P>
<P>
   The retired general spoke from the USS New Jersey, docked in
nearby Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces and for America if
we could have another commander in chief named George Bush with
Dick Cheney on his team?'' he said, referring to Bush's running
mate, who served as secretary of defense during Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Vietnam POW, used his military background to
make his link to Bush. He noted that the candidate's father served
in World War II under McCain's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's
brave subordinate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his remote appearance, Bush returned the kind words from his
new ally, saying McCain's ``straight talk and strong convictions
are admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech offered only mild shot at the political system
he believes is fatally compromised by cash. He coupled it with a
theme often pushed by Bush, who believes partisanship _ not
political money _ is the root of Washington evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, those who hold a public trust have failed to set
the necessary example,'' said McCain, drawing applause. ``Too
often, partisanship seems all consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator offered a stronger campaign finance message
Sunday, when he addressed a so-called ``shadow convention'' at
which he was booed when he mentioned Bush. Prior to his Tuesday
speech, McCain said he was perturbed by the flow of
special-interest money at the convention, which is supported by a
long list of high-dollar donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system's broken. We are addicted to soft money,'' he said,
calling it a ``bipartisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, following a primary battle that grew increasingly
bitter, McCain, calling himself a ``distant runner-up'' and getting
an enthusiastic welcome from the floor, offered a no-holds-barred
endorsement of his ex-foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to forget in politics where principle ends and
selfishness begins. It takes leaders of courage and character to
remember the difference. Tomorrow, our party nominates such a
leader,'' said McCain. ``George Bush believes in the greatness of
America and the justice of our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain got prolonged applause with this line: ``I say to all
Americans; Republican, Democrat or independent, if you believe
America deserves leaders with a purpose more ennobling than
expediency and opportunism, then vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far different tone that McCain adopted in winning seven
primaries, including a New Hampshire contest that changed the tone
of the race, before being ousted in March. When the GOP field
narrowed to Bush and McCain, each man took shots at each other.
McCain accused Bush of being the darling of the religious right and
a candidate tainted by the kind of wealthy special interests who
make politics a fixed game.
</P>
<P>
   After a wealthy Bush friend of Dallas paid for $2.5 million
worth of ads assailing McCain's environmental records, McCain urged
voters in March, ``Do not let the Bush campaign and their cronies
hijack this election with negative ads and $2.5 million of their
dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, McCain called Bush ``a Pat Robertson
Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush fired back in kind, noting that McCain solicited the kind
of special-interest donations he damns. Bush also blasted the
McCain campaign for trying to portray Bush as anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later endorsed Bush, who said he would have considered
McCain as a running mate if the senator had not said he didn't want
the job.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP continued a convention aimed at attracting support
from independents and minorities, Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway
criticized the event as a ``masquerade ball _ designed to conceal
the real identity and special interest agenda of the same old
party.'' He noted a New York Times delegate survey that found that
one in five delegates here put their net worth at more than $1
million. Eighty-three percent are white.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain shed his rebellious image to
play the admiring party stalwart at the Republican National
Convention Tuesday night, commending Gov. George W. Bush to
independents and Democrats and _ addressing one of the governor's
most pronounced vulnerabilities _ saying he would ably defend the
nation's interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him,'' McCain said in his prepared remarks, trying
to erase tensions from a primary battle that had been so raw that
McCain waited two months to reluctantly endorse Bush. ``I am
grateful to him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech anchored an evening whose overarching objective
was to assemble several faces, old and new, to assure the national
viewing audience that Bush could be trusted on the international
stage despite his failure to serve in Vietnam and the fact that, by
his own admission, his foreign policy experience does not stretch
beyond Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the chorus in the other high-profile speech was
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser who,
as an African American, also underscores Bush's pledge to put
minorities in consequential roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George W. Bush I know is a man of uncommonly good
judgment,'' Rice, a national security council official in former
President Bush's administration, said in her prepared remarks. ``He
is focused and consistent. He believes that we Americans are at our
best when we exercise power without fanfare or arrogance. He speaks
plainly and with a positive spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches were testimonials to the personal ability McCain,
Rice and the other speakers perceived in Bush, but offered little
on specific policies or countries.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to shore up Bush's record, a cavalcade of
speakers reminded the public of Republican presidents like Ronald
Reagan and George Bush who were known for eliciting respect for
America abroad and for their emphasis on national security.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war, appeared via satellite from a battleship,
reminding the convention that ``10 years ago tomorrow, Iraq invaded
Kuwait.'' He asked: ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces,
and for America, if we could have another commander in chief named
George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago who was wounded
in World War II, asked the audience to ``join me in saluting the
greatest generation of veterans and every generation of our armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who had a starring role at the convention in
1996 when she spoke reverentially of her husband, said that
``timeless values form our first line of defense.'' Bush, she said,
``will put an end to the smash-mouth politics of recent years and
to the name-calling that tarnishes our trust and alienates so many
real people whose real problems can never be solved in a focus
group or soothed by a spin doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the theme of military might, there was a video
tribute to World War II veterans and a musical medley of military
service anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's popularity afforded him the freedom to play to a broader
audience outside the hall by giving a speaking slot (albeit not in
prime time) to an openly gay congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, who spoke about international trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks, several members of the Texas delegation
protested by taking off their cowboy hats and bowing their heads in
prayer. Most of the delegates were respectful but offered Kolbe
only weak applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all the way there with our party,'' Kolbe, speaking
of his party's policy toward homosexuals, said on ``Political
Points,'' the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ``The
Democratic Party isn't all the way there yet either in terms of its
treatment of minorities and other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   So concerted was the outreach to Democrats from the stage here
that the convention played a videotape featuring the words of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gauzy, smiling images of moderation from the stage,
there were stirrings of resentment among some conservatives who
voiced concerns that the convention did not truly reflect their
views. At a crowded Christian Coalition rally at a downtown hotel,
delegates seemed thrilled to hear some of the conservative, red
meat rhetoric missing from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a convention of sweetness and light,'' Pat
Robertson, the coalition's founder, declared to the crowd. ``Nobody
wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike St. Clair, a delegate from Ankeny, Iowa, complained that
the party was not putting forth enough contrast with the Democrats.
``There must be some contrast, otherwise it is hard for people to
become passionate,'' he said. ``You have to be able to see the
differences between the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m., delegates rose in applause to a tableau
representing every living Republican president: Gerald Ford and his
wife, Betty, and Nancy Reagan joined former President and Mrs. Bush
in the prime viewing seats overlooking the convention. Mrs. Dole
also sat with them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the evening was clearly dominated by McCain. The Bush
campaign's decision to give a vanquished rival such a prominent
role on the second night of the convention marked a striking
departure from the last several Republican conventions. At the
convention four years ago, the prized Tuesday night slot was given
to then Rep. Susan Molinari, who had been one of Dole's most loyal
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's decision to give McCain such a high profile
underscored not only that McCain has emerged as an influential
force in his party but also that Bush is so popular among
Republicans that he does not have to worry that McCain would draw
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain clearly recognized that there was no
political upside to stirring up trouble for the Texas governor and
that he could score points by playing the loyal trooper.
Strikingly, he was so determined to fall in line behind Bush that
he did not even raise his signature issue of campaign finance
reform, something he relentlessly brings up every chance he gets.
He even played down his achievement of winning the New Hampshire
and Michigan primaries, calling himself ``a distant runner-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Tuesday night led some of McCain's most ardent
backers to privately grouse that he was being too adulatory, and
abandoning his greatest attribute _ his maverick nature.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who drew a potent following from independents and
Democrats during the primaries, implored his followers to rally
behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent,''
he asserted, ``if you believe America deserves leaders with a
purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote
for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a
soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op, then
vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said McCain knew it was
not in his interest to be a political menace at the convention.
``He has a great future with the party,'' Simpson said. ``You never
want to be known as a poor loser. He wants to be loved like all of
us. He wants to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   While the speakers touched on a panoply of foreign-policy
issues, the matters left unaddressed were telling. For example,
despite Schwarzkopf's praise of former President Bush for leading
the coalition to victory in the Persian Gulf, American warplanes
are still bombing Iraq and President Saddam Hussein is as firmly
entrenched as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Governor Bush would never allow the United States
to be blackmailed by outlaw states, and urged swift construction of
a national missile defense to safeguard against missile strikes.
But she laid out no new plan to defend against stateless terrorists
who might use the much cheaper and equally deadly alternative of a
truck bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Rice depicted Governor Bush as a bilingual
internationalist, meeting with leaders from Mexico, Russia and
South Africa. But, in fact, many of the meetings were little more
than handshakes and hellos. President Thabo Mleki of South Africa
called his visit to the governor's mansion in May a ``courtesy
call.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington in April, Bush met briefly in his hotel with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to discuss Chechnya and the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Beforehand, Bush told reporters he
was looking forward to meeting ``Iggy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a notable contrast to the play for moderates from the hall,
Pat Robertson, at the Christian Coalition gathering earlier in the
day, delivered a rousing speech about the stakes in this election
for religious conservatives, focusing on the Supreme Court. ``Five
people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if two or three of those unelected officials are
getting ready to retire or go on up to that great court in the sky.
The next president is going to have the ability to select two or
three judges on the Supreme Court,'' he added, to cheers and
applause. ``We need to have the election of a man who will appoint
righteous judges to the court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan. I think we
should do away with the federal Department of Education.'' This, of
course, put him distinctly at odds with Bush, who fought hard
against that position in the platform process _ and prevailed.

FORMER WAR HEROES LAUD BUSH AS IDEAL COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF &HT;    (EDS: Updates with quote from Schwarzkopf, Bush; pickup: Two
recent polls)
 &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A triumvirate of war heroes praised Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's qualifications to be commander-in-chief Tuesday
night, with former POW John McCain telling the Republican National
Convention: ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Arizona senator who defeated Bush in seven GOP
primaries earlier this year before bowing out of the race, sought
to reassure voters that the untested Bush ``will confidently defend
our interests and values wherever they are threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that former President George Bush served as a naval
aviator in World War II under McCain's grandfather, an admiral who
commanded aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's
brave subordinate,'' McCain said, adding that Bush was a leader of
``courage and character.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Navy carrier pilot, McCain was shot down in 1967 during the
Vietnam War and spent five and a half years in a North Vietnamese
prison. He was introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., another
decorated veteran of the Vietnam War and a McCain ally on campaign
finance reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Tuesday night's convention session was national
security and foreign policy and allowed Bush to bask in the
reflected glow of some of the nation's most well-known decorated
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McCain, former Sen. Bob Dole and retired Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of allied forces in the Persian
Gulf War, praised Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a decorated World War II veteran and the 1996 GOP
presidential nominee, evoked lengthy applause from the delegates
when he said the nation looks to Bush and Dick Cheney, Bush's
choice for the vice presidential nomination, ``to raise our sights
and to restore honor and civility to public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking via satellite from the decommissioned USS New Jersey
battleship docked in the nearby Delaware River, Schwarzkopf said
the Clinton administration had allowed U.S. military readiness to
dip. He cited enlistment and re-enlistment shortfalls, the
declining preparedness of Army divisions and the increasing number
of military personnel who receive food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf praised the governor's father for his leadership
during the 1990-1991 Gulf War, then asked, ``Wouldn't it be great
for our armed forces and for America if we could have another
commander-in-chief named George Bush with Dick Cheney on his
team?'' Cheney was Bush's secretary of defense during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, who addressed the convention on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, retired from the U.S.
Army in 1991 as a four-star general and is active with numerous
charitable activities and conservation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Condoleeza Rice, a former national security
specialist in President Bush's administration and now a senior
adviser to the Texas governor, told the convention that the younger
Bush already has a deep understanding of when _ and when not _ to
employ the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the numerous peacekeeping missions that
Clinton has committed U.S. troops to, Rice said Bush does not view
the military as ``a global police force. They are not the world's
911,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas for the last five years, Bush has met with
leaders from Russia, South Africa and Mexico, she said. ``I know
that he understands the complexities of our relationship with
China,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Bush would make good on Republican efforts to
deploy a missile defense shield, known as National Missile Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke briefly to the delegates via satellite from
Gettysburg, Pa., saying that under the Clinton administration
``morale is dangerously low'' among troops and that he would
``rebuild'' the military.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent polls indicated the voters believe Bush would do the
better job handling defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll released Monday by the Los Angeles Times, Bush led
Vice President Al Gore 61 percent to 24 percent on the question of
who would do a better job of handling national defense. And an
ABC-Washington Post poll had Bush leading Gore 45 percent to 40
percent on the question of who would best handle foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush spoke to a rally in Charleston, W.Va., on his way
to the convention, sounding the same defense theme and criticizing
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore,''
he told a rally in Charleston, W.Va. ``This nation wants somebody
who will restore the military strength of the United States of
America.''

HATCHET MAN NO MORE, BOB DOLE DISPENSES WIT, PHILOSOPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   PHILADELPHIA _ Four years ago, the stage
was set for Bob Dole to be the Republican nominee for president.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dole's stage was cable TV's Comedy Central, where he
did a routine poking fun at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   A comedown?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, Dole and his supporters said. Besides, two hours
after taping the comedy show, Dole got a thunderous ovation at the
convention when he spoke on veterans affairs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bob Dole is free to be anyone he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a lot of fun,'' Dole said as he strolled the
convention hall Monday night, trailed by reporters, delegates and
well-wishers. ``There's a lot of happy people here. We're going to
win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole went out of his way to greet security guards, ushers and
the elderly, a habit he picked up on the presidential campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ya doin?'' Dole boomed in his familiar baritone.
</P>
<P>
   As for his gig on Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show with Jon
Stewart,'' Dole shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of these things. I've been on Leno a
couple of times, Letterman, `Saturday Night Live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dole serves as political commentator on ``The Daily Show,''
combining serious analysis with his omnipresent wit. He taped the
show before a highly enthusiastic audience at a University of
Pennsylvania studio.
</P>
<P>
   The running gag Tuesday night was the convention's lack of
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been this excited since David Eisenhower married
Julie Nixon,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring?'' Dole said. ``It's so boring, even some of the
protesters were trying to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who came up short in presidential bids in 1980 and 1988
before winning the nomination four years ago, also poked fun at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a little sentimental at conventions,'' Dole said. ``I
always feel like writing a concession speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who will tape another show Thursday, said he hopes
appearing on programs popular with young people will spur their
interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want more people to vote,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole appeared on the show in December 1999 as a guest for a
two-part interview. He and host Jon Stewart hit it off, and Stewart
made an on-air plea for him to return for the conventions. Dole
agreed _ for a fee, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central spokesman Steve Albani said Dole's humorous side
shows now that he's not a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really see it,'' Albani said. ``He's a lot more free.
He's not trying to be Bob Hope. He's first and foremost Bob Dole.
But he's very quick with a quip.''
</P>
<P>
   Albani called the Kansan a bonanza for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just go out and get ourselves a former Republican
nominee,'' he said. ``And having someone who is high-level person
who is completely serious and without a sense of humor would not
work for `The Daily Show.' We're still wondering how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Dole has served as a spokesman for
hire. In the years since his losing presidential bid, Dole has been
a pitchman for Target stores, Air France and Visa. Then, of course,
there was his much-discussed work for Viagra, the sexual stimulant
for men.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from politician to comedian began when he
appeared on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' shortly after
losing to President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole has done more than comedy since 1996. He was an adviser
on the Kosovo conflict and lately his focus is raising money for a
national World War II memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have taken that (1996) defeat and said, `I'm out of
here,' '' said Sen. Sam Brownback, who took over Dole's Senate seat
in Kansas. ``The party could have taken it and said, `That's a
defeat of the World War II generation, and we're moving on.' But
neither happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback and others suggested that if more voters had seen
Dole's humorous side, he would have fared far better four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he can be more effective for Bush than he was for
himself,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri state Sen. Peter Kinder of Cape Girardeau saw it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as a little regrettable,'' said Kinder, a
Republican. ``I would rather see him at CNN or the Fox News Network
than with Comedy Central.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dole had any reservations about his diminished role at the
convention this year compared with four years ago, it hasn't shown.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters this week his political standing at the 1996
convention was far different than the one George W. Bush enjoys
this year. For one thing, Dole was trailing in the polls to
Clinton. This year, Bush is leading Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   There's also something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things Bush won't have to worry about:
Buchanan, Clinton and a sort of confrontational House in the
Congress with Gingrich and so forth,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was referring to Pat Buchanan, the firebrand TV commentator
who abandoned the GOP for the Reform Party; a popular sitting
president; and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a
Georgian who many found to be a polarizing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Bush for reaching out to new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to broaden the base of our party,'' Dole said. ``If
we want to be the majority party, we've got to have an agenda that
will attract people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to accord Dole a coveted evening speaking slot
suggests that he still regards Dole as an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name will continue to be invoked by lots of folks,'' said
Kansas Gov. Bill Graves, head of his state's delegation at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Parkinson, chairman of the Kansas GOP, said he has no
problems with Dole's appearance on Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much bickering and fighting and partisanship,''
Parkinson said. ``If somebody wants to come along and make it a
little humorous, I think that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 77, Dole's ties to his home state have loosened. Graves said
he didn't know the last time Dole had visited, and Parkinson said
he hadn't talked to Dole since he became party chairman early in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas party went through a rough patch after Dole left the
Senate in 1996. One of the party's biggest fund-raisers, Dole
suddenly was no longer bringing in the bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he stopped the fund-raising, the party struggled for a
while,'' Parkinson said. ``We have really had to build up a list of
small donors, which the party never built up because it relied so
heavily on Senator Dole raising money from national contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, said Dole has always had
a sense of humor that came in handy in the U.S. Senate during his
career there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could define the whole U.S. Senate as Comedy Central,''
Roberts said. ``Bob always had the ability to use self-deprecating
humor. I always wish the American electorate had seen the Bob Dole
as we know him.''

   Why party platforms don't really matter
</P>
<P>
   By JANE ELY
</P>
<P>
   c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Political eons ago, when the Democrats dominated
Texas politics, ideologues who managed to become convention
delegates and wanted their party to reflect their causes usually
found themselves shuffled off to make their cases to the
Resolutions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when it came time to consider resolutions, you almost
could hear the train coming through the convention hall as the one
running this political railroad would take a motion to refer
resolutions to the party executive committee, rule it passed and
instantly bang the gavel to adjourn the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1972, the year of George McGovern, did the action change
as the liberals won enough seats to spout every cause and to drag
the doings into the night.
</P>
<P>
   After that, no matter which philosophy dominated the Dems, they
tended to devote little time to arguing ideology. In fact, they
even trended to reducing their national platform to the most
general of statements, written in the briefest _ and pretty much
the blahest _ of language.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a lot longer coming, but, at last, the Republicans
actually may be _ barely _ starting to go through the same
evolution in writing their ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: The platform, which, in comparison to GOP
documents of recent decades, virtually sailed through the
Republican National Convention here, is certainly not brief, and it
absolutely is not blah.
</P>
<P>
   But, for GOPers, especially those as conservative as most
delegates here, there were a fair number of concessions made in
ideology for the sake of George W. Bush, their certain presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the approved platform does not call for the
elimination of the Department of Education, nor does it contain a
lot of the harshness of platforms past.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in obvious concession to Bush, it warmly welcomes
minorities and immigrants to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it sternly sticks to its GOP guns by emphatically
opposing abortion, gay rights and sex education. It covers pages
with the most tedious of details demanding the delegates'
particular wishes and ways be foisted onto all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document leaves one question in particular
unanswered. That is: Is the GOP actually on its way to ultimately
recognizing the reality the platform of the party seldom is truly
the platform of the candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Are Republicans moving to realize that never is a candidate, nor
an elected officeholder, driven purely by the document contrived at
political conventions?
</P>
<P>
   For example, it's one thing for a president to subscribe to the
general tone of his party's platform. It's quite another for him to
expend political capital to achieve what the document dictates. One
has but to look at Ronald Reagan and abortion to recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   By all sane political definition, George W. Bush is a
conservative. Only the most ardent of conservative zealots _ and
there surely are some of those here _ would question it.
</P>
<P>
   But not even they can muster the power or the pure political
guts to do much more than mumble their unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   It is little consolation to those who once again tried in vain
to remove the unyielding anti-abortion language from the GOP
platform, but they can take some relief in knowing lots of
ideologues of polar positions failed to win their ways here as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even Bush, who totally has dominated this confab even
though he has not yet been here, clearly has not had his full way
in the contents and ideology of his party's political platform.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is: While lots of Republicans won their ways in
having input into the party platform, Bush won the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he leaves here to begin _ fully and formally _ his
Republican presidential campaign, GWB may not even have read the
platform produced here.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if modern political tradition prevails, the only ones
besides the most intense Republicans who will read the GOP platform
are the most intense Dems.
</P>
<P>
   And they, just like GOP zealots, will try hard to convince the
nation Bush embraces every word of the platform and will follow it
to the letter if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is most voters won't have read the GOP
platform either. The platform they care about is the one for which
the candidate stands _ not the convention delegates. &QL;

   Hill should stay GOP, Bush says softly
</P>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES
</P>
<P>
   c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ No off-message dissent is being brooked at the
lock-step love-in that is the Republican National Convention, but
the careful listener can pick up faint murmurs of trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the charitable can write it off as merely ``different
emphases.'' But over the next three months, it could blow up into a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are divergent notions of the Bush campaign and the
national Republican Party leadership about how to fight at the same
time to regain the White House and to keep control of Congress.
It's a classic question that's almost always decided in favor of
the presidential candidate doing whatever is necessary to win. If
the House and Senate elections break the party's way, fine; if not,
too bad.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a bit cavalier for Republicans this year, given that
partisan control of the House really does hang in the balance. A
shift of six seats out of 435 to the Democrats would end the GOP
interregnum that began only in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, of course, would rather become president with
Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Unified campaigns
will be run in many states to that end. But as long as the
presidential race remains fairly tight and public dissatisfaction
with the national legislature remains fairly strong, Bush is
unlikely to make retaining Republican control of Congress a major
issue in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican National Committee and the
House and Senate Republican campaign operations will be spending
millions of dollars on generic ads seeking to boost the chances of
the GOP remaining in power on both sides of Capitol Hill. More will
be laid out in individual races.
</P>
<P>
   The differing views of the Bush campaign and the institutional
Republican hierarchy in Washington on this point was evident in
comments to reporters here by Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist,
and Jim Nicholson, RNC &QL; 
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicholson, Armageddon seems to be approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an historic election,'' the chairman said. ``It's really
a parliamentary election'' because the fate of all three branches
of government is at stake. Not since the days of Herbert Hoover
have Republicans controlled the White House and Congress, and had a
majority of Republican-appointed justices on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ages and health of some members of the Supreme Court,
it seems likely that the next president will fill enough vacancies
to alter the precarious 5-4 split on such fractious social issues
as abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's how much we have riding on this thing,'' Nicholson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats share Nicholson's cataclysmic view, and the threat
that they see implicit in a GOP takeover of the entire government
is already a central theme of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise then that Rove was less apocalyptic than
Nicholson in assessing the importance of the congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, we'd like to win,'' Rove said,
sounding like he was discussing a $2 ticket at a dog track.
</P>
<P>
   Rove pledged that the Bush folks will ``do our part'' to
maintain Republican majorities in the House and Senate, but he made
clear that was not the be-all, end-all for the high command in &QL; 
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Rove said, would be ``prepared to deal with whatever kind
of circumstances face him'' on the congressional front.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, in fact, spent more time laying out how Bush had worked
with a divided government in Texas and explaining how the governor
``understood the prerogatives of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   This flows from Bush's theme about returning a bipartisan spirit
of cooperation to Washington, which flows from public disgust at
incessant bickering and &QL; 
gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have developed a perverse affection for divided
government but also an aversion to the constant clashes it seems
destined to produce. So for a presidential candidate to make a
strong, sustained pitch to give his party all the reins of
government could be risky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has even shown he can light into congressional Republicans,
criticizing them last fall for trying to ``balance their budget on
the backs of the poor.'' It was a shrewd bid to distinguish his
``compassionate conservatism'' from the sledgehammer oafishness of
Tom DeLay &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton-Gore engineers the budget train wreck in September or
October that some skeptics foresee and seeks to blame the
Republicans, don't be surprised if Bush's attitude is ``a pox on
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes kicking two dogs is as easy as kicking one.

 ENTREPRENEURS GET STARTED WITH GRANTS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Entrepreneurs with technology visions but little
capital can often get going by trading a big chunk of equity in the
startup to outside investors or borrowing cash at high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another lesser-known option. If they are not in a
hurry for the money and don't mind a load of paperwork or tailoring
their technology for a government application, they might win
millions of dollars in federal and state grants.)
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Bay Area inventors and entrepreneurs have taken
advantage of the federal Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)
program, which approves about $1 billion a year in research and
development grants to small technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can often leverage those grants to get additional
funds from other governmental sources. For example, the California
Technology Investment Partnership (CalTIP) provides more than $6
million a year to about 30 California companies to help them
commercialize their technology and hire local employees.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these and other government R&AMP;D programs, PowerLight of
Berkeley has combined solar energy technology with roofing
materials to produce a 2-for-1 product that provides electricity as
well as covering. Another Berkeley company, Integrated
Magnetoelectronics, is creating a newfangled magnetic memory
storage device for cell phones and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Bay, Acellent Technologies Inc. and Sensant Corp.
are developing sensor and imaging technologies that can peer
beneath the surfaces of aircraft as well as other man-made
structures and humans themselves to detect problems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither federal nor state technology grants require recipients
to pay back anything so ``they're a good way to build up equity,''
said CalTIP program manager Sharon Stagg.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that ``it takes a while.'' Applicants for the
California grants must submit proposals by May, and the winners
(about 1 out of 3 or 4) aren't announced until this month. They
don't get any money until October or November. Federal contracts
can take even longer.
</P>
<P>
   PowerLight
</P>
<P>
   One fan of both SBIR and CalTIP grants is Berkeley entrepreneur
Thomas Dinwoodie.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving master's degrees in mechanical engineering from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he focused on
renewable energy, and in architecture from the University of
California at Berkeley, he came up with the idea of maximizing the
value of expensive photovoltaic cells by building them right into
other building materials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he won a patent for tile that serves as both a roofing
material and solar-electric power plant. He started his company,
PowerLight, and depended heavily on government grants to develop
the dual-purpose tile. His first grant was a $50,000 award from the
Sacramento Municipal Utilities District in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grants have helped us finance our long-term development work
and commercialize the technology,'' said Dinwoodie.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, PowerLight has received more than $5 million in
grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and other federal and
state programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company's year-old manufacturing plant in Berkeley produces
500,000 square feet of electricity-producing tiles annually, enough
to cover the roofs of several hundred commercial buildings and
generate 15 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main product, called PowerGuard, is dark blue tile
that has polystyrene foam on the bottom and a photovoltaic laminate
on top. The product has been installed on flat roofs from the Mauna
Lani hotel and club house in Hawaii, where it supplies nearly all
the hotel's electric power when the sun is shining, to the new
Chabot Observatory in the Oakland, Calif., hills and Clint
Eastwood's new Carmel, Calif., country club. The tiles also have
been installed overseas from Australia to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to $825,000 in federal Small Business Innovation Research
grants, PowerLight also is working on a product for the residential
market. Called SunTile, it looks likes conventional shingles and
can be mounted on many types of roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The energy-generating shingles plug into each other to produce
electricity to run a the house. Whatever power is left over runs
back through the same power lines that bring electricity into the
house for the benefit of other electricity users. The homeowner's
electric meter then runs in reverse direction, lowering and perhaps
eliminating electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   Although PowerLight's products are several times more expensive
than conventional roofing materials, the company says they offer
benefits aside from excellent insulation and protection from the
elements. ``We offer a way to turn your roof into a profit
center,'' said Executive Vice President Daniel Shugar.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Magnetoelectronics, meanwhile, was started by Richard
Spitzer, a former physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, to
develop new types of memory devices that use metallic thin film
rather than silicon or other semiconductor materials.
</P>
<P>
   After raising $600,000 in private capital, IME has relied on
government grants. Since 1996, it has received 13 grants totaling
$4.3 million, including money from the Department of Defense,
Department of Energy, National Science Foundation and CalTIP
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company is primarily interested in large commercial
markets such as memory devices for cell phones and cameras that
retain information when the power is turned off, magnetic memory
chips also have broad military and satellite applications because
the devices are nonvolatile and are not subject to radiation
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting government grants has been a beautiful strategy,''
said Bob Burger, IME's director of development. ``The downside is
you try to fulfill the requirements of the awards but those things
don't necessarily help you get to market very fast.'' To remedy
that, IME is raising $6 million from angel investors to build its
first manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sensor Sensations
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, several Stanford University professors and
graduates with advanced degrees also are tapping government grants
to build high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford aeronautics Professor Fu-Kuo Chang and his former
doctoral student Mark Lin co-founded Acellent Technologies in
Sunnyvale last year to take advantage of sensor technology
advances.
</P>
<P>
   The price of an electronic sensor has declined during the past
decade from as much as $50 to 50 cents. That, together with
advances in software and computing technology, wireless
communications and the Internet, makes it possible to put sensors
in flexible film that can be mounted on or inside aircraft,
bridges, buildings and all sorts of structures to test their
soundness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, hundreds or thousands of sensors could be embedded
at load-bearing and other critical points inside an airplane and
could continually broadcast diagnostic signals. Or, their
measurements could be quickly downloaded and analyzed at regular
intervals, such as at the end of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   Important information can be gained when sensors pick up changes
to the structure caused by corrosion, cracks, delamination of
materials and other damage. Or, by running low electrical current
through the structure, the sensors can analyze the minuscule
vibrations to detect potential weaknesses and predict where a
structure might fail.
</P>
<P>
   While such diagnostic systems for a plane could cost $20,000 or
more, Acellent Director of Technology Mark Lin said they would be
far less expensive, cumbersome and time consuming than current
visual, touch and tap inspections and the occasional use of X-ray
and other probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market could be huge,'' said Chang, who licensed the
technology for Acellent from Stanford. ``Aircraft, trains, ships,
autos, buildings, bridges and other infrastructure all need better
inspection systems. Just look at the unprecedented number of recent
space launch failures.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Military, Technology Meet
</P>
<P>
   Although Acellent is interested primarily in commercial markets,
there are obvious military applications for the technology. Since
September, the company has received $730,000 in SBIR grants from
the Army to investigate whether sensor networks mounted in missile
silos or on portable rocket launchers can quickly and easily
determine whether the equipment is safe to use.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has applied for a $250,000 matching CalTIP
grant to help it commercialize its technology.
</P>
<P>
   If an entrepreneur needs a lot of money and needs it fast, Chang
doesn't recommend applying for government grants. But if a startup
has patent protection, a few years to conduct R&AMP;D and doesn't want
to lose control to outside investors, he recommends government
grants.
</P>
<P>
   However, Acellent next plans to raise about $10 million in
venture capital. That's because, after proving the concept, the
company needs significantly more money to develop commercial
products.
</P>
<P>
   Sensant Corp. also is focused on high-tech monitoring.
Specifically, the San Jose, Calif., firm uses semiconductor
manufacturing techniques to create probes that can translate
ultrasonic signals into 3-D images for superior medical testing.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in 1998 by Igal Ladabaum, who studied
bioengineering at UC Berkeley before receiving a doctorate in
electrical engineering from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   To get an SBIR grant, Sensant redirected its attention from
serving cardiologists to helping the Navy find an easier, faster,
cheaper way to check aircraft for corrosion and other structural
defects. It turns out the inspection problem is much the same.
``Both involve imaging something underneath the skin,'' said Andrew
Cittadine, Sensant's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1999, the San Jose startup has received two SBIR
grants from the Office of Naval Research totaling $520,000 and it
could get another $300,000. Sensant also has applied for a $200,000
CalTIP grant to help commercialize its technology for the $1
billion medical ultrasound probe market.

 STUDY TALLIES VALUE OF S.F. DIGITAL ECONOMY  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's digital industry generated
nearly $4.9 billion last year, nearly five times the amount it made
in 1995, according to a study by the San Francisco Partnership, a
nonprofit business development organization.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the report's findings actually reflect the state of the
digital industry in San Francisco is unclear. Only 60 companies out
of 1,048 companies polled took part in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday, details the tremendous growth of
the Internet, video game and software industries within San
Francisco's city limits. It also shows how this growth is causing
these companies to cope with such problems as the high cost of
office space, lack of skilled workers and high living costs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is a follow-up of a 1995 survey done by accounting
firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for the partnership. This time around,
however, the San Francisco Partnership's own staff updated the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the results, such as the size of the digital
industry's revenues, are extrapolated from the sample of 60
companies. In addition, much of the reporting, especially by the
small private firms that responded to the survey, was not
double-checked.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, nearly 40,000 people work in San
Francisco for digital companies. Another 42,000 people work outside
the city for digital companies that are based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The employment figures could be much higher because the survey
did not count people who work for the online arms of traditional
companies such as stock brokerage Charles Schwab, Kmart and the
Gap. Marie Jones, director of economic development for San
Francisco Partnership, said it couldn't get these figures because
the companies couldn't provide the necessary information.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue figure of $4.9 billion in 1999 shows that the
digital industry is, as expected, a major part of the local
economy. For example, the tourism industry, one of the city's
largest moneymakers, took in $6.55 billion in 1999, according to
the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the digital industry is strong and vital and
is a major piece of our economy,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest challenges to doing business in San Francisco,
according to 61 percent of the study's respondents, is the high
cost of rent. Another 41 percent complained about high wages,
parking scarcity and a lack of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Employee turnover in the digital industry is 24 percent,
according to the survey. But companies do not cite it directly as a
business obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be the focus of a high-wage industry,'' said
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of
the California Economy, a private research company in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``But there are a lot of challenges that come with
success.''

 CALIFORNIA PRICE CAP ON ELECTRICITY HALVED  &HT;     By KELLY YAMANOUCHI 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Under pressure from Gov. Gray Davis and
regulatory agencies, the California Independent System Operator on
Tuesday slashed the maximum price it pays for wholesale power in
half to $250 per megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in a month that the board has taken action
to reduce the price cap from $750 per megawatt, as hot weather
triggered record customer demand and doubled energy bills in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups fear that similar price increases will show up
when the rate freeze on energy bills in Northern California is
lifted in March 2002 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which operates much of the state's electricity grid,
had earlier lowered the maximum rate to $500 per megawatt. Two
other efforts to institute a $250 cap were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Davis and the Electricity Oversight Board,
which oversees the state's electricity market, stepped in and asked
the board to lower the cap to the ``lowest reasonable level.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price last year for a megawatt of energy, which
powers approximately 1,000 households per hour, was $62. On
Tuesday, wholesale energy rates on the state's power exchange hit
the $500 maximum when demand for electricity soared as consumers
cranked up their air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 15 to 6 in favor of the lower cap, with three
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO faced threats from energy generators who said a $250 cap
would push them to sell their energy supply elsewhere. Alex
Goldberg, an attorney for power plant operator Williams Cos., told
the board that lowering the price cap could create a less reliable
electricity supply for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reliability is the primary objective of this board, it is not
controlling prices,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Florio, who sits on the ISO representing the consumer
interest group The Utility Reform Network, told board members that
a recent study of energy rates showed that lowering the price cap
did not result in a loss of supply of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The possible effects of an energy shortage were obvious Tuesday
during the meeting. Pagers and cell phones sounded in the room as
the ISO declared a Stage 2 emergency. It called for large energy
consumers to voluntarily curtail their electricity usage and warned
of the possibility of rolling blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO's decisions are being closely watched by federal and
state authorities. With Davis pushing for action, the state's
Public Utilities Commission and Electricity Oversight Board filed
subpoenas with the ISO last week to gather information for a report
due to the governor by August 1. Davis said he intends to take
strong measures to hold down power rates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said last
week that it would investigate the ISO board. The commission wants
to issue a report by November 1 that will determine whether the
state's energy markets are working competitively, discuss what the
problems are and lay out a course of action.

 GROW A BUSINESS: TWO ATTORNEYS HANG THEIR SHINGLES ONLINE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Setting up online marketplaces can be quite
risky, as stories and stock prices have recently shown. But that
hasn't deterred two San Francisco attorneys from separately giving
up the practice of law to practice entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Dmitry Shubov, who tapped the computer
programming talents of fellow Russian-Jewish immigrants to create
LegalMatch, a Web site to connect lawyers with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Richard Harroch, who retired as partner at San
Francisco's Orrick, Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe to start
LawCommerce.com, an online marketplace where law firms can purchase
legal research, software and other products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Harroch knows a thing or two about law, entrepreneurship and
taking risks. In addition to working on hundreds of corporate deals
and writing a 1,600-page legal treatise, ``Startup &AMP; Emerging
Companies,'' he authored the popular IDG books ``Small Business Kit
for Dummies,'' ``Business Contracts Kit for Dummies'' and ``Poker
for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, Harroch founded AllBusiness.com, a Web service
designed to help small and growing businesses build and manage
their operations. In February, NBC Internet bought the company for
$225 million in stock and Harroch, 47, made more money than he had
in his career as corporate attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than retiring to his hobbies, playing poker and buying
domain names, Harroch got an idea for another Internet play, a B2B
marketplace for the legal community.
</P>
<P>
   Harroch figures the market on the Internet for legal services
and products can be huge. In the United States alone, more than 1
million lawyers purchase in excess of $50 billion in products and
services each year.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent law firms including Wilson Sonsini, Skadden Arps
and Orrick Herrington have invested several million dollars in
Harroch's latest venture. On Friday, Andersen Consulting announced
it has invested in LawCommerce.com and will be a strategic partner.
In addition, more than 30 large law firms from Silicon Valley to
Wall Street have signed on as charter members.
</P>
<P>
   Harroch still finds time for his hobbies. He has participated in
three poker world championships and dabbles in domain names.
Harroch has been offered $10,000 for e-visionary and
eVisionary.com, $15,000 for Administer.com and $75,000 for
e-arbitration and eArbitration.com.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't interested in selling these or other electronic
addresses such as resemble.com, e-achete.com and bazillions.com
that have yet to attract any offers. ``I think good dot-com names
are like San Francisco real estate,'' he said. ``They have
tremendous value and it keeps going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubov has a different business model for LegalMatch.com.
Instead of providing online procurement services for large law
firms, Shubov, 27, envisioned LegalMatch as a type of dating
service where small-business and other consumers of legal services
can check out qualified lawyers online and outline their needs.
Attorneys could then bid for their business.
</P>
<P>
   Shubov immigrated with his parents from Kiev, Ukraine, to Canada
when he was 11 and then moved to the Bay Area where he attended
Lowell High School and later the University of California at
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Then he worked for Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &AMP; Jacobson, a
large New York law firm. During his two years there, Shubov saw the
problem smaller firms and sole practitioners have in attracting new
clients and the difficulties individuals face finding good lawyers
at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to San Francisco to bring the two sides together and
used his connections with the Russian and Jewish programming
community to build LegalMatch.com. Convinced Shubov's idea would
work, about 20 programmers and other experts contributed about $2
million worth of their time. Instead of cash compensation, they
took about 20 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of a converted two-bedroom apartment in San
Francisco's Richmond District, Shubov was able to launch the Web
site this week ( &LR; www.legalmatch.com &LR; ) with only about $300,000 from
friends, family and a few angel investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shubov says his service will provide significantly more than
other Web services such as Lawyer.com and Lawoffice.com, which are
primarily directories of attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses and individuals using the service can fill out
a questionnaire stating the services they are looking for, and
attorneys can advertise their expertise and bid for business.
</P>
<P>
   LegalMatch.com plans to charge law firms $20 to $200 a month for
membership and 3.5 percent commissions on business they book
through the online service. By contrast, Shubov said bar
associations typically take a 12 percent commission for referrals.

MRS. CLINTON, ON OPPONENT'S HOME TURF, SAYS GOP LINES HAVE FAMILIAR
RING By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. _ The day after the Republican National
Convention opened with a call to ``leave no child behind,'' Hillary
Rodham Clinton marveled at how familiar it all seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it sounded like the convention theme was `It Takes a
Village,''' Clinton said with a smirk, referring to the title of
her book, which was ridiculed by conservatives when it was
published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme at the Philadelphia convention on Monday was
actually ``Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind.'' The
phrase appeared in the remarks of many speakers, from experts on
adoption and literacy to Gen. Colin L. Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the issues that were discussed and the way they were
discussed were very much in line with what I've written about and
talked about for 30 years,'' Clinton said on Tuesday, the first day
of a three-day campaign trip on Long Island. ``I'm happy to have
even rhetorical support for our mutual obligation to care for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's remarks came on the home turf of her Republican
opponent for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio. Clinton is likely to
have a much harder time winning votes on Republican-dominated Long
Island, where Lazio was born and raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath all of that soothing rhetoric are very different
ideas about what we should do as a country,'' she told reporters
after a lunch meeting of the Nassau County Village Officials
Association here.``And if the people of New York know the
differences, the Democrats will do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tailored her remarks on Tuesday to the crowds of largely
white, middle-aged and elderly Long Islanders, emphasizing issues
like lowering taxes and her support for using the federal surplus
to preserve Social Security and introduce prescription drug
benefits for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also downplayed her earlier sharp criticism of Lazio,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the imminent Republican nominee for
president, and his designated running mate, Dick Cheney, saying
that she had merely been pointing out facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's an attack to say Governor Bush went to Bob
Jones University, Governor Bush supports the Republican platform
and Supreme Court nominees who are dedicated to doing away with a
woman's right to choose,'' she said. ``I don't think it's negative
or an attack to say here are the facts and let people make their
own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed downright earnest, even returning, for the first
time in months, to the slogan of her book. ``It takes a village to
provide parks,'' she said earlier on Tuesday during a campaign stop
at a neighborhood park. ``It takes a village to keep the streets
safe. It takes a village to provide teachers and resources
necessary to educate our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of villages,'' Clinton observed, ``to help
elect someone to the United States Senate.''

 DRUG OK COULD BE A BOON FOR ALZA CORP.  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved a one-a-day pill for attention-deficit disorder that is
easier to take and possibly more effective than current three-a-day
versions of the commonly prescribed drug Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View,
Calif.'s Alza Corp., which can now enter the $700 million-a-year
market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ADHD makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and
in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when parents are making the decision
to use or not use ADHD medications,'' said Alza chief executive Dr.
Ernest Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Mario said the company will immediately start promoting its
one-a-day capsule to pediatricians. He said Alza could ship the
first pills out of its Vacaville factory ``in a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alza pill is based on the drug methylphenidate, the generic
version of Ritalin, which has been used since the 1950s to control
ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   For the 3 to 5 percent of schoolchildren, mainly boys, who are
believed to have ADHD, pediatricians routinely prescribe Ritalin or
generic alternatives two or three times a day, generally around
mealtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Novartis, the Swiss drug firm that invented Ritalin,
brought out a sustained-release version in 1984, that single-dose
pill has not been widely used by physicians. Dr. Ami Goodman, a
pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, said doctors
typically prescribe the multiple-dose versions because they think
they work better.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said doctors have been hoping for an effective one-a-day
version because fewer children will forget to take the drug. He
said a one-a-day pill would remove the stigma that attaches to kids
who must slip off to the school nurse's office for a noon booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of trying to keep ADHD a more private affair,''
said Goodman, who had no opinion about whether the new Alza formula
would be any more effective than Novartis' little-used
sustained-release pill.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Glen Elliot, a psychiatrist at the University of
California at San Francisco and an Alza consultant, said the
clinical studies leading up to the FDA's approval suggest that Alza
has found the time-release technology that works.
</P>
<P>
   Alza's secret is the pill itself, which is about the size of a
Tic Tac candy. The pill's outer coating is actually a dose of the
drug, which dissolves quickly and begins circulating through the
child's bloodstream when the pill is taken before or after
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   But it is what is inside the pill that counts. The outer shell
dissolves to reveal a tiny plastic pump filled with a 12-hour dose.
The pump works by osmosis. It absorbs water from the body. The
water liquifies tiny amounts of drug and pushes the liquified drug
out a microscopic hole in the pump at a rate calculated to exhaust
the medicine just as the child is finishing homework.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of an easy-to-use pill is sure to fuel the
debate about whether ADHD is overdiagnosed _ and whether Ritalin or
its generic alternatives are overprescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hinshaw, a psychiatrist at the University of California
at Berkeley and an ADHD specialist, was part of a recent National
Institutes of Health study that endorsed the effectiveness of
Ritalin for controlling ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Hinshaw, who is also an Alza consultant, the problem
is that ADHD can be misdiagnosed in two ways: labeling boys with
the condition simply because they are rambunctious, while missing
girls who may have a form of ADHD that shortens their attention
span without making them unruly in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that you can't evaluate ADHD in 10 minutes, but
in some places that's all the time you get with your physician,''
Hinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   For information about ADHD, contact the nonprofit group Children
and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in
Landover, Md. Its Web site ( &LR; www.chadd.org &LR; ) posts links to local
chapters.

 ENTREPRENEURS GET STARTED WITH GRANTS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Entrepreneurs with technology visions but little
capital can often get going by trading a big chunk of equity in the
startup to outside investors or borrowing cash at high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another lesser-known option. If they are not in a
hurry for the money and don't mind a load of paperwork or tailoring
their technology for a government application, they might win
millions of dollars in federal and state grants.)
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Bay Area inventors and entrepreneurs have taken
advantage of the federal Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)
program, which approves about $1 billion a year in research and
development grants to small technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can often leverage those grants to get additional
funds from other governmental sources. For example, the California
Technology Investment Partnership (CalTIP) provides more than $6
million a year to about 30 California companies to help them
commercialize their technology and hire local employees.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these and other government R&AMP;D programs, PowerLight of
Berkeley has combined solar energy technology with roofing
materials to produce a 2-for-1 product that provides electricity as
well as covering. Another Berkeley company, Integrated
Magnetoelectronics, is creating a newfangled magnetic memory
storage device for cell phones and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Bay, Acellent Technologies Inc. and Sensant Corp.
are developing sensor and imaging technologies that can peer
beneath the surfaces of aircraft as well as other man-made
structures and humans themselves to detect problems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither federal nor state technology grants require recipients
to pay back anything so ``they're a good way to build up equity,''
said CalTIP program manager Sharon Stagg.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that ``it takes a while.'' Applicants for the
California grants must submit proposals by May, and the winners
(about 1 out of 3 or 4) aren't announced until this month. They
don't get any money until October or November. Federal contracts
can take even longer.
</P>
<P>
   PowerLight
</P>
<P>
   One fan of both SBIR and CalTIP grants is Berkeley entrepreneur
Thomas Dinwoodie.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving master's degrees in mechanical engineering from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he focused on
renewable energy, and in architecture from the University of
California at Berkeley, he came up with the idea of maximizing the
value of expensive photovoltaic cells by building them right into
other building materials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he won a patent for tile that serves as both a roofing
material and solar-electric power plant. He started his company,
PowerLight, and depended heavily on government grants to develop
the dual-purpose tile. His first grant was a $50,000 award from the
Sacramento Municipal Utilities District in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grants have helped us finance our long-term development work
and commercialize the technology,'' said Dinwoodie.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, PowerLight has received more than $5 million in
grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and other federal and
state programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company's year-old manufacturing plant in Berkeley produces
500,000 square feet of electricity-producing tiles annually, enough
to cover the roofs of several hundred commercial buildings and
generate 15 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main product, called PowerGuard, is dark blue tile
that has polystyrene foam on the bottom and a photovoltaic laminate
on top. The product has been installed on flat roofs from the Mauna
Lani hotel and club house in Hawaii, where it supplies nearly all
the hotel's electric power when the sun is shining, to the new
Chabot Observatory in the Oakland, Calif., hills and Clint
Eastwood's new Carmel, Calif., country club. The tiles also have
been installed overseas from Australia to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to $825,000 in federal Small Business Innovation Research
grants, PowerLight also is working on a product for the residential
market. Called SunTile, it looks likes conventional shingles and
can be mounted on many types of roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The energy-generating shingles plug into each other to produce
electricity to run a the house. Whatever power is left over runs
back through the same power lines that bring electricity into the
house for the benefit of other electricity users. The homeowner's
electric meter then runs in reverse direction, lowering and perhaps
eliminating electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   Although PowerLight's products are several times more expensive
than conventional roofing materials, the company says they offer
benefits aside from excellent insulation and protection from the
elements. ``We offer a way to turn your roof into a profit
center,'' said Executive Vice President Daniel Shugar.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated Magnetoelectronics, meanwhile, was started by Richard
Spitzer, a former physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, to
develop new types of memory devices that use metallic thin film
rather than silicon or other semiconductor materials.
</P>
<P>
   After raising $600,000 in private capital, IME has relied on
government grants. Since 1996, it has received 13 grants totaling
$4.3 million, including money from the Department of Defense,
Department of Energy, National Science Foundation and CalTIP
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company is primarily interested in large commercial
markets such as memory devices for cell phones and cameras that
retain information when the power is turned off, magnetic memory
chips also have broad military and satellite applications because
the devices are nonvolatile and are not subject to radiation
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting government grants has been a beautiful strategy,''
said Bob Burger, IME's director of development. ``The downside is
you try to fulfill the requirements of the awards but those things
don't necessarily help you get to market very fast.'' To remedy
that, IME is raising $6 million from angel investors to build its
first manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sensor Sensations
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, several Stanford University professors and
graduates with advanced degrees also are tapping government grants
to build high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford aeronautics Professor Fu-Kuo Chang and his former
doctoral student Mark Lin co-founded Acellent Technologies in
Sunnyvale last year to take advantage of sensor technology
advances.
</P>
<P>
   The price of an electronic sensor has declined during the past
decade from as much as $50 to 50 cents. That, together with
advances in software and computing technology, wireless
communications and the Internet, makes it possible to put sensors
in flexible film that can be mounted on or inside aircraft,
bridges, buildings and all sorts of structures to test their
soundness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, hundreds or thousands of sensors could be embedded
at load-bearing and other critical points inside an airplane and
could continually broadcast diagnostic signals. Or, their
measurements could be quickly downloaded and analyzed at regular
intervals, such as at the end of each flight.
</P>
<P>
   Important information can be gained when sensors pick up changes
to the structure caused by corrosion, cracks, delamination of
materials and other damage. Or, by running low electrical current
through the structure, the sensors can analyze the minuscule
vibrations to detect potential weaknesses and predict where a
structure might fail.
</P>
<P>
   While such diagnostic systems for a plane could cost $20,000 or
more, Acellent Director of Technology Mark Lin said they would be
far less expensive, cumbersome and time consuming than current
visual, touch and tap inspections and the occasional use of X-ray
and other probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market could be huge,'' said Chang, who licensed the
technology for Acellent from Stanford. ``Aircraft, trains, ships,
autos, buildings, bridges and other infrastructure all need better
inspection systems. Just look at the unprecedented number of recent
space launch failures.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Military, Technology Meet
</P>
<P>
   Although Acellent is interested primarily in commercial markets,
there are obvious military applications for the technology. Since
September, the company has received $730,000 in SBIR grants from
the Army to investigate whether sensor networks mounted in missile
silos or on portable rocket launchers can quickly and easily
determine whether the equipment is safe to use.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has applied for a $250,000 matching CalTIP
grant to help it commercialize its technology.
</P>
<P>
   If an entrepreneur needs a lot of money and needs it fast, Chang
doesn't recommend applying for government grants. But if a startup
has patent protection, a few years to conduct R&AMP;D and doesn't want
to lose control to outside investors, he recommends government
grants.
</P>
<P>
   However, Acellent next plans to raise about $10 million in
venture capital. That's because, after proving the concept, the
company needs significantly more money to develop commercial
products.
</P>
<P>
   Sensant Corp. also is focused on high-tech monitoring.
Specifically, the San Jose, Calif., firm uses semiconductor
manufacturing techniques to create probes that can translate
ultrasonic signals into 3-D images for superior medical testing.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in 1998 by Igal Ladabaum, who studied
bioengineering at UC Berkeley before receiving a doctorate in
electrical engineering from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   To get an SBIR grant, Sensant redirected its attention from
serving cardiologists to helping the Navy find an easier, faster,
cheaper way to check aircraft for corrosion and other structural
defects. It turns out the inspection problem is much the same.
``Both involve imaging something underneath the skin,'' said Andrew
Cittadine, Sensant's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1999, the San Jose startup has received two SBIR
grants from the Office of Naval Research totaling $520,000 and it
could get another $300,000. Sensant also has applied for a $200,000
CalTIP grant to help commercialize its technology for the $1
billion medical ultrasound probe market.

BERTHA HOLT, 96, A LEADER IN INTERNATIONAL ADOPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in
the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands
of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell,
Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Holt first attracted national attention when she and her
husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were
American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a
lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to
watch a film about Amerasian children in Korean orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Holt later
wrote in ``The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on
adoption. ``We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such
bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching
for someone to care.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon
decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50
years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each
wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Holt later recalled, but
each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take
so many.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more
than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the
Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the
Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from
infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the
process easier.
</P>
<P>
   At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a
daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Holt returned to Korea for more children, while Holt found
families in the United States willing to take them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt
International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system
in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children
were the first such large group to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The Holts, who were Baptist, believed, with missionary fervor,
that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American
families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international
adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born
children were adopted in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be
known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt,
works for the Holt agency in Korea. Holt is also survived by nine
other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack,
Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt
and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine
Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19
grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage
shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha
Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was
a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in
nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt.
The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ``custom
farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough
to buy their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Harry Holt
also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the
Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to
the Willamette Valley in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but
in 1950 Harry Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to
prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Holt more time
to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.
</P>
<P>
   While in Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack
and died. Many thought the agency would close, but his wife took
over, traveling endlessly. Holt also worked to improve conditions
at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage
and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other
countries to set up adoption programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what
I think,''' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the
Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, President Johnson named Holt the National Mother of the
Year, and in 1995, she became the only non-Korean to receive the
Korea National Merit Award. But, Cox said, Holt liked to say that
she preferred the photographs that children sent from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home
could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic
background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after
Holt's death.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive
families, Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible,
which she said she had read 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In
1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the
over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush may be
packing the stage of the Republican National Convention with
minority supporters, but his record and appointments destroy the
illusion of an all-inclusive GOP, Democrats said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse called `Vision' that Bush is riding into this
convention on is not real,'' said U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, an
African-American Democrat from Houston. ``If you can't sign a hate
crimes bill when a man in your state was dismembered, how can you
say you include all the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee was referring to the brutal 1998 murder of James
Byrd Jr., a black man who was chained to a pickup by three white
men and dragged to his death near Jasper. Despite pleas from Byrd's
daughter, the Texas governor refused to back a hate crimes bill
last year because it also included protection for crime victims
attacked because they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on hate crimes was one of many racially sensitive
issues pointed out during a news conference organized by the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jackson Lee was joined by Democratic National
Chairman Joe Andrew; U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn.; Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Nelson Diaz, chairman of the Democratic
Hispanic Caucus; and Carol Price, the Maryland coordinator of the
Million Mom March and a mother who lost her 13-year-old son to gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Participants contrasted Bush's record with his claims that the
``new'' Republican Party, though still overwhelmingly white and
affluent, will embrace minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints were Bush's decision to invite retired Gen.
Colin Powell, who is African-American, to address the convention
Monday night vs. his decision to take the stage himself at Bob
Jones University, which prohibited interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized Bush's refusal to condemn the flying
of the Confederate flag above the South Carolina statehouse, and
his opposition to affirmative action programs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's appointment of state Health Commissioner
William R. ``Reyn'' Archer and his appointment of Marshall Police
Chief Charles Williams to head a statewide law enforcement agency
also were criticized, as was his selection of former Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Archer came under fire earlier this year for blaming Texas' high
teen pregnancy rate on a Hispanic culture that he said accepts
teen-age motherhood. Williams sparked a huge outcry when it was
reported that he said in a court deposition that he didn't consider
the term ``porch monkey'' to be racist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended both men, and refused calls to fire them. Williams
later resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as a congressman from Wyoming, voted to abolish the
Department of Education and voted against funding for Head Start,
an educational program that 25 percent of Hispanic children
nationwide participate in. He also voted against a resolution
calling for the release of then South African political prisoner
Nelson Mandela, and, like Bush, has opposed gun control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Diaz, chairman of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, cited
Texas' poor record on providing health insurance for poor children
and criticized Bush for failing to visit South Texas colonias.
About half a million Texans, mostly Hispanic, live in the
unincorporated subdivisions, which lack basic provisions like
running water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on race was prompted by Monday's GOP activities,
which included performances and speeches by several minorities and
featured Powell's prime-time speech. The popular general praised
Bush, but also sharply criticized the party for its stand against
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but you hardly hear a whimper from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with preferences
for special interests,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the NAACP confirmed Tuesday that
the group's president, Kweisi Mfume, had asked Republican Party
leaders if he could address the GOP convention here but received a
counter-offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invited him to speak to a small group of black
Republicans at a reception,'' said Jean Ross, spokeswoman for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``Mr.
Mfume, of course, turned that down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush said he agrees with Powell that the party needs
to do more to reach out to minorities, but he did not support
Powell when asked whether Republicans spend too much time bashing
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I agree with Colin Powell that Republicans need to do more
to reach out to minorities, got a lot of work to do and I agree
with him that I'm the man to do it for the Republican Party,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people heard his message that our party must do a
better job of recruiting minorities and as he said, specifically
African-Americans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The 248 Texas delegates to the convention, who are
overwhelmingly white and social and religious conservatives,
generally gave high marks to Powell's speech, but there were
differences of interpretation on his affirmative action remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was trying to say we should support
affirmative action,'' said Tim Lambert of Lubbock, a member of the
Republican National Committee and an at-large Texas delegate. ``I
think he was saying we ought to be consistent in opposing corporate
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Sam, a teacher from La Marque and one of a handful of
black delegates, said she left the Democratic Party a few years ago
because it was taking minorities for granted. She also lost two
races for Congress as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sam said Powell's speech was ``awesome,'' and she believed it
was a strong endorsement of affirmative action, which she also
supports.

NEW YORK'S GIULIANI CONFIRMS PRELIMINARY CANCER TREATMENT WITH
HORMONE THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
acknowledged for the first time Tuesday night that he has been
undergoing hormone treatments for his prostate cancer for the past
two and a half months.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to indicate that the hormones were a preliminary
therapy and added that he would make a final decision about his
treatment within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which could either be radiation or surgery,'' Giuliani said.
``But luckily the hormones are working.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the hormone treatments had reduced the levels of
prostate-specific antigens in his blood to ``minuscule'' amounts.
``I have no problems right now, except every once in a while it
leaves you a little fatigued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made his comments at the Republican National Convention
here during a live, nationally televised interview on MSNBC with
Tom Brokaw, who immediately asked the mayor about his health.
Giuliani was relaxed and jovial in his response. His manner was in
striking contrast to the verbal lashings he has given to New York
City Hall reporters in recent weeks when they have asked the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after The New York Daily News quoted unnamed sources
who said that the mayor was receiving treatments of the hormone
Lupon, Giuliani angrily reprimanded reporters for trying to confirm
the story during a news conference at City Hall Park. He neither
confirmed nor denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also told Brokaw that he expected his treatments to
take seven or eight months and that he was ``very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made similar remarks in another live television
interview Tuesday night with Judy Woodruff and Bernard Shaw of CNN,
although he did not say specifically at that time that he was
receiving hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced on April 27 that he had prostate cancer in an
early, treatable form. On May 19, citing his cancer, he withdrew
from his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.

HAMPTON DOES THE JOB ALL AROUND AS METS TOP REDS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ See Mike Hampton pitch. See Mike Hampton bat. See
Mike Hampton field. See Mike Hampton sweat in the dugout before the
Mets complete a 3-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Just seeing Mike Hampton in a Mets uniform should be enough for
Shea Stadium fans because he offered no objections to the trade
that brought him to New York. Not that he had a choice when the
deal was made with Houston last winter, but the good guys get
credit no matter what the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the mound Tuesday night, Hampton shut out the Reds
for seven innings before slipping in the eighth and setting the
stage for a parade of three relief pitchers. Armando Benitez
secured the final three outs, but it was the third out that John
Franco got in the eighth inning that was most critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was out there,'' said Hampton, who watched the last
five outs from the dugout. ``It's not any mystery that I don't like
being taken out of the game, but we have a good bullpen. You just
root your teammates on and hope they get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell didn't, giving up a run-scoring triple that put
Dante Bichette 90 feet from a tie game, but Hampton nevertheless
gained his 11th victory against 7 defeats and raised his record for
the past two months to 9-3. Then there were those other
contributions the left-hander made.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping to the plate in the second inning with Bubba Trammell
at third base and Mike Bordick at first on successive no-out
singles, Hampton lofted a sacrifice fly to right field, doubling
the lead to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The run batted in was Hampton's sixth of the season. His rbi
ratio of one per 8.67 at-bats is better than the ratios belonging
to Kurt Abbott, Matt Franco, Lenny Harris (with the Mets) and Rey
Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton displayed the third phase of his triple-threat talent in
the third inning. With two out, Chris Stynes rapped a ground ball
back to the mound. The ball was too far to Hampton's left to snare
with his glove so he quickly stuck out his left foot and knocked
the ball down. In another sport, someone would have said, ``Kick
save and a beauty.'' Having corraled the ball, Hampton coolly bent
over, picked it up and threw to first for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a reaction play,'' Hampton said. ``You see the
ball hit up the middle, I'm trying to kick it or do something with
it. I got it on the bottom of my shoe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Hampton signs with the Mets or another team as a free agent
sometime after the season, his fielding and hitting will be taken
into consideration, but he will get his $12 million or more a year
primarily for his pitching. He did a little bit of that Tuesday
night, too.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first seven innings, he allowed more than one
baserunner in an inning only once, and only once did he allow
runners to advance beyond first base. Those acts both occurred in
the fifth inning, which he ended by inducing Stynes to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, scrambling to catch the St. Louis Cardinals in the
National League West or the Mets in the wild-card race, finally
scored in the eighth inning. Stynes began the inning with a single,
and Barry Larkin lashed a line drive to left that eluded Trammell
and became a run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. grounded out, and Valentine called for Wendell
to face Bichette, who promptly hit a high fly ball that collided
with the right field fence just as Derek Bell did. The ball won,
and Bichette raced to third with a run-scoring triple.
</P>
<P>
   Now Valentine brought in Franco, who, with the infield in,
induced Sean Casey to bounce to first for the second out. But then
he walked Alex Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give him anything good to hit,'' Franco said.
``I wanted to nibble a little bit; maybe I nibbled too much. I
thought maybe he would chase. On the other hand, I didn't want to
walk him, which I did, and put the winning run on. It was a mistake
on my part, but it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago was next, and he worked the count to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking if he comes inside here he has no chance
because it's Johnny's bread and butter,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking. ``I fed him most of the pitches away, away,
away,'' Franco said, ``and kind of froze him up with a two-seam
fastball. Guys who have been with me a lot know I like to freeze
guys up inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Ed Rapuano called the pitch strike three, even though it
appeared to be so much inside that catcher Mike Piazza quickly
moved his glove to show the ball in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion that was a strike,'' Franco protested, unable to
stifle a laugh. ``It was right down the middle and he took it. Let
me enjoy this, please.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Mets, Hampton especially, enjoyed it.

YANKEES TOP ROYALS, 5-4, ON BROSIUS HOMER IN EIGHTH 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dwight Gooden pitched seven strong innings on
Tuesday, giving up only four hits and one walk, as the New York
Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 5-4 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius put the Yanks over the top with a dramatic solo
homer in the eighth inning to break a 4-4 tie. The Yanks' Mike
Stanton picked up the win in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Royals starter Dan Reichert was thoroughly
frustrating the Yankees and stranding runners in bunches, Gooden
kept pace. The Royals nicked him for an unearned run in the fourth
and another run in the fifth, but Gooden had a solid fastball,
precise control and confidence. Gooden, who is now 3-0 with a 1.86
earned run average in five appearances as a Yankee, is making the
team look shrewd for believing in him again. He had been dropped by
the Yankees twice previously before George Steinbrenner
sympathetically offered him one last chance this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, with the Yankees trailing by 2-1, Reichert
issued back-to-back walks to Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter.
Reichert was followed by left-hander Tim Byrdak, who struck out
Paul O'Neill, then gave up a two-run double to Bernie Williams,
which put the Yankees ahead, 3-2. David Justice followed with a
double to make it, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was six outs from his fourth victory with the Yankees and
he had thrown only 79 pitches, but Torre naturally turned to
Stanton in the eighth. A one-out single, a walk and Johnny Damon's
booming double off the right-center-field fence, which was a few
feet from being a three-run homer, tied the score, 4-4. The Royals
later loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson, but he whiffed Joe
Randa and pumped his fist as he returned to the dugout. All of the
Yankees were celebrating a few moments later as Brosius belted
Bottalico's 1-0 pitch over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals had at least a few chances to score in the chaotic
fourth, but managed just one after having three of their players
thrown out on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez reached first when Jeter bounced a throw to first
base, his 14th error of the season. Mark Quinn lined a shot down
the left field line, but, after the ball caromed off the wall in
front of the first row seats, David Justice made a bare-handed
pickup and fired a one-bounce throw to nab Quinn at second. Sanchez
cruised into third.
</P>
<P>
   With the infield drawn in for the Yankees, Jermaine Dye hit a
slow tapper to shortstop. Sanchez inexplicably took three steps
toward the plate, realized Jeter would easily throw him out, tried
to return to third and was caught.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa followed by ripping a bullet to left center field that
scored Dye from first for a 1-0 lead. Randa tried to scoot to third
as Justice bobbled the ball on the warning track, but the relay
throw from Justice to Jose Vizcaino to Brosius got Randa.

 &HT;    Donnan says Dogs can do
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - More than eight months after Georgia's regular season
ended with a controversial fumble at Georgia Tech's 2-yard line,
the Bulldogs are still talking about bad calls.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Georgia announced it was suspending seven of its
players for making unauthorized telephone calls, Bulldogs coach Jim
Donnan addressed a standing-room-only crowd of about 5,000 fans at
a downtown Atlanta hotel. After apologizing for the phone incident,
Donnan quickly turned fans' attention to the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who return 19 starters from last season's 8-4
squad, have been ranked as high as third nationally by one
preseason poll. Georgia was picked to finish second in the SEC East
at last week's media conference in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even (Steve) Spurrier said we have a chance,'' Donnan joked,
referring to the Gators' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although Donnan has tried to temper expectations surrounding his
team in recent weeks, he wasn't backing down on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 55 years to be the head coach of a football
team that has this much potential,'' he said. ``And I guarantee you
that we're going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, entering his fifth season at Georgia, apologized for the
suspensions.Seven players were suspended for one of the first two
games after they charged more than $50 to a university
long-distance access code. Nine other players will pay restitution
and serve community service for charges less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize personally for what happened,'' Donnan said. ``I
wish I could keep tabs on what our players are doing day and night.
It's embarrassing for us and hopefully we'll be able to overcome
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan asked the crowd to focus on the season, which begins
Sept. 2 against Georgia Southern in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people need to understand is that we need to get a sense
of direction around here,'' Donnan said. ``We need to understand
that this team has a chance to do something special. I promise you
that we're going to do a lot more good things than bad things this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of apprehension and expectations about our team
this year, but it should be that way at Georgia. We should be in
the upper echelon every year.''

CONSERVATIVES STILL MAJOR PRESENCE IN GOP
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Away from the don't-rock-the-boat choreography of
the convention hall, more than 2,000 GOP faithful rocked to
conservative religious oratory Tuesday in a hotel ballroom and
showed that Christian conservatives remain a major presence in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``From reading in the media, I thought there was no more
religious right. This is as big as the convention itself,''
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating declared to cheers at the Philadelphia
Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd swayed to the strains of the ``Battle Hymn of the
Republic'' and Lee Greenwood's ``God Bless the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   TV evangelist Pat Robertson, keynoting the ``Faith and Freedom
Celebration'' sponsored by the Christian Coalition, depicted the
presidential election as an opportunity to name U.S. Supreme Court
judges who will reverse the Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortion across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like two or three of these unelected officials are
getting ready to retire or go on to that great unelected court in
the sky,'' said Robertson, an outspoken backer of Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have an election of a man who will appoint
righteous judges to the Supreme Court of the United States,''
Robertson added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will not make the abortion issue a litmus test
for court nominees, although he has expressed admiration for
anti-abortion positions taken by Justices Clarence Thomas and
Anthony Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Flournoy, a GOP delegate from Lufkin, Texas, explained the
outpouring of emotion as ``a hunger for a return to righteousness
in our nation.'' He looked around at the standing-room-only crowd
and added: ``I've never been in a rally of Christian people this
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion and the prospect of a turnover of the nation's highest
court were the crowd's catalysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to elect (in Bush) a president who is
pro-life unapologetically ... who has endorsed a pro-life platform
and picked a pro-life running mate,'' declared Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, lead counsel with the American Center for Law and
Justice, formed by Robertson to litigate against the liberal
American Civil Liberties Union, excoriated recent court rulings
against a Texas high school's prefootball game prayers. ``We have a
Supreme Court protecting pornography and penalizing prayer,''
Sekulow said.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was one of the few unabashedly partisan events at what
has been a deliberately non-controversial GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a convention of sweetness and light,''
Robertson said. ``Nobody wants to rock the boat.'' With that said,
however, the TV evangelist and 1988 presidential candidate
proceeded to rock the ballroom with his oratory.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when Republicans have backed off from their 1996 call
to abolish Cabinet departments, Robertson brought back the earlier
pledge. ``I agree with Ronald Reagan. I think we should do away
with the federal Department of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education actually grew during Reagan's
presidency, but Robertson depicted it as a boondoggling
bureaucracy. ``I promise you, if I could ever get my hands on
one-tenth the budget of the federal Department of Education, there
would not be a single illiterate child in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in their official proceedings, have sought
never to have a repetition of 1992, when defeated GOP presidential
candidate Pat Buchanan declared from the podium that there was ``a
cultural war'' going on in America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many in the Republican Party believe what Buchanan said
that night.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``great cultural battle for the soul of our
country,'' Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas told the crowd. He decried
``cultural pollution'' in the entertainment industry that is, he
said, ``glorifying violence and hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback also noted that a fund-raising party at the upcoming
Democratic National Convention will be held at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they will celebrate not liberty, but license,''
Brownback said. ``The values of the Playboy Mansion do not belong
in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition's clout was noted by one speaker not
usually associated with the religious right. Sen. Mitch McDonnell
of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, praised the group's efforts in turning back proposed
limits on campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear the three words `campaign finance reform,' some
liberal is trying to shut you up,'' McConnell told the rally.
