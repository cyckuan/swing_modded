<HEADLINE> Grand National Horse Race Abandoned After Bomb Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) - The Grand National horse race, one
of Britain's greatest sporting events, had to be abandoned today
after bombing threat were sent to police.
</P>
<P>
Police told officials at Aintree course, near the north-west
city of Liverpool, to evacuate the whole race course and clear the
site after receiving coded warnings of two bombs on the site,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Around 60,000 spectators plus the 38 jockeys were moved off the
site half an hour before the start of the scheduled race early in
the afternoon. Officials later abandoned racing for the rest of
the day.
</P>
<P>
Security forces carried out a controlled explosion at the
course after finding several suspect packages.
</P>
<P>
Although It was not immediately clear who had delivered the
bomb warnings, Prime Minister John Major blamed the IRA again for
the incident, saying he was "appalled that the IRA seem to be
threatening hundreds of thousands of people and causing such
disruption."
</P>
<P>
"This is further demonstration of their contempt and disregard
for the lives and interest of ordinary people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, police found two bombs on road bridges after
receiving coded telephone warnings, and two major motorways had to
be closed for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago the Grand National ended in turmoil in different
circumstances after two false starts led to the race being
declared void.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been trying for more than 25 years to end British
rule of Northern Ireland. It called off a 17-month long ceasefire
in February, 1996, and has since exploded several large bombs on
the British mainland.

<HEADLINE> Italy Tries to Avoid Political Crisis Over Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Refoundation Party of
Italy today reaffirmed its opposition to the Italian-led
multinational protection force (IPF) in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The party's general secretary, Fausto Bertinotti, told
reporters that "there is no room for compromise... We will vote
against the military mission in Albania."
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi warned Bertinotti on Friday
that if the Communists do not support the mission in the Balkan
country, his government could fall.
</P>
<P>
The Communists opposed the IPF mission in a parliamentary
debate earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti said his party does not intend to endanger the Prodi
government although it believes that the military intervention in
Albania is flawed from a political or historical point of view.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the center-left Olive Tree Bloc, including the
Communist Refoundation Party, are expected to meet on April 7 to
seek a common ground on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Olive Tree Bloc formed the Prodi government in April, 1996
after it won 167 of the 315 seats in the Senate and 319 of the 630
seats in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Italian IPF, to be deployed in Albania in the
week beginning on April 14, will protect aid shipments to the
crisis-ridden country as well as the delegations from the European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
to restore order there.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the Italian government has a duty to help Albania,
adding that "the government has made a long-term plan and we
cannot pull back now."
</P>
<P>
He said that since it is the first time Italy assumes the
leadership of a multinational mission, Italy has a responsibility
to see it through to the end.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today warned against
"dangerous divisions" at home and called for concerted efforts to
help Albania out of crisis.

SEOUL, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean semi-governmental
trade official said today that South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) had discussed the possibility of
opening a South Korean trade office in its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Ending an eight-day visit to Pyongyang today, Hong Ji-sun of
the Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said he
held talks with DPRK officials on the business opportunities in
the export processing industry.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the two sides had made progress in opening a
trade office in DPRK's Rajin-Sonbong Free Trade and Economic
Zone. But he declined to give further details.
</P>
<P>
Hong promised to give a press conference on April 7 on the
negotiations, Yonhap News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
KOTRA and DPRK's External Economic Cooperation Committee agreed
in principle in 1995 to open an office of KOTRA in the economic
zone. But tension soon flared up and the plan was not carried
out.

NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Forces of the rebel Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) today
entered zaire's diamond capital of mbuji-mayi in central Zaire, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Mining sources in the town said rebels had streamed in across
a bridge in the morning.
</P>
<P>
``People are cheering in the streets, there's a heck of a lot
of noise. they are treating this as very good news,'' one said.
</P>

The rebels took up arms to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko
last October. They repulsed an offensive launched by government
troops in February and seized Kisengani, the third largest city
in Zaire and vowed to take Lubumbashi in Shaba Province this
month
</P>
<P>
The mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi and the surrounding Kasai
region of central Zaire is a diamond-rich land of opposition to
President Mobutu. Kasai even uses different money to defy the
ailing president and is a crucial test of support for the rebel
alliance.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Aid agencies in eastern Zaire
have called on warring parties in the Great Lakes region to
provide free access to refugees and displaced persons and enable
aid workers to assist them.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement by aid agencies reaching here today said
that "these people's needs must not be overlooked as the Zairean
parties prepare for political negotiations over their country's
future."
</P>
<P>
As representatives of the Zairean government and rebels
prepare to meet in South Africa, the release said, "we appeal to
the participants in the talks to fully consider the urgent
humanitarian needs" of refugees stranded in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that hundreds of thousands of refugees fled
into the rain forest to escape the fighting and violence in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies in the region are trying to aid more than
100,000 refugees who have re-emerged from the forest, the release
said, noting that many thousands of Rwandan and Burundi refugees
remain out of reach.
</P>
<P>
Following the seizure of Zaire's third largest city of
Kisangani late last month, rebels led by Laurent Kabila gave
order to refugees living around the city to leave their temporary
camps.
</P>
<P>
Since then, hundreds of thousands of refugees trapped in the
Zaire jungle near a railway line could die any timei unless aid
workers provide food, water and medicine to them, said the
release.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) has called for effective management of the
environment to halt emerging infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by UNEP reaching here today said that
old infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have
resurged and new diseases like HIV have been discovered during
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that many emerging and resurgent
infectious diseases may have been attributed to "extreme weather
conditions".
</P>
<P>
Many effects of global climate change on human health would be
adverse unless strict measures are undertaken to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to the reasonable levels, it added.
</P>
<P>
Human interference with the natural flow of freshwater systems
has accelerated the spread of some infectious diseases while dams
and irrigation canals often serve as breeding areas for
mosquitoes, the release stressed.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution can spark outbreaks of cholera and dysentery,
said the release which was issued in commemoration of "The World
Health Day" on April 7.
</P>
<P>
The world environment body of UNEP noted that "human health
and that of the environment are intimately interlinked."
</P>
<P>
"Effective management of the environment will help to halt and
eventually stop these diseases," it added.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Parties Urged to ensure Free Access tl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Aid agencies in eastern Zaire
have called on warring parties in the Great Lakes region to
provide free access to refugees and displaced persons and enable
aid workers to assist them.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement by aid agencies reaching here today said
that "these people's needs must not be overlooked as the Zairean
parties prepare for political negotiations over their country's
future."
</P>
<P>
As representatives of the Zairean government and rebels
prepare to meet in South Africa, the release said, "we appeal to
the participants in the talks to fully consider the urgent
humanitarian needs" of refugees stranded in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that hundreds of thousands of refugees fled
into the rain forest to escape the fighting and violence in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies in the region are trying to aid more than
100,000 refugees who have re-emerged from the forest, the release
said, noting that many thousands of Rwandan and Burundi refugees
remain out of reach.
</P>
<P>
Following the seizure of Zaire's third largest city of
Kisangani late last month, rebels led by Laurent Kabila gave
order to refugees living around the city to leave their temporary
camps.
</P>
<P>
Since then, hundreds of thousands of refugees trapped in the
Zaire jungle near a railway line could die any timei unless aid
workers provide food, water and medicine to them, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued by European naon Commission
for Humanitarian Aid, U.N. High Commission for Refugees, UNICEF
and WFP.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Halt Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) has called for effective management of the
environment to halt emerging infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by UNEP reaching here today said that
old infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have
resurged and new diseases like HIV have been discovered during
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that many emerging and resurgent
infectious diseases may have been attributed to "extreme weather
conditions".
</P>
<P>
Many effects of global climate change on human health would be
adverse unless strict measures are undertaken to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to the reasonable levels, it added.
</P>
<P>
Human interference with the natural flow of freshwater systems
has accelerated the spread of some infectious diseases while dams
and irrigation canals often serve as breeding areas for
mosquitoes, the release stressed.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution can spark outbreaks of cholera and dysentery,
said the release which was issued in commemoration of "The World
Health Day" on April 7.
</P>
<P>
The world environment body of UNEP noted that "human health
and that of the environment are intimately interlinked."
</P>
<P>
"Effective management of the environment will help to halt and
eventually stop these diseases," it added.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Fair Exhibitors Robbed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Robbers attacked visitors and
participants in the on-going All Africa Trade and Tourism Fair in
a hotel in Kaduna, northern Nigeria on Friday, carting away cash
and property at over five million Naira (about 60,000 US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources here said today that the hoodlums unleashed terror at
the Zakariya Prestigeious Hotel, one of the best in the inland
industrial center, between 2:15 and 3:30 Friday morning, breaking
into guest rooms and asking for money and valuables from the
victims at gun point.
</P>
<P>
The victims include participants from other parts of the
country and foreign nationals, who were robbed of cash, wrist
watches, jeweleryious, television sets, cameras, mobile phone
sets, shoes, bags, telecommunication radio sets and some goods
for exhibition.
</P>
<P>
TV, video and radio sets belonging to the hotel were also
carried away, while lodgers without any substantial money and
valuable to offer the marauders were beaten up, amidstryious
screams from the female guests terrified by the gun-totting men.
</P>
<P>
There is no report of any intervention of the hotel security
people during the robber's one-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
Around 10 workers of the hotel have been arrested by police,
while some of the panic-gripped lodgers have reportedly checked
out.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair, jointly sponsored by the Organization of
African Unity and African Economic Community, has attracted
delegates from more than 20 African countries, as well as
business people from all over Nigeria.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Proposed Merger of Two Office Suppliers Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.Federal Trade Commission
rejected on Friday the proposed 4 billion U.S. dollars merger of
two office supply giants, Staple Inc. and Office Depot Inc.
</P>
<P>
The action, which is reported to reflect the aggressiveness in
anti-trust enforcement by the F.T.C. came after Staple and Office
Depot had agreed to sell 63 stores to their only other competitors
in the office supply superstore market, Officemax Inc.
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 4 to 1 to seek a Federal court injunction
against the merger, which would have created an office superstore
chain with more than 1000 stores and 10 billion U.S. dollars in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal was an undisguised and illegal attempt to
eliminate competition between the two chains and would inevitably
lead to higher prices for consumers, William J. Baer, director of
the F.T.C. anti-trust division, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the F.T.C. required several supermarket
and department store chains that sought to merge to divest
themselves to maintain competition in their regions.
</P>
<P>
The commision's action was applauded by consumer advocates and
was described as new evidence that the Clinton Administration is
serious about enforcing antitrust laws.

<HEADLINE> UK Water Companies Accused over Big Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Water companies in Britain are
losing more than a quarter of supplies through leaks, with Thames
Water at the top of 38.6 percent leaks.
</P>
<P>
The news released by Ofwat, the water industry regulator, came
with Britain facing a drought crisis after the driest two-year
period in England and Wales since records began over 200 years ago
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statistics from the Institute of Hydrology underline the
fact that large parts of Britain's most densely populated region
will have hosepipe bans within a few months.
</P>
<P>
The shock leak figures forced Ofwat to slap leak reduction
targets on water companies, to ensure they made better progress in
tackling their leakage rate.
</P>
<P>
Ofwat said water companies will face heavy financial penalties
if there is not a rapid improvement. Thames Water was named as the
worst offender, losing almost four gallons out of ten through
leaks--more than 200 million wasted gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
Welsh Water was almost as bad, and North West Water and
Northumbrian Water were also picked out for strong criticism.
</P>
<P>
The regulator said, Britain's 10 privatized companies had a far
worse record than the 18 other water suppliers in England and
Wales.
</P>
<P>
The companies, who have been warning of hosepipe bans and
drought orders, were reportedly themselves handed multi-million
pound conservation ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
Tory MP Elizabeth Peacock, vice-chairman of the all-party
Commons water group called the leaks "outrageous", saying "Any
company losing more than 20 percent needs to act."
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for people to accept a hosepipe ban when so
much water is being wasted," she added.

JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Transvaal Agricultural
Union (TAU), the biggest of its kind in South Africa, today
expressed concern over the exodus of experts from
the national and provincial agricultural departments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pietersburg, TAU President Dries
Bruwer said the officials were either resigning or applying for
severance packages.
</P>
<P>
"There are just not enough people with the same level of
experience or expertise to replace these officials," Bruwer said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pietersburg District Agricultural Union Chairman
Herman Vercueil claimed that some senior officials were
"skillfully being manoeuvred into positions where they had no
option but to apply for severance policies or to resign due to
the policy of affirmative action".
</P>
<P>
Vercueil said about 20 percent of highly trained and
experienced officials in Northern Province's Agricultural
Department had either resigned or accepted severance packages
during the past three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
said today the modernization of the South African Navy fleet was
not a matter of debate despite the cut in the defence budget.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks on board the South African Navy
vessel Pretea after taking the salute of a naval review of local
and foreign warships in front of Cape
a harbor.
</P>

The international naval review was the culmination of the
three-day naval festivities to celebrate the South African Navy's
75th anniversary in Cape Town and nearby Simon's Town navy base.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela said changing priorities had led to
a reduction in the defence budget, but the government recognized
the navy's needs.
</P>
<P>
"We do recognize our responsibility for ensuring that our
country has an adequate and appropriate naval force," said the
president.
mik+H|ESx/el last month, the defence budget was down to 2.38 billion
U.S. Dollars, a 9.4 percent decrease compared with the previous
year.

Mandela also welcomed transformation in the navy, and said the
government valued the navy's contribution in trade and protecting
maritime resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The first round of talks
between the Zairean government and the rebel forces kicked off in
Pretoria today with both sides committing themselves to seeking a
peaceful solution to the conflict in their country.
</P>
<P>
Zairean Foreign Minister Kamanda Wa Kamanda said at the
opening of the talks that the Zairean government would approach
the talks with an open mind, stressing "we are going to look for
peace."
</P>
<P>
Kamanda expressed appreciation for the South African government's
mediation efforts, saying that he would welcome help from South Africa
to create conditions conducive to the progress and development of
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Bizima Karaha, leader of the delegation representing the
Zairean rebels, said his delegation will take the opportunity of
the negotiation to "find peaceful and lasting solutions" to the
Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the outcome of
the current talks would have an impact on the length and breadth
of the politics on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is one of four countries chosen at a summit in
Nairobi last December to spearhead peace efforts in Zaire, which
has for months been plagued by violent clashes between the
government troops and the rebels led by Laurent Kabila.

Mohamed Sahnoun, the U.N. Special Representative for the Great
Lakes Region, attended the talks and said the delegations from
the warring sides in Zaire were fully aware of their
responsibility.

Sahnoun pointed out there should be no illusions about the
odds of such meetings producing spectacular results, but those
involved would leave no stone unturned to prepare the ground for
durable peace.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, the peace talks would continue later in
the day under the co-chairmanship of Sahnoun and South African
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad. enditem

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Development Trust Accelerates Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Transitional
National Development Trust (TNDT) announced here today it had
accelerated funding to non-governmental organizations (NGO) and
community-based organizations (CBO) since the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The TNDT, established as an interim development funder in 1995
by the government, said in a statement that it had undergone a
priorization process because of the large volume of requests
received from NGO's and CBO's throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The TNDT's original financing of 125 million Rand (about 28
million U.S. Dollars) came from the government and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The trust had so far received request totaling 1.2 billion
Rand (about 270 million Dollars) from about 1400 NGOs and CBOs,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
TNDT General Manager Paul Jackson said about 10 million
Dollars had to date been committed to 141 projects assessed by
the trust.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said nearly 60 percent of the funds had been allocated to
the education and training sector, small, medium and micro
enterprises, rural and urban development, and good governance and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that TNDT's priority was given to projects
which emphasised community participation and benefited rural

<HEADLINE> Ekeus-Aziz Talks Secured No Substantial Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN
Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCO) announced that his talks with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz resulted in no substantial
progress, accusing Iraq of continuing to obstruct the work of the
UN arms inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
This came at a press conference held by Ekeus in the Iraqi
capital today after three days of talks with Aziz on the file of
Iraq's mass-destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to Ekeus, the talks focused on
Iraq's chemical weapons and long-range missiles as well as Iraq's
efforts including written statement to allay the UN fears about
these weapons.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the UN inspection teams need to verify
any Iraqi written announcement, to have interviews with the Iraqi
scientists who participated in Iraq's former armament programs,
and the UNSCO would complete its mission in Iraq within six months
if with smooth Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iraqi diplomatic sources also said that
Aziz assured Ekeus that Iraq has destroyed all the
mass-destruction weapons its possessed in the wake of the Gulf war
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Political circles in Baghdad think that Ekeus' talks with Aziz
on Iraq's chemical weapons were the first of their kind since the
UN arms inspection teams started their mission in Iraq in April,
1991, and that the issue of Iraq' biological weapons is still more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus arrived in Baghdad last Thursday, accompanied by four UN
arms inspectors, for a routine visit to Iraq. He will be leaving
Baghdad later today.

CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A large consignment of Egypt-made medicines reached
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad today for an Egyptian Medicine Fair
to be held on April 8.
</P>
<P>
This will be Egypt's first medicine fair held in Iraq since the
United Nations partially removed economic sanctions against it
late last year, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 20 Egyptian firms specialized in the production and
manufacturing of drugs will participate in the exhibition
organized by the Egyptian Holding Company for medicines in
cooperation with the Iraqi Health Ministry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibited products will be later offered to the Iraqi
people to help relieve the medicine crisis caused by the six-year
international embargo imposed on the country, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between Iraq and Egypt in late
January, Egypt will export 3 million U.S. dollars of medicines to
Iraq. The first batch of the medicine has reportedly reached Iraq
in February.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects the volume of exports to Iraq to reach 100
million U.S. dollars in the first six months of the implementation
of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal starting from last December to
ease the impact of the trade sanctions imposed for Iraqi August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

The mission will shed spotlight on a number of Egyptian
products including ceramics, carpets, leather products, shoes,
kitchen tools, aluminum, stainless steel, juices, jams, wood and
office furniture.

<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will export to the United States 1 million
dozens of shirts worth nearly 50 million dollars, head of the

The two countries have reached agreement recently on increasing
the quota by 10 percent annually as of next year, he said.
</P>

Under the agreement, Egypt will also export certain types of
yarn, knitting fibers and cloth worth more than 50 million dollars
to the U.S. markets, he added.

<P>
NICOSIA -- Tourist arrivals in Cyprus dropped 14.5 percent in
February 1997 compared with the same period of 1996.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that he does "not expect much" from a
meeting to be held next week between Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to be "a just intermediary and a
pushing power in order to re-activate the peace process" in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister underlined that the peace process
could not succeed but "by Israel's adherence to the principles
which was defined for this process since the beginning."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Israeli summit comes as the Middle East peace process
is threatened by high tensions between Israelis and the
Palestinians following the decision of Netanyahu's government to
build 6,500 homes for some 25,000 Jews at Jebel Abu Ghnaim, or
Har Homa, in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>

Boueiz left here today for New Delhi, the capital of India, to
attend the conference of the non-aligned countries' foreign
ministers, which will be held on April 7.

situation in south Lebanon and the Lebanese detainees in Israeli
prisons.

understanding reached between Lebanon and the Jewish state in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The committee has held more than a dozen of meetings to

KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will continue to
support the role of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in pushing
peace forward in the Middle East in face of Israeli activities in
building a new settlement in East Jerusalem, a Kuwaiti official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti State Minister for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Dakhil
Al-Dakhil made the remark before leaving Sunday for New Delhi,
India, to attend the 12th meeting of the NAM countries' foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
He would call on the ministers to urge Israel to stop the
construction of the new settlement in defiance of criticism from
the world community, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also added that he would ask the NAM to call on Iraq to
implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and release all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti
prisoners of war still detained in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official said Kuwait's participation in the meeting
emanates from its belief in the positive role played by the
movement in supporting international causes and its effective role
in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would review world economic and political
developments and is expected to release a final statement
explaining the movement's policies regarding international

<HEADLINE> Night Curfew Imposed on Somali District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 5 (Xinhua)-- South Mogadishu faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid today imposed a night curfew on Afgoe Distrct,
30 km south of here.
</P>
<P>
The curfew is effective tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, vehicles and pedestrians should stop
moving around from 24:00 local time to the sun rise in
the morning, otherwise they face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
All street vendors, cinemas, and restaurants are similarly
ordered to halt their activities after 24:00.
</P>
<P>
However, the movement of health personnel and patients is allowed
once they introduce their identities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chief Security Officer of the district,
Hussein Ali Weheliye, all militiamen other than those on duty
should remain in their quarters and weapons seen circulating in
the town will be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of the night curfew on the town was prompted
after the security situation there has been seriously threatened
by widespread freelance looting, kidnapping and rape against the
women especially at night.
</P>
<P>
The instability in Afgoe has increased since the interclan
clashes have began between clansmen in the region including Habar
Gidir, Garre, Murusadeh and Galadi.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the administration of Hussein Aidid
imposes a night curfew on towns in southerm Somalia since June
1995. The town of Baidoa was the first place where the practice
had began after Rahanwein militiamen intermittently attacked the
bases of the militiamen of late faction leader Farah Aidid who
took over the control of the town in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also in November last year, a night curfew was imposed in
north Mogadishu after the collapse of the islamic courts
following Ali Mahdi's deeree sacking Sheikh Ali Dhere from the
chairmanship of the supreme islamic court. enditem

only 370 tons has been donated by donor organizations.

With regard to water supply, the statement said 33 water tanks
have been secured from different non-governmental organizations
and 40 more tanks were pledged by the government of Germany.

AMMAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem should be made the
permanent gate for peace, said Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan here
today at a conference on Israeli settlement policy in Jerusalem,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan reiterated Jordan's firm opposition against Israeli
government's Jewish settlement policy in Arab's East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians claim as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
About 450 dignitaries from a number of Arab and Muslim
countries attended the conference and discussed practical measures
to defend Jerusalem from Jewish settlement and to preserve the
Arab and Muslim identity of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
The high number of participants at the conference reflected
Arab concern over the plans by the right-wing Israeli government
to consolidate the Jewish state's grip on East Jerusalem
highlighted by its latest plan to build a Jewish settlement on
Jabal Abu Ghneim, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Three major religions in the world -- Islam, Judaism and
Christianity -- all consider Jerusalem as their religions' birth
place. Israel, a Jewish state, has been accused by the
international community of Judaising the Holy City by building
Jewish settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government's settlement policy has triggered off
consistent opposition from the Arab world and stone-throwing
incidents in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> EU to Determine EMU Joiners in Late April or Early May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
agreed on Saturday at a meeting in the Netherlands that the
decision on which countries join the single currency, the Euro,
would be made in late April or early May.
</P>
<P>
Meeting informally together with EU central bankers in the
Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk, the ministers also endorsed plans
to penalize countries running excessive budget deficit -- above
three percent of GDP -- once they are part of the EMU, scheduled
to start on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Countries wishing to join EMU must meet various criteria set
out in the Maastricht treaty on deficits, debt, inflation,interest
rates and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Though deluged in recent weeks by speculation about a delay in
the starting date for the Euro, the EU finance ministers
reaffirmed their commitment to the 1999 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The group also took stock of negotiations on a revamped
Exchange Rate Mechanism, dubbed ERM 2, and designed to link
countries outside EMU to the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Prior to March 1, 1998, each Member States is required to
provide the European Commission with final information on the
country's 1997 budget performance.
</P>
<P>
The Commission and the European Monetary Institute, the
forerunner of the future European Central Bank, will then have
roughly two weeks to come up with their convergence reports.
</P>
<P>
After the evaluation, there is a six-week consultation period
with the European Parliament, before a qualified majority decision
will be taken, at a meeting of Heads of state and Government of
the EU countries, to adopt the list of countries due to join the
Euro on January 1, 1999.

KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Women social workers in Nepal
today threatened to stage street demonstrations if the government
fails to enact a bill on women's equal property rights through
ordinances.
</P>
<P>
A group of women activists at a gathering here decided to call
a meeting of women representatives from all walks of life next
Wednesday and finalize their protest programs.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to meet Women and Social Welfare Minister
Sahana Pradhan, who was a strong proponent of the Women's property
rights bill before being appointed into the cabinet last month
when Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand formed his coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The women rights workers said they would launch a relay hunger
strike and picket the prime minister's office and main ruling
parties' offices to protest the government's failure to legalize
women's inheritance rights for parental property.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, a 15-day ultimatum for the implementation of the
government's commitment to social justice at international forums
and a memorandum to the prime minister on the demand will be
submitted, they said.

<HEADLINE> Rolf Sorensen Wins Tour Of Flanders World Cup Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Dane Rolf Sorensen broke away on
the long home stretch to win the Tour of Flanders World Cup
classic in Meerbeke, Belgium, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sorensen beat his closest challengers Frederic Moncassin of
France and Italy's Franco Ballerini by five seconds. The top three
made their vital break with 9 kilometers to go after ten riders
were still packed together following the 15 steep hills that
dotted the 256-kilometer trek through Flanders fields.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Andrei Tchmil finished fourth, 17 seconds behind,
ahead of Italians Davide Casarotto and Claudio Chiappucci.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup classic was run under a brilliant sunshine,
considerably easing race conditions. Pre-race favorite Johan
Museeuw, was accidentally run into the ground by Swiss Bruno
Boscardin some 30 kilometers from the end and lost all hope for a
third win in the famed classic over the cobblestones and hills of
northern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
World Cup leader Erik Zabel, who won Milan-San Remo two weeks
ago, was never a factor in the second World Cup race of the season.
</P>
<P>
The next event in the World Cup competition is the
Paris-Roubaix classic on the cobblestones of northern France next
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Chubb Looking To Insure Cultural Property in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Executives of the US's Chubb
Corporation, one of the world's major insurers, are looking at
providing insurance for China's cultural property, a virgin land
for foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The company thinks its expertise can be used to provide a
protective canopy for China's rich cultural heritage, according to
Deano Hare, chairman of the board of Chubb.
</P>
<P>
Chubb is set to cooperate with the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics in an effort to teach the country's museum curators and
staff about cultural property insurance, and has sponsored a
program called "Friends of Chinese Treasures."
</P>
<P>
A local official estimates that China's insurance business may
be worth 250 billion yuan by the end of the century as more people
become aware of the importance of insurance in their lives, and
the country is gradually opening its insurance market to overseas
insurers.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to play a part in China's burgeoning insurance business,
especially in the field of culture, Chubb has set up offices and
centers in Beijng, Shanghai, and Shenzhen since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Hare said Chubb last year had assets of 20 billion US dollars.

LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Grand National horse race,

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Adopt Rules to Attract Private Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, The Philippines, April 6 (Xinhua) -- To ensure sustained
economic growth in the Asia Pacific, the finance ministers of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's 18 economies
today adopted a set of voluntary rules to facilitate sustained
capital flows into the region.
</P>
<P>
After their two-day meeting which ended here today, the finance
ministers adopted a joint ministerial statement, whose centerpiece
is the voluntary rules helping bring private capital into the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the finance ministers recognized
the importance of both private sector participation in
infrastructure development and sound financial and capital markets
in sustaining the growth momentum of the APEC region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they agreed to adopt these rules to stimulate
private sector investment in infrastructure and accelerate the
development of domestic financial and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
But according to the statement, all these rules will be
implemented on a voluntary basis with due respect for diversity
and different levels of economic development of each APEC member.
</P>
<P>
To encourage private investment in infrastructure, the
statement said, the APEC member economies agreed to pursue the
following rules:
</P>
<P>
-- Sound macroeconomic environment. Steady and sustained growth
based on sound macroeconomic fundamentals is the key to attracting
private sector investments in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
-- Stable and transparent legal framework and regulatory
systems. A stable and transparent legal framework is a
prerequisite for attracting private investors and safeguarding
their interests.
</P>
<P>
-- Sectoral policies that promote competition. Where
applicable, member economies shall unbridle existing monopolies in
infrastructure to promote increased private sector participation,
competition, and consumer welfare.
</P>
<P>
-- Availability of long-term capital. Well-developed domestic
financial and capital markets play a crucial role in mobilizing
savings and making available longer-term capital for
infrastructure investments.
</P>
<P>
To promote financial and capital markets development, the
ministers also agreed that the following goals shall be achieved:
</P>
<P>
-- Sound macroeconomic environment. The pursuit of sound
macroeconomic policies is an essential element in maintaining
strong banking systems and a prerequisite to the development of
capital markets, including long-term debt markets.
</P>
<P>
-- Stable and transparent legal and regulatory systems. Sound
financial regulation and supervision is critical to capital
markets development.
</P>
<P>
-- Well-developed market infrastructure. High quality,
transparent and comparable reporting and disclosure on the
financial positions of business promote investor interests in
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
-- Financial and capital market instruments. Market-based
benchmark rates for medium to long term securities facilitate more
accurate pricing and encourage the development and deepening of
the bond market, including that for municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
Besides the voluntary rules, the finance ministers also reached
agreement on collaborative initiatives in the two areas, proposed
by some leading APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives include enhanced cooperation among export
financing institutions, strengthened financial market supervision,
well-developed clearing and settlement systems, and a voluntary
action plan for supporting the freer and stable flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of these voluntary rules and collaborative
initiatives will be reviewed at the next APEC finance ministers'
meeting, due to be held next year in Canada. Canada currently
holds the rotating presidency of APEC.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among the Asia-Pacific economies. It groups China,
the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, New Zealand, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines
and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Major Rules out Sinn Fein Entry Into Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
warned today that Saturday's bomb scare that wrecked the Grand
National horse race puts back Sinn Fein's entry into Northern
Island peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The 150th Grand National, one of Britain's greatest sporting
events, was cancelled Saturday after police received two coded
bomb warnings.
</P>
<P>
Major immediately laid blame on the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
for the alert although no one has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC TV's Breakfast With Frost program that he had no
doubt the bomb warnings were the work of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
If Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, thought its action
would hasten an entry into peace talks, this was a "total and
utter misjudgment," Major said.
</P>
<P>
"It puts it back. It certainly doesn't put it forward," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party showed solidarity with Major, saying
that IRA tactics put Sinn Fein "beyond the pale" for talks after
the general election.
</P>
<P>
The minority Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy Ashdown also
said Saturday's events would only serve to strengthen people's
anger.
</P>
<P>
Britain has refused to admit the Sinn Fein to the Northern
Island peace talks unless the IRA declares a lasting cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has been fighting for more than 25 years to end
British rule in Northern Ireland, was believed by police to be
responsible for two other bomb alerts on British motorways last
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Navigation Project Completed on China's Hanjiang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The navigation-channel renovation
project on the Hanjiang River in central China's Hubei Province
has been completed, allowing 500-dwt ships to go downstream from
Xiangfan to Wuhan, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The project cost a total of 243 million yuan, and allowed the
river to become another way to move coal from northern to southern
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Hanjiang River is 1,567 km long and is the Yangtze's
largest tributary, originating in Ningqiang County in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province and entering the Yangtze in Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The Hanjiang, with its many bends and shallows, made navigation
very difficult before the renovation project, which included work
on a 532-km-long navigation course, construction of a coal port,
and a telecommunications system. The project began in 1990, and
ultimately involved moving 1.72 million cu m of earth.
</P>
<P>
Part of the project involved work on landslide-prone sections,
which covered 86 km in the middle and lower reaches of the river
and which were effectively dealt with.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Process Nears Collapse: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace process is
near collapse because of the Israeli government's failure to abide
by the signed agreements, Syrian Vice President Zuhair Masharqa
said.
</P>
<P>
In an article published today by Syrian newspaper Al-Baath,
Masharqa warned of the emergence of tension that might bring the
region back to violence because of Israel's disregard for the
Madrid conference and the U.N. relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the tension to Israeli persistence in
Judaizing Jerusalem and its refusal to withdraw from the Golan
Heights it seized from Syria in 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice president noted that if the Middle East peace
process has failed to secure any progress, it is due to Israel's
wish to dominate the Arab region, to retain the occupied Arab
territories and set up more Jewish settlements on them.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his country's adherence to the peace process in
accordance with the Madrid conference, the relevant U.N.
resolutions, as well as the land-for-peace principle and the
agreements reached in the past years.

<HEADLINE> Funding for Mausoleum Repairs in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China has put more than three
million yuan into renovating a mausoleum of Genghis Khan, the
Mongolian-born emperor of China's Yuan Dynasty in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
The repair project is part of observances of the 50th
anniversary of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and
is scheduled to be completed before June 20, according to the
director of the bureau in charge.
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan, who was born in 1162, united the various
Mongolian tribes in 1206 and set up a powerful empire, referred to
as the Yuan Dynasty (1271 --1368) in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The work will include building a statue of the horse-riding
emperor in front of the steps leading up to the mausoleum, a
sacrificial altar, and a house for sacrificial offerings and
storing sacrificial utensils.
</P>
<P>
Eight hectares of pine trees and 10,000 square meters of grass
will be planted around the mausoleum. Antiques will be duplicated
as part of the mausoleum's display.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has spent nearly 10 million yuan on
repairs of the imperial mausoleum since 1955, when it was built,
said the director.
</P>
<P>
The mausoleum is a major historical and cultural site under
state protection, and has more than 120,000 visitors a year.

<HEADLINE> Education Center To Be Named for Chinese Warship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- An education center named for the
cruiser "Chungshan" is planned for a shipyard near Wuhan, the
capital of central China's Hubei Province, at an estimated cost of
five million yuan (about 600,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-square-meter center will have two exhibition halls
for historic relics and ship models, an 8.8-meter-high monument
beside the restored cruiser, and 25 steles describing crew members
of the cruiser.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongren, an official in charge of preparations, said that
young people can learn about military affairs and patriotism at
the center, and there will be courses on making model ships.
</P>
<P>
The Cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Sun Chungshan),
forerunner of the Chinese Democratic Revolution, was sunk at Wuhan
October 24, 1938 in China's War of Resistance Against Japan.
</P>
<P>
It was salvaged on January 28. The 62.1-meter-long,
8.9-meter-wide, 780-ton cruiser played a role in an historical
event, following Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution,
when he launched a surprise attack on the Chinese Communist Party
on March 20, 1926.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the center is scheduled to be completed in
mid-May.

YINCHUAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region will need a great deal of overseas funds if it
is to speed up housing construction as planned, the regional
construction department says.
</P>
<P>
Some 31.5 million sq m of residential buildings will be built

</P>
<P>
To accelerate construction work, funds from both China and

attract outside funds.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, per capita living space for 16,000 people
was less than four sq m., and 700,000 sq m of housing needed
repairs. In addition, the regional urban population is expected to
grow at an annual rate of 50,000, requiring 800,000 sq m of new
housing.
</P>
<P>
The regional government is planning to have 11 sq m in per
capita living space for its citizens by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expressway Re-routed To Protect Ancient City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- An expressway that will run
from north to south China had to be redesigned recently to protect
the original site of an ancient city in Hebei Province in the
north.
</P>
<P>
The expressway starts in Beijing and ends in Shenzhen in
Guangdong Province on the Hong Kong border, and was originally
designed to run through Yecheng, the seat of 22 dynastic rulers
for more than 370 years from the early third century to the late
sixth century. The site in today's Linzhang County was designated
as a historical place under special state protection by the State
Council in 1988.
</P>
<P>
After the construction work started, the provincial cultural
relics department and the Linzhang County authorities submitted a
proposal to the State Bureau of Cultural Relics and the provincial
road construction headquarters, saying that the expressway should
be routed around Linzhang. The Ministry of Communications soon
revised the route to move it 600 meters west of the site. This
meant that two km were added to the highway, resulting in a cost
increase of two million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Ministry of Communications spent more
than three million yuan excavating the area that was to be the
roadbed, and 213 ancient tombs, 20 kilns, and more than 3,000
pieces of cultural relics dating back as much as 2,000 years ago
were uncovered.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Consult With US on Pork Trade Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines hopes to peacefully
settle its pork trade tiff with the United States, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Philippine Agriculture Secretary Salvador
Escudero had set the date for formal consultations with the U.S.
on April 10.
</P>
<P>
Escudero was quoted as saying that the U.S. had lodged a case
before the World Trade Organization (WTO), accusing Manila of
"deliberately slowing down" the process of importing U.S. pork and
poultry.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was given a tariff-rate quota of 36,000 metric
tons of U.S. pork and poultry according to the minimum access
volume under the WTO-General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
However, the country did not import any until 1996, prompting
the U.S. to file the complaint and request the Philippines'
tariff-rate quota on pork and poultry take place within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Escudero explained that there was no barriers for the imports
of U.S. products, but the Filipinos just don't like the taste of
frozen U.S. meat.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's central bank announced
here today that the inflation rate stood at 26.1 percent during
the first 11 months of the last Iranian calendar year ending
March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) said in a report that the
average retail price index went up by 26.1 percent compared with
the same period of the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
The CBI report said that the average price index of goods and
consumer services went up by 23.8 percent, reaching 455.7 points
during the period.
</P>
<P>
It said that the average price index of goods and consumer
services for the capital city of Tehran was 447.4 points, up by
22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is one of the major problems in Iran, which has
aroused wide complaints from the public. Specialists believe
that the official inflation rate is too low. The inflation
should be round 50 percent at present, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Iranian government raised prices of all oil
products, including super petrol and fuel oil, by a quarter
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran raised the fuel prices by 50 percent last year, 100
percent the previous year. The move triggered some protests and
demonstrations from the public, who complained about the
runaway inflation.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the increase in fuel prices, all taxi drivers
today raised the taxi fare by a quarter or one-third in
Tehran.

<P>
TUNIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has worked out, in collaboration with member states, a regional
plan to fight newly-emerging infectious diseases, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the WHO's East Mediterranean Bureau on
the occasion of the World Health Day, which falls on April 7,
said that the plan includes systems for observing diseases,
monitoring epidemics and promoting health consciousness in all
countries of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the geographic position of the region and
its proximity to several regions where infectious diseases abound,
make it easy to be subject to the transfer of epidemics and
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The high population density and the environmental and economic
conditions of some areas in the region, makes it easy for any
infectious disease to spread out so as to develop into an
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
It said that AIDS, malaria, viral hepatitis tuberculosis, viral
bleeding fever, cholera, and diseases of animal origin are among
the infectious diseases that the east Mediterranean population
is suffering from.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Purchases Up Five percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Contracts valued at 4.78 billion
HK dollars (613 million US dollars) were arranged by the Hong
Kong Government Supplies Department (GSD) in 1996, a five percent
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were for the supply of goods and services to
over 80 government departments and to several non-government
organizations, including the Hospital Authority.
</P>
<P>
The main items purchased included computer hardware and
software, pharmaceutical preparations, medical and hospital
equipment, fuel oils and scientific and laboratory equipment.
</P>
<P>
They were obtained from over 35 countries and regions. The
United States was the principal manufacturing source of the goods
purchased, supplying goods valued at 1.89 billion HK dollars (242
million US dollars), or 40 percent of total purchases.
</P>
<P>
The US has been the leading source of manufactured goods
supplied to the Hong Kong government since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Other important sources of purchases were Britain, the Chinese
mainland, Germany and Hong Kong itself. Products of local
manufacture included furniture items, pharmaceutical preparations,
hospital consumables, household disposals and sundries.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong government adopts an open and fair procurement
policy by purchasing the goods and services that represent best
value for money, irrespective of country of origin," Director of
Government Supplies Nigel Shipman said.
</P>
<P>
Record savings of 146 million HK dollars (18.8 million US
dollars) were achieved through price negotiations. The Hong Kong
government buys principally through open competitive tendering and
prices are only negotiated in special circumstances.

<HEADLINE> APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting Ends in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, The Philippines, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers' meeting
ended here today with promises to facilitate private sector
participation in infrastructure development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at the end of the two-day meeting,

</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the finance ministers agreed on a
set of voluntary principles for facilitating private sector
participation in infrastructure and promoting capital and

<HEADLINE> HK To Spot-check Access for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Equal Opportunities
Commission (EOC) will check more than 100 buildings at random
throughout Hong Kong next month to ensure their facilities for
the disabled are being used properly, Hong Kong Standard reported
today.
</P>
<P>
There was inadequate access to some facilities in public
buildings, a commission spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Places where the disabled visit frequently, such as Government
buildings, food outlets, shopping arcades, commercial buildings
and multi-purpose complexes, will be prime targets, Cheung
Kin-fai, of the Rehabilitation Alliance Hong Kong, said, whose
team will make the checks.
</P>
<P>
And general access and specially-designed toilets for the
disabled will be emphasized, Cheung added.
</P>
<P>
"We think we will be able to check 10 locations a day, and
expect to finish the whole project within two weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although many facilities for the disabled had been installed,
they were not being used properly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance sought help from the commission because
the lack of access for the disabled was a form of discrimination.
"Under the principle of equal opportunities among all people, the
disabled should have free access to the buildings."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Speaker to Visit Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri is to visit Russia Thursday as a major campaign
for Iran's 7th presidential elections scheduled for May 23,
today's English daily Iran News reported.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old speaker, a front-runner among nominees in the
current presidential race, will make the five-day visit to Russia
at the invitation of Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady Selezney.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said that Nateq-Nouri's visit is part
of Iran's effort to counter U.S. anti-Iran propaganda. Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati waged extensive visits to
Islamic countries last month with invitations from Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to his counterparts for the
Organization of Islamic Countries summit scheduled to be held
here in December.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Tehran Sergei Tretyakov termed the
visit to Moscow, the capital of Russia, of the Iranian parliament
speaker as a major step toward strengthening relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities said earlier that the visit by
Nateq-Nouri to Moscow has been postponed due to the likelihood
of drastic changes in the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
While stressing importance of strategic relations between the
two countries, Nateq-Nouri said earlier that consolidation of
Tehran-Moscow ties will have positive and constructive impacts
on all regional and world countries.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit by the strong presidential candidacy
shows that the Iranian regime attaches greater importance to its
strategic relations with northern neighbor of Russia, which has
already sold three submarines and nuclear reactors to Iran
despite strong opposition by the United States.

<HEADLINE> "Save the Peace" Rally Held In Tel Aviv </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A huge mass rally took
place in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square Saturday night with a call to
"Save the Peace."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered in the place where the late
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was gunned down by an
ultra-right student on November 4, 1995 at the end of a peace
rally.
</P>
<P>
The after-Shabbat (Israel's weekly day-off) rally was
organized at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian relations fell
into an unprecedented deep crisis since the Oslo Accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, chairman of the opposition Labor Party and
former prime minister after Rabin, lashed out at Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in an emotional address, saying that since the
his election, "10 months have passed, and the peace looks weak
and security has been undermined."
</P>
<P>
The Labor chief warned of the consequences of the halt of the
peace process. He noted that it means Israel's isolation and arms
race.
</P>
<P>
Peres, architect of the Oslo Accords, said that the whole mood
will change considerably and old confrontation will re-emerge
consequently.
</P>
<P>
The rally was initiated by the peace body "An Entire Generation
Demands Peace" and supported by other peace and youth movements in
Israel. The country's best singers volunteered to perform at the
rally.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the peace activists said that they held the
rally to protest the deterioration of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement asserted "A whole generation will not allow
anybody to bury the peace process. We have no other process, we
have no other peace, we have no other future."
</P>
<P>
"We must go back to the road of peace, to the road of Yitzhak
Rabin," declared the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today eased
the closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a
relatively quiet weekend, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangements, which take effect this morning, allow
Gaza Strip residents in the West Bank to return to Gaza, as well
as West Bank residents in the Gaza Strip to travel home.
</P>
<P>
The army is also letting Palestinians who are married to
Jerusalem residents with Israeli identity cards to enter the
city.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, another 22 Palestinian ambulances are allowed to
enter Israel on an emergency basis, bringing to 36 the number of
ambulances allowed to cross into Israel from the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said that 100 Arab laborers working in tourist
industries are also allowed to enter Israel as of this morning,
but stressed that all entrance permits are subjected to strict
security clearances.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip immediately after a suicide bombing attack in a
down town coffee shop in Tel Aviv, which left three women dead
and more than 40 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from
returning to their jobs inside Israel and from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

chimpanzees has fallen from 10,000 in 1986 to only 3,000 at
present, reported the local daily "the Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
The decline has brought the usually timid primate into the
category of "seriously endangered species" in Uganda today, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Robinson Yampa, animal keeper of the Uganda Wildlife
Centre at the Entebbee zoo, 40 km south of Kampala was quoted as
saying that the others in the seriously endangered category
include the parrot and the rhinoceros in the country.
</P>
<P>
The increasing spate of deforestation is the major reason for
the decline, he said.
</P>
<P>
Poaching is another reason for the decline, he said, adding
that chimpanzee smugglers and poachers have been arrested on
several occasions and have been prosucuted in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chimpanzee and other seriously endangered species in Uganda
are important elements for attracking tourists to the country and
are playing an important role in tourism in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Be Used to Attack Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will not allow its

</P>
<P>
This was stated by Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence Vshimba

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Uruguay to Probe Terrorist Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned
the Uruguayan ambassador last night and asked Uruguay to probe
the terrorist assault on the Iranian embassy in Montevideo, Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two masked men armed with revolvers attacked the Iranian
embassy on Friday. They beat Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ali
Sarmadi and threatened to blow up the Iranian mission.
</P>
<P>
However, the incident did not result in any loss of life or
property because of immediate action from the Iranian embassy
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Seyyed Musa Kazemi, the head of the 2nd American Affairs
Department of the Foreign Ministry, denounced the act of the
terrorism and told the Uruguayan ambassador that Iran expects the
Uruguayan government to provide additional security measures for
protecting the Iranian embassy staff in Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
"Iran would like to see the speedy arrest of the masked
terrorists," the Iranian official was quoted by the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan ambassador deplored the incident and called it
a grave problem against the credibility of his country.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that based upon the two countries' excellent
relations his government would spare no efforts in pursuing the
matter and announcing the result of the investigations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal's Bitter-Sweet Access to Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tourists from western countries
often found to their surprise that there are almost as many
computer service companies as travel agencies in downtown streets
of this capital city of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Despite one of the poorest countries in the World, the
Himalayan kingdom of Nepal has caught up the latest development of
information technology and has access to the worldwide
computer-based communication network -- the Internet.
</P>
<P>
With the country's other sectors growing by less than five
percent in recently years, the turnout of the computer-related
industry is surging at an annual growth rate of over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many businesses of the tourism sector as well as Nepal-based
international organizations and aid agencies quickly opened their
cyber addresses on the Internet when a local private company
initiated the Internet service here three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies in Nepal have realized the importance to lure
foreign visitors through advertising the country's picturesque
Himalayan peaks, exotic cultural heritage and hospitable people in
a multimedia way on the Net.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are already over 22,000 sites on the
Internet established for disseminating messages about Nepal or
matters related to the country, according to local daily the
Kathmandu Post.
</P>
<P>
Although many of these Net sites have been created by Nepali
students studying abroad or foreign tourists sharing their
adventures in Nepal, computer service companies here saw a
favorite prospect of the tourism-driven Internet business for
local clients and are scrambling to begin their networking
service.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Tourism Ministry of Nepal has set up its own home
page on the Internet in order to promote the government's "Visit
Nepal 1998" program, which is aimed at attracting some 500,000
foreign tourists in the year.
</P>
<P>
Kathmandu's media circles also showed their enthusiasm for the
Internet as almost all English-language daily and weekly papers,
including the official daily the Rising Nepal, have launched their
cyber editions.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Radio Nepal linked up with the Internet last
week to bring its English news broadcasts to listeners around the
World.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with their counterparts in developed
countries, Internet users in Nepal have to pay relatively high
rates -- at least several hundreds US dollars for one year's
service.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nepal's Internet service companies depend on the
satellite channels of the state-run Nepal Telecommunication
Corporation (NTC) to transmit and receive Internet signals, mainly
contributing to their hefty operation costs, industry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Mercantile Office System
Company, the first Internet service provider in the country, the
price of using the Internet has gone down about 80 percent in the
last one and half years.
</P>
<P>
If the communication costs could be cut down further, more
customers would apply for the Internet access, he said, adding
that the number of Internet users in the country is expected to
grow 40 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
He added that his company had a plan to establish a national
network to provide Internet service to users outside the capital
city and had already set up a service station in a tourist
destination in West Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But local users have no reason to expect a considerable price
decrease for the Internet service in the near future as the
government seems unwilling to break the state-run NTC's monopoly
over communication links and allow private companies to install
their own satellite receivers, service providers said.

HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Daily Information Bulletin
(DIB), issued by the Hong Kong Government Information Services
(GIS), has been uploaded onto the Government Home Page on the
Internet since April 1.
</P>
<P>
Internet users can now read the DIB, which covers all the press
releases and regular statistics and figures issued through GIS by
various government departments, under the News Update of the page.
</P>
<P>
A GIS spokesman said today that the new arrangement was
environment-friendly, as more than 3.1 million sheets of A4-size
paper could be saved each year, not to mention the postage, labor
and other costs incurred in printing and mailing.
</P>
<P>
At present, 853 copies of the Chinese and English versions of
the DIB are sent daily to subscribers, including local and
overseas public organization, consulates and the business
community.
</P>
<P>
It will no longer be sent to subscribers in the form of hard
copies from May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Internet users can now view the DIB the day immediately after
the press releases have been issued, compared with two or three
days through the normal mailing method," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Major press releases issued by policy branches and government
departments have already been included in the Internet since the
end of 1995, yet the launch of the DIB on the Internet provides a
more comprehensive set of government press releases which Internet
users might find useful."
</P>

The News Update in the Government Home Page attracted more than
5,400 visitors in March.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Gamble Away Around 3.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Singaporeans gambled away around
five billion Singapore dollars, or about 3.5 billion US dollars,
last year, putting the city-state of three million people at the
top in Southeast Asia in terms of per capita spending on gambling.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Sunday Times, the Sunday edition
of the Straits Times, today, that amount was just what was placed
on legal bets, while billions more went to illegal betting
syndicates, and an unknown amount was spent by Singaporeans in
casinos in Genting Highlands of Malaysia, Australia and other
places, including on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
It said that last year's estimated total spent on legal
gambling was up from 4.2 billion Singapore dollars (about three
billion US dollars) in 1995. The money went to horse racing,
4-digits, jackpot machines, as well as on the Singapore Sweep and
Toto.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that gaming industry officials
estimated that the turnover for illegal betting in Singapore could
be around 20 billion Singapore dollars, or about 14 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only last month, the police smashed one syndicate which netted
an estimated 2.4 million Singapore dollars (about 1.7 million US
dollars) a month. Police believe that there are one or two more
such groups still operating.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China has approved state standards
for health food, which will take effect on May 1, 1997, according
to the State Bureau of Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The standards define and classify health foods, and include
technical requirements, testing procedures, and regulations on
labelling.
</P>
<P>
Health food products are classified in 13 categories according
to their effect on the body, and technical requirments state that
health food must enhance human health in at least one way.
</P>
<P>
An additional three contents are to be added to labels of
health products, giving nutrition information and function of the
products, and specific contents.
</P>
<P>
Health food is distinctly different from drugs, and is not
designed or produced for treating illness. The health food
industry has developed rapidly in China in the 1990s, and the
adoption of state standards for health food marks the beginning of
putting production, distribution, and management of the industry
under the control of laws.

<HEADLINE> East China City Increasing Pollution-Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Weihai City, in east China's
Shandong province, is watching its environmental protection more
closely while its economy develops rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The city closed a paper mill recently even though the mill had
over seven million yuan in net profits in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"After the shut-down of the mill, the surrounding ecology
improved remarkably, with many fish and shrimps returning to the
nearby sea waters," one expert noted.
</P>
<P>
The city's hi-tech development zone has turned down over 10 big
projects with a total investment of 2.2 billion yuan over the past
five years because of potential pollution problems. And the city
has spent some 120 million yuan on two sewage treatment plants,
each with a capacity of treating 80,000 tons of waste water
daily. Urban sewage is expected to be totally under control this
year, according to experts here.
</P>
<P>
Weihai has also increased efforts at developing solar energy to
reduce pollution caused by burning coal.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent some 1.3 billion yuan on environmental
protection infrastructure construction, and moved 38 polluters,
and shut down two ironworks, three paper mills, and four
electroplating plants.The government has drafted more than 10
environmental protection regulations, giving its environmental
protection department the right to turn down any construction
project application.
</P>
<P>
The city government rejected 53 projects with potential
pollution problems, and examined over 60 cases that violated the
Environmental Protection Law during the 1991-1995 period.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Increasing Agricultural Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi province
plans to continue increasing financial and technological input in
agriculture, with local government expenses and loans for
agriculture already up 10 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Central and provincial government funding for agricultural
development will eventually be 10.5 percent more than last year,
reaching 1.79 billion yuan (about 223 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sun Yonghe, Jiangxi's vice-governor, says that some 30
technological findings for agricultural production will be used in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government decided earlier this year that the
use of improved strains of crops should be 85 percent this year,
and the use of science and technology should increase, and
technicians have been sent to rural areas to provide technical
training to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi is on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
and is an important paddy production base. Its grain output last
year topped 17.66 billion kilograms, 1.08 billion kilograms more
than the previous record in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Global Alert on Emerging Infectious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- "Emerging infectious diseases -
global alert, global response." This is the theme chosen by the
World Health Organization (WHO) to mark this year's World Health
Day which falls on April 7.
</P>
<P>
WHO's warning is not from imagination. In the past decades,
spectacular progress has been made with a number of infectious
diseases, like smallpox, eradicated. However, tragically, with
optimism came a false sense of security, which has helped many
diseases spread with alarming rapidity.
</P>
<P>
According to information from WHO, in the last 20 years, more
than 30 new and highly infectious diseases have been identified.
they include the virulent Ebola-type hemorrhagicc fever,
HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis C and D.
</P>
<P>
Other examples of new or newly detected infectious diseases of
global concern include a new form of cholera, a naemolytic
uraemic syndrome, Legionaires' disease, and lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
There is also a highly fatal respiratory disease caused by a
virus called sin nombre, a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jokob disease
of central nervous system which is suspected, though not proven,
to be associated with a similar disease in cattle called bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
WHO maintains that although it is not always possible to know
if these are new in humans, or whether they have been present but
unrecognized throughout the years, many8emerging diseases are
thought to be due to a closer contact of man with their
reservoirs in nature, with a successful "jump" of the infectious
agent from animal to man across the species.
</P>
<P>
For many of these diseases there is no treatment, cure or
vaccine, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
A WHO press release says re-emerging infectious diseases often
reappear in epidemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is increasing worldwide due in part to its close
association with HIV infection; cholera has been re-introduced
into countries and continents where it has previously
disappeared, and where it can spread because water and sanitation
systems have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, dengue or "break-boneathy" fever has started to occur in
urban areas where mosquito control has broken down.
</P>
<P>
In addition, microorganisms resistant to antibiotic drugs
emerged and spread soon after the introduction of these drugs and
in parallel with their use.
</P>
<P>
Many well-known antibiotics are no longer effective to treat
common infections such as otitis, pneumonia, gonorrhoea and
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
In his message to mark the World Health Day, WHO Director
General Hiroshi Nakajima says, "We have to face the fact that
infectious diseases are a common threat which demands urgent
attention, especially at a time when people all over the world
are being brought closer together by international travel and
trade."
</P>
<P>
He called for a global alert, saying, "communicable diseases
respect no frontier. We must work together globally to control
them."

<HEADLINE> South China Province to Investigate All Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
plans to conduct an overall investigation of the province's
polluting factories this year, said officials here today.
</P>
<P>
The province conducted similar inspections in 1986 and
1989. However with the area's rapid economic development, the
original results no longer reflect the true state of the
province's environment, which poses problems for effective
pollution control, said an official with the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
To be reviewed are all the factories and the tertiary
industries with known pollution problems. The project is expected
to be completed in the third quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Overhaul of Italy's Development Aid System Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said here today he was planning an overhaul of Italy's
development aid system, especially to define the responsibilities
of the government and of the parliament on aid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on aid policies, Dini said the
government's job is to work out and introduce policies, and it is
for the parliament to approve the plans and the expenditure on aid
in a three-year period of time.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for aid would stay with the foreign ministry,
but management of the program would be entrusted to a development
agency and the Service Center for Training, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed the need to separate development aid from Italy's
commercial policies.
</P>
<P>
Dini had called for reforming the country's development and
welfare systems from January 1995 to January 1996, when he acted
as prime minister of Italy.
</P>
<P>
On issues of Bosnia and Albania, Dini said, "these were
situations in which it is necessary to use a new approach in
tackling not only the emergency but also development and
reconstruction, in a context of stability."

<HEADLINE> China to Fight Foreign Dumping with Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China now has legal power to
protect its manufacturers after enacting its first anti-dumping
and anti-subsidies regulations.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, drafted mainly according to rules of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), enable China to take action
against foreign companies that export products at lower than
normal prices to China, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate the investigation procedures and
rulings on dumping and subsidy actions.
</P>
<P>
China intends to stop foreign companies from threatening the
competitiveness of Chinese industries, from causing substantial
damage or preventing the establishment of relevant industries.
</P>
<P>
Shang Ming, an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said that foreign dumping cost
China billions of US dollars and several thousand jobs a year.
</P>
<P>
Moftec and several other departments are in charge of
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy issues from appeals to verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Companies appealing dumping charges must represent a
considerable proportion of the total domestic output of a certain
product.
</P>
<P>
China will levy anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties after a
verdict is announced that dumping or subsidies exist and have
caused substantial damage.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese prospecting ships are
scheduled to leave for the northern Pacific Ocean on May 20 to
spend six months exploring the seabed with robots that can work
6,000 meters under water.
</P>
<P>
This is one of four scheduled large-scale prospecting events
this century, an official from the China Ocean Mineral Research

as the economy maintains its sustained and rapid growth, China has
an ever-growing demand for minerals.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exploring natural resources in international
waters, China is tapping the natural wealth in a
three-million-square-kilometer area it controls according to the
UN Sea Convention Law.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 billion tons of petroleum await development in
China's subsea areas, where other resources also abound.
</P>
<P>
China will start a high-tech program to develop marine
resources. The program, with the goal of becoming a technical
resource for the maritime industry, will involve three major
sectors: sea water prospecting, marine biology and submarine oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, China plans to vigorously develop its

<HEADLINE> Inflation to Drop Below Two Percent in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's annual inflation rate this
month could dip below two percent for the first time in 28 years,
said Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani today.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the national statistics institute ISTAT is expected
to confirm that the inflation rate in March fell to 2.2 percent
from February's 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report prepared for parliament, Ciampi said the
anti-inflation process is expected to be consolidated in the
course of 1997, making it possible to achieve the goal of keeping
the average annual rate below the planned 2.5 percent level and
the monthly figures below two percent in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Optimism about the inflation trend helped raise the value of
the lira on the foreign exchange market yesterday, and also
boosted the bond futures market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said speculation was growing over a possible new cut
in official interest rates. The central bank's discount rate has
been steady at 6.75 percent since January.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Market to Open Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The opening of China's insurance
market will be gradual, prudent and orderly since the market is
still in an early stage, an official of the People's Bank of China
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies are allowed to sell life insurance in China
through joint ventures, the official was quoted by today's China
Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The annual premium income of foreign insurers last year was 575
million yuan (69.2 million US dollars), accounting for 0.74
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The country started allowing foreign companies to operate in
China on a trial basis in 1992 when the American International
Group received a license to operate in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign insurers is aimed at promoting the
reform and development of China's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the central bank's supervision over foreign
insurance companies, the central bank has revised the Shanghai
provisional regulations on foreign insurance institutions. The
revised regulation is waiting for the final approval of the State
Council. It would regulate all foreign insurers' activities.
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry this year will concentrate on the
establishment of a State reinsurance company, reform of
agricultural insurance and export credit insurance, the paper
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Four minivans powered by
electricity have been developed in Qinghua University, one of the
most important talent banks in China.
</P>
<P>
They are from the joint effort of the university's automobile
engineering department and more than ten manufacturing and
research units as a national research project, which was approved
by the State Planning Commission in 1992 and completed last
May. Achievements included electric vehicle batteries, battery
management systems and chargers.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles can be recharged overnight during non-peak
hours. However, electric vehicles in China will be heavier, slower
and limited to traveling short distances, according to today's
China Daily, explaining that since high-power hydro-nickle
batteries are too expensive, only low-density power lead-acid
batteries are practical in China.
</P>
<P>
The electric minivan's maximum speed is about 80 km per hour,
and the range per charge is about 120 km.
</P>
<P>
Two prototypes of electric minibuses traveled 6,000 km outside
Beijing last year. A fixed route for the minivans might be opened
between Qinghua University and a community where many professors
live.
</P>
<P>
Besides electric minbuses, postal vehicles, milk and meal
distributive vehicles and airport shuttles are expected to be
powered by lead-acid batteries.
</P>
<P>
The State Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defence, co-operating with US aerospace firm Northrop
Grumman Co, developed an electric bus last year.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Increasing Efforts To Fight Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province has
announced that all sources of pollution in the Huaihe River valley
must be treated to meet government standards by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the province's 566 major polluters, over 100 are expected to
be able to set up pollution treatment facilities, and 90 percent
of the polluters are expected to meet government-set discharge
standards by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the country's highest governing body,
announced last year that all polluters in the river valley should
meet government discharge standards by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The province has 1,045 heavy polluters in the valley, 566 of
which each discharges more than a hundred tons of waste water
daily.
</P>
<P>
"Some 3.2 billion yuan (about 400 million US dollars) is
expected to be spent making these factories meet the discharge
standards," said an official with the provincial government, who
noted that industrial waste can be reduced by more than 70 percent
if they all meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
The province closed 17,000 small polluters last year, and all
cities and towns have cut pollution by 10 percent, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The provincial environmental protection bureau has made regular
inspections of the major polluters, supervising their efforts and
urging them to speed up treatment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, governments at all levels have been closely
watching new projects, strictly preventing potential pollution.

GUANGZHOU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangzhou city, a
leader in the country's opening up process, plans to improve the
distribution sector this year by placing priority on helping
enterprises eliminate losses and increase profits, and on
promoting the merger of firms.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent conference on distribution, by 1998, the
debt-incurring rate of 13 large commercial groups will drop to
some 65 percent from 1995's 70 percent and that of 106 small
businesses to around 80 percent from 1995's 96 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the Ninth Five-Year-Plan, the city will set
up 13 large enterprise groups in the commercial sector, each with
properties worth 250 million yuan and a sales volume of over 5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Small firms will be given more freedom to act on their own and
a stock-issuing system will be tried out on 38 small firms, which
allows employees to own shares while others are available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Another 20 small companies will be revitalized by being leased
or operated on a contract basis, and those with several years of
experience of losses will be allowed to declare bankruptcy or to
be mergered.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Raps U.S. Interference in Others' Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A major Yugoslav newspaper,
"Politika," today condemned the United States for openly
interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders in the U.S. have recently attacked other
countries for "having influenced" U.S. general elections, but
facts show that it is the U.S. that has overtly meddled in other
countries' internal affairs, the newspaper said in a signed
article.
</P>
<P>
The article said the U.S. Congress each year allocates a large
amount of money to influence other countries' politics, and this
has become an open secret.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the U.S. government set up an agency some 15 years
ago to "promote democracy" in other countries, spending some 3
million dollars each year to back political parties, trade unions,
dissidents and news media it favored, so as to influence the
political situation in these countries, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The agency of the U.S. government openly financed certain trade
unions in France, Paraguay, the Philippines and Panama, and in the
1980s, granted some 5 million dollars to Polish people living in
the U.S. to support the "Solidarity Trade Union," the article
noted.
</P>
<P>
It has also exerted influence on the political activities of
the "mild parties" in Portugal, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Northern
Ireland, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is widely known that in 1990, the agency donated 400,000
dollars to a party in the Czech Republic that backed Vaclav Havel
for presidency, and provided Nicaragua with 3 million dollars in
"technical assistance" to help the U.S.-favored candidate to win
the elections, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said that in 1996, the agency spent some 1.6 million dollars
to draft a plan to carry out political propaganda directed at
China, so as to "intensify U.S. influence in China and Asia."
</P>
<P>
The agency's activities to interfere in other countries'
internal affairs, nevertheless, were dwarfed by those of the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which often secretly
plotted to topple or prop up a political figure in other
countries, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the CIA even supported selected political parties
in "friendly" nations of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The CIA also spread rumors, bought off political leaders, and
spent millions and millions of dollars to control the media of a
certain country, the article noted.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Cleaning Up Its Major River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest economic center
has decided to clean the Suzhou River, that runs through the urban
area, to make it suitable for tourism and sight-seeing, a
municipal government official says.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of the river has deteriorated since the
middle part of the century when a large number of factories and
residential areas were built along its banks, and large amounts of
industrial and residential waste water was directly discharged
into it.
</P>
<P>
Since the late '60s, the river has turned black and gives off
an awful odor.
</P>
<P>
In the late '80s, the city laid a large pipe on the river's
northern bank to handle waste water in the 70-sq.km. area, which
discharges the water into the Yangtze River after being
treated. The system's daily capacity is 1.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Now waste water is no longer directly discharged into the
river, and the water quality is improving," said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, because the causes of river pollution are many and
complex and the pollution has gone on for quite a long time, the
river is still black and still smells bad.
</P>
<P>
A major group supporting the clean-river project has been set
up, headed by the mayor, and the city has decided that no solid
matter, or oil or other substances should be found floating on the
river surface after October 1 of this year, and that structures
that do not have permits must be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Some 29 docks will be moved this year, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank plans to help the city clean up the
river, and some overseas Chinese have expressed a wish to donate
to the project, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says U.S. to Maintain Strong Presence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States will keep a
significant military presence in Asia even if there will be a
peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was making the remarks in Honolulu, Hawaii, on his way to
Japan and South Korea for a two-day visit, designed to highlight
the U.S. commitment to maintaining a large troop presence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We will still have to maintain a significant presence in the
region, we would still remain a strong presence in Korea," Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to remain in Korea, assuming there's a unification,
into the indefinite future," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are about 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea, and 45,000
troops in Japan, which, with some troops stationed in other parts
of the region, totals up to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's remarks indicate that the United States would never
relinquish its intention to flaunt its military strength in the
Asian-Pacific area to make sure its influence would not be dented.
</P>
<P>
This is Cohen's second trip abroad as defense secretary and
first to Asia. He told reporters he hoped to travel to China
before the end of the year in search of ways to establish more
regular U.S.-Chinese military contacts.
</P>
<P>
When he is in Japan and South Korea, he will meet government
and military officials of both countries and discuss a wide range
of security issues with them. He will also inspect American forces
in the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai province in the
northwestern part of China provided training courses for 500,000
farmers to teach them practical agricultural techniques during
their slack season last winter.
</P>
<P>
In four months of training, the farmers were shown ten new
techniques for planting wheat and corn, for prevention of diseases
and insects, and for greenhouse vegetable growing.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored jointly by the local agriculture department, science

husbandry department, the training will help spread the use of new
techniques for agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, the courses are part of an
agricultural development plan of the province this year.
</P>
<P>
To see that farmers understand the new techniques, the local
government sent more than 2,000 technicians to villages to train
them on the spot. It also allocated special funds for books and
teaching equipment. In this way the province will increase the
acreage that is using new technology by 23,000 ha.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest City Plans Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's most populated and,
perhaps, most polluted city is planning to clean up its dirty
image in the next few years, municipal government sources say.
</P>
<P>
A "Green Program" campaign has begun this year to control the
heavy pollution of this city in southwest China, which is now the
fourth municipality that is directly under central government
control.
</P>
<P>
The city is one of China's oldest industrial centers and is
famous for its acid rain, and the 30 million people of the
newly-expanded urban area suffer from smoke, dust, and other
effluvia churned out by thousands of factories.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up program has 29 items that deal with polluted
water, gas, acid rain, and the environment as a whole, and are
expected to meet state criteria for pollution control by the year
2000, sources say.
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy thing is the 300 factories that will
control water pollution, half of which will be built in the Three
Gorges reservoir area along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is regarded as a major place for improving the
Chinese economy in underdeveloped central and western regions, and
is a focal point of resettlement efforts for towns that will be
flooded by the Three Gorges Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts say that the ambitious program will be a
hard job. Unlike Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, the other three
municipalities directly under central government control, all of
which are located on plains, Chongqing is a hilly city where
geographical and meteorological conditions make things more
difficult.

KIEV, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will develop a powerful,
modernized navy, Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said in a
congratulatory message to the Ukrainian navy to mark its fifth
birthday.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian navy was founded on April 5, 1992, under a decree

</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian navy was made up of surface forces, navy air
force, surface-based missile force, marine corps and special
troops.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Ukrainian navy has 30 warships, 80 auxiliary

<HEADLINE> Number of Senior People in Indonesia Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of senior people in
Indonesia between 1990 and 2025 will increase by 414 percent, said
a lecturer at the medical faculty of the Diponegoro Univesity in
Semarang, Central Java, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
"This means, by 2025 there will be 20 million additional old
people in the country," said Prof. Dr. Boedhi Darmojo.
</P>
<P>
He also said the hike rate is the highest in the world compared
with Kenya's 347 percent, Brazil's 255 percent, India's 242
percent, China's 220 percent, Japan's 129 percent, Germany's 66
percent and Sweden's 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in the number of old people is predicted to bring
Indonesia to the fifth or sixth rank in the list of countries with
the highest number of old people by 2000," Darmojo said, adding
that in 1980 Indonesia ranked the 10th."low quality" in the sense
that they have never experienced formal education as they live in
remote rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the future, however, he expressed his optimism that the
country's old people will mainly comprise of the "quality" ones.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the logical consequence of the successful
development programs in the country which have also push up the
life expectancy of most of its people," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will give Ukraine the
second batch of a business development loan, media reports said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Tamara Solyanyk, deputy head of the National Agency of
Reconstruction and Development, was quoted as saying that the
World Bank's board of directors would take an official decision on
disbursing the second batch at its April 8 meeting.

</P>
<P>
The World Bank is granting the loan for developing small and
medium-sized businesses in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Solyanyk said the disbursement of the second batch depends on
the bank's approval of Ukraine's report on the use of the first
batch of 100 million U.S. dollars, which was granted last
September.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Managing Director Caio Kokh-Wester, who visited Kiev
at the end of March, said that the bank had no serious objections
to the Ukrainian government's report.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is hoping to use the second batch of the loan, along
with a European Union loan of 100 million dollars to service its
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The government said in March that Ukraine will have to spend
130 million dollars on servicing interests on loans from
international financial institutions and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's foreign debt had risen to 8.725 billion dollars by
January 10 this year.

<P>
TIRANA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of unknown gunmen today
blocked a convoy of Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino and his
cabinet ministers on their way to the northern town of Shkoder,
forcing them to return to Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen stood in the way of Fino's convoy at Bushat, a
village south of Shkoder, in the morning, shooting in the air and
throwing grenades to the roadside.
</P>
<P>
Fino and his ministers, who planned to hold talks with local
leaders, representatives of political parties and religious
figures in Shkoder, were forced to turn back.
</P>
<P>
Fino convened a special cabinet meeting after returning to
Tirana and strongly condemned this anti-government action,
instructing the Interior and Defense Ministries to start
investigation immediately.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Arben Malaj, who traveled with Fino, said the
gunmen claimed that 120 people from Shkoder were being held in the
southern port of Sarande and demanded their release.
</P>
<P>
Malaj denied the claims but said the government would check
them out.
</P>
<P>
Since Fino took office as the prime minister of the national
reconciliation government on March 12, this is the first time for
him to visit the northern part of the country where he has few
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Although the political crisis in Albania has been relaxing
recently, robbery and terrorism are still rampant in some places.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has been calling for an urgent
deployment of an international peace-keeping force in the country.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had agreed to send an Italian-led
6,000-member force to help protect aid delivery to Albania. But
Italy said on Friday it would not be ready until April 14 at the
earliest.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (5-6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (5-6) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why should people in the mainland also familiarize
themselves with the Basic Law?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law is a law on the Hong Kong SAR, but it is
also a national law to be observed by the whole nation. As a
national law, it safeguards national unity, sovereignty and
territorial integrity, protects national security and the basic
social system of the country, and guarantees direct administration
over the Hong Kong SAR by the central government.
</P>
<P>
By stipulating that the Hong Kong SAR is an inalienable local
administrative region of China, the law helps maintain a
harmonious relationship between Hong Kong and the interior.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, therefore, represents the will and interests of
not only Hong Kong compatriots but also the Chinese nation as a
whole. The Basic Law should be abided by not only by the Hong Kong
SAR but also by the central authorities, provinces, autonomous
regions and centrally-administered municipalities, not only by
Hong Kong people but also by people in the interior.
</P>
<P>
To abide by the Basic Law, people must first be familiar with
it.
</P>
<P>
Question: Why will capitalism and the existing way of life in
Hong Kong remain unchanged for 50 years after China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over it?
</P>
<P>
Answer: On the settlement of the Hong Kong question, Deng
Xiaoping said: "There can be only two ways: one is peaceful, the
other nonpeaceful. To settle the Hong Kong question peacefully, we
have to take into account realities in Hong Kong, and realities in
China and in Britain as well. In other words, the way of settling
the question should be acceptable to all the three sides."
</P>
<P>
"If we were to achieve the reunification (of Hong Kong and the
motherland) with socialism, acceptance by the three sides would be
difficult. A reluctant acceptance would lead to a chaotic
situation. Even if no armed conflict occured, Hong Kong would
become a desolate city with a lot of problems, and that is not a
Hong Kong we hope to have."
</P>
<P>
"So far as the Hong Kong question is concerned, therefore, the
only solution acceptable to all the three sides is the 'one
country, two systems' arrangement, under which Hong Kong is
allowed to retain its capitalist system and maintain its status as
a free port and a financial center. There is no other alternative."
</P>
<P>
Why will Hong Kong be allowed to keep its existing capitalist
system and lifestyle unchanged for 50 years? Deng Xiaoping
said: "This is also based on Chinese realities."
</P>
<P>
"It will take 30-50 years for China to get really developed, or
for it to come close to, rather than surpass, developed
countries. If, before the end of this century, we need to
implement an open policy, then in the first 50 years of the next
century, when China comes closer to developed countries, we need
to continue implementing this policy."
</P>
<P>
"It won't do to discard this policy. Maintaining the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong accords with China's own vital
interests. When we say '50 years', it is not something spoken of
casually, out of a burst of emotions. It is the result of taking
into account of China's realities and requirements for its
development."
</P>
<P>
"If (China's) open policy remains unchanged in the first 50
years of the next century, then in the second 50 years when we
have more economic exchanges with the rest of the world and when
there is a greater inter-dependence (between China and the rest of
the world), it will be still more impossible for China to change
its open policy."

<HEADLINE> More Child Care Centers Become Homes For Elderly In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- With a growing population of
elderly and a declining birth rate in Shanghai, China's industrial
and financial center, some child care centers have been
transformed into homes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 2.27 million people at and above the age of
60, accounting for 17.4 percent of the metropolitan population,
and the city's 330 welfare facilities for old people, which have
15,000 beds, are far from sufficient.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the declining birth rate in recent years has
meant that child care workers are facing the possibility of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
So, governments at all levels have allocated funds to turn some
of the child care centers into old folks' homes by adding medical
facilities, libraries, and by training people to care for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
The Putuo District is an experimental area for this, where five
child care centers have been changed into homes for the
elderly. This move has been followed by ten other districts.

<HEADLINE> Wasps Used in Costa Rica to Control Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican agricultural
technicians are using certain types of wasps to eliminate pests
and replace insecticides that have negative impact on human health
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The "Trichograma" wasp can control some 250 kinds of pests that
threaten cultivation of vegetables and fruits in several parts of
the country, the Agriculture Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To control one hectare of cultivated land, 120,000 wasps are
needed, at a cost of a little more than two U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Trichograma wasp is used in Russia, South America, the
Caribbean and Europe.

<HEADLINE> China Allows Bigger Population Growth of Ethnic Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The couples of minority groups in
China's vast northwestern regions are allowed to have a second or
even third child, unlike the majority Han group, and women of
child-bearing age are now being provided with better medical
treatment and other services in China's remote regions.
</P>
<P>
Chichige, a 38-year-old herdswoman in the Badain Jaran Desert
in Inner Mongolia, told Xinhua, "I had planned to have two
children. But, my first two children were girls who couldn't drive
the camels to do heavy work. So I had a third child -- a boy who
is now six years old."
</P>
<P>
She said the local government understood her difficulties and
when she was about to have her third child, they arranged for a
special medical team that drove more than 100 kilometers to her
house.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its one-child policy in the late 1970s to curb
the dramatic population growth, but eased family planning
restrictions for families of ethnic groups, even though family
planning was also advocated for better economic and cultural
development in ethnic areas and to improve the quality of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhilan, the director of the Family Planning Commission of
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that the 48 ethnic
groups there include Mongolians, Huis, and Manchus, most of them
living in border areas that are sparsely populated and with a
harsh environment.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia covers 1.18 million square kilometers, 12.3
percent of China's total landspace, and has a population of 23
million, which accounts for 1.8 percent of the nation's total. The
region's birth rate stands at 9.6 per thousand, lower than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Mongolian population, the major ethnic
group there, had declined sharply. These people, with their
glorious history, had only 680,000 people when the autonomous
region was established in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The number of Mongolians came to 3.7 million, accounting for
15.8 of the region's total population, and the group's birth rate
was 20 per thousand. Other minority groups amounted to nearly
850,000 people and had a birth rate of 15 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since the early 1950s the central government has
sent a large number of medical personnel to the vast Inner
Mongolian grasslands to combat epidemic and infectious diseases
like plague and venereal disease. Quite a few Mongolian women who
had become infertile because of the venereal disease regained
their reproductive capacity after receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian population has seen rapid growth in the past few
years and numbered 3.7 million by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The nomadic life has meant that Mongolians tend to have fewer
children, and although their living conditions have greatly
improved, they still follow that tradition. However, the women of
other minority groups still expect to have more children.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhilan, who has been involved in family planning for more
than 20 years, says that the regional government has focused on
improving the quality of life in the ethnic population rather than
curbing their numbers.
</P>
<P>
The region has several hundred schools and family planning
service centers for the nomadic population. Medical workers go by
horse or car for more than a hundred kilometers to provide medical
check-ups for pregnant women and family planning advice.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that more than 90 percent of the towns and villages
are even equipped with ultrasound equipment.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Makes Wood Carving to Mark Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in north China's
Hebei province plans to provide the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region with a large wood carving, which he made to
mark the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The jujube wood carving is 50 cm by 50 cm by 15 cm and is like
the railway connecting Beijing and Kowloon. On its pedestal is an
ox pulling a cart, loaded with the territory of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The carving symbolizes the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland in 1997, the Year of the Ox in the Chinese calendar,
the carver, Wang Ziran, explains.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the rough sculpture, which is made from a
105-kilogram piece of jujube, has high artistic value.
</P>
<P>
Wang spent half a year drawing the design and scouring the
county for the right piece of wood.
</P>
<P>
"To express a farmer's joyous feeling about the return of Hong
Kong and the unification of China, I will give this to Mr. Tung
Chee-hwa, the first chief executive of the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region as a gift," said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crude Oil Prices Drop Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the crudes
and refined products closed at 15.90 U.S. dollars per barrel last
week, said the Energy and Mines Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The average price estimated for April of 1997 will be 16.23
dollars per barrel, a continual drop from 17 dollars per barrel in
March, 18.70 dollars in February and 20.36 dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
The price fall was a result of seasonal effect of less demand
for energy.
</P>
<P>
However, oil sector sources said the Venezuelan profits from
the export of hydrocarbons will maintain stable during the
April-May-June quarter as a consequence of the price rise in
gasoline in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The average basket price of crudes and byproducts set by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was 17.40
dollars per barrel at the close of last week.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Carries Out Seed Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's new end-of-century
seed project will promote improvement in seed strains used in the
city's rural areas, according to the local agriculture department.
</P>
<P>
The department says that by the year 2000, two generations of
rice strains will be developed and one new generation of wheat and
rapeseed will be worked out. The new seeds will be used in 90
percent of the municipality's farmland.
</P>
<P>
All seeds used in the city will be refined and provided with
proof of brand to avoid falsification in packaging.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for fine seed-breeding bases with
technicians and equipment on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts point out that some factors hindering the
reaching of this goal are diversified research, production and
sales, and poor managment in the seed business.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will set up three large bases for
municipal-level seed use and inspection, for oil-bearing seeds,
and a rice-breeding base.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has nearly 70,000 ha of fine seed-breeding bases
and 75 percent of the seeds used are provided by using
guidelines.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong province
plans to spend some 56 billion yuan (about 7 billion US dollars)
in environmental protection during the 1996-2000 period, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that government input will account for about 30
percent of the total funding, and that from enterprises will make
up 40 percent. Another 30 percent will come from loans.
</P>
<P>
Tang Bingquan, the province's vice-governor, told China
Environmental News that pollution has held back the province's
economic development and threatened people's health.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that the provincial government will increase its
input in environmental protection, arranging 20 million yuan a
special fund for the environment every year during the 1996-2000
period.
</P>
<P>
"The fund will increase with the growth of the province's
financial capacity," Tang added.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong officials have asked all provincial cities and
counties to earmark funds for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that three things are "absolutely not allowed" in
the province's environmental protection campaign: sacrificing the
environment for economic development; ignoring the best interests
of future generations in order to satisfy the desires of today's
generation; and overlooking general and long-term interests for
benefits now.

<HEADLINE> Grand National Horse Race Abandoned After Bomb Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Grand National horse race, one
of Britain's greatest sporting events, had to be abandoned today
after bombing threat were sent to police.
</P>
<P>
Police told officials at Aintree course, near the north-west
city of Liverpool, to evacuate the whole race course and clear the
site after receiving coded warnings of two bombs on the site,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Around 60,000 spectators plus the 38 jockeys were moved off the
site half an hour before the start of the scheduled race early in
the afternoon. Officials later abandoned racing for the rest of
the day.
</P>
<P>
Security forces carried out a controlled explosion at the
course after finding several suspect packages.
</P>
<P>
Although It was not immediately clear who had delivered the
bomb warnings, Prime Minister John Major blamed the IRA again for
the incident, saying he was "appalled that the IRA seem to be
threatening hundreds of thousands of people and causing such
disruption."
</P>
<P>
"This is further demonstration of their contempt and disregard
for the lives and interest of ordinary people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, policie found two bombs on road bridges after
receiving coded telephone warnings, and two major motorways had to
be closed for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago the Grand National ended in turmoil in different
circumstances after two false starts led to the race being
declared void.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been trying for more than 25 years to end British
rule of Northern Ireland. It called off a 17-month long ceasefire
in February, 1996, and has since exploded several large bombs on
the British mainland.
