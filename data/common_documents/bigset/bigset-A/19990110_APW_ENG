<HEADLINE> Study: Boomers To Alter Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The demanding, cash-heavy and  
technology-savvy baby boomers who have driven the retail market 
will do the same with an ever-restrictive health care industry, 
inspiring customer-friendly services and an explosion in medical 
advertising, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasting the impact of aging baby boomers that are starting  
to spend more time at the doctors' office, analysts at the 
Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park research group presenting 
their findings Monday, said this generation -- which has come to 
rely on brand names and flexible options when they shop -- will 
become increasingly vocal about what they want from managed care. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new consumer is a pretty empowered person,'' said Wendy  
Everett, director of a study commissioned by the Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got money, resources and the ability to make decisions  
that ten years ago we just didn't have. That allows them to become 
much more demanding, much more mobile when it comes to having 
health plans to choose from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. population of people age 65 and older has grown from  
about 25 million in 1980 to about 35 million today. It's projected 
to rise sharply beginning in 2010, from 40 million that year to 70 
million just 20 years later, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 28 percent of the U.S. population is temporarily or  
consistently uninsured. Another 34 percent have low job security 
and are in managed care plans paid by employers who may not 
guarantee retirement benefits or are trying to reduce them. The 
remaining 38 percent are in more secure jobs with managed care or 
fee-for service plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Many members of these groups will have discretionary incomes of  
$50,000 or more, at least a year of college under their belts and 
Internet proficiency, the report says, making them a powerful 
market influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in our country's history, the majority will  
have ... critical thinking skills,'' Ms. Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money -- not legislative policy changes -- is likely to do much of  
the talking as employers pass onto baby boomers moving into their 
50s more health care costs, reducing their premium contributions 
and restricting the benefits they offer, Ms. Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
	These ``pushy baby boomers'' will demand accountability: more  
benefits security, flexibility and coverage in their plans, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Another likely result of baby boomers' skepticism is provider  
report cards like those on health plans that are currently 
accessible to 10 to 15 percent of all consumers. That number should 
increase, with about 50 percent of all consumers being able to get 
information on plan quality by 2010 -- with the Internet key sources 
of their information -- the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is pretty sensitive to supply and demand,'' Everett  
said. ``It's the stuff that the retail world has been doing 
forever. They're open on Thursday night, they're open on the 
weekend. Health care has to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 2010, when the first of the baby boomers hit 65, change  
will be incremental. But after that, be prepared for a major 
consumer revolution, Ms. Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushy baby boomers are not willing to wait,'' she said. ``If  
they don't get what they want, they're going to walk to another 
provider. ... The health plans that have figured out how to meet 
these consumers' wishes are gong to be extremely successful.''

<HEADLINE> Panama City Wins at Gulfstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Panama City rallied to win the $100,000,  
Grade 3 Mac Diarmida Handicap for 3-year-olds and up on the grass 
at Gulfstream Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Panama City made the lead in midstretch  
the second time around and won by four and one-half lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Longshot The Kaiser came from the last to finish second.  
Notoriety and Musical Ghost, the odds-on favorite, battled for the 
lead for most of the 1 3-8 miles distance and killed each other 
off. They finished third and fourth respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama City was timed in 2:20 3-5 on a good course and paid  
$8.40 and $4,40 and $3.60. The Kaiser paid $7.60 and $5.60. 
Notoriety paid $5.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Notoriety, on the inside, and Musician Ghost, raced as a team  
into the far turn the first time around. They went head and head 
into the backstretch, seven lengths in front of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
	On the far turn the final time, the two pacesetters still were  
on even terms as Panama City started to move on the outside, 
cutting the deficit to three and a half lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama City collared the leaders at the eighth pole and drew  
out. The Kaiser closed with a rush for second, two and one-half 
lengths clear of Notoriety, who outfinished Musical Ghost by a neck 
for third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner is the five-year-old Kentucky-bred son of El Gran  
Senor, and is owned by Robert Sangster and Joseph Lamcombe. He has 
won five of 18 starts with four seconds and a third, earning a 
total of $462,868. 
</P>
<P>
	He closed out 1997 with a victory in the W.L. McKnight Handicap  
at Calder and earned $332,995 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he finished out of the money in all five of his  
starts.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Discuss Treasury Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government will conduct a new round of  
talks Jan. 18 with foreign holders of frozen treasury bills, the 
Interfax news agency reported Sunday, citing Deputy Finance 
Minister Oleg Vyugin. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, the Russian officials concluded negotiations  
with both domestic and foreign investors on basic restructuring 
parameters of some $40 billion of bills, on which the previous 
government defaulted in August. Foreigners hold about $10 billion 
of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	While domestic investors seemed mostly content with the terms,  
foreigners have balked at some aspects of the restructuring plan 
and demanded additional talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the debt holders were promised to redeem 10  
percent of their bills, maturing through Dec. 31 1999, in cash and 
to swap a portion of the remaining frozen bills in new bonds with 
maturities from three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	After agreeing on the initial set of terms in early November  
last year, however, foreign investors have emphasized that a final 
restructuring agreement has not been reached. They have also 
complained that the government has provided little detail about the 
repatriation of cash proceeds from the unfrozen debt.

<HEADLINE> Returning Online Buys Not So Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for the Internet turning shopping into a  
point-click-and-buy experience. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to returning goods to many online merchants, you  
still need to phone in, wait for a representative who can give you 
a return authorization number, pack up the items and schlep to the 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is easy to buy online, but is hard if you don't want  
something. That's where the convenience of the Internet breaks 
down,'' said Brenda Nashawaty of Boston, who has returned books and 
shoes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an incredible holiday season for Internet merchants, with  
sales soaring well above expectations. An estimated $3 billion was 
spent online during the holidays, nearly tripling from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Enticing many shoppers to the Internet was its convenience. With  
a computer in hand, they could buy from home, work or hotel, and 
had access to an unthinkable number of merchants. Within days, 
their purchases arrived, sometimes even wrapped with cards 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that Christmas is through, consumers are seeing that the  
high-tech online world has some low-tech glitches -- with returns 
topping the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Many retailers require consumers to notify them before sending  
an item back -- that involves time on the phone to get a return 
confirmation number. Most insist on a prepaid, insured delivery 
method, which means waiting on line at UPS, Federal Express or the 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
	While that is similar to catalog returns, many shoppers who were  
lured to the ease of the Internet simply didn't expect such 
hands-on hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people tried buying online this year, but they didn't  
check the return policies and now they're getting bitten,'' said 
Preston Gralla, author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online 
Shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many online merchants hired outsiders to run their Web sites,  
but not all handle exchanges. That means some shoppers are finding 
another unexpected inconvenience: they must first return the item 
and get a refund before purchasing something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants, like Shopping.com, will only accept the item if  
it is shipped in the packaging it came in, which means holding on 
to boxes and wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
	And many others, including Victoria's Secret and Wal-Mart, won't  
let shoppers return most goods to their brick-and-mortar stores. 
That's frustrating for shoppers who chose to buy from traditional 
retailers' Web sites because they assumed they could make returns 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no wonder the consumers are confused,'' said Jim Daniell,  
chief executive of OrderTrust, which runs the online services for 
some well-known merchants like SkyMall and Catalog City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Returns are a key element of customer service and retailers  
have to get their arms around this issue this year. It has to be 
easier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing consumers' complaints, some online retailers are  
already taking action. Amazon.com, for instance, has extended its 
holiday returns deadline until Jan. 31, instead of its usual policy 
of 30 days after purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Many others are agreeing to pay shipping for returns if a  
customer complains about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	One new Internet mall, Buyitonline.com, is going so far as to  
offer a no-hassle return policy. The site, which launches Monday 
with more than 100 small merchants, will send UPS to a shopper's 
home to pick up any unwanted item. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have consumers come to our site and everything is good  
except for the problems with the returns, then we've ruined the 
whole buying experience for them and they might not come back,'' 
said Michael Clebnik, president and chief operating officer at 
Buyitonline.com. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Nashawaty won't stop shopping over the Internet, she's  
learned that she must read the return policies more closely before 
she makes a purchase. She was frustrated with how complicated it 
was to return at some sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is as easy as its seems,'' said Ms. Nashawaty. ``I  
shopped online because I don't have a lot of time, but I ended up 
wasting a lot of time.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Searching for New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel's abrupt departure from the  
University of Colorado in the middle of a recruiting weekend left 
some unmistakably angry feelings around the stunned campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel confirmed Saturday night that he had accepted a  
lucrative, seven-year offer to be head football coach at the 
University of Washington. The deal reportedly will pay him $1.5 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, who earned $625,000 annually at Colorado, will join  
Florida's Steve Spurrier, Florida State's Bobby Bowden and 
Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer as the only seven-figure coaches in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad timing,'' Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Because national letter-of-intent signing day is less than a  
month away (Feb. 3), Tharp said he was forming a search committee 
and would move ``expeditiously'' to find a successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Even worse, 11 recruits were on the Colorado campus, being sold  
on the Buffaloes' program by assistant coaches and players at the 
same time that the head coach was informing Colorado officials he 
was departing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no good time to do this,'' Neuheisel insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen prospects have already verbally committed to Colorado,  
but at least one of them said Saturday night he was reneging on 
that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	LaRoy Bias, a speedy wide receiver from Smoky Hill High School  
in Aurora, said Saturday night he will go elsewhere because 
Neuheisel is leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	The news shocked Jon Hawk, a 6-foot-6, 280-pound defensive  
tackle from Mullen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll still honor the commitment,'' Hawk said, ``but this  
leaves everything wide open now. I'll have to talk with my family 
to see what we'll do. This is unbelievable. He told all the 
in-state guys that they should stay in-state and that he was 
staying, and now he's leaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of recruits who were on campus over the weekend were  
informed of the news as they walked to dinner Saturday night. One 
player left the building in tears, declining to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will play Washington in Seattle next Sept. 25, which  
should make for an intriguing matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``If coach Neuheisel is the coach of the Huskies, I can't wait  
to go up there and kick their butt,'' said Colorado linebacker Ty 
Gregorak. ``I want to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked right now. The thing that's bothering me is what's  
going to happen to the staff?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel recommended three current Colorado assistants to Tharp  
as possible successors: defensive coordinator A.J. Christoff, 
offensive coordinator Karl Dorrell and defensive ends coach Jon 
Embree. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker coach Brian Cabral, a holdover from the previous  
staff of Bill McCartney, has said he would apply for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	Other names that could appear on the search committee's list  
include Northwestern coach Gary Barnett and LSU coach Gerry 
DiNardo, both former Colorado assistants; Joe Glenn, who has led 
Northern Colorado to two straight NCAA Division II national 
championships in the past three years, and Texas Christian's Dennis 
Franchione. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett issued a statement on Sunday that read:  
</P>
<P>
	``My entire professional life prior to Northwestern was in the  
state of Colorado. It is only natural everyone would assume that I 
would be eager to return. However, while there is certainly a 
strong fondness for the University of Colorado, I have neither been 
contacted by anyone at Colorado nor has anything occurred that 
would alter my December 1997 statement that I intend to fulfill my 
contract at NU.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, 37, went 33-14 in his four seasons at Colorado,  
leading the school to three bowl wins. He replaces Jim Lambright, 
fired after the Huskies' first non-winning season in 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Mulgrew May Beam Off Voyager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Capt. Kathryn Janeway may be ready to abort her  
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported Sunday that Kate Mulgrew, who plays the  
captain on ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' wants to leave the show. The 
newspaper said Ms. Mulgrew is tired of 80-hour work weeks and that 
she wants to devote more time to her teen-age children and upcoming 
marriage to Tim Hagan, a Cleveland politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mulgrew also complained Friday to TV critics in California  
that she was fed up with Hollywood because it lacks intimacy and a 
sense of community. She said she wanted to return to theater work 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Mulgrew's comments were reported, Paramount, which  
owns the UPN network where ``Voyager'' airs, issued a statement in 
which Ms. Mulgrew said she ``cannot imagine not participating in 
(the show's) entire run, whatever that may be.''

<HEADLINE> IPO Makes Taiwan Man a Billionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The public listing of Quanta Computer Inc.  
last week created an instant billionaire in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong-born Lin Pai-li, who founded Quanta in Taiwan 10 years  
ago, now holds 24 percent of the company's shares with an estimated 
value of $1.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As Taiwan's largest notebook computer maker, Quanta went public  
on Friday and its stock immediately became the highest priced on 
the Taiwan Stock Exchange. It was traded at $12.45 per share and 
traders expect the shares to rise further this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Notebooks have emerged a rising star in Taiwan's computer  
industry, replacing monitors as the island's top computer product 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 6 million notebooks Taiwan turned out last year, Quanta  
produced 1.3 million sets, accounting for about 8 percent of the 
world output. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin, chairman of the company, came to Taiwan to attend college  
in 1965 and established Quanta in 1988 with another computer 
engineer from Hong Kong, Liang Tse-chen, who is now Quanta's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	A computer wizard and former maker of calculators, Lin has said  
his best interest lies in knocking down computers and reassembling 
them, something he could do well even in complete darkness.

<HEADLINE> NFL Teams Videotaping Locker Rooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NFL teams are permitted to videotape their  
locker rooms and, according to the head of the players association, 
at least 25 percent of the franchises appear to be monitoring their 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason might not just be for security purposes.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets are one team that uses hidden cameras to  
monitor their facility, The New York Times said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a spokesman for the team denied the team uses video  
cameras for surveillance purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things around here have knocked me for a loop, but  
this is one of the biggest,'' said a defensive starter for the 
Jets, who requested anonymity. ``My first thought was, `Has the 
team been spying on us?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell confirmed that some teams were  
using surveillance equipment in the locker rooms, but he was not in 
favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd fire the first guy who did that here,'' Modell said. ``No  
video cameras, no audiotapes, no eavesdropping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several agents were aware Jets players were being filmed in the  
locker room after thefts occurred last season at the team's 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of facilities have surveillance equipment  
throughout the complex and locker room,'' Gene Upshaw, executive 
director of the players association, said. ``I believe this and 
I've been told this by some teams. But the equipment is there for 
security, not so much for surveillance.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Eyes $60B for R&AMP;D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG plans to invest $55 billion to  
$60 billion in research and development over the next three years 
as it seeks to lead the auto industry in technological innovation, 
co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the broader vehicle line that resulted from the recent  
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, the new 
automaker doesn't expect to have to sell its technological 
innovations to its competitors to justify the large investment, 
Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, DaimlerChrysler will introduce major technological  
advances on its premium brands, such as Mercedes-Benz, then 
incorporate them over time into its higher-volume divisions, such 
as Dodge, Jeep and Smart. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp's comments came during the opening session of the  
Automotive News World Congress, an annual gathering of auto 
executives that coincides with the start of the North American 
International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Daimler and Chrysler together spent $16.5 billion on  
research and development. Schrempp noted that amounts to $45 
million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, more than 80 percent of our revenues come from products  
introduced within the last five years,'' Schrempp said. ``Only 
superior, innovative products deliver the competitive edge to 
provide above-average margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp and co-chairman Robert J. Eaton gave an optimistic  
outlook for DaimlerChrysler and the industry. But Eaton said the 
industry's overcapacity -- it's ability to build more cars and 
trucks than consumers are willing to buy -- will lead to further 
consolidation of automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consolidation is a fact of life in this industry,'' Eaton  
said. ``We were the first. There will be more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton referred to the rumored behind-the scenes discussions of  
potential auto mergers during last week's media preview of the 
Detroit show as a ``giant cotillion, with everybody looking for the 
best dance partner and trying to figure out who leads and who 
follows. I think some are actually well into the heavy courting 
stage, and I predict that in 1999 we'll see some marriage 
announcements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was nearly one year to the day that Eaton and Schrempp held  
their first meeting that resulted in the merger. Since the deal was 
completed in November, speculation has focused on a potential 
DaimlerChrysler linkup with Nissan Motor Corp.

	Witnesses at Clinton Trial Debated  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testimony from witnesses is crucial to  
conducting the impeachment trial of President Clinton, several 
Republican senators who will sit as jurors said today. Countering, 
Democrats said testimony could unnecessarily prolong the trial and 
end the current bipartisan harmony. House Republicans who will act 
as prosecutors in the trial are also pressing for the right to call 
witnesses, chiefly Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern 
with whom Clinton admitted an extramarital affair. Rep. Lindsey 
Graham, R-S.C., said prosecutors could call six or seven witnesses 
and still finish their case by the middle of February. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Increase Public Land  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose  
dramatic increases in spending to preserve open spaces by expanding 
federal land purchases while giving millions of dollars to states 
for urban parks and land conservation. The package would call for 
spending between $900 million and $1.5 billion a year in 
open-spaces initiatives. The plan includes grants to states for 
building parks, and a package of tax incentives for preserving 
farmland, suburban green spaces and parkland. 

</P>
<P>
	Offenders Serve More Time in Prison  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prisoners are spending more time behind bars  
as states enact laws to narrow the gap between sentences handed 
down and the time offenders actually serve, the government said 
today. Violent offenders released in 1997 -- people convicted of 
murder, rape, robbery or aggravated assault -- spent an average of 
49 months in prison, up from 43 months in 1993, a study by the 
Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed. On 
average, violent offenders freed in 1997 had served 54 percent of 
their sentences. In 1993, they had served 47 percent.

	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Monitors in Kosovo today  
tried to avert a military showdown by urging ethnic Albanian rebels 
to free eight Yugoslav soldiers held captive in a northern village. 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana appealed for the soldiers' 
release and called on both sides to show restraint. International 
officials fear an escalation of violence could destroy the 
cease-fire that halted more than seven months of fighting in 
Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian-majority province of Serbia,

	Palestinians Demand Troop Pullback  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leaders demanded yesterday that  
Israel proceed with a troop pullback from the West Bank that was to 
have taken place last month under the Wye River peace accord. 
Israel called off the promised withdrawal, citing what it said were 
Palestinian violations of the accord. The Palestinians deny 
violating the agreement, and say they will not meet new terms 
demanded by Israel. Seeking to step up outside pressure on Israel, 
Yasser Arafat's government sent a letter yesterday to U.S. peace 
envoy Dennis Ross and representatives of 94 other countries 
complaining about Israel's suspension of compliance.

boost recruitment for the priesthood, the Roman Catholic Diocese of 
Providence has begun running local ads on the cable music network 
and created a Web site. The Rev. Marcel Taillon, recruiting

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Greyhounds' Death a Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The cause of a virus that killed six  
greyhounds at a dog track here remains a ``medical mystery,'' 
according to a pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74-year-old Derby Lane track was closed Saturday in the wake  
of what one regulator called a ``bloody mess.'' A coughing spell 
among the dogs left six dogs dead and four others critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's obviously something else happening in some of these  
dogs,'' said Dr. William Castleman, the University of Florida 
pathologist who performed an autopsy on one of the dogs, Gaffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it something new?'' Castleman asked Sunday. ``Is it a  
common infection that's just taken a new turn? We don't know. But 
the fact this dog became very ill and started bleeding and died has 
us thinking there has to be something else going on here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castleman said it will probably take two weeks before scientists  
can isolate the pneumonia-like virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The illness also affected greyhounds at Sarasota Kennel Club.  
The track had 33 dogs scratched in the last three cards Thursday 
and Friday nights, most of which suffered ``canine cough'' 
syndrome, or tracheobronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other reports of disease outbreaks at greyhound  
tracks in Hollywood and Fort Myers, said Deborah Miller, director 
Florida's Division of Parimutuel Wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers reported that dogs suffering the mystery illness were  
bleeding through the nose and the mouth, discharging bloody stools. 
Some had blood vessels in their skin burst. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've evidently been a bloody mess,'' said Miller.  
``Whatever type of infection this is, it breaks down the clotting 
mechanisms in the dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dogs at Hollywood Greyhound Track have been put under  
quarantine after several greyhounds came down with a virus 
different than the one in St. Petersburg, Garry Duell, assistant 
racing secretary at the track, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the same virus,'' he insisted. ``It's the normal  
kennel cough that they get this time of year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several dogs were scratched from the race card Saturday but none  
where taken off Sunday, Duell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the virus scare, Greyhound Protection League, a San  
Francisco-based anti-racing group, has urged owners to impose a 
nationwide quarantine at the greyhound tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Tampa Bay coordinator, Janet skinner, said dietary  
problems and unsanitary conditions at Derby Lane could make animals 
in close quarters susceptible to infection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cal Holland, president of the Tampa Bay Greyhound  
Association, insisted the 1,155 dogs at the track, most ranging 
from 2 to 3 years old, are well cared for. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the best-kept compounds in the country,''  
Holland said. ``We treat our animals better than most people treat 
their kids.''

<HEADLINE>  Doubters Silenced by Denver's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos dissected the Dolphins. Now  
they will try to tackle the Tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who routed Miami 38-3 in Saturday's AFC divisional  
playoff game, learned Sunday that they will play coach Bill 
Parcells and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship next Sunday 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets beat Jacksonville 34-24 on Sunday for their first  
playoff victory since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and the Jets have never met in the playoffs, but  
Denver pounded New England 37-3 and 34-8 in consecutive seasons 
when Parcells was head coach of the Patriots in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success,'' Denver coach Mike 
Shanahan said, ``and obviously a coach who has a couple of Super 
Bowl rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells -- dubbed ``Tuna'' after asking his players, ``Who do  
you think I am, Charlie the Tuna?'' -- has worked his magic for the 
Jets, guiding them to their first playoff appearance since 1991. 
Since finishing 1-15 in 1996, the Jets are 21-11 in regular season 
games under Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great man leading them,'' Denver safety Tyrone  
Braxton said. ``Parcells, he's won everywhere he's gone. There's no 
reason to think he wouldn't win there. But it's surprising that he 
did it so quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have enjoyed a mini-resurrection of their own. After  
two late-season losses, critics questioned whether they would 
survive their first playoff game against Miami, which humbled them 
on national television three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver silenced the doubters with a 35-point victory that helped  
ease any apprehension outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' offensive  
lineman Dan Neil said. ``Everybody's an expert. We weren't 
struggling. I don't think anyone was panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos lost two of their final three games after winning  
their first 13, but looked about as loose as they have all season 
Saturday, springing league MVP Terrell Davis for 199 yards rushing 
and forcing three Miami turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, John Elway said Denver's two-game losing streak  
allowed the Broncos to relax in the wake of their pressure-packed 
run at perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure we'd love to have been undefeated,'' Elway said, ``but  
that kind of overshadowed everything we were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver healthy, focused and seemingly on top of its game,  
the Jets will have to contend with a defense that gave up just 14 
yards rushing against Miami and an offense that methodically picked 
apart the Dolphins through the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the challenge will be the crowd noise at Mile High  
Stadium, where the Broncos have won 18 straight games since a 
playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 2,008 yards rushing during the regular season,  
said he might have aggravated a rib injury Saturday, but does not 
expect to miss any practice time. Elway also had lingering soreness 
after taking a blind-side hit from Miami's Zach Thomas late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only real question mark is offensive tackle Tony Jones,  
who sprained his right knee. An MRI was negative, and Shanahan 
hopes he can return to practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not done yet,'' Braxton said. ``We have to look at the  
big picture. This is one piece of the puzzle. This is not it.''

	GOP, Democrats Debate Witness Issue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats hit the Sunday talk  
shows this morning to make pleas for and against witnesses at 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. The White House urged an 
early dismissal. House Republicans who will be prosecutors say they 
want to call Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's personal secretary Betty 
Currie, his friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. Democrats said testimony could unnecessarily prolong 
the trial and end the current bipartisan harmony.

	Social Security Supplement Sought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's advisers are considering  
how to use government surpluses to help Americans build new 
retirement savings accounts to supplement Social Security. The idea 
of supplemental accounts surfaced at a meeting last week. The 
accounts wouldn't directly address the cash shortfall expected to 
face Social Security as the nation's huge baby boom generation 
retires. But they could help Americans be better prepared for 
retirement. They also have bipartisan backing.

released in 1997 spent an average of 49 months in prison, up from 
43 months in 1993, a study by the Justice Department's Bureau of

killed and tortured thousands of his own people. Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Amr Moussa echoed that unprecedented appeal. The Saudi and 
Egyptian statements are the first direct call by Arab governments

all-out government offensive, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
appealed in Brussels, Belgium, for the soldiers' release and called 
on both sides to show restraint. Although there was no sign of

Friday. That was down about a half-cent over the past three weeks, 
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. The 
price fell below the all-time low of nearly $1.04 reached last

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Unveil Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose  
dramatic increases in spending to preserve open spaces by expanding 
federal land purchases while giving millions of dollars to states 
for urban parks and land conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the White House, Interior Department and other  
agencies were putting together a package that envisions spending 
between $900 million and $1.5 billion a year in open-spaces 
initiatives, according to administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some details of the environmental package, which will be part of  
President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget proposal, have yet to be 
worked out, the officials said. Internal debate continued on 
exactly how much money to request, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was to unveil the first installment -- a  
series of actions aimed at reducing urban sprawl and improving 
``quality of life'' -- in a speech Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal would provide at least $100 million a year,  
mostly in the form of grants to states, for building community 
parks and green areas and protecting environmentally sensitive 
areas from urban development. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to grants funneled through states, Gore's so-called  
``livable communities initiative'' is expected to include a package 
of tax incentives for preserving farmland, suburban green spaces 
and parkland as well as incentives to reduce traffic congestion and 
counter uncontrolled development. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials said Gore's anti-sprawl initiative is part of a  
much broader administration proposal aimed at pumping more money 
into programs that shelter farmland, forests and rangeland from 
development and aid in restoration or protection of coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Such efforts could benefit Gore in his bid for the presidency in  
2000. In signs of public support for such programs, last November's 
elections saw 200 state and local ballot measures aiming to 
preserve watersheds, parks, farmland and other open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal would rely on money from more than  
$6.5 billion collected annually from offshore oil drilling, 
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, as much as $3 billion a year had been proposed but  
drew opposition from the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, which considered it too extravagant, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on the condition of not being further  
identified, said the proposal now is likely to be closer to $1 
billion and probably no more than $1.5 billion, including $900 
million for buying land either directly or through states. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Congress provided about $320 million for public land  
purchases for conservation. Environmentalists have long argued that 
more money should be spent to set aside environmentally sensitive 
lands including rangeland, forests, seashores and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be the first time that we would be saying that  
we're going to make this kind of an investment in the future of 
this country and its open spaces,'' said Rindy O'Brien of the 
Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a need for ``a very major increase in federal funding  
for land acquisition,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the 
Sierra Club. ``There's a tremendous backlog in land purchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's initiative comes as both Republicans and  
Democrats in Congress are signaling readiness to expand programs to 
shelter land from development. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final weeks of the last Congress, legislation was  
introduced in both the Senate and the House that would spend as 
much as $5 billion on such programs. Environmentalists opposed the 
bills, arguing they focused too much on returning money to states 
with offshore drilling.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Ball Control Keys Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Bill Parcells has the New York Jets  
on the brink of a Super Bowl by using the same formula he used to 
get the New York Giants and New England Patriots there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets combined a cold-weather, ball-control offense with a  
solid defense Sunday to pull within a victory of their first Super 
Bowl berth since 1969 with a 34-24 win over the Jacksonville 
Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets reached their first AFC title game since 1982 by  
controlling the ball for 39:16, running 77 play to the Jags' 53 and 
outgaining Jacksonville 429 yards to 251. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason ball control was so important is that when  
quarterback Mark Brunell had the ball, he made things happen for 
Jacksonville, throwing three touchdown passes and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to control the ball, and I think we did,'' Jets  
center Kevin Mawae said. ``I don't know what the time of possession 
was, but I think it was a whole bunch to not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mawae said the Jets put in a cold-weather package for the game,  
and they used it several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically smash-mouth, who wants it the most, and I think  
we came out on top,'' Mawae said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets set the tone from the opening kickoff, moving 70 yards  
in seven plays. Vinny Testaverde capped the drive with a 21-yard TD 
pass to Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you take it down on the opening drive, it does a lot  
for the offensive line,'' guard Matt O'Dwyer said. ``You get in a 
groove, and it's nice. We got stopped a few times, but we came back 
when we needed to and did some good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big things were done by Testaverde, Johnson and halfback  
Curtis Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde completed 24 of 36 passes, including all four on the  
opening drive. Martin carried 36 times for 124 yards, caught six 
passes for 58 yards and scored two touchdowns. Johnson tied a team 
playoff record by catching nine passes for 121 yards and a 
touchdown. He also scored on a 10-yard run, recovered a fumble and 
intercepted a pass in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spread it around and we're a smart team,'' said veteran  
tackle Jumbo Elliott, a members of Parcells' final Super Bowl team 
with the Giants in 1990. ``We recognize what defenses are trying to 
give us and what they are trying to take away and we can respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Jaguars, the Giants dominated the line of scrimmage  
against an injury-depleted line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jacksonville had some guys beat up on the defensive line,''  
rookie tackle Jason Fabini said. ``Tony Brackens was inactive and 
they've had five or six guys go on IR. Their d-line was kind of 
thin and it kind of helped what we wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the time of possession, the Jets had to sweat out  
the final minutes after Jacksonville pulled to 31-24 and got the 
ball back on Donovin Darius' interception with 2:24 to go. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Darius blundered trying to run the ball out of the end  
zone, and the Jaguars started their final drive on the 1. They only 
moved the ball 7 yards before giving it up on downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brunell is a dangerous quarterback,'' Mawae said. ``He brought  
them back in the game and we turned the ball over when we should 
not have, and we made it harder than it should have been. But they 
played good defense against us and their offense is incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets face an even more formidable offense next Sunday in  
Denver, where the Broncos will play host to the conference title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know by no means we can take the same type of game that we  
had in the latter part of today and still come out victorious 
against Denver,'' linebacker Pepper Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Wins Skating Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Michelle Kwan and Yevgeni Plushenko outshone the  
professionals Sunday as the U.S. champion won the women's title and 
the young Russian took the men's crown at the Honda Lev Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice dancing title went to the Russian professional pair of  
Maya Usova and Evgeny Platov. Elena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze of Russia won the pairs competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interpretive free program before a capacity crowd of  
10,000 at Yoyogi National Gymnasium, Kwan and Plushenko retained 
the leads they had after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, the 18-year-old world champion, started with a single axel  
that was reduced from a planned double axel. It was the only flaw 
for the Olympic silver medalist in a program that included spirals, 
spins and flying camels plus two clean triple jumps to the music 
from ``East of Eden.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya finished second  
and third, respectively. Japan's Yuka Sato, who turned pro after 
winning the 1994 world championship, placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first mistake was a little stupid,'' Kwan said. ``After  
the mistake, I told myself, `OK, Michelle, you've got to get into 
it ... just forget (it).' '' 
</P>
<P>
	For her free program, Kwan received a perfect 6.0 mark from one  
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In the free program of professional-amateur skating, greater  
emphasis is placed on the skaters' interpretation of the music and 
artistry than on technical difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Plushenko, winner at Skate Canada in November  
and the NHK Trophy in December, started with a clean triple axel 
and flying camel spins. His routine also included a circle step 
sequence, spirals and three more flawless jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``One-hundred percent,'' Plushenko said of his performance.  
</P>
<P>
	Russian Alexei Yagudin placed second and Todd Eldredge of the  
United States was third.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Words Central to Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When 100 senators sit in judgment of President  
Clinton this week, Monica Lewinsky's words will be the heart of the 
case against him -- and the soul of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the former White House intern is never called to the  
well of the Senate to testify in person, the version of events she 
told a grand jury will be crucial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House managers for the case will use Ms. Lewinsky's  
testimony to argue that Clinton lied under oath about details of 
their intimate contact and schemed to keep the affair out of court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers will counter with Ms. Lewinsky's spontaneous  
declaration to the grand jury: ``No one ever asked me to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the White House will argue that even if true  
the charges aren't grave enough to justify ejecting a president 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	To Americans who made up their minds long ago, it may seem  
nothing new can be said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate must listen afresh, beginning Thursday, to the  
evidence that persuaded a majority of House members to vote for 
impeachment. And if the senators agree to call witnesses, as 
Republicans on Sunday's television talk shows said they need to do, 
the case could take new twists. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can plan and plan, but trials have a life of their own,''  
said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers. 
``Information pops up that you don't anticipate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would take 67 votes to convict the president. If all 55  
Republicans want to oust him, the votes of 12 Democrats would be 
needed -- an unlikely prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence the senators will consider is divided into two  
articles of impeachment. One alleges Clinton lied in his Aug. 17 
testimony to a federal grand jury, the other that he tried to 
obstruct Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the perjury allegations stem from Clinton's attempts to  
justify for the grand jury earlier testimony in the Jones lawsuit, 
where he claimed he couldn't remember being alone with Ms. Lewinsky 
and denied having ``sexual relations'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will judge whether Clinton was being tricky or simply  
dishonest with answers such as ``It depends on how you define 
alone'' and ``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers also contend Clinton lied about details of the  
sexual encounters. His defenders argue that he admitted to 
``inappropriate intimate contact,'' and that should be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``His primary defense is, 'I was intentionally misleading, but I  
didn't intentionally lie under oath,''' former independent counsel 
Michael Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction of justice charge alleges a wide-ranging scheme  
to buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence, hide evidence and encourage friends 
and aides to echo the president's lies, often unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Among alleged acts of obstruction:  
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton suggested that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid  
testifying in the Jones case, and House managers contend he knew 
the document would falsely deny their relationship. White House 
lawyers argue she could have filed a carefully worded yet truthful 
deposition to avoid testifying in the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton is alleged to have arranged for his friend Vernon  
Jordan to help Ms. Lewinsky find a high-paying job in New York so 
she would keep their secret. Prosecutors contend her request for 
help languished until Dec. 11, 1997, when the judge in the Jones 
lawsuit cleared the way for questioning of Ms. Lewinsky and other 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	In his grand jury testimony, Clinton insisted, ``I was not  
trying to buy her silence. ... I wanted to help her get on with her 
life. It's just as simple as that.'' Ms. Lewinsky backs his 
account, testifying she was never offered the job in exchange for 
her silence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton called in Oval Office secretary Betty Currie and ran  
through a rapid litany of questions allegedly intended to direct 
her testimony (``I was never alone with Monica Lewinsky, right? ... 
Monica Lewinsky came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''). 
Clinton testified he only wanted his secretary's help to refresh 
his memory. White House officials argue the president couldn't 
obstruct justice anyway, because Mrs. Currie wasn't a witness at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	--House managers contend Clinton was behind his secretary's  
arrival at Ms. Lewinsky's home to retrieve gifts he had given her. 
Mrs. Currie has testified that she believed Ms. Lewinsky called her 
to come get the gifts. But prosecutors think she was acting under 
the president's orders, noting that cellular phone records show a 
call from the secretary to Ms. Lewinsky, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he didn't even know the gifts had been returned and  
wasn't worried about them being subpoenaed for the Jones case, 
anyway. He gave her more gifts around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton suggested cover stories to Ms. Lewinsky to disguise  
their relationship and denied impropriety to aides who he knew 
would be likely grand jury witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Clinton acted as a man trying to  
keep his illicit affair from his family and the public but never 
urged anyone to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution may not be able to prove each charge, but ``the  
more detail you layer, the more credible the story becomes, and the 
harder it is for the president's lawyers to construct a tale of 
innocence,'' Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Richard Ben-Veniste, an outside adviser to the White  
House, said the Clinton team will answer all the charges with two 
arguments: ``They haven't proved it, and even if they have, it 
doesn't amount to an impeachable offense.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Still Wavering on Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Everyone is waiting for Michael Jordan to make his  
retirement decision. In less than a month, it will be John Elway's 
turn. Again. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, spent several months pondering his future after the  
Denver Broncos won their first Super Bowl title last January. He 
returned, saying this would be his 16th and final season, but that 
is subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thoughts haven't changed a whole lot,'' Elway said Sunday.  
``But I'm not going to make any snap judgments. I am going to sit 
down, talk to my wife and kids, see how I feel physically and go 
from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway missed all or parts of six games because of injuries this  
season, but he has remained healthy enough to play the past seven 
games, including Saturday's 38-3 playoff victory over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He even proved he still has some mobility, scrambling 11 yards  
on a designed bootleg on third-and-2 early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really was a surprise,'' Elway said. ``I think I was  
probably as shocked as anyone when I heard it was going into the 
game plan. I can go about 10-15 yards, and after that (my legs) are 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway acknowledged that next Sunday's AFC Championship game  
against the New York Jets could be his final game at Mile High 
Stadium. Then again, if the Broncos win another Super Bowl, he 
could come back for one more encore. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was pointed out that he could retire a champion, Elway  
played devil's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, then they (advice givers) will use the other one and say  
that, `Well, nobody's ever won three in a row,''' he said. ``So 
there's a lot of positives on both sides.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotes End IHL Affiliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes have severed their partial  
affiliation with the International Hockey League's Las Vegas 
Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyotes assistant general manager Taylor Burke signed a  
termination agreement Saturday after a 2 1/2-year relationship with 
the Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the past few weeks, we've worked to determine a route that  
would work for both teams and what we decided was that it was in 
the best interest to terminate the affiliation for the year,'' 
Burke told The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two players under contract with Phoenix -- forwards J.F. Jomphe  
and Andrei Vasilyev -- were recently assigned to other teams after 
Las Vegas coach Bob Bourne and Thunder general manager Bob Strumm 
criticized them for supposed poor attitudes and work ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt in order to have an affiliation there, we needed our  
players part of a winning environment and part of a healthy 
environment,'' said Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas is in last place in IHL's Western Conference with a  
9-23-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said two other players under contract with Phoenix have  
been moved from Las Vegas to other IHL teams. Goalie Scott Langkow 
was loaned to Utah and left wing Louie DeBrusk was sent to Long 
Beach.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Unveil Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose  
dramatic increases in spending to preserve open spaces by expanding 
federal land purchases while giving millions of dollars to states 
for urban parks and land conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the White House, Interior Department and other  
agencies were putting together a package that envisions spending 
between $900 million and $1.5 billion a year in open-spaces 
initiatives, according to administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Some details of the environmental package, which will be part of  
President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget proposal, have yet to be 
worked out, the officials said. Internal debate continued on 
exactly how much money to request, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was to unveil the first installment -- a  
series of actions aimed at reducing urban sprawl and improving 
``quality of life'' -- in a speech Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal would provide at least $100 million a year,  
mostly in the form of grants to states, to reduce congestion, 
improve urban planning and stem uncontrolled development. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, according to officials, also includes $700 million  
in tax credits over five years to finance bond offerings whose 
proceeds would be use to create greenways, community parks, and 
preserve farmland and other open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials estimated the bonds financed by these  
tax credits could generate $9.5 billion for investment by state and 
local governments into open space initiatives over the five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials said Gore's anti-sprawl initiative is part of a  
much broader administration proposal aimed at pumping more money 
into programs that shelter farmland, forests and rangeland from 
development and aid in restoration or protection of coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Such efforts could benefit Gore in his bid for the presidency in  
2000. In signs of public support for such programs, last November's 
elections saw 200 state and local ballot measures aiming to 
preserve watersheds, parks, farmland and other open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal would rely on money from more than  
$6.5 billion collected annually from offshore oil drilling, 
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, as much as $3 billion a year had been proposed but  
drew opposition from the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, which considered it too extravagant, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on the condition of not being further  
identified, said the proposal now is likely to be closer to $1 
billion and probably no more than $1.5 billion, including $900 
million for buying land either directly or through states. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Congress provided about $320 million for public land  
purchases for conservation. Environmentalists have long argued that 
more money should be spent to set aside environmentally sensitive 
lands including rangeland, forests, seashores and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be the first time that we would be saying that  
we're going to make this kind of an investment in the future of 
this country and its open spaces,'' said Rindy O'Brien of the 
Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a need for ``a very major increase in federal funding  
for land acquisition,'' said Carl Pope, executive director of the 
Sierra Club. ``There's a tremendous backlog in land purchases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's initiative comes as both Republicans and  
Democrats in Congress are signaling readiness to expand programs to 
shelter land from development. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final weeks of the last Congress, legislation was  
introduced in both the Senate and the House that would spend as 
much as $5 billion on such programs. Environmentalists opposed the 
bills, arguing they focused too much on returning money to states 
with offshore drilling.

<HEADLINE> Broncos, Vikes Have Home Field Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons, the enemy in next  
week's championship games will not only be Denver and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be noise.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the noise at Mile High Stadium and in the Minnesota  
Metrodome might be harder to overcome than the Broncos and the 
Vikings. The crowd certainly jump-started Minnesota on Sunday 
against Arizona, which had the ball for just 54 seconds in the 
first quarter of its 41-21 loss to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the factors going into the conference championship  
games are the same as when the playoffs started, when the Broncos 
and Vikings looked odds-on to reach the Super Bowl, with the Jets 
as the dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
	After this weekend, when the Broncos returned to their form of  
the first half of the regular season, the odds favoring the home 
teams might be even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was as focused as we have been, and we played our best  
game all year,'' John Elway said after Saturday's 38-3 demolition 
of Miami, a team that beat the Broncos just 19 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at the two games.  

</P>
<P>
                 *New York Jets (13-4) at Denver (15-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, 1-15 just two years ago, are riding what's becoming  
known around the NFL as the ``Bill Parcells mystique.'' And if they 
beat the Broncos next week, Parcells will become the first coach to 
take three different teams to Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be easy unless they take the Mile High crowd out of it.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jets have won seven straight and finished the regular season  
on the kind of roll Parcells had with his best team -- the 1986 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	But this team is more like Parcells' 1990 Giants -- heady,  
gritty, and experienced. They even have three members of that team 
-- offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, linebacker Pepper Johnson and 
kick returner/third-down back Dave Meggett. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of teams with a lot more talent than us,''  
says Vinny Testaverde, the quarterback whose career was resurrected 
by Parcells. ``But it's hard to measure the heart and these guys 
have tremendous heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also have the surprise element.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't played them for awhile,'' Elway said Sunday. ``We  
don't know what they're all about. We'll have to start from 
scratch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Jets probably don't have the defense to stop all the  
elements of Denver's offense -- Terrell Davis, Elway, tight end 
Shannon Sharpe and wide receivers Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, defensive coordinator Bill Belichick will devise some odd  
schemes, but Elway is too experienced to get thrown off balance. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, the Jets' offense can probably move the ball against a  
Denver defense that's experienced but movable. Curtis Martin and 
New York's offensive line are far more dangerous that the banged-up 
group Miami put on the field Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Denver defense doesn't force mistakes, the crowd  
will. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson said of  
Denver. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say this about Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	He usually speaks the truth.  

</P>
<P>
                  *Atlanta (15-2) at Minnesota (16-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first conference title game in a dome, and the  
winner will be the first Dome team to reach a Super Bowl. The 
problem for the Falcons, of course, will be that they'll be facing 
what their opponents usually face at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	What the Falcons have going for them is experience.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chandler, the 33-year-old quarterback, is unlikely to be  
as rattled as Arizona's Jake Plummer was in the first 20 minutes in 
the Metrodome. Eugene Robinson, the free safety, played in the last 
two Super Bowls for Green Bay, and coach Dan Reeves has been to 
eight Super Bowls as player, assistant coach and head coach, 
including three with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dreamed about it a lot, but we were not sure it was a  
reachable goal,'' Chandler said of his Super Bowl dreams. ``It's 
been a season of modifying goals all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To modify their goals again, the Falcons will need to control  
the ball against the Vikings, something they're capable of doing 
with Jamal Anderson. They're also capable of scoring against the 
Minnesota defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Metrodome crowd is adept at drawing false start and  
delay penalties, and Chandler's teammates will be hard-pressed to 
hear his calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger problem will be defensing Randall Cunningham and the  
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stop Randy Moss, and Cris Carter makes plays.  
</P>
<P>
	Stop both and it's Robert Smith.  
</P>
<P>
	Stop all of them and a role player like Leroy Hoard or David  
Palmer can get you behind an offensive line with three Pro Bowlers 
-- left tackle Todd Steussie, left guard Randall McDaniel and center 
Jeff Christy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings aren't a perfect team.  
</P>
<P>
	But they're almost a perfect offense.

<HEADLINE> Offenders Serve More Time in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prisoners are spending more time behind bars  
as states enact laws to narrow the gap between sentences handed 
down and the time offenders actually serve, the government said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent offenders released in 1997 -- people convicted of murder,  
rape, robbery or aggravated assault -- spent an average of 49 months 
in prison, up from 43 months in 1993, a study by the Justice 
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, violent offenders freed in 1997 had served 54  
percent of their sentences. In 1993, they had served 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all types of offenders, the average time served by released  
prisoners increased from 22 months in prison and 6 months in jail 
in 1990 to 25 months in prison and 5 months in jail in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The report points to changes in state legislation, such as  
truth-in-sentencing laws, that restrict the early release of 
prisoners. Such laws require offenders to serve a substantial 
portion of minimum sentences, generally between 50 percent and 100 
percent, before being eligible for release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend has been more restrictive to require offenders to  
serve more time,'' Doris James Wilson, the report's co-author, said 
in an interview. This shift is driven in part ``by an overall view 
that criminals were not serving enough time, that there was too 
much of a gap between sentences set by a judge and the amount of 
time actually served.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia now require  
violent offenders to serve at least 85 percent of prison sentences. 
Federal legislation passed in 1994 authorized the government to 
reward with grants states that set the 85 percent minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 13 states require violent offenders to serve substantial  
portions of minimum sentences before being eligible for release. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states also have reduced the discretion of parole boards in  
authorizing prisoner releases. Fourteen states have abolished 
parole board releases for all offenders, with at least six others 
abolishing parole board releases for certain violent or felony 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at some of the research, we saw a progression moving  
from the indeterminate model, where there is a lot of discretion by 
parole boards, to more restrictive models,'' Wilson said 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory minimum sentences, which require offenders to be  
sentenced for a specified prison term, and state sentencing 
guidelines for given offenses also have contributed to offenders 
spending more time in prison, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings of the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--More released prisoners are serving full sentences. About 18  
percent of those released in 1997 served full sentences, compared 
with 13 percent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 70 percent of prison admissions for violent offenses in  
1997 were in states requiring offenders to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentences. More than 90 percent were in states 
requiring that at least 50 percent of the sentence be served. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of releases relative to the number of inmates in  
prison dropped from 37 per 100 state prisoners in 1990 to 31 per 
100 prisoners in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27 states requiring prisoners to serve at least 85 percent  
of their sentences are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Cards Take No Solace in Good Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- So much for the Cardiac Cardinals, at least  
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	After their 41-21 demolition at the hands of the Minnesota  
Vikings in an NFC playoff game Sunday at the Metrodome, a more 
appropriate moniker would be Crushed Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Steamrolled on the field and subdued in the locker room.  
</P>
<P>
	They took no solace in their successful season and weren't about  
to fall into the just-happy-to-be-here mode. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ask me if it feels good to be here, it doesn't,''  
linebacker Jamir Miller said. ``It never feels good to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe two or three weeks down the road, when I reflect, maybe  
I'll feel a little better about it,'' he added. ``But you know, I 
just got trounced, so I can't feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer, who was done in by noise  
and nerves, had three turnovers. He said the 20-point pummeling 
made it hard to relish the strides the Cards made in 1998, their 
first winning season since moving to Phoenix a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight's going to hurt,'' Plummer said. ``We should be mad  
for a while. We had a great opportunity. We didn't take advantage 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But a month from now, when I'm out teeing off, I can look back  
and say, `Wow. We did have a pretty good year. We put together a 
good season.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, who set an NFL record by going 7-1 in games  
decided by a field goal or less this season, never gave themselves 
a chance at another miracle finish, surrendering points on seven of 
the Vikings' first nine possessions and failing to force a punt 
until the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said the sting of defeat can't  
erase the strides the franchise made this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The spunky Cardinals (10-8) had to win their final three games  
of the regular season to make the playoffs, and they won all three 
on last-second field goals by Chris Jacke. 
</P>
<P>
	They followed that with a shocking victory at Dallas last  
weekend, their first postseason win in 51 years, which served as a 
warning flare that the Cardinals are a team of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last week, the last time the Cardinals won a playoff game  
was 1947 in a one-game postseason. The Chicago Cardinals beat 
Philadelphia for the NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his shaky start Sunday, Plummer pulled the Cards to  
24-14 by directing an 80-yard drive to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jake is a young quarterback who's got tremendous resiliency.  
He's a playmaker and he's going to fight you for 60 minutes. He's 
going to fight you for as many games as you play,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'll say this about our football team in general, which  
Jake is a part of: I think we've come an awful long way this year 
as far as what kind of team we've got, the way we perceive 
ourselves. We came up short today but I think that we laid the 
foundation this year for some good football teams in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said there's still lots of room for improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, you play in this league to win the Super Bowl and any  
time you fall short of that, I don't think that you can be 
satisfied,'' Tobin said. ``But you have to go in increments 
sometimes and I think we made giant strides this year as far as 
organization, as far as football team, the maturity of our football 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Bates, who had a trio of 1-yard touchdown runs, said the  
Vikings were simply too good for an upstart team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like a machine,'' he said. ``Our wrench just wasn't  
big enough to stop them.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Words Central to Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When 100 senators sit in judgment of President  
Clinton this week, Monica Lewinsky's words will be the heart of the 
case against him -- and the soul of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the former White House intern is never called to the  
well of the Senate to testify in person, the version of events she 
told a grand jury will be crucial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House managers for the case will use Ms. Lewinsky's  
testimony to argue that Clinton lied under oath about details of 
their intimate contact and schemed to keep the affair out of court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers will counter with Ms. Lewinsky's spontaneous  
declaration to the grand jury: ``No one ever asked me to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the White House will argue that even if true  
the charges aren't grave enough to justify ejecting a president 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	To Americans who made up their minds long ago, it may seem  
nothing new can be said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate must listen afresh, beginning Thursday, to the  
evidence that persuaded a majority of House members to vote for 
impeachment. And if the senators agree to call witnesses, as 
Republicans on Sunday's television talk shows said they need to do, 
the case could take new twists. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can plan and plan, but trials have a life of their own,''  
said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers. 
``Information pops up that you don't anticipate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would take 67 votes to convict the president. If all 55  
Republicans want to oust him, the votes of 12 Democrats would be 
needed -- an unlikely prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence the senators will consider is divided into two  
articles of impeachment. One alleges Clinton lied in his Aug. 17 
testimony to a federal grand jury, the other that he tried to 
obstruct Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the perjury allegations stem from Clinton's attempts to  
justify for the grand jury earlier testimony in the Jones lawsuit, 
where he claimed he couldn't remember being alone with Ms. Lewinsky 
and denied having ``sexual relations'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will judge whether Clinton was being tricky or simply  
dishonest with answers such as ``It depends on how you define 
alone'' and ``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers also contend Clinton lied about details of the  
sexual encounters. His defenders argue that he admitted to 
``inappropriate intimate contact,'' and that should be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``His primary defense is, 'I was intentionally misleading, but I  
didn't intentionally lie under oath,''' former independent counsel 
Michael Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction of justice charge alleges a wide-ranging scheme  
to buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence, hide evidence and encourage friends 
and aides to echo the president's lies, often unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Among alleged acts of obstruction:  
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton suggested that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid  
testifying in the Jones case, and House managers contend he knew 
the document would falsely deny their relationship. White House 
lawyers argue she could have filed a carefully worded yet truthful 
deposition to avoid testifying in the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton is alleged to have arranged for his friend Vernon  
Jordan to help Ms. Lewinsky find a high-paying job in New York so 
she would keep their secret. Prosecutors contend her request for 
help languished until Dec. 11, 1997, when the judge in the Jones 
lawsuit cleared the way for questioning of Ms. Lewinsky and other 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	In his grand jury testimony, Clinton insisted, ``I was not  
trying to buy her silence. ... I wanted to help her get on with her 
life. It's just as simple as that.'' Ms. Lewinsky backs his 
account, testifying she was never offered the job in exchange for 
her silence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton called in Oval Office secretary Betty Currie and ran  
through a rapid litany of questions allegedly intended to direct 
her testimony (``I was never alone with Monica Lewinsky, right? ... 
Monica Lewinsky came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''). 
Clinton testified he only wanted his secretary's help to refresh 
his memory. White House officials argue the president couldn't 
obstruct justice anyway, because Mrs. Currie wasn't a witness at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	--House managers contend Clinton was behind his secretary's  
arrival at Ms. Lewinsky's home to retrieve gifts he had given her. 
Mrs. Currie has testified that she believed Ms. Lewinsky called her 
to come get the gifts. But prosecutors think she was acting under 
the president's orders, noting that cellular phone records show a 
call from the secretary to Ms. Lewinsky, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he didn't even know the gifts had been returned and  
wasn't worried about them being subpoenaed for the Jones case, 
anyway. He gave her more gifts around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton suggested cover stories to Ms. Lewinsky to disguise  
their relationship and denied impropriety to aides who he knew 
would be likely grand jury witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers argue that Clinton acted as a man trying to  
keep his illicit affair from his family and the public but never 
urged anyone to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution may not be able to prove each charge, but ``the  
more detail you layer, the more credible the story becomes, and the 
harder it is for the president's lawyers to construct a tale of 
innocence,'' Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Richard Ben-Veniste, an outside adviser to the White  
House, said the Clinton team will answer all the charges with two 
arguments: ``They haven't proved it, and even if they have, it 
doesn't amount to an impeachable offense.''

<HEADLINE> Supplement Sought for Soc.Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's advisers are considering  
how to use government surpluses to help Americans build new 
retirement savings accounts to supplement Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and congressional aides said Clinton advisers  
mentioned their interest in the idea of supplemental accounts at a 
meeting with House Democrats last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did indicate they were intrigued by the proposal,'' said  
Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif. He attended the meeting with top 
administration officials including White House chief of staff John 
Podesta and Lawrence Summers, the deputy Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's State of the Union address scheduled for Jan. 19  
nears, the president is looking for ways to push forward reforms of 
the nation's retirement system without new political fights. 
Clinton has not yet indicated favor for a particular option. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts wouldn't directly address the cash  
shortfall expected to face Social Security as the nation's huge 
baby boom generation retires. But they could help Americans be 
better prepared for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, they have bipartisan backing.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, important Republican committee chairmen -- Delaware  
Sen. William Roth, of the Senate Finance Committee, and Ohio Rep. 
John Kasich, of the House Budget Committee -- introduced plans to 
hand back surpluses to American workers in new retirement accounts 
they could invest for themselves on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri also has  
said he could support individual investment accounts as long as 
they were in addition to Social Security, not a replacement for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Such accounts might be similar to 401(k) investment plans that  
many companies offer their employees. Government surpluses could be 
used to provide startup money, then again perhaps over the years to 
match some portions of workers' own contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many details would have to be worked out. Among the biggest: Who  
would be eligible for the government-subsidized accounts, everyone 
or just low-income Americans? 
</P>
<P>
	The idea also could meet with resistance because it would spend  
surpluses without actually doing anything to address how Social 
Security will pay benefits promised aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to have a new entitlement or a new social  
service program, I'd like to really focus on that separate and 
apart,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``But right now it's how 
the hell are you going to pay for the Social Security system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is under increasing pressure from Republicans to present  
a blueprint for Social Security reforms -- and particularly how 
government surpluses would fit in. That's because his insistence 
the money be saved for Social Security is thwarting GOP desires to 
use it for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers say the president worries, however, that by being too  
specific in the State of the Union address he might end up only 
encouraging lawmakers to take sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, the president's top economic adviser, said  
Saturday the problem in moving forward is basically political. 
``The only way to get a full Social Security reform accomplished,'' 
Sperling said, ``is if we can pull together some form of bipartisan 
spirit that would allow some of the tougher choices to be made 
together that may be too difficult for either party to make 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats said they have encouraged Clinton to hang back  
and continue to pursue bipartisan talks. 
</P>
<P>
	At White House talks last month with Democrats and Republicans,  
Clinton joined an emerging consensus by tentatively endorsing the 
use of stock market investments to increase Social Security's money 
supply. The program's cash reserves are invested in safe but 
low-yielding Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	How any such stock market investments would be made is more  
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans would like to see a portion of the taxes now  
deducted from workers' paychecks for Social Security diverted 
instead to investment accounts that individual Americans would 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats don't want any of Social Security's guaranteed  
benefits replaced with a system that increases financial risks 
borne by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts could prove a possible compromise on that  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials still would have to figure out how to ensure  
Social Security could pay out its promised benefits, alongside the 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Other proposals to shore up the program -- raising the retirement  
age, taxing the wealthy more or having the government invest Social 
Security money in the stock market in bulk -- have proven equally 
divisive.

<HEADLINE> Report: Olympic Sponsor Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American oil company Texaco-Caltex  
reportedly has withdrawn from a $6.3 million Olympic sponsorship 
deal, leaving games organizers with a possible revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald said Monday that the company has  
written to the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games 
(SOCOG), withdrawing from the arrangement that set up the 
sponsorship deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have been a boost to SOCOG's 1999 sponsorship  
drive, which must raise $126 million by the end of the year to 
achieve its budget target. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco-Caltex pulled out after 12 months of negotiations, saying  
it already had signed as a major sponsor of the U.S. Olympic team 
and a major partner for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, the 
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Unveil Open Spaces Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a $1  
billion-a-year program to help develop ``smart growth strategies'' 
for communities plagued by dirty air, traffic congestion and 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore planned to unveil the package of tax  
incentives and federal grants in a speech today, saying economic 
growth depends on creating more ``livable communities'' and 
preserving open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, part of President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget to  
be sent to Congress next month, are aimed at addressing a growing 
concern among many Americans -- and one that may have political 
payoff -- that unbridles growth is contributing to a decline in 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a theme that Gore has addressed in past speeches and  
likely will make an important part of his 2000 presidential bid. He 
is convinced, according to advisers, that the public demands more 
effective measures to manage sprawl and promote ``smart growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last November's elections, there were more than 200 local  
ballot measures, most of them approved, that involved concerns 
about lack of open space, congestion, the disappearance of farmland 
and unchecked development, Gore's advisers are fond of noting. 
</P>
<P>
	To address these problems, the administration proposes more than  
$1 billion in additional spending and tax breaks next year to 
provide communities ``new tools and resources to preserve green 
space, ease traffic congestion and pursue regional smart growth 
strategies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The package being unveiled today includes $700 million in tax  
credits to help spur community investment in urban parks, greenways 
and restoration of contaminated industrial sites, according to 
officials and to draft documents obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The credits would be used to finance what Gore calls a ``Better  
America Bond'' -- a new financing tool that administration officials 
say would generate $9.5 billion over five years for open-space 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sharp increases in funding for mass transit, including an  
additional $600 million to help communities develop regional 
transportation strategies to reduce congestion and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	--About $100 million in grants to help communities manage growth  
on a regional basis with an eye toward reducing congestion and 
sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	--About $50 million to help communities share crime statistics  
and law enforcement information. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals involve as many as a dozen federal agencies,  
although in most cases money would be funneled through states to 
local communities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's announcement was part of a broader package of spending  
proposals aimed at preserving open space and curtailing unbridled 
development that will be unveiled in coming days, according to 
administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the White House, Interior Department and other  
agencies were putting together a package that envisions spending 
between $900 million and $1.5 billion a year in open-spaces 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that money is included in the initiative being announced  
today. But it also would include other federal land purchases to 
preserve environmentally sensitive areas and funnel millions of 
dollars to states for land acquisitions or purchase of conservation 
easements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs would be financed by revenue from offshore oil  
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $3 billion a year had been proposed originally, but  
that drew opposition from the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, which considered it too extravagant, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the proposal now is likely to be closer to $1 billion  
and probably no more than $1.5 billion, including $900 million for 
buying land either directly or through states. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Congress provided about $320 million for public land  
purchases for conservation.

<HEADLINE> Art Shell Interviews With Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Art Shell gained his NFL experience banging  
heads with guys like Lyle Alzado and Al Davis. And that was 
certainly enough to get him a head coaching interview with Browns 
president Carmen Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, the current offensive line coach for the Falcons, flew  
into Cleveland on Saturday night after Atlanta's home playoff win 
over San Francisco and met with Policy at the Browns headquarters 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've looked forward to coming here,'' he said. ``When I got  
the call from Carmen I was very elated about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Shell is the third candidate to interview with  
the expansion Browns, who are the only NFL team allowed to talk 
with assistant coaches of teams still in the playoffs. Minnesota 
offensive coordinator Brian Billick and Denver offensive 
coordinator Gary Kubiak have already met with Policy and Dwight 
Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was a Hall of Fame offensive tackle with the Raiders  
before being hired as their head coach in 1989. The first black 
head coach in modern NFL history, Shell posted a 54-39 record, 
making the playoffs twice, including taking his 1990 team to the 
1990 AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Policy, who was in San Francisco at the time, Shell's  
biggest head coaching accomplishment may have been how well he 
worked under the controversial Davis and amid the upheaval that 
always seems to surround the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been the boss, and when you are a head coach for the  
Raiders it's kind of like you're engaged in special forces-type 
activity,'' said Policy. ``We're not talking about a mere 
infantryman here, we're talking about somebody's who goes behind 
enemy lines all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He distinguished himself and he always kept his composure. He  
was always able to maintain the image of and the stature of the 
head coach no matter what was happening around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the way Policy figures it, if Shell could handle the  
Raiders, he's be perfect for the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be tough times ahead for the Cleveland  
Browns,'' he said. ``And we've got to make sure that we have a 
professional who's going to be able to handle those times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was fired by Davis after the 1994 season despite a 9-7  
record. He spent two seasons as Marty Schottenheimer's line coach 
in Kansas City before joining Dan Reeves in Atlanta before last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He's flourished in his role an assistant, molding a young  
offensive in Atlanta into one of the best units in the NFL. With 
Jamal Anderson running behind Shell's line, the Falcons are headed 
to their first conference championship game in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell has now experienced pro football at every level, and he  
knows head coach is the title he wants most. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted to be one again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shell is one of only four black head coaches in NFL history, and  
of the last 18 head coaching changes, none has been filled by a 
black. However, Shell wasn't critical of the league and thinks 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue is doing all he can to even the playing 
field for all coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you want to is to have an opportunity to sit down and talk  
with people like Carmen,'' said Shell, whose interview with Policy 
was only his second for a head coaching position. ``Talk to them 
about yourself, build yourself because we all have something to 
offer. We all have something to give. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to find a way to make the process better for  
everyone involved, not just minorities, everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his visit with Policy, Shell got to retell one of the  
Raiders' greatest victories, which happens to be one of the Browns' 
most painful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was cold,'' Shell said describing Oakland's 1981 playoff  
win over Cleveland. ``The field was frozen, you didn't know what 
shoes to wear. I remember playing against Lyle Alzado that day and 
we were in the locker room sharpening our cleats so they could dig 
into the doggone turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders won the game, 14-12, when Raiders safety Mike Davis  
intercepted Browns quarterback Brian Sipe in the end zone in the 
closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy with the worst hands on the team intercepted the  
ball,'' Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell and the Raiders standing on the sideline were expecting  
the Browns to kick the winning field goal when Sipe made the 
fateful pass that has haunted Browns fans for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden he drops back and he's throwing the ball,''  
Shell said widening his eyes as if still in disbelief. ``And then 
you see Mike Davis. Oh, my God, we won the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy cut Shell off right there.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to see that in Cleveland anymore,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Rice Reflects on 49ers' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sitting on a stool in a quiet 49ers' locker room,  
Jerry Rice was more interested in looking ahead than dwelling on 
his roller-coaster season and the team's final defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not done,'' Rice said.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's career leader in touchdowns, receptions and yards  
receiving, the 36-year-old Rice made a strong comeback from two 
major injuries to his left knee that sidelined him most of last 
season. But he struggled through the final seven weeks with a 
partially torn ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a very difficult season,'' said Rice, whose  
standing as the team's top receiver was challenged with the 
development of Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But just watching the young guys grow, the fire is still  
burning. I'll be back next year in better shape and I will be 
healthy and ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens had a team-high eight receptions for 73 yards, but it was  
Rice who flashed his Pro Bowl form on a 17-yard touchdown catch 
that got San Francisco back into the game after Atlanta led 14-0 
Saturday. The Falcons held on to win the divisional playoff game 
20-18, ending the 49ers' season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to play man-to-man and I did not have a game plan,''  
Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan said. ``He caught a good pass, but 
I'm not going to be mad because he may have won that battle but we 
won the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Rice still has it. I told him after the game that I  
don't want anyone telling him that he doesn't have it because he 
and Steve Young can still click.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers' passing game couldn't click enough to overcome  
the loss of running back Garrison Hearst, who went down on the 
first play with a broken bone in his lower left leg. Knowing the 
49ers had to throw, the Falcons put up a strong defense against the 
pass, intercepting Young three times to fend off San Francisco's 
comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a hard pill to swallow,'' Rice said of Hearst's loss.  
``We didn't feel like we had to do anything desperate but we knew 
the receivers had to pick up the slack. There's a couple plays we 
wish we had back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the 49ers accomplished a great deal this season even  
though they didn't realize their goal of going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crazy season, up and down,'' said Rice, recalling the  
high from last week's last-second wild card win over Green Bay on 
Owens' dramatic touchdown catch and the season-long front-office 
tumult marked by the exodus of Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark to 
the expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite his success, coach Steve Mariucci had to weather  
rumors about his job security. That speculation died after the 
49ers' beat the Packers, and Mariucci now is on the verge of 
signing a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, this team kept it together with everything that was  
going on around it,'' Rice said. ``We have a lot to hold our heads 
up about and just get ready for next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco safety Tim McDonald said there's nothing to do now  
for the 49ers but move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big swing in emotions for us between last week and  
this,'' he said. ``It has been a trying season. Of course, we'd 
like to end it a little better than we did.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Impeachment Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate moves ahead this week with  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, some Republicans are 
demanding to hear from witnesses while Democrats warn that 
testimony could spin the proceedings out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had until noon EST today to respond to Senate  
summons and declare it will present a defense for two articles of 
impeachment against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House prosecutors and White House lawyers had until the  
end of the day to present motions. The White House likely was to 
seek a motion to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote on that would not come until after the prosecutors and  
the White House present their cases to the jury of 100 senators and 
take questions from the senators. That phase begins Thursday with 
House arguments and could last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to call witnesses also will follow the initial  
presentations. Republicans and Democrats are divided on the need or 
wisdom of that step. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' He said this was ``probably the most 
important trial of this century, and it calls for that type of 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned that ``you could get into a  
quagmire, which would be very lurid, which would not be a dignified 
ending to this sad chapter and would not add enough evidentiary 
value to outweigh the negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, say they must have  
witnesses to properly present their case alleging that Clinton 
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in trying to cover up 
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said on CBS' ``Face the Nation''  
that they could limit the witnesses to about six. Among then, he 
named Ms. Lewinsky; the president's secretary, Betty Currie; and 
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to get into graphic details. We want to talk  
about the obstruction of justice,'' Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the hope there is that  
after the initial phase of the trial, senators will realize the 
case does not warrant removing the president from office and vote 
to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said Clinton plans to deliver his State of the Union  
address to Congress as scheduled Jan. 19, even though the trial 
will be under way. ``We have no intention of being diverted from 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on CNN's ``Late Edition''  
that if Republicans, in a partisan vote, force the acceptance of 
witnesses the bipartisan spirit that brought senators together on a 
format for the trial ``could degenerate very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the facts,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said  
on CBS. ``I think we are ready now to present the evidence and make 
a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats say they prefer that Clinton stay in office but  
that Congress approve a strong resolution censuring him for his 
actions in the Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told NBC she is working on a  
censure motion, saying that if Clinton is not removed from office, 
``there should be something before the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to  
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which requires a 
two-thirds majority. A motion to dismiss would need 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	From Thursday, the House will have 24 hours, probably over three  
days, to present its case as to why Clinton should be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said Rep. James Sensenbrenner,  
R-Wis., would make opening statements after initial remarks by 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. McCollum said ``I 
seriously doubt'' the House will need the full 24 hours to make its 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner, Hutchinson, McCollum and Reps. James Rogan of  
California and Ed Bryant of Tennessee would present the evidence 
and Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., and others would explain how the 
charges met the standards for impeachable offenses, congressional 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will then have 24 hours for its arguments and up  
to 16 hours will be devoted to questions from senators. After that, 
the Senate would take up the motion to dismiss, and, if that fails, 
vote on motions to present witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Neuheisel Named Coach at Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Newly hired football coach Rick Neuheisel  
insisted Sunday that he did not take the Washington job because of 
the money -- up to $1.5 million a year for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking money. I'm not about money. This was not a  
monetary decision for me,'' Neuheisel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a decision based on a platform here at the University  
of Washington which I think can be, certainly, the beacon 
university in the West, and hopefully we can become the beacon 
university for the whole United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, 37, arrived in Seattle on Sunday after being lured  
away from the head coach job at Colorado by Washington athletic 
director Barbara Hedges. He had been earning $650,000 there on a 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies wanted Neuheisel so badly that they reportedly  
agreed to pay off the remainder of a mortgage on his $850,000 house 
in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	He met with reporters Sunday night in an impromptu news  
conference on the basketball court at Hec Edmundson Pavilion. Then 
he met with Husky players and assistant coaches in a meeting that 
started upbeat and got more exciting from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He started barking and getting us going,'' wide receiver Dane  
Looker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he would bring back the gold helmets from the  
glory years of winning coach Don James -- a move the players liked. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel refused to bite when asked what kind of values college  
students would learn when a football coach earns more than anyone 
else at the university, or even the governor of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pretend to make any judgment on what value is,''  
Neuheisel said. ``I think that's determined by the market. I just 
am interested in achieving the goal that anybody who gets in my 
profession wants to achieve, which is to be the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel was scheduled to be formally introduced at a news  
conference at 10 a.m. PST Monday at the school's Don James Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedges' offer and Neuheisel's agreement surprised Husky fans  
Saturday night. It appeared that the choice had been narrowed to 
Idaho's Chris Tormey and Toledo's Gary Pinkel, two proteges of 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of those them, who both interviewed for the post,  
the job went to an old Washington nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel beat the Huskies as a coach and a player on the field,  
and he also beat them to some of the top high school talent in 
their own state. 
</P>
<P>
	And Neuheisel got quite an offer from the Huskies. Only  
Florida's Steve Spurrier, at $2 million, will be earning more than 
Neuheisel as a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is an extremely bright, innovative, creative and talented  
coach and we are fortunate to welcome him to our program. Rick is 
excited about the opportunity to coach at Washington in the Pac-10 
and to compete at the national level,'' Hedges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel will be a welcome sight at Husky Stadium, where  
Washington fans watched their team lose home games to Arizona and 
UCLA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-year record at Colorado was 33-14, including 8-4 this  
season, when the Buffaloes beat Oregon 51-43 in the Aloha Bowl in 
Honolulu on Christmas. Washington lost to Air Force 45-25 in the 
Oahu Bowl in Honolulu the same day, sealing the fate of coach Jim 
Lambright. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington went to three straight Rose Bowls to open the 1990s  
and won a national championship under Don James in 1991. But the 
Huskies' recruiting has fallen off and they slipped to 6-6 this 
season, their first nonwinning year since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel must upgrade Washington's roster quickly. The Huskies  
had only two first-team all-Pac-10 players this season in nose 
tackle Jabari Issa and special teams player Joe Jarzynka, both 
juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock Huard, Washington's career passing leader, is forgoing his  
senior year to enter the NFL draft. The quarterback next season is 
expected to be backup Marques Tuiasosopo. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel and Washington open the season Sept. 11 at Brigham  
Young.

<HEADLINE> Four Records Set at Dartmouth Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Adam Nelson, a 1997 Dartmouth graduate,  
made a successful return to the Dartmouth Relays by setting a meet 
record in the shot put Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, ranked ninth in the world, heaved the shot 65-01 1/4,  
outdistancing his closest competitor by nearly 11 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other meet records fell during the day, two on the track  
and one in the field events. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruny Surin, representing Athletics Canada, set a meet record in  
the 55-meter dash. Surin, a member of Canada's gold medal team, ran 
6.14 and broke his own record which was set in 1996, by one 
one-hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	Surin was also a member of the Athletics Canada relay team that  
set a meet record in the 4x200 race. The foursome ran 1:28.85 to 
top the University of Sherbrooke's 1996 mark of 1:30.45 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Norgren, representing the Boston Athletic Association,  
shattered the meet record in the weight throw with a toss of 
63-00 1/4. The old mark of 59-09 was set in 1996 by Syracuse's Nicole 
Jackson.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Interview Bribe Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC intends next week to begin  
questioning those members suspected of selling votes in Salt Lake 
City's successful Olympic bid, a Swiss newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have identified all those members from whom we want an  
explanation now,'' Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who is 
leading his organization's inquiry, told the Zurich weekly 
SonntagsZeitung. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of next week we will send them letters in  
which they will be invited to answer a few questions for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, and  
vice president David Johnson resigned Friday after disclosures of 
cash payments to IOC members and other misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound has said the IOC has most, though not all, of the evidence  
it needs, and he is confident the panel can complete its work by 
the Jan. 23-24 target date. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in Salt Lake City have been very supportive,'' he  
told SonntagsZeitung. ``We have got a lot of documents and 
important information from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound declined to identify the IOC members concerned or to say  
how many letters will be sent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that yet because first we want to give all the  
suspects the chance to explain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If no satisfactory reply to the letters is forthcoming, ``then  
we will assume that they have no explanation,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he would recommend that any IOC members found guilty  
of corruption be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to throw the bad apples out of the barrel as quickly as  
possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such corruption wasn't responsible for Salt Lake City being  
awarded the 2002 Winter Games, Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's election ``was so clear that the few members who are  
implicated in this scandal certainly didn't make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation is one of four inquiries into the Salt  
Lake scandal. Also investigating are the U.S. Justice Department, 
the U.S. Olympic Committee and Salt Lake's own ethics board.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaragua's president said Sunday that  
his nation will be eternally grateful to foreign countries and 
international organizations that provided quick disaster relief 
after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	In his annual presidential address, President Arnoldo Aleman  
also called on his people to come together to recover in the 
aftermath of the storm, which struck Central America in late 
October and early November. 
</P>
<P>
	Aleman said 2,400 Nicaraguans were killed, more than 900 were  
missing, more than 250 were injured, and an additional 870,000 
people were affected, many of them losing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Across Central America, more than 9,000 people were killed.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Nicaragua in ``an apocalyptic shadow,'' Aleman  
said. He said Nicaragua needs about $1.4 billion to rebuild the 
country. The country's foreign debt is estimated at $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have faith, conviction and optimism that given the task of  
transforming the country we will be united and without (political) 
partisanship,'' he said.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- After recuperating from surgery, the  
governor of Brazil's most developed state took up his post Sunday 
and offered strong support for the country's austerity plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Covas, 68, a key ally to President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso, was inaugurated as Sao Paulo state governor more than a 
week late because of an operation to remove a cancerous growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at his inauguration ceremony, Covas vowed to support  
the federal government's measures to trim $23 billion off its $65 
billion budget deficit in 1999. International lenders have approved 
a $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, provided it meets its 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	Covas was re-elected for a second term Oct. 25, and was  
hospitalized weeks later so doctors could remove a malignant growth 
in his bladder and a non-cancerous tumor in his prostrate gland. He 
left hospital on December 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo is Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse,  
accounting for more than one-third of its economic output. With 34 
million inhabitants, it is also the most populous state.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In a move expected to allay concerns  
that Venezuela's new leftist government will reverse free-market 
policies, President-elect Hugo Chavez announced Sunday he will keep 
the current finance minister in his new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritza Izaguirre, a career government finance and planning  
official, has helped steer the country through economic troubles 
provoked by a 12-year low in oil prices. Oil accounts for 
three-quarters of Venezuela's exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a populist and the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt,  
has softened some of his views recently to try to ease worries that 
he will run the country with an iron fist. Chavez won the Dec. 6 
presidential race in a landslide, capitalizing on anger over 
widespread poverty and corruption. He takes office Feb. 2.

	Clinton Advisers Hope To Inform Public  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential advisers believe they can use to  
their advantage poll results indicating well over half of Americans 
are misinformed about the nature of the perjury charge against 
President Clinton. The impeachment case involves Clinton's 
statement solely about specific details of his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky, such as when it began and where he touched her. 
The officials said the White House plans to better inform the 
public that Clinton is not on trial for denying a sexual 
relationship. His Senate trial begins Thursday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal rates increase today for the first time  
in four years, raising the cost of the basic first-class letter a 
penny -- to 33 cents. Despite four-straight profitable years, the 
post office says it needs added cash to buy equipment, cover rising 
costs and reduce outstanding debt. Originally, the rate increase 
had been expected to take effect last summer, but it was postponed 
at the urging of the Postal Rate Commission and Congress. The first 
33-cent stamps went on sale last Tuesday.

slave laborers by the Nazis plan to sue Germany for more than $1 
billion in compensation for wages and ill health, according to a 
German magazine report yesterday. The group of 21,844 former 
laborers has sent a letter to the government demanding $240 for 
each month of work in Nazi prisons or concentration camps, 
according to Der Spiegel, for a total of $1.43 billion. A lawyer

it will sue the companies that used slave labor during World War

<HEADLINE> Report: Prosecutors Hiding Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prosecutors throughout the country have hid  
evidence, leading to wrongful convictions, retrials and appeals 
that cost taxpayers millions of dollars, according to a Chicago 
Tribune analysis of thousands of court records in homicide cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The records show prosecutors have won conviction against black  
men, hiding evidence the real killers were white. They also have 
prosecuted a wife, hiding evidence her husband committed suicide. 
And they have prosecuted parents, hiding evidence their daughter 
was killed by wild dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning has become more important than doing justice. Nobody  
runs for the Senate saying I did justice,'' said Harvard University 
law professor Alan Dershowitz, a longtime critic of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	John Justice, president of the National District Attorneys  
Association, responded: ``I believe the great majority of 
prosecutors in this country are truly dedicated to doing their jobs 
in the proper fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in some cases, they have prosecuted defendants who came  
within hours of being executed, only to be exonerated, according to 
the Tribune report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling designed to curb  
misconduct by prosecutors, at least 381 defendants nationally have 
had a homicide conviction thrown out because prosecutors concealed 
evidence suggesting innocence or presented evidence they knew to be 
false, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 381 defendants, 67 had been sentenced to death, including  
Randall Dale Adams of Texas, whose wrongful conviction was revealed 
by the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line.'' Although 28 of those 67 
death row inmates were subsequently freed, almost all spent at 
least five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois' record for misconduct by prosecutors ranks among the  
worst, with 46 of the 381 cases, the Tribune found. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, three former DuPage County prosecutors will face  
trial on charges of conspiring to frame Rolando Cruz, who served 
about 10 years on death row before being acquitted of murder at his 
third trial. If the former prosecutors are convicted of a felony 
for concealing and knowingly using false evidence, it would be a 
first in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Rice Reflects on 49ers' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sitting on a stool in a quiet 49ers' locker room,  
Jerry Rice was more interested in looking ahead than dwelling on 
his roller-coaster season and the team's final defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not done,'' Rice said.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's career leader in touchdowns, receptions and yards  
receiving, the 36-year-old Rice made a strong comeback from two 
major injuries to his left knee that sidelined him most of last 
season. But he struggled through the final seven weeks with a 
partially torn ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a very difficult season,'' said Rice, whose  
standing as the team's top receiver was challenged with the 
development of Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But just watching the young guys grow, the fire is still  
burning. I'll be back next year in better shape and I will be 
healthy and ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens had a team-high eight receptions for 73 yards, but it was  
Rice who flashed his Pro Bowl form on a 17-yard touchdown catch 
that got San Francisco back into the game after Atlanta led 14-0 
Saturday. The Falcons held on to win the divisional playoff game 
20-18, ending the 49ers' season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to play man-to-man and I did not have a game plan,''  
Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan said. ``He caught a good pass, but 
I'm not going to be mad because he may have won that battle but we 
won the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Rice still has it. I told him after the game that I  
don't want anyone telling him that he doesn't have it because he 
and Steve Young can still click.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers' passing game couldn't click enough to overcome  
the loss of running back Garrison Hearst, who went down on the 
first play with a broken bone in his lower left leg. Knowing the 
49ers had to throw, the Falcons put up a strong defense against the 
pass, intercepting Young three times to fend off San Francisco's 
comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a hard pill to swallow,'' Rice said of Hearst's loss.  
``We didn't feel like we had to do anything desperate but we knew 
the receivers had to pick up the slack. There's a couple plays we 
wish we had back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said the 49ers accomplished a great deal this season even  
though they didn't realize their goal of going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crazy season, up and down,'' said Rice, recalling the  
high from last week's last-second wild card win over Green Bay on 
Owens' dramatic touchdown catch and the season-long front-office 
tumult marked by the exodus of Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark to 
the expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite his success, coach Steve Mariucci had to weather  
rumors about his job security. That speculation died after the 
49ers' beat the Packers, and Mariucci now is on the verge of 
signing a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, this team kept it together with everything that was  
going on around it,'' Rice said. ``We have a lot to hold our heads 
up about and just get ready for next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco safety Tim McDonald said there's nothing to do now  
for the 49ers but move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big swing in emotions for us between last week and  
this,'' he said. ``It has been a trying season. Of course, we'd 
like to end it a little better than we did.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Women Can't Outrun Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No matter how good women get in distance  
running, men are destined to be faster, a new study contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The study rebuts a controversial 1992 article which found that  
women's world distance records were improving faster than men's and 
extrapolated that women would overtake men. The 1992 article 
predicted that the women's record for the marathon would equal the 
men's in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't happen, however. The women's record is 2 hours, 20  
minutes, 47 seconds, held by Kenyan Tegla Loroupe. The men's is 2 
hours, 6 minutes, 5 seconds, by Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	And gaps such as that will remain; the days in which women could  
make great gains against men are over, said researcher Phillip P. 
Sparling of Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that the sex difference is really stable for the last  
nearly 10 years in events from the mile to the marathon,'' Sparling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparling and his colleagues looked at times of the world's 100  
best men and 100 best women from 1980 to 1996 for the 1,500 meters 
(the metric mile), and 42 kilometers (the metric marathon of 26.2 
miles). Their findings were published in the American College of 
Sports Medicine journal, Medicine and Science in Sports and 
Exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Men were about 11 percent faster in both events, and there was  
little variability. ``That percent difference is a very constant 
difference,'' and athletes can expect it to continue, Sparling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparling's study did not seek reasons for the gender difference  
in distance running. He speculated that men's greater muscularity 
and higher levels of oxygen-carrying red blood cells may be causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparling's findings contradict the predictions of the 1992  
letter in the journal Nature by researchers Brian J. Whipp and 
Susan A. Ward, both then of the University of California, Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Whipp and Ward had looked over distance records dating back to  
1920 for women, compared the record times to those for men, and 
discovered that the women's records were falling more sharply than 
the men's. They projected that, based on the difference in the 
improvements, women could some day overtake men. 
</P>
<P>
	What made women look so good in Whipp and Ward's data was that  
women's running was in its infancy, Sparling said. Record times 
plunged more quickly as women learned more about how to train and 
as greater numbers of potentially excellent women runners entered 
the sport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, however, women and men train about equally hard  
and well, Sparling said. And this makes it about equally hard for 
either sex to show big improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sparling may have a point, it could take up to 30 years to  
be sure, countered Ward, now at the University of Glasgow, 
Scotland. ``The proof of the pudding is in the waiting,'' she said. 
`If this is indeed a flattening off, it would need to be 
demonstrably maintained over a longer time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Sparling's study neatly sums a perception that people  
who follow track have held for some time, said Amby Burfoot, editor 
of Runner's World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The running world in general was aware of the 11 percent  
difference, and people who traffic in this are forever comparing 
differences in times and genders,'' he said. ``I believe it's very, 
very much sex-based, which is to say biologically based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do the findings bother a top U.S. miler, Suzy Hamilton of  
Madison, Wis. ``I think that women will never be able to catch men 
in the mile, just because of genetics,'' the former Olympian said. 
``Just because a man can beat me in the mile doesn't make me less 
determined to try to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't turn races into battles of the sexes, Hamilton said.  
``If I go past a man, I hope that guy is rooting for me and saying, 
`I am happy for her.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And it is possible that women may regularly beat men in one  
event -- the grueling ultramarathon. Two South African studies found 
that women performed significantly better than men in races of 56 
miles and more. One researcher quoted in a women's sports section 
of February Runner's World believes women are more efficient at the 
greater distances. Another, however, says it'll take larger studies 
and tighter research to be sure.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen early Monday  
on persistent worries about Brazil's economy. Tokyo stock prices 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.14 yen in early trading, down 1.28 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
110.93 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 124.40 points,  
or 0.93 percent, to 13,267.41 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed down 144.75 points, or 1.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved lower on the market view  
that the greenback remains highly susceptible to further signs of 
crisis in Brazil and indications that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
may face a prolonged trial in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Brazil's third wealthiest state, Minas Gerais,  
declared a debt moratorium on its payments to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic difficulties in Brazil pressure the dollar because of  
the large exposure of U.S. banks and companies to the South 
American country's economy, the world's ninth largest. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started lower as  
investors were discouraged by the yen's continued strength against 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stronger yen has prompted some selling in the cash  
market,'' said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is viewed as bearish for shares of  
export-oriented companies as it makes Japanese exports more 
expensive abroad, and thus less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded lower at 128.58 yen in Tokyo early Monday,  
down from 130.08 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section slipped 5.79 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,052.61 in 
early trading. The TOPIX closed down 11.20 points, or 1.05 percent, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
105.56 points to 9,643.32, a new record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.790 percent from Monday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.08 yen from 101.05 yen.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Hire Andy Reid As Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles have hired Green Bay  
quarterbacks coach Andy Reid as their new head coach, The 
Associated Press learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, who served on Mike Holmgren's staff in Green Bay for seven  
years, accepted the Eagles' offer to succeed fired coach Ray Rhodes 
late Sunday night, a source who asked not to be identified told the 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles scheduled a news conference for noon Monday at a  
downtown hotel to introduce Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 40, arrived in Philadelphia late Saturday and toured the  
city and met with team executives for a second interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He emerged as the team's top choice in a field that included  
Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett, fired Carolina coach 
Dom Capers and Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid would become the second-youngest head coach in the NFL  
after Oakland's Jon Gruden, 35. But Holmgren's assistants have an 
impressive track record. Reid would join Rhodes, Gruden and San 
Francisco's Steve Mariucci as former Holmgren assistants to land 
head coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all done it, and I haven't done it,'' Reid said last  
week. ``Do I think I can do it? Sure. I have a lot of confidence in 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's agent, Bob LaMonte, did not return telephone calls  
seeking comment on the contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's jump to the Eagles could coincide with Rhodes getting the  
Packers head coaching job that became available when Mike Holmgren 
signed a $32 million, four-year contract to be coach and general 
manager of the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes has been regarded as a top candidate to succeed Holmgren,  
and The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that the former 
Eagles coach was headed to Green Bay for an interview. Packers 
spokesman Lee Remmel said Sunday that Rhodes was not in Green Bay, 
and that the team would make no announcements until a coach was 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes' agent, Jim Solano, did not return a telephone call  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is one of Rhodes' best friends. The two worked together on  
Holmgren's staff at Green Bay during Rhodes' two seasons as the 
Packers' defensive coordinator in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes blamed the Eagles' front office for the team's fall from  
20-12 in his first two seasons to 6-9-1 and 3-13 in the final two. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reid said last week that he made it a point not to  
contact Rhodes about the Eagles situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want any influence like that,'' Reid said Thursday  
after his first interview. ``I purposely did not call Ray and ask 
him about the operations of the Philadelphia Eagles prior to coming 
here. I wanted to approach this as Andy Reid, not Ray Rhodes. 
That's what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never has held the title of offensive coordinator,  
Reid played a major role in designing the Packers' offensive game 
plans and is considered very knowledgeable about Holmgren's 
successful offensive system.

<HEADLINE> Offenders Serve More Time in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average time offenders serve in prison has  
increased, due in part to states enacting measures that restrict 
inmates' early release, a federal study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Offenders released in 1996 had served an average of 25 months in  
prison and five months in jail, up overall from the average 22 
months in prison and six months in jail from those freed in 1990, 
the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent offenders -- those convicted of murder, rape, robbery and  
aggravated assault-- leaving prison in 1997 had an average of 49 
months behind bars, up from 43 months in 1993, according to the 
study. Convicts released in 1997 had served an average 54 percent 
of their sentence, up from 47 percent four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The report points to changes in state laws to restrict the early  
release of prisoners. These include ``truth-in-sentencing'' laws 
that require offenders to serve a substantial portion of their 
minimum sentence -- generally between 50 percent and 100 percent -- 
before being eligible for release. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend has been more restrictive to require offenders to  
serve more time,'' Doris James Wilson, a co-author of the report, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	This shift is driven in part ``by an overall view that criminals  
were not serving enough time, that there was too much of a gap 
between sentences set by a judge and the amount of time actually 
served,'' she noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia require violent  
offenders to serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences. 
Legislation passed in 1994 authorized the federal government to 
provide grants to states that set this minimum for time served. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27 states are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware,  
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 13 states require violent offenders to serve a  
substantial portion of their minimum sentence before being eligible 
for release. They are Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, 
Texas and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states also have reduced the discretion of parole boards in  
authorizing the release of prisoners. Fourteen states have 
abolished parole board release for all offenders, with at least six 
other states abolishing parole board release for certain violent or 
felony offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at some of the research, we saw a progression moving  
from the indeterminate model, where there is a lot of discretion by 
parole boards, to more restrictive models,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandatory minimum sentences, which require offenders to be  
sentenced for a specified amount of prison time, and state 
sentencing guidelines for given offenses have also contributed to 
offenders spending more time in prison, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings of the study:  
</P>
<P>
	--More released prisoners are serving their entire sentences.  
About 18 percent had served full terms in 1997, compared with 13 
percent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 70 percent of prison admissions for a violent offense in  
1997 were in states requiring offenders to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentence. More than 90 percent were in states 
requiring at least 50 percent of the sentence be served. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of releases relative to the number of inmates in  
prison dropped from 37 per 100 state prisoners in 1990 to 31 per 
100 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 3M's Filament Tape Turns 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- It has been used to pull cars out of the mud,  
make emergency fan belt repairs and improve golf games. 
</P>
<P>
	More commonly, 3M Co.'s Scotch brand filament tape holds  
appliance doors shut during shipping, secures truckloads of 
merchandise being sent across town or around the country and forms 
the tear-strip opener on express mail envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 50 years since Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co.  
introduced filament tape, the company has sold more than 1 billion 
rolls -- enough to wrap around the world 1,340 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our tape does, in effect, what you do when you put your finger  
on a shoelace, to keep the bow in place while you finish tying the 
knot,'' said Dave Wagner, a manager in the 3M Packaging Systems 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	All that for as little as $1 for the most common size roll, 3/4  
inch by 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with the tape's 50th anniversary, 3M is sponsoring  
a yearlong contest seeking innovative uses for its filament tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I use Scotch filament tape on the face of my golf clubs,'' one  
entrant wrote. ``The golf ball leaves a mark indicating exactly 
where I am making contact with the ball. It is illegal to use 
during play, but an effective teaching tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another entrant touted its usefulness in emergency car repairs.  
``When our fan belt broke, a roll of filament tape and a wrench 
came in handy to repair the belt and get us to the nearest 
garage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ev Osten and Mike O'Reilly, who have worked at 3M headquarters  
in Maplewood for 31 years, tell of taping a portable ice fishing 
house to the top of O'Reilly's car for a trek to the lake one 
January in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That weekend the temperature hit near 40 below zero,'' Osten  
said. ``It's a hundred mile drive and through all that cold and 
wind it stayed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Reilly also said he's often used the tape as tow cable for  
moving disabled vehicles short distances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as long as you want it to be. I don't think I ever had  
one break on me,'' O'Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually it's the one item you have in the trunk of the car, in  
the tool box and on the shelf at home,'' Osten added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company introduced filament tape in 1948 as a safer, easier  
to use substitute for steel straps and wire for heavy-duty 
packaging. For lighter-duty packaging, it was stronger and more 
convenient than rope or string. 
</P>
<P>
	Early ads promoted the tape as ``so strong a Mr. America can't  
break it!'' with a picture of a grunting muscle man trying to do 
just that. Sales representatives demonstrated the product by towing 
a customer's car around the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 3M tape hit the market, a rudimentary filament tape  
was introduced by another company using less sophisticated 
technology and manufacturing, said 3M spokesman Henry Owen. 
</P>
<P>
	That first entry is no longer made. Dozens of other companies  
now make filament tape -- also called strapping tape -- but 3M is the 
largest manufacturer and worldwide leader in sales, Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which manufactures the tape at its plant in  
Bristol, Pa., doesn't disclose sales figures for its individual 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	3M's first filament tape, rayon filaments backed with crepe  
paper, has undergone continuous refinement. In the 1960s, paper and 
acetate film backings were replaced by polyester and polypropylene 
film backings. The filaments are now glass or polyester yarns.

<HEADLINE> Earlier Euro Cash Debut Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Encouraged by the smooth debut of the  
European common currency on financial markets, some politicians and 
economists are pushing for a early launch of euro bills and coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmut Hausmann, the leading Free Democratic Party candidate for  
EU parliament elections in June, wants euro cash to become 
available Jan. 1, 2001, one year earlier than planned, Focus 
newsmagazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Making people wait too long to have euros and cents in their  
hands and wallets could create widespread disappointment, Hausmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro launched Jan. 1 in 11 European countries. While euro  
currency will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, it now can 
be used for credit card or traveler's check purchases. Many major 
firms are converting their transactions to euros, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Fuchs, president of a German wholesalers and retailers  
association, agreed with Hausmann. Planning the launch in 2002 is 
``already an unfriendly act,'' Focus quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, also is  
calling for a swifter cash debut, as is Ulrich Hombrecker, an 
economist with WestLB. Both say the 11 euro nations do not need 
three years to prepare for bills and coins, the Munich-based 
magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``One year is enough,'' Hombrecker said.

<HEADLINE> Errors End Jacksonville's Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars returned  
to their roots Sunday. They looked like an expansion team in its 
first season. 
</P>
<P>
	They botched so many plays that it turned the trip to the  
Meadowlands into a disappointing 34-24 playoff loss to the New York 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumb mistakes, inadvertent bloopers, bad play calls, missed  
opportunities. There were so many errors that it brought up 
memories of Jacksonville's only other trip here to play the Jets -- 
a 27-10 loss in Week 3 of 1995, their expansion season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets advanced to play the Denver Broncos in the AFC  
championship game. The Jaguars (12-6) closed the season feeling 
they were good enough to get there, but lacked the smarts and 
discipline when it counted most. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made foolish, foolish plays, foolish throws, foolish  
decisions,'' said quarterback Mark Brunell, who threw three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing to be expected from a team that shed the  
expansion label quickly and was making its third straight 
appearance in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most glaring mistakes were Brunell underthrowing a  
wide-open Keenan McCardell on a third-and-1, Damon Jones dropping 
an easy reception deep in Jets territory and Donovin Darius' 
decision to run an interception out of the end zone instead of 
taking the touchback. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, there was the symbolic play of the game: safety  
Chris Hudson's decision to lateral after he scooped up Curtis 
Martin's fumble and returned it well into Jets territory in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I don't think Chris Hudson has callous disregard  
for the ball,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``But I think it was a 
very, very ill-advised thing he did, and it really ends up stinging 
us. You don't get many opportunities like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lateral looked like a forward pass, but the officials ruled  
Hudson simply bobbled the ball. It looked like a botched call. So 
silly was the mistake, however, that Coughlin's immediate reaction 
was to slam his cap to the turf and go after Hudson, not referee 
Bob McElwee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to make a play,'' Hudson said. ``I was just  
trying to make something out of nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said of Darius after his interception with  
2:28 remaining in the game with the Jaguars trailing 31-24. He slid 
to make the catch in the end zone and stayed there for what seemed 
like a long time, with the entire field empty ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he realized it, however, the Jets offense converged.  
Darius ran out to the 6-inch line, where he was tackled. The 
Jaguars went four-and-out, and the game was essentially over. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I didn't really know where I was,'' Darius said.  
``But I would do it again. I don't regret it. If I get up and go 
100 yards, everybody's talking about what a great decision it 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Jaguars won, Coughlin would have been deemed a genius  
for his third-and-1 call early in the third quarter. Instead of a 
plunge to Fred Taylor, Coughlin called for a play-action pass. 
Everyone on the Jets defense bit on the fake, but Brunell floated 
it to an unguarded McCardell, and safety Corwin Brown picked it 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven plays later, the Jets led 24-7.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars made their share of plays, as well. Brunell hit  
Jimmy Smith for a 52-yard touchdown to cut a 17-point deficit to 
17-7 on the last play before halftime. Reggie Barlow had an 88-yard 
kickoff return that led to another score. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor ran for 86 yards and the Jaguars defense got a pair of  
key turnovers in the fourth quarter. Darius' interception came just 
minutes after Dave Thomas recovered a fumble that led to a 
Jacksonville field goal, closing the Jags to 31-24. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the kinds of things that usually win in the playoffs.  
Unless, that is, you do even more to give the game away.

<HEADLINE> Dodge, Universal OK Marketing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Universal Studios Inc. and the Dodge  
division of DaimlerChrylser AG are expected to announce today the 
formation of a marketing deal that will link Dodge vehicles with 
Universal movies, theme parks and other entertainment venues. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is one of the largest automotive-entertainment  
marketing partnerships ever, according to Jim Julow, vice president 
of the Dodge division. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes exclusive product tie-ins with certain  
Universal movies and a marketing campaign to coincide with 
Universal's opening of its Islands of Adventures theme park in 
Orlando, Fla., next summer. Dodge will invite owners of its Caravan 
minivan to a sneak preview of the part in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``From motion pictures to consumer goods, theme parks and the  
Internet, we now have new avenues to gain exposure for all our 
products and to serve both new and existing customers,'' Julow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodge and Universal did not disclose terms of the deal, which  
has been under discussion for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers for years have used movies as a marketing tool to  
promote certain vehicles. The Dodge-Universal deal is part of a 
recent trend to expand such marketing relationships to theme parks 
and other types of entertainment.

Federation is not panicking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Kleckner remains optimistic despite falling prices, bad  
weather, disease and fewer and fewer small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. is still the No. 1 producer in the world. And with  
the help of technology, we're going to continue to go forward,'' 
Kleckner said as the nation's largest farming organization prepared 
for its 80th annual convention in Albuquerque this week. ``We're 
never going to go back to the old days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of reasons to be pessimistic in 1998. Excess  
supply in the pork industry sent prices plummeting, while the beef 
and poultry did not fare much better. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with the exception of dairy producers, farmers  
worldwide are experiencing a sort of recession, said Kleckner, an 
Iowa hog farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A world glut of farm products and lessened demand are keeping  
prices low,'' Kleckner said in an interview. ``Pork is a complete 
disaster, but prices for major crops are low, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy marketing order reform, farmland preservation and  
environmental challenges are among the many issues the 
4.7-million-member Farm Bureau will tackle at the convention, which 
continues through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop insurance reform is one of the major priorities for  
Kleckner. Farmers received nearly $3 billion in disaster relief 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current system, farmers are paid from a federal  
disaster relief fund if their crops are destroyed by disease or bad 
weather. Kleckner, who wants the federal program privatized, said 
the money in the fund should be used to help farmers pay their 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance should be based on the amount of income a farmer lost  
in a year, instead of the percentage of crops lost, and the fund 
should be expanded to cover livestock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulation is another area of concern for farmers because  
overregulation has driven many out of the business, Kleckner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need (regulations), but they ought to make sense and be  
done for the common good,'' he said. ``They're causing farmers to 
throw their hands up in the air. The big farms can hire lawyers to 
deal with the legalese, but the small farmers say they can't keep 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulation, particularly the Endangered Species Act, is a  
primary concern for farmers in the West, Kleckner said. He is 
urging the government to enlist farmers and ranchers to help design 
laws affecting agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the government starts out with the mindset that  
ranchers and farmers are the enemies,'' he said. ``(But) when it 
comes to growing plants and animals, who knows more than farmers?''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Keep Everyone Off-Balance / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whether it is falling or rising, the stock  
market of the late 1990s has a powerful penchant for keeping 
everybody off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last summer, when prices were tumbling amid talk of an  
international financial crisis, the market unnerved investors the 
world over. Now that it has rebounded to new highs, it is scaring 
lots of people again, climbing so fast it seems to have broken 
loose from all its usual moorings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Move more carefully,'' Standard &AMP; Poor's weekly newsletter The  
Outlook tells its readers. ``We're worried about the historically 
extreme stock valuations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are most other analysts who take the measure of the market  
using traditional yardsticks. By S&AMP;P's calculations, the 
price-to-earnings ratio of the firm's 500-stock composite index has 
recently climbed above 32 to 1, based on the profit reports of the 
most recent 12 months. That's ``the highest ever by a wide 
margin,'' S&AMP;P says. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are that quite a few investors who play it strictly by  
the book have been out of the game for some time. The aggregate 
dividend yield of the popular blue-chip averages was thought to be 
shockingly low when it dropped below 2.5 percent a few years back. 
Now it is not much more than half that size. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks' gains of the past year or two have been especially hard  
on value investors, including many admired professionals who 
maintain a set of standards from which they refuse to deviate. 
</P>
<P>
	These people wouldn't touch an Internet stock even before the  
doublings, triplings and redoublings in the prices of those shares 
over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``With no earnings or dividends, these Internet stocks have been  
bid up like commodities -- they have nothing to relate to other than 
the stock's last sale,'' says analyst Ray DeVoe at Legg Mason Wood 
Walker Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fundamental rule regarding this is that when stocks are  
treated like commodities, they will behave like commodities. When 
there is no relation to value, as in commodities, the plunges can 
be dramatic and sudden. That is why there are daily trading limits 
in commodities, something missing in Internet stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even amid all the skepticism, most observers concede that  
the new economic promise of computers and communications represents 
much more than a short-term mania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an accident that markets have been so strong for so  
long,'' says George Cohen at the New York investment firm of Cohen, 
Klingenstein &AMP; Marks Inc. ``Real forces have correctly driven 
securities prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or in the words of L. Roy Papp, a Phoenix investment adviser and  
fund manager, ``something is different. Since the development of 
the personal computer in 1982 we have had only one year of 
recession. Globalization and increased trade have dramatically 
changed our country. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the last 20 years the United States has skyrocketed  
ahead of the rest of the world in technology, particularly 
computers, entertainment and scientific education, and the gap is 
increasing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its runaway rise in the 1980s and '90s, the stock market  
has shown that it seldom waits for new developments like these to 
become visible to the naked eye. It anticipates them when they are 
still only a glimmer of a suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	But history shows that it also tends to go to extremes of either  
optimism or pessimism, with often-wrenching reappraisals 
afterwards. ``We must look through the windshield of the car, not 
the rearview mirror,'' says Papp. ``However, we should not use a 
telescope to do so.''

<HEADLINE> Publisher Joins Cable Car Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Military prosecutors have subpoenaed Rolling  
Stone magazine as well as CBS seeking unpublished materials about a 
deadly ski lift accident in the Italian Alps for which two Marine 
Corps aviators face court-martials. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling Stone filed a motion to quash the subpoena on Friday  
with a military court at Camp Lejeune, N.C., the same day that CBS 
took similar action, magazine lawyer Laura Handman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty people were killed Feb. 3 when a Marine Corps EA-6B  
Prowler slashed through the cables supporting a ski lift gondola. 
The plane's pilot and navigator are scheduled for separate trials 
next month on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Handman said Rolling Stone published an article about the  
accident in its Dec. 10 issue and the subpoena seeks raw and unused 
material, including off-the-record interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	For reporters to be forced to divulge such information violates  
protections guaranteed by the First Amendment, Handman said.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Jet Hits Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Tokyo-bound United Airlines jumbo jet hit severe  
turbulence Sunday, slightly injuring two American passengers and 
three crew members, an airport official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 833 from Chicago, with 227 passengers and 23 crew members  
aboard, hit turbulence over the Kamchatka region in eastern Russia, 
said Narita Airport Authorities spokesman Tomiichi Nagayama. 
</P>
<P>
	All five were treated and released from an airport clinic after  
the Boeing 747-400 jet arrived at the Tokyo International Airport 
in Narita, 40 miles east of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, a 32-year-old Japanese woman died of head  
injuries and more than 100 people were hurt when a United Airlines 
jet suddenly plunged while flying from Tokyo to Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Continue To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices continued to drop at  
the pump as supply outpaced demand, an industry analyst said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average retail price for all grades, including taxes, was  
$1.03 per gallon on Friday. That was down about a half-cent over 
the past three weeks, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The price fell below the all-time low of nearly $1.04 reached  
last month, thanks to an oil glut compounded by lowered demand from 
economies hit by financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate of decline has slowed ... and prices went up in some  
cities and down in many others in that period. But there still is 
more supply than demand requires,'' analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving demand is at its lowest during this winter period, she  
added. ``This puts the brakes on prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price cuts were slower than in the past few weeks, however.  
Crude oil prices, while still near rock-bottom, increased somewhat 
and that pushed up wholesale gas costs in some areas, mainly in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many dealers didn't pass the increases on to customers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they are sacrificing to compete for customers in  
this low-demand season,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices at self-serve stations were 96.95 cents per gallon for  
regular; $1.0784 for mid-grade and $1.1634 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full service prices were $1.4253 for regular, $1.5169 for  
mid-grade and $1.5873 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Redskins, Stadium Sold for $800M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium were sold for $800 million Sunday in the most expensive 
bidding war in NFL history, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The price paid by a group headed by brothers Howard and Edward  
Milstein and Daniel Snyder breaks the $530 million Alfred Lerner 
spent last year for the expansion Cleveland Browns, a team for 
which Howard Milstein also put in a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Final details were hammered out at a meeting Sunday between  
members of the Milstein-Snyder group and trustees of the estate of 
the late Jack Kent Cooke, according to sources involved in the 
sale. The final sticking point centered on what figure to release 
when the formal announcement is made Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how you count the money,'' one source told the  
AP. ``The price is $800 million gross. The net is $750 million. The 
group will pay $800 million, but will essentially get $50 million 
back right away from money in a Redskins bank account and other 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Milstein brothers, who come from a successful banking  
family, own 45 percent of the NHL's New York Islanders, but will 
all but certainly have to sell that interest to comply with the 
NFL's cross-ownership rules. Howard Milstein, 47, is a noted New 
York real estate executive who bid $450 million for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, 34, is chief executive of Snyder Communications in  
Bethesda, Md., a marketing firm that employs 8,000 people in 80 
locations in 12 countries. It is particularly big in pharmaceutical 
and long-distance telephone marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale must be approval by three-quarters of NFL owners, who  
are expected to take up the matter during Super Bowl week at the 
end of the month. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which has been 
handling the negotiations, has kept the league apprised during the 
process to help ensure that the winning candidate would meet NFL 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ends 25 years of Cooke family control of one of the  
blue-chip franchises in professional sports. Cooke, who became 
majority owner in 1974, oversaw the team's glory years of three 
Super Bowl victories under coach Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cooke died in April 1997 at the age of 84, and his will  
contained a surprise. Instead of leaving the team to his son, John 
Kent Cooke, the elder Cooke instructed that the seven trustees of 
his estate sell the team and stadium and that the proceeds be used 
to establish a charitable foundation for children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kent Cooke was determined to keep the team in the family,  
but struggled to keep pace in the bidding war because he lacked the 
personal wealth of the billionaires and mega-millionaires who were 
competing against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His dad made it awful difficult for him to keep,'' said Hall  
of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen, who has been associated with 
the Redskins as a player-broadcaster-unofficial team confidant 
since 1964. ``He tried his best and it didn't work out. It's sad. 
It's going to quite an adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the very public sale of the Browns, the Redskins were  
sold behind of veil of secrecy. Prospective bidders were required 
to sign a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke had no comment Sunday night, according to a team  
spokesman. The Milstein brothers and Snyder also withheld comment, 
at the request of the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's purchase leaves in doubt the futures of general  
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner. The Redskins 
haven't made the playoffs since 1992, and are 32-47-1 in five years 
under Turner. Sources at Redskin Park said both would have been 
retained had Cooke kept the team, which finished 6-10 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the process was secretive, most of the major  
contenders became known, including Baltimore Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos; Phoenix real estate developer Sam Grossman, who enlisted 
Gibbs as a minority partner; and Texas investor David Bonderman, 
whose group included shopping center developer Ted Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling price is even more remarkable considering it is  
primarily a stock sale, which offers fewer tax perks to the buyer 
as opposed to the asset-based sale conducted for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	If translated to an asset price, the $800 million would almost  
certainly top the world record $1 billion offer Rupert Murdoch has 
made for English soccer club Manchester United.

<HEADLINE> German Insurance Cos. May Face Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Descendants of Holocaust victims have  
filed a lawsuit accusing German insurance firms of ``conspiring'' 
to deny them payment on Nazi-era life insurance policies, a 
magazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``conspiracy'' lawsuit reported by Der Spiegel would follow  
numerous lawsuits against insurance firms seeking payment on 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Dec. 30 in New York, claims the insurance  
firms have done everything in their power to ``frustrate the 
demands of lawsuits.'' It also accuses the insurance firms of 
trying to cover up their guilt by systematically privatizing their 
profits from World War II, according to the Hamburg-based magazine.

<HEADLINE> Fiat, Other Carmakers Talk Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian automaker Fiat is in talks with Sweden's  
Volvo and several other carmakers to explore possible alliances, 
the chairman of IFIL SpA was quoted as saying in a number of 
Italian dailies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Fiat-Volvo talks have been going around for weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The discussion (with Volvo) exists, but not only with them,''  
said Umberto Agnelli, chairman of IFIL SpA, one of the holding 
companies through which the Agnelli family controls Fiat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two or three groups (we are talking to),'' Agnelli  
said. ``In any case alliances are useful, but not indispensable for 
Fiat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Volvo needs a strong bid or cooperation deal for  
its car unit to support its stock price. In a recent story, 
London's Financial Times identified Fiat, Ford Motor Co. and 
Volkswagen AG as possible bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnelli made his comments while hosting a dinner for visiting  
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, prompting additional 
speculation that a possible deal with Mitsubishi Motors Corp may be 
on the cards.

 *Lord Bristol    	
</P>
<P>
	BURY ST. EDMUNDS, England (AP) -- The Marquess of Bristol, who  
squandered millions on drugs and was jailed twice for heroin and 
cocaine possession, has died, the agent for his estate said Sunday. 
He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Bristol died in his sleep and was found Sunday morning at  
his family's estate in eastern England near Bury St. Edmunds, said 
Simon Pott. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not disclose a cause of death, but said Bristol had been  
suffering from a flu-like bug for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th Marquess of Bristol, who inherited the title in 1985  
when his father died, led a colorful and troubled life, becoming 
addicted to heroin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He later served a total 19 months in prison for drug possession.  
At a 1993 trial, it was estimated his addiction had cost his family 
$11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Bristol is survived by a half-brother, Lord Frederick  
Hervey, who will become the 8th Marquess of Bristol, Pott said.

</P>
<P>
	JASPER, Ala. (AP) -- Carl Elliott, a Democrat who served eight  
terms in Congress, died at his home Saturday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliot, who served from 1948 until 1964, was a champion of human  
rights and the first winner of the national John F. Kennedy 
Profiles in Courage Award. 
</P>
<P>
	He was instrumental in passing the National Defense Education  
Act, which allowed more than 15 million Americans to attend 
college, and also in the passage of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott cited the education bill as his proudest achievement.  
</P>
<P>
	He was a racial and political moderate during the segregationist  
days of the 1950s and 1960s. He refused to join Gov. George Wallace 
in defiance of federal court orders that called for the 
desegregation of southern schools. Wallace died Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	He was defeated by Wallace's wife, Lurleen, in the Alabama  
governor's race in 1966.

 *Jacques Neuville    	
</P>
<P>
	SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) -- Jacques Neuville, a forger for the  
French Resistance in World War II who became a San Francisco 
department-store executive, died Dec. 29. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and reared in Berlin as Guenther Neustadt, Neuville later  
adopted a French name when he was sent by his family to Paris at 
the rise of Nazi power. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Neuville studied painting and joined the French army.  
When his artillery unit was overwhelmed by German forces, Neuville 
made his way to a Resistance unit in Lyons and forged the ration 
cards, passports, and marriage and birth certificates that were 
used for false identities. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuville received the Croix de Guerre in 1946 for his wartime  
service in the anti-Nazi underground in Lyons and Paris and later 
received a U.S. citation for providing information on pilots 
captured by the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuville was betrayed to the Gestapo by a woman who went through  
his trouser pockets one night and found many ration cards. He was 
in prison for six weeks until a sympathetic French guard left the 
doors open, allowing Neuville and other prisoners to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Neuville began a marketing career in San Francisco. The  
child of a well-to-do Jewish family in the clothing trade, he later 
became the merchandising manager at Macy's. He retired in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Wins Skating Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Michelle Kwan and Yevgeni Plushenko outshone the  
professionals Sunday as the U.S. champion won the women's title and 
the young Russian took the men's crown at the Honda Lev Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice dancing title went to the Russian professional pair of  
Maya Usova and Evgeny Platov. Elena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze of Russia won the pairs competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interpretive free program before a capacity crowd of  
10,000 at Yoyogi National Gymnasium, Kwan and Plushenko retained 
the leads they had after the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, the 18-year-old world champion, started with a single axel  
that was reduced from a planned double axel. It was the only flaw 
for the Olympic silver medalist in a program that included spirals, 
spins and flying camels plus two clean triple jumps to the music 
from ``East of Eden.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya finished second  
and third, respectively. Japan's Yuka Sato, who turned pro after 
winning the 1994 world championship, placed fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first mistake was a little stupid,'' Kwan said. ``After  
the mistake, I told myself, `OK, Michelle, you've got to get into 
it ... just forget (it).' '' 
</P>
<P>
	For her free program, Kwan received a perfect 6.0 mark from one  
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In the free program of professional-amateur skating, greater  
emphasis is placed on the skaters' interpretation of the music and 
artistry than on technical difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Plushenko, winner at Skate Canada in November  
and the NHK Trophy in December, started with a clean triple axel 
and flying camel spins. His routine also included a circle step 
sequence, spirals and three more flawless jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``One-hundred percent,'' Plushenko said of his performance.  
</P>
<P>
	Russian Alexei Yagudin placed second and Todd Eldredge of the  
United States was third.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pills, Therapy Best Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Medication or therapy alone may not be enough  
to keep depression at bay for many senior citizens, according to a 
University of Pittsburgh study. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of antidepressant pills and counseling is most  
effective at preventing a relapse in older patients, Dr. Charles 
Reynolds said in the study, published in the Jan. 5 issue of the 
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings should send a message to insurance companies that  
pay only for pills, said Reynolds, a professor of psychiatry and 
neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's 
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depression is a kind of economic sinkhole in the medical  
delivery system,'' Reynolds said. ``Depressed patients make more 
clinic visits, consume more medication and stay longer in the 
hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are beginning a follow-up study to analyze  
whether paying for both types of treatment will save health-care 
costs in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institute of Mental Health, which funded both  
studies, reports that among people 65 and over, as many as 3 out of 
100 suffer from clinical depression. A study published last June in 
the medical association journal noted that significant symptoms of 
depression are common in older people but often go untreated 
because of a misconception that depression is just part of growing 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	The study released this month ``shows that depression in older  
people is both treatable and preventable,'' said Dr. Jerrold 
Rosenbaum, associate chief for clinical research at Massachusetts 
General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the first adequate study of that issue in the  
older population,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds and his team used both medication and therapy to treat  
180 people aged 60 or older who had been diagnosed with depression. 
Of them, 124 recovered and were then divided into four groups for 
follow-up treatment over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first group received only the antidepressant drug  
nortiptyline, known as Pamelor; the second received only monthly 
counseling; the third received both treatments; and the fourth 
received only a placebo drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that both treatments together prevented  
depression from recurring in 80 percent of the test group. Of the 
patients who took medication alone, 57 percent remained well, and 
of the ones who received only therapy, 36 percent stayed mentally 
fit. Only 10 percent of the placebo group did not again experience 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier, similar study on people in their 40s found no  
significant advantage in combined treatment over medication alone, 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	But because everybody in the seniors study was treated initially  
with both medication and therapy, the study may only prove that 
people who receive both treatments at first -- not the entire senior 
population -- also are best suited to a similar follow-up treatment, 
Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this, the study is the most significant examination to  
date of the relapse rate of depression among older Americans, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly demonstrates that this is a highly recurrent  
disorder, and treatment needs to be maintained over time,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> John Mellencamp Films New Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- John Mellencamp stayed close to home  
when he shot his latest, aptly titled video ``I'm Not Running 
Anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Music fans and curious onlookers braved biting cold Saturday to  
watch Mellencamp and his band film around the Monroe County 
Courthouse Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in the video so badly,'' said Elizabeth Tompkins,  
who stood for hours as the 14-hour filming brought Bloomington 
traffic to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne Sutton took her chances and came down from Chicago to see  
the shoot, which just happened to be on her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	She found out about it from a Web site devoted to Mellencamp,  
whose new album, ``John Mellencamp,'' was released late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday, and I said,  
'I want to go to Bloomington.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The song, flavored with groove and hip-hop samples, was written  
about Mellencamp's two young sons with his current wife, Elaine 
Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the boys end up in the video? ``They'll weasel their way in  
somehow,'' Irwin joked. ``But they're not supposed to be.''

<HEADLINE> Doubters Silenced by Denver's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos dissected the Dolphins. Now  
they will try to tackle the Tuna. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who routed Miami 38-3 in Saturday's AFC divisional  
playoff game, learned Sunday that they will play coach Bill 
Parcells and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship next Sunday 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets beat Jacksonville 34-24 on Sunday for their first  
playoff victory since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos and the Jets have never met in the playoffs, but  
Denver pounded New England 37-3 and 34-8 in consecutive seasons 
when Parcells was head coach of the Patriots in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going  
against a coach who has had a lot of success,'' Denver coach Mike 
Shanahan said, ``and obviously a coach who has a couple of Super 
Bowl rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells -- dubbed ``Tuna'' after asking his players, ``Who do  
you think I am, Charlie the Tuna?'' -- has worked his magic for the 
Jets, guiding them to their first playoff appearance since 1991. 
Since finishing 1-15 in 1996, the Jets are 21-11 in regular season 
games under Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great man leading them,'' Denver safety Tyrone  
Braxton said. ``Parcells, he's won everywhere he's gone. There's no 
reason to think he wouldn't win there. But it's surprising that he 
did it so quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have enjoyed a mini-resurrection of their own. After  
two late-season losses, critics questioned whether they would 
survive their first playoff game against Miami, which humbled them 
on national television three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver silenced the doubters with a 35-point victory that helped  
ease any apprehension outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I laugh when people talk about us struggling,'' offensive  
lineman Dan Neil said. ``Everybody's an expert. We weren't 
struggling. I don't think anyone was panicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos lost two of their final three games after winning  
their first 13, but looked about as loose as they have all season 
Saturday, springing league MVP Terrell Davis for 199 yards rushing 
and forcing three Miami turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, John Elway said Denver's two-game losing streak  
allowed the Broncos to relax in the wake of their pressure-packed 
run at perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure we'd love to have been undefeated,'' Elway said, ``but  
that kind of overshadowed everything we were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Denver healthy, focused and seemingly on top of its game,  
the Jets will have to contend with a defense that gave up just 14 
yards rushing against Miami and an offense that methodically picked 
apart the Dolphins through the air and on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the challenge will be the crowd noise at Mile High  
Stadium, where the Broncos have won 18 straight games since a 
playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're an amazing team,'' Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson  
said. ``Obviously they are the Super Bowl champions and 
everything's in their favor. We barely could stop Fred Taylor 
(Sunday), so I don't know what's going to happen with the other 
guy, Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had 2,008 yards rushing during the regular season,  
said he might have aggravated a rib injury Saturday, but does not 
expect to miss any practice time. Elway also had lingering soreness 
after taking a blind-side hit from Miami's Zach Thomas late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's only real question mark is offensive tackle Tony Jones,  
who sprained his right knee. An MRI was negative, and Shanahan 
hopes he can return to practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not done yet,'' Braxton said. ``We have to look at the  
big picture. This is one piece of the puzzle. This is not it.''

<HEADLINE> Austrian Raich Tops Maier in Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLACHAU, Austria (AP) -- Austrian star Hermann Maier lost a World  
Cup giant slalom in front of his hometown fans Sunday to a younger 
and less experienced teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Raich, a 20-year-old skier in his first season on the  
World Cup, rallied from third place after the first heat to win his 
first giant slalom title with a combined time of 1 minute, 27.02 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier wound up third, losing a race in his home country for the  
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never my goal to beat Maier,'' said Raich, a five-time  
World Junior champion. ``My goal was to finish at the top of the 
podium, and I don't care who is behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the overall World Cup leader and Olympic champion in the  
giant slalom, said third place was a ``small victory,'' considering 
he had finished 20th in the previous World Cup giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was expecting a lot from me,'' Maier said. ``It was  
almost impossible to focus on the race. It was even harder than at 
the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, the world giant slalom  
champion, finished second, .05 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not disappointed with second place because the time  
difference is so small,'' said Von Gruenigen, who has won 15 giant 
slalom races. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich joined the World Cup circuit this season and immediately  
began making an impact. He scored his first World Cup victory in a 
slalom Thursday at Schladming, where he rallied from 23rd after the 
first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years it used to be the same people in the top spots,''  
Von Gruenigen said. ``Now it is exciting to see newcomers to the 
circuit do so well. It gives you extra motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20,000 spectators lined the course Sunday. They  
cheered wildly and honked horns when it was clear an Austrian had 
won the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have become quite popular with Austrian ski fans,''  
Raich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier placed ninth in the first run, then tore down the second  
run in his aggressive style and moved up six places. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raich is in great shape,'' Maier said. ``But I will strike  
back 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Maier and Von Gruenigen said Raich was successful because  
he felt no pressure to win, allowing him to stay relaxed and take 
more risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Sunday's race, Maier had won every World Cup he had  
competed in on Austrian slopes since joining the circuit last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, whose parents are ski instructors at Flachau, increased  
his lead in the overall World Cup standings to 208 points. Norway's 
Lasse Kjus, who fell for the second consecutive race Sunday, is 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen took over the event lead from Austrian Christian  
Mayer.

<P>
	WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) -- A Florida-bound airliner was  
evacuated because of worries about a message found scrawled inside 
an in-flight magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	State police and bomb-sniffing dogs searched the plane at  
Bradley International Airport for about an hour but found nothing 
suspicious, said state police Lt. Robert Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Charter Flight 9912, carrying 150 passengers to West Palm

passenger flipping through the airline's magazine discovered the 
message, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy could not give details about the message, but said it  
referred to a Middle Eastern group known for terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The passenger considered it suspicious, a veiled threat,''  
Duffy said. ``It got back to the pilot, who thought he better go

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Official Denies Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Insisting he bribed no one and did nothing  
wrong, Tom Welch contends his organization acted responsibly in its 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, is accused of bribing IOC officials in the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News reported Sunday that Welch acknowledged cash  
payments and gifts to IOC members, but called them contributions to 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never bribed anybody. We never bought a vote,'' Welch said.  
``We made contributions out there as a part of the Olympic family, 
as an obligation we have. ... It was the responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch admitted giving $50,000 cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC  
member from the Republic of Congo. Ganga sought the money to help 
children in the African nation ravaged by civil strife, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I think the money went,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged the bid committee made a $10,000  
contribution to the campaign of Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander 
Fantini, who was running for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch did not immediately return telephone messages Sunday left  
by The Associated Press at his Park City home. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in  
1997 after being charged with spousal abuse, said he will challenge 
the right of the committee to cancel his $10,000-per-month 
consulting contract. The committee also stripped him of his 
$500,000 pension. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it was revoking the contract Friday, the same  
day senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign and 
President Frank Joklik said he was quitting for the good of the 
Games. Joklik will remain at his job until a replacement is found, 
possibly for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson are the only Salt Lake Olympic boosters being  
blamed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations -- by the Justice Department, the IOC, the  
U.S. Olympic Committee and a Salt Lake ethics panel -- are under way 
into accusations some IOC members accepted lavish gifts and money 
from Salt Lake boosters. The IOC voted for Salt Lake in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Saturday that Ganga received more  
than $70,000. Welch discussed only the $50,000 payment to Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch told the newspaper that Joklik and other bid committee  
board members knew about the gifts and payments to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew everything we were going to do,'' he said. ``I never  
did anything I am embarrassed about, or that I felt was wrong or 
that I felt was hidden or not disclosed to (Joklik) and the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Joklik, who was chairman of the bid board, and the board  
reviewed detailed annual budgets that were purposely not made 
public so competing cities would not match the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as keeping it secret or hiding it? No way,'' Welch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch also denied a rumor being investigated by the outside  
ethics panel for the SLOC that prostitutes were hired for IOC 
members visiting Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm offended to the core ... at some of the wild allegations,  
like the escort services and that type of thing, which is not 
true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said he secured medical care for Ganga when he was sick  
with hepatitis and Ganga's mother when she had an infected knee. It 
was previously reported that Salt Lake hospitals gave IOC members 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never hesitated. Was that wrong? I'd do it again,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Police School Disney on Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Disneyland was told to leave all future  
accident scenes untouched after workers washed away blood from a 
fatal incident on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Randall W. Gaston said he told park officials  
Saturday that officers must be promptly notified of any future 
accidents, and that any major injury, fatal accident or crime scene 
must be preserved until their investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 24, an 8-pound metal cleat ripped loose from the sailing  
ship Columbia as it was being moored. Luan Phi Dawson, 33, of 
Duvall, Wash., was struck in the head and died of a brain 
hemorrhage and skull fracture. His wife and a park employee were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The first uniformed policeman arrived about an hour after the  
accident and waited in the park security office. Police 
investigators responded two hours later and were briefed in the 
office before finally arriving at the dock, police reports and 
dispatch logs showed. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Disneyland workers had cleaned the area. Park  
officials said the blood and accident debris were washed away 
because they were unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston stressed that police did not believe Disneyland  
intentionally tampered with evidence or obstructed the 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Doomsday Cult Shuns Family Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Fourteen members of a doomsday cult deported from  
Israel spent Sunday holed up in hotel rooms as relatives waited 
anxiously in the downstairs lobby, hoping for some form of contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Roggeman, a Denver police officer who studies cults while  
off duty, believes the 14 probably already have contacted their 
leader, Monte Kim Miller, 44, who has tight control over the 
Concerned Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that they're here, he's probably trying to figure out what  
to do with them,'' Roggeman said. ``I think he'll probably try to 
send them to another country, maybe Greece or Mexico, but all we 
can do is wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The whereabouts of Miller, 44, were unknown.  
</P>
<P>
	The cult members arrived Saturday at Denver International  
Airport after being deported from Israel, where authorities accused 
them of plotting attacks in Jerusalem to hasten the return of Jesus 
Christ. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities worried that cult members were planning a mass  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members refused to meet with relatives at the airport.  
Private security officers are protecting their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	About half a dozen relatives maintained a somber vigil in the  
hotel's restaurant, hoping their family members who are in the cult 
would contact them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not giving up hope. As a parent, how can you?'' said  
Sherry Clark, whose daughter is a member of the cult but was not 
among those deported. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight Concerned Christian cult members sold their  
belongings and left their jobs in October. When relatives and 
friends noticed the departures, they discovered the group believed 
that Denver would be destroyed by an earthquake that would signal 
the beginning of the apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 14 later appeared in Jerusalem, while other  
members, ranging in age from infancy to 68, still are not accounted 
for.

<HEADLINE> Bigfoot Enthusiasts Discredit Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOTHELL, Wash. (AP) -- In the hearts and minds of true believers,  
Bigfoot's existence has long been enshrined in a single minute of 
jerky, grainy footage of a startled sasquatch retreating into the 
upper California woods. 
</P>
<P>
	But two enthusiasts of the legendary being are alleging four  
magnified frames of the 16 mm footage show tracings of a 
bell-shaped fastener at Bigfoot's waist. They say the creature in 
the so-called Patterson-Gimlin Film can finally be dismissed as a 
man in a monkey suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hoax,'' said Cliff Crook, a longtime Bigfoot tracker  
who devotes rooms to sasquatch memorabilia in this suburb north of 
Seattle. ``How can an artificial, manmade object end up on a 
Bigfoot?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film, purportedly showing a female Bigfoot fleeing a  
streambed, was taken by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin on Oct. 20, 
1967. It has largely withstood independent scrutiny and, for many 
steeped in the lore of the man-beast, has become bedrock evidence 
of its very existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way of really detracting from it,'' said Ray Crowe,  
president of the Western Bigfoot Society in Portland, Ore. The 
image captured in the footage ``has a fluid motion. It's a wild 
creature of nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film is important because many Bigfoot believers compare all  
plaster casts of telltale footprints against those made by 
Patterson the day he purportedly filmed the creature slinking 
across a sandbar in the Six Rivers National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Discredit the footage, experts agree, and the gold standard for  
Bigfoot tracks will be washed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Crook bases his assertion on computer enhancements performed by  
Chris Murphy, a Bigfoot buff from Vancouver, British Columbia, who 
maintains he discovered an aberration in the footage in 1995 while 
helping his son Daniel prepare a class project. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy declined to be interviewed, instead supplying a written  
narrative detailing his discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	According to that account, the Murphys used a color photocopier  
to duplicate a frame of the Patterson film. Zooming in again and 
again, Chris Murphy became suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	To him, something geometric -- vaguely the shape of a bottle  
opener -- seemed to take shape at Bigfoot's waist. Murphy maintains 
that four sequential computer-scanned frames of the film show the 
object in different positions, as if it were swinging. He theorizes 
something is cinching the sasquatch costume in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy made a clay model of the object and in October gave that  
and the enlargements to Crook, a charter-bus driver transfixed by 
sasquatch stories since 1957. That's the year he made a camping 
trip with teen-age friends on Washington's Olympic Peninsula that 
ended with telltale signs of a sasquatch encounter: a rustling of 
brush, a throaty growl and an ever-worsening hallmark musk. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, at 58, spare rooms in his home are dubbed  
``Bigfoot Central,'' stuffed with photos, plaster casts and maps 
dotted with push-pins that chart sasquatch sightings. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his hoax assertion is giving rise to a howl that would make  
a Bigfoot proud. Longtime enthusiasts smell a deserter. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent e-mail was typical of the incredulity Crook's  
allegation of a costume fastener is up against. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cliff, Cliff, Cliff,'' it scolded. ``That's matted feces.''  
</P>
<P>
	``There are two witnesses (and) there are footprints,'' said  
Rene Dahinden, a Richmond, British Columbia, researcher who shares 
the film's copyright. ``We've never had anything like it 
previously, and anything like it since.''

	Dahinden, 68, discounts Murphy as an amateur. ``He wasn't  
involved in this until 1993,'' Dahinden said. ``He couldn't spell 
the name `sasquatch' before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grover Krantz, a Washington State University anthropology  
professor and Bigfoot expert, also believes firmly in the old 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully accept the Patterson film,'' Krantz said. ``If there  
was a fastener, it could not be seen in an enlargement. The film 
grain is such that it cannot hold an image of something that 
small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truth of the Patterson-Gimlin film remains as elusive as  
Bigfoot itself. Enthusiasts such as Krantz and Crowe see the film 
as a building block for their faith. And the faiths of Crook and 
Murphy endure in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Crook knows that, in dissent, he and Murphy are ``far  
outnumbered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a few broken friendships because of this,'' Crook  
said. ``I just figured, `This is a search for the truth. When it 
becomes something different, that's when it should stop.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe a Bigfoot will one day view the film, Crook figures, and  
offer its own disapproving grunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just too much evidence that these creatures do inhabit  
certain areas out there,'' Crook said, ever sanguine. ``Even though 
the Patterson film is a hoax, it doesn't mean Bigfoot doesn't 
exist.''

	Witness Issue Hangs Over Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testimony from witnesses is crucial to  
conducting the impeachment trial of President Clinton, several 
Republican senators who will sit as jurors said on Sunday. 
Countering, Democrats argued that testimony could prolong the trial 
and end current bipartisan harmony. House Republicans, who will act 
as prosecutors in the trial, are also pressing for the right to 
call witnesses, chiefly Monica Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern with whom Clinton admitted to having an extramarital affair.

	Report: Charge Minor in Diana Death  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British newspapers are reporting that no major  
charges will be filed in the Paris automobile crash that killed 
Princess Diana in August 1997, but a spokeswoman for Diana's 
brother said Sunday the family had received no word of the French 
investigation's results. The Sunday Mirror tabloid reported that a 
judge in Paris has decided that no manslaughter charges will be 
filed in the crash that also killed Diana's companion, Dodi Fayed. 
The Mirror, saying it had obtained parts of the investigation 
report, said that only minor charges would be filed, against three 
paparazzi from whom Diana's car had been fleeing.

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Saudi Arabia and Egypt on Sunday issued the  
first direct call by Arab governments for Saddam's Hussein's 
ouster, a few days after the Iraqi president exhorted Arabs to rise 
up against rulers ``who boast of friendship with the United 
States.'' In a commentary, the official Saudi Press Agency accused 
Saddam in the deaths of thousands of his own people. Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that Saddam is ``shaming the

	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG plans to invest $55 billion to  
$60 billion in research and development over the next three years 
as it seeks to lead the auto industry in technological innovation, 
co-chairman Juergen Schrempp said Sunday. Schrempp's comments came 
during the opening session of the Automotive News World Congress, 
an annual gathering of auto executives that coincides with the 
start of the North American International Auto Show. In 1998, 
Daimler and Chrysler together spent $16.5 billion on research and

	GOP Wants Witnesses at Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton is  
stirring strategists from both political parties, with Republicans 
pressing to hear testimony from witnesses, while the White House is 
taking the measure of public opinion and urging an early dismissal. 
In addition to Monica Lewinsky, Republicans want to call Clinton's 
personal secretary Betty Currie, his friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. Democrats said testimony could 
unnecessarily prolong the trial and end the current bipartisan 
harmony. 

</P>

	Gov't Surplus Eyed For Retirement  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's advisers are considering  
how to use government surpluses to help Americans build new 
retirement savings accounts to supplement Social Security. The idea 
of supplemental accounts surfaced at a meeting last week. The 
accounts wouldn't directly address the cash shortfall expected to 
face Social Security as the nation's huge baby boom generation 
retires. But they could help Americans be better prepared for 
retirement. They also have bipartisan backing.

	Inmates' Prison Time Lengthens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prisoners are spending more time behind bars  
as states enact laws to narrow the gap between sentences handed 
down and the time offenders actually serve, the government said 
today. Violent offenders released in 1997 spent an average of 49 
months in prison, up from 43 months in 1993, a study by the Justice 
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed. On average, 
violent offenders freed in 1997 had served 54 percent of their 
sentences. In 1993, they had served 47 percent.

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's foreign minister is accusing Saudi  
Arabia and Kuwait of actively supporting last month's US-British 
airstrikes. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's official news agency today 
urged Iraqis to overthrow President Saddam Hussein, saying he had 
killed and tortured thousands of his own people. Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Amr Moussa echoed that unprecedented appeal. The Saudi and 
Egyptian statements are the first direct call by Arab governments 
for Saddam's ouster.

	Amnesty Seeks Ban on Child Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The international community lacks the political  
will to take a first step toward banning child soldiers by 2000, 
according to Amnesty International. The human rights group released 
a report today supporting a campaign to raise the minimum age for 
military recruiting to 18, instead of 15 as specified in the U.N. 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The release coincides with a 
meeting of the working group of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva, which is deliberating whether to recomend seting the higher 
age.

	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices continued to drop at

taxes, falling to $1.03 per gallon on Friday. That was down about a 
half-cent over the past three weeks, according to the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. The lows come thanks to an 
oil glut compounded by lowered demand from economies hit by 
financial crises.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Wins Disney Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Santiago de Araujo of Brazil  
pulled away from Chris Teague in the late stages to win the Walt 
Disney World Marathon for the second straight time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Araujo finished seven seconds ahead of Teague in 2 hours, 24  
minutes, 29 seconds. His time was 1:04 slower than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Araujo took a big lead over Teague in the 22nd mile of the  
26.2-mile race, near the Tower of Terror ride at Walt Disney World. 
The race passed through the resort's four theme parks, including 
Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the time I knew he was behind me and close because I was  
looking behind and watching,'' Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Teague's marathon debut. He held back early before  
coming on strong at the 12th mile and moving into second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last four miles were tough,'' said Teague, of North  
Chelmsford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Jones of Margarita, Calif., who will be 47 next month,  
was the women's winner in 2:54:21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being 46, there's still hope for me,'' Jones said. ``I said  
(before the race) it would be neat if I could do this for older 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Fagen of Apopka, Fla., the leader for 22 miles before  
Jones passed her, finished second at 2:55:20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept focusing on her,'' said Jones, the runner-up last year.  
``I didn't want to be a bridesmaid this year.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Official Denies Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Insisting he bribed no one and did nothing  
wrong, Tom Welch contends his organization acted responsibly in its 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, is accused of bribing IOC officials in the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News reported Sunday that Welch acknowledged cash  
payments and gifts to IOC members, but called them contributions to 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never bribed anybody. We never bought a vote,'' Welch said.  
``We made contributions out there as a part of the Olympic family, 
as an obligation we have. ... It was the responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch admitted giving $50,000 cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC  
member from the Republic of Congo. Ganga sought the money to help 
children in the African nation ravaged by civil strife, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I think the money went,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged the bid committee made a $10,000  
contribution to the campaign of Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander 
Fantini, who was running for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch did not immediately return telephone messages Sunday left  
by The Associated Press at his Park City home. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in  
1997 after being charged with spousal abuse, said he will challenge 
the right of the committee to cancel his $10,000-per-month 
consulting contract. The committee also stripped him of his 
$500,000 pension. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it was revoking the contract Friday, the same  
day senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign and 
President Frank Joklik said he was quitting for the good of the 
Games. Joklik will remain at his job until a replacement is found, 
possibly for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson are the only Salt Lake Olympic boosters being  
blamed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations -- by the Justice Department, the IOC, the  
U.S. Olympic Committee and a Salt Lake ethics panel -- are under way 
into accusations some IOC members accepted lavish gifts and money 
from Salt Lake boosters. The IOC voted for Salt Lake in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Saturday that Ganga received more  
than $70,000. Welch discussed only the $50,000 payment to Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch told the newspaper that Joklik and other bid committee  
board members knew about the gifts and payments to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew everything we were going to do,'' he said. ``I never  
did anything I am embarrassed about, or that I felt was wrong or 
that I felt was hidden or not disclosed to (Joklik) and the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Joklik, who was chairman of the bid board, and the board  
reviewed detailed annual budgets that were purposely not made 
public so competing cities would not match the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as keeping it secret or hiding it? No way,'' Welch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch also denied a rumor being investigated by the outside  
ethics panel for the SLOC that prostitutes were hired for IOC 
members visiting Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm offended to the core ... at some of the wild allegations,  
like the escort services and that type of thing, which is not 
true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said he secured medical care for Ganga when he was sick  
with hepatitis and Ganga's mother when she had an infected knee. It 
was previously reported that Salt Lake hospitals gave IOC members 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never hesitated. Was that wrong? I'd do it again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Utah Democratic lawmakers called for the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee to publicly disclose all financial records, 
especially credit-card receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	And The Salt Lake Tribune reported that, contrary to the 2002  
Winter Games' billing as a privately funded event, public money has 
long supported the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City donated $156,960 to the bid effort from 1990  
through 1995, the newspaper reported. The bid committee's tax 
returns showed government grants of only $102,500 in those years, a 
difference that's expected to be scrutinized by the Justice 
Department for possible tax crimes.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Smith, Hoard Set Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Robert Smith is the speedy runner with the  
long, graceful stride. Leroy Hoard is the strongman who steamrolls 
defenders with little finesse. 
</P>
<P>
	Both took home a postseason record for the Minnesota Vikings on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith ran for 124 yards and Hoard scored three touchdowns -- both  
Vikings playoff records -- as they crushed Arizona 41-21 to advance 
to the NFC championship game next Sunday at the Metrodome against 
the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it helps when you're always on the 1-yard line and  
you're the short yardage back,'' said Hoard, who scored the first 
touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run. He later added scores on a 
16-yard pass from Randall Cunningham and on a 6-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ask me to go in when the ball is inside the 10, so that  
automatically puts me in a good position to score,'' he said. 
``That's my job on this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard, who gained 44 yards on 11 carries, became the first  
Vikings player to score three touchdowns in a playoff game. He also 
became the first Minnesota player to have both a rushing and a 
receiving touchdown in a postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor when you think about who has played here,'' he  
said. ``Running backs like Chuck Foreman and Dave Osborne and 
receivers like Cris Carter and Ahmad Rashad. Those are all great 
names in Vikings history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who broke Foreman's playoff record of 118 yards set in  
1976 against the Los Angeles Rams, carried 19 times and averaged 
6.5 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know our roles,'' Smith said. ``Leroy doesn't get upset  
with me for getting most of the yards and the carries, and I don't 
get upset when he scores touchdowns. I just don't care who scores 
the touchdowns as long as we win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith gained 1,187 yards during the regular season and scored  
eight touchdowns, while Hoard had 479 yards and 10 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both, Hoard says, are happy when the other does well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We joke about it,'' Hoard said. ``He'll run 70 yards to the  
10- or 5-yard line and then I get to go in and score the 
touchdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is known for his ability to break long gainers. Hoard, at  
225 pounds, is more of a grinder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're as different as two backs can be,'' Smith said. ``I'm  
6-2 and can hurt you with speed. He's what, 5-2 or 5-3? He comes in 
and pounds it. The bottom line is, we're both effective and we both 
help win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard laughed when told of Smith's assessment of the two  
players' running styles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could run like Robert,'' Hoard said. ``I fight for 4  
or 5 or 6 yards and then he comes back in and stretches it out. I'm 
just in there to give him a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoard was asked if he has ever played for a better offensive  
team than the 1998 Vikings, which set the NFL record with 556 
points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody in this room can say that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota piled up 416 net yards against the Cardinals, 188 on  
the ground, and didn't have to rely on the famed passing game built 
around Cunningham, Carter and super rookie Randy Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	At 16-1, the Vikings are a balanced, potent offensve with no  
apparent weakness. But Hoard issued a word of caution about talk 
that the Vikings appear unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody can be stopped,'' he said. ``A couple weeks ago they  
said Denver couldn't be stopped, and Terrell Davis had 29 yards 
rushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Hoard smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm glad I'm not the one who has to figure out a way to  
stop this team.''

<HEADLINE> Vegetarians Plan Carnivore Converts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- Vegetarians from around the world  
pledged Sunday to convert millions of meat-eaters by the end of the 
century and launched an Asian Vegetarian Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bangkok-based Asian group seeks to foster the  
still-fledgling vegetarian movements in many Asian countries and 
counter a trend among the continent's youth to ape Western 
carnivorous habits. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 participants from 30 countries at the 33rd World  
Vegetarian Congress concluding Sunday called on vegetarian groups 
all over the world to invite people to give up meat for the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	A mass pledge-taking ceremony is planned at midnight, Dec. 31.  
</P>
<P>
	The congress set a goal of converting at least 5 percent of the  
population in areas where vegetarian societies exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from being a matter of compassion, it is in humankind's  
interest to adopt a vegetarian diet if we are to avoid starvation, 
disease, pollution and ecological damage on a vast scale,'' said 
one congress official, Nitin Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates to the meeting of the 110-year-old International  
Vegetarian Union included doctors, nutrition experts, Indian 
religious gurus, Western stock brokers and animal-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions ranged from the latest studies on ways to treat AIDS  
with herbs and a plant-based diet to how the meat industry 
continues to deplete water supplies and convert forest areas into 
grazing lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still live in a non-vegetarian world. In a way, vegetarians  
are aliens, like Martians,'' said Maxwell G. Lee, the union's 
deputy president, a vegetarian since the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee and others agreed that vegetarianism has grown rapidly in  
North America and Europe, with most converts giving up meat for 
health rather than ethical or environmental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But affluence and the copying of mainstream Western ways have  
increased meat consumption in Asia, especially among the young. 
Delegates from China, India and Japan, where a long tradition of 
vegetarianism exists, said ways have to be found to counter the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Vegetarian Union selected an ad hoc committee to draw  
up a constitution and organize the first congress in two years'

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsor Nixes $6.3M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American oil company Texaco-Caltex has  
pulled out of a $6.3 million Olympic sponsorship deal, leaving 
Games organizers with a possible revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic  
Games (SOCOG) said Monday it was disappointing that the company had 
withdrawn a memorandum of understanding that set up the sponsorship 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have been a boost to SOCOG's 1999 sponsorship  
drive, which must raise $126 million by the end of the year to 
achieve its budget target. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco-Caltex pulled out after 12 months of negotiations, saying  
it had already signed up as a major sponsor of the U.S. Olympic 
team and as a major partner for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG spokesman Milton Cockburn said officials were disappointed  
the potential sponsorship fell through because of changed financial 
circumstances within Texaco-Caltex. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed, however it's not a crucial development in  
terms of SOCOG's task in raising additional sponsorship revenue,'' 
Cockburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Olympics Minister Michael Knight, who is also  
SOCOG president, said Knight was confident SOCOG would raise 
additional sponsorship by the end of this year.

	GOP Wants Impeachment Witnesses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Republican senators, who along with their  
Democrat counterparts will determine President Clinton's fate, said 
today that testimony from witnesses in the impeachment trial is 
crucial to their deliberations. Democrats said testimony could 
unnecessarily prolong the trial. House Republicans who will act as 
prosecutors in the trial are also pressing for the right to call 
witnesses, chiefly Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern 
with whom Clinton admitted an extramarital affair. Rep. Lindsey 
Graham, R-S.C., said prosecutors could call six or seven witnesses 
and still finish their case by the middle of February. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Unveil Open Spaces Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose  
dramatic increases in spending to preserve open spaces by expanding 
federal land purchases while giving millions of dollars to states 
for urban parks and land conservation. The package would call for 
spending between $900 million and $1.5 billion a year in 
open-spaces initiatives. The plan includes grants to states for 
building parks, and a package of tax incentives for preserving 
farmland, suburban green spaces and parkland.

	Envoys Try To Free Yugo Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Monitors in Kosovo today  
tried to avert a military showdown by urging ethnic Albanian rebels 
to free eight Yugoslav soldiers held captive in a northern village. 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana appealed for the soldiers' 
release and called on both sides to show restraint. International 
officials fear an escalation of violence could destroy the 
cease-fire that halted more than seven months of fighting in 
Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian-majority province of Serbia, 
Yugoslavia's dominant republic.

	Netanyahu: Arafat Won't Make Border  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today  
told his Cabinet that the Palestinians will not be allowed to 
determine Israel's borders. A senior Palestinian official, 
meanwhile, insisted Palestinians would achieve an independent state 
with Jerusalem as its capital -- something Israel has vowed never to 
allow.

	AP Journalists Shot in Sierra Leone  
</P>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Two journalists for The Associated  
Press were shot today while covering the civil war in Sierra Leone, 
where insurgent fighters have seized partial control of the 
capital. The two were among a group of journalists and officials of 
the government's Information Ministry who were traveling in four 
cars through embattled downtown Freetown. The journalists' names 
are being withheld until family members can be informed.

	Reno To Be Second in Service Time  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Reno, who has presided over a dramatic  
decline in youth violence and weathered controversy for refusing to 
seek an independent counsel to investigate campaign financing, 
tomorrow will become the nation's second-longest-serving attorney 
general. Reno today tied the 5-year, 10-month tenure of Homer 
Cummings, President Franklin Roosevelt's first attorney general. A 
former state prosecutor in Miami, Reno was sworn in as attorney 
general March 12, 1993.

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian automaker Fiat is in talks with Sweden's  
Volvo and several other carmakers to explore possible alliances, 
the chairman of IFIL SpA was quoted as saying in a number of 
Italian dailies today. Analysts say Volvo needs an alliance to 
support its stock price.

	IOC To Interview Bribe Suspects  
</P>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC intends next week to begin  
questioning those members suspected of selling votes in Salt Lake 
City's successful Olympic bid, a Swiss newspaper reported today. 
Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee, and 
vice president David Johnson resigned Friday after disclosures of 
cash payments to IOC members and other misdeeds.

	Jets 34, Jaguars 24  
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Jets today reached  
their first AFC Championship game since 1982 with a 34-24 victory 
over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson ran 
for a touchdown, caught a touchdown, recovered a fumble and even 
had an interception. It was the Jets' first home playoff game since 
1986. They will play at Denver next Sunday for the right to go the 
Super Bowl for the first time since 1969.

<HEADLINE>  Dutch Pair Win Skating Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) -- The Dutch duo of Rintje Ritsma  
and Tonny de Jong won the men's and women's all-round titles at the 
European Speedskating Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a record fifth title for Ritsma, who went into Sunday's  
10,000 meters with a 29.78-second lead over Germany's Christian 
Breuer, and relaxed in the race, finishing ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10,000 was won by Belgium's Bart Veldkamp in 13 minutes,  
29.81 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Ritsma won the 500 and 1,500 and was third in the  
5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, De Jong's third-place time of 7:07.44 in the 5,000  
kept her .95 seconds ahead of defending champion Claudia Pechstein 
of Germany in the women's competition. De Jong also won the 
European title in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Pechstein was second in the 5,000 at 7:06.09 and second overall.  
</P>
<P>
	Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany, who holds a record seven  
all-round European titles, won the 5,000 in 7:03.35 for her second 
distance title of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Niemann-Stirnemann was only fourth overall after losing too  
much time in the sprints to De Jong and another Dutchwoman, 
Annamarie Thomas, who was sixth in the 5,000 and third overall.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Impeachment Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Republican senators who will sit as  
jurors to decide whether to remove President Clinton from office 
said Sunday that testimony from witnesses is crucial to their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said testimony could unnecessarily prolong the trial  
and end the current bipartisan harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	And House Republicans among the 13 who will prosecute the two  
articles of impeachment facing Clinton pressed for the right to 
call witnesses. They put Monica Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern whose affair with Clinton triggered the case, at the top of 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
	She's the key witness, said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``She ought to be the one to present the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A carefully crafted compromise on how the trial will proceed,  
which Senate Republicans and Democrats worked out last week, put 
off the witnesses question. Under the plan, the Senate will vote on 
whether to allow specific witnesses only after House prosecutors 
and the White House present their arguments and senators have a 
chance to ask questions. That's about two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on 
ABC. If the House prosecutors say they need live testimony, ``It's 
going to be pretty hard for senators to vote against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I can make a decision,'' said Sen. Susan  
Collins, R-Maine, on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``without hearing from 
someone firsthand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors say they want to call Lewinsky, Clinton's  
personal secretary Betty Currie, his friend Vernon Jordan, White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal and possibly other, unidentified women 
who have claimed that Clinton made sexual advances in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he and his prosecutor  
colleagues could call six or seven witnesses and still finish their 
case by the middle of February. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine reported in its edition on newsstands Monday  
that the House prosecutors have promised not to ask Ms. Lewinsky 
details about her sexual encounters with Clinton. Another of the 
prosecutors, Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition'' that Ms. Lewinsky could be questioned ``without dealing 
with any of the salacious material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers would have the right to seek their own  
witnesses. But White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Sunday they 
still hope that after hearing opening presentations the Senate will 
vote to dismiss the impeachment charges on the grounds they do are 
not grave enough to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., warned that the witness problem could  
destroy the fragile mood of cooperation. ``We are in a bipartisan 
mode for the opening kickoff, halftime is questionable and if we go 
into overtime, all bets are off,'' Breaux said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, on CBS'  
``Face the Nation,'' said he doesn't think Ms. Lewinsky ``can add 
one iota of additional information.'' He said the hope is to 
conclude the trial in a couple of weeks, but ``clearly if witnesses 
are agreed to, this is going to take a lot longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise provides for a motion to dismiss the charges  
after the initial presentations, but Sen. John Chafee, a Republican 
moderate from Rhode Island whose vote the Democrats would need to 
accomplish that, said it won't pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we want to hear this case out, and I think I'd be  
surprised if a motion to dismiss at that early stage prevailed,'' 
he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Chafee said he would not 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to  
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which would require a 
two-thirds majority, or 67 of the 100 senators. A motion to dismiss 
would need 51 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The next stage of the trial is Monday, when the House and the  
White House must file motions. On Thursday the House prosecutors 
begin what could be up to 24 hours of prosecution -- Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that they wouldn't 
need that much time -- and then the White House would get 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared certain the trial will be in progress on Jan. 19,  
when Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address 
in Congress. Most Republicans, and a few Democrats, said Sunday he 
should either postpone the speech or submit it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio said on NBC that a Clinton speech  
during the trial is ``clearly going to be awkward.'' Democrat 
Dianne Feinstein of California said that, after spending a day at 
the trial, ``It is almost schizophrenic then to turn around and go 
that evening into a State of the Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her fellow California Democrat, Sen. Barbara Boxer, whose  
daughter is married to a brother of first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, said that while it may be uncomfortable, ``The people 
deserve to hear from their president. I hope he will go on and do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Kennedy said Clinton plans to deliver the  
speech. ``We have no intention of being diverted from that,'' 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he and Sen. Paul Wellstone,  
D-Minn., will introduce a motion to open to the public Senate 
debates on how to proceed with the trial, which under current rules 
will be closed. ``The best political disinfectant is sunshine,'' 
Harkin said on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who chairs the Senate Rules  
Committee, said on CNN that is unlikely to happen. ``We are much 
better able to relate to each other and deal with each other and 
reach compromises when we are not under the glare of the camera,'' 
McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Jon Stewart Debuts on 'Daily Show' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Jon Stewart got an offer to host ``The  
Daily Show,'' he almost turned it down -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Comedy Central program was conceived in 1996, Stewart  
turned down the job and former ESPN sportscaster Craig Kilborn got 
the job instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But when network executives recently called looking for someone  
to replace Kilborn, Stewart took the job, albeit a little 
reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't looking for anything to sink my teeth into,'' he told  
Newsday in Sunday's editions. ``I was looking just more for a 
hammock, some place to lie down and rest and go back to the normal 
gentle buzzing in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 36, begins anchoring the show Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The comedian got his first big break as the host of an MTV talk  
show in 1993. The next year, he moved on to a late night syndicated 
show that was canceled after one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been a guest on other talk shows and appeared  
in movies, including ``The Faculty,'' now in theaters.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Falcons Look To Erase Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons are doing their best to erase  
32 years of misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons removed from a 3-13 season and trying desperately to  
shake their sorry past, the Falcons find themselves in the NFC 
championship game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, there's the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	``We dreamed about it a lot, but we were not sure it was a  
reachable goal,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said after Atlanta 
defeated San Francisco 20-18 in a divisional playoff Saturday. 
``It's been a season of modifying goals all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History is being modified, too. The Falcons have long been  
considered one of the league's worst franchises, plagued by bad 
trades (Brett Favre began his career in Atlanta), bad drafts 
(Aundray Bruce was the No. 1 overall pick in 1988) and bad hirings 
(Remember Norb Hecker? He was the team's first coach). 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had seven winning records in their first 32 seasons,  
making the playoffs a mere five times. Before Saturday, they had 
only two postseason victories -- the last coming in 1991 -- and never 
survived past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the 1997 season, the Falcons stripped themselves  
of their losing legacy. Since then, they have won 21 of 25 games, 
including a 15-2 record this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Sunday, Atlanta will play for a trip to the Jan. 31 Super  
Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fun is just starting around here,'' tight end O.J.  
Santiago said. ``When you're 14-2, you expect to win the first 
playoff game. The real test will come next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' latest victory followed a familiar pattern. They  
controlled the clock for more than 32 minutes with their 
sledgehammer of a running back, Jamal Anderson, who carried 29 
times for 113 yards and two touchdowns. Chandler threw sparingly 
but effectively (13 of 19 for 169 yards), freezing the 
Anderson-conscious 49ers with play-action passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the ball-hawking defense, a major reason the  
Falcons led the league with a plus-20 turnover margin. Atlanta 
intercepted three of Steve Young's passes and appeared to return a 
fumble for a touchdown, only to have the officials call the play 
back on a disputed decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say enough about the defense,'' said Falcons coach  
Dan Reeves, on the sideline for the first time since quadruple 
bypass surgery Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1991, the NFC's dominant trio -- San  
Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas -- won't be represented in the 
championship game. For the 49ers, that makes this season a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's Super Bowl or bust because that's how you get  
there,'' Young said. ``You can tell by this locker room that 
there's somewhat of a train-wrecked feeling. I don't think there's 
anyone in here that didn't think we were going to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After jumping to a 14-0 lead on Anderson's scoring runs of 2 and  
34 yards, the Falcons appeared to blow the game open when defensive 
end Chuck Smith picked up a loose ball and rambled to the end zone 
late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The play began when Terry Kirby dropped a lateral pass from  
Young, prompting a confused scramble on the Georgia Dome turf 
between Kirby and Henri Crockett. The ball popped into Smith's 
arms, but the officials ruled Kirby briefly had possession and was 
touched by Crockett while his knee was down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers took advantage of the call to score a touchdown and  
field goal in the final 1:10 of the half, going to the locker room 
with a 14-10 deficit instead of 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Falcons might have folded. The new Falcons stopped two  
San Francisco drives with interceptions, leading to field goals by 
Morten Andersen, then survived a late TD run by Young, whose final 
pass was William White's second interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``At halftime, (Reeves) told us we couldn't control what  
happened in the first half, so just go back out there and keep 
pounding and pounding,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves kept his notorious temper in check, and a team physician  
was always close by. During kickoffs and punt returns, Reeves stood 
about 15 yards back from the sideline, and he occasionally wandered 
as far as 65 yards away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to have him back, even if he was just his  
semi-self,'' Mathis said. ``He's the leader, and we follow him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right to the NFC championship game.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Be Second in Service Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Reno, who has presided over a dramatic  
decline in youth violence and weathered controversy for refusing to 
seek an independent counsel to investigate campaign financing, has 
become the nation's second-longest-serving attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she is neither an old friend nor a confidante of  
President Clinton, who nominated her after two earlier choices 
withdrew in controversy, Reno tied the 5-year, 10-month tenure of 
Homer Cummings on Sunday. On her arrival at work Monday, she is 
alone in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	A former state prosecutor in Miami, Reno was sworn in as  
attorney general March 12, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	By passing Cummings, President Franklin Roosevelt's first  
attorney general, Reno also became the longest-serving holder of 
the Cabinet post this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 78 attorneys general in the nation's history, Reno has  
held the post longer than anyone except William Wirt. Nominated by 
President James Monroe and kept on by President John Quincy Adams, 
Wirt served 11 years, 3 months beginning in November 1817. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was typically unimpressed by her milestone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you judge people by how long they are here but  
by what they do,'' she said when asked about her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	A 9-year explosion in teenage gun murders, driven by crack  
cocaine gangs, peaked in 1993 and has been in decline ever since. 
Academic experts credit Reno with playing a role in this, because 
she has tirelessly traveled the nation appealing for more attention 
to youth crime and more resources for after-school supervision and 
activities for young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reno deserves credit for firmly planting the idea in the minds  
of Americans that they have to respond to youth violence,'' said 
professor Jack Levin, who directs the Program for the Study of 
Violence at Northeastern University in Boston. The result has been 
an explosion of local programs devised by both officials and 
private groups to help young people thought to be in danger of 
falling into crime. 
</P>
<P>
	And such efforts of hers continue to gain momentum. Clinton  
announced Thursday that his next budget will propose tripling funds 
for after-school programs, to $600 million. And the new Republican 
leader in the House, Rep. Dennis Hastert, a former history teacher, 
devoted his first public appearance since becoming speaker on 
Wednesday to events in Chicago and Elgin, Ill., to announce a $2.5

	Reno has been undeterred by demands from some Republicans that  
she resign for refusing repeatedly over the last two years to have 
an independent counsel named to take over her department's 
investigation of campaign financing in the 1996 election. The 
Justice Department task force has charged 15 people, including 
prominent Democratic contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Reno has approved seven independent counsels to  
investigate 10 different matters involving Clinton himself and 
other top administration officials -- more independent counsels than 
any other attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	That record has occasionally frosted her relationship with some  
top White House aides. But when asked about her future, Reno always 
says she's willing to stay as long as Clinton will have her. And he 
hasn't asked her to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old attorney general appears to enjoy the job  
thoroughly, regularly working more than 10-hour days, usually six 
or seven days a week. Unmarried, living in an apartment near the 
Justice Department, Reno's favorite off-duty pastimes are hiking 
and canoeing along the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has the mildest form of Parkinson's disease. Her only  
symptom is a tremor in her left hand, and her doctors say there is 
no reason the disease should shorten her term of office.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Announces Promotions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has promoted three  
executives, including one who is apparently being groomed to 
succeed chief executive David Glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Soderquist, 64, previously the company's vice chairman and  
chief operating officer, was named senior vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	H. Lee Scott, 49, will fill Soderquist's previous position, and  
Thomas Coughlin, 49, who was chief operating officer of the 
Wal-Mart Stores Division, was promoted to succeed Scott as 
president of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say the promotions of Scott and Coughlin send a  
message that they are the heirs apparent to Glass and Soderquist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this clearly indicates that Lee has a good chance to  
be the successor to David Glass,'' Jay Allen, a Wal-Mart spokesman, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts saw the promotions as rewards for two of the executives  
most responsible for re-energizing Wal-Mart's earnings and revenue 
growth in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott has helped Wal-Mart return to the position it likes to be  
in -- increasing profits faster than sales, said Daniel Barry, 
senior retailing analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, a native of Baxter Springs, Kan., will oversee all three  
major divisions: Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Club and the international 
division.

<HEADLINE>  Soaring Falcons Look To Erase Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons are doing their best to erase  
32 years of misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two seasons removed from a 3-13 season and trying desperately to  
shake their sorry past, the Falcons find themselves in the NFC 
championship game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, there's the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	``We dreamed about it a lot, but we were not sure it was a  
reachable goal,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said after Atlanta 
defeated San Francisco 20-18 in a divisional playoff Saturday. 
``It's been a season of modifying goals all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History is being modified, too. The Falcons have long been  
considered one of the league's worst franchises, plagued by bad 
trades (Brett Favre began his career in Atlanta), bad drafts 
(Aundray Bruce was the No. 1 overall pick in 1988) and bad hirings 
(Remember Norb Hecker? He was the team's first coach). 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had seven winning records in their first 32 seasons,  
making the playoffs a mere five times. Before Saturday, they had 
only two postseason victories -- the last coming in 1991 -- and never 
survived past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, at the midway point of 1997, the Falcons stripped  
themselves of their losing legacy. Since then, they have won 21 of 
25 games -- including a 15-2 record this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Sunday, Atlanta will play at Minnesota for a trip to the  
Jan. 31 Super Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fun is just starting around here,'' tight end O.J.  
Santiago said. ``When you're 14-2, you expect to win the first 
playoff game. The real test will come next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' latest victory followed a familiar pattern. They  
controlled the clock for more than 32 minutes with their 
sledgehammer of a running back, Jamal Anderson, who carried 29 
times for 113 yards and two touchdowns. Chandler threw sparingly 
but effectively (13-of-19 for 169 yards), freezing the 
Anderson-conscious 49ers with play-action passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the ball-hawking defense, a major reason the  
Falcons led the league with a plus-20 turnover margin. Atlanta 
intercepted three of Steve Young's passes and appeared to return a 
fumble for a touchdown, only to have the officials call the play 
back on a disputed decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say enough about the defense,'' said Falcons coach  
Dan Reeves, back on the sideline for the first time since heart 
bypass surgery on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1991, the NFC's dominant trio -- San  
Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas -- won't be represented in the 
championship game. For the 49ers, that makes this season a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's Super Bowl or bust, because that's how you get  
there,'' Young said. ``You can tell by this locker room that 
there's somewhat of a train-wrecked feeling. I don't think there's 
anyone in here that didn't think we were going to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After jumping to a 14-0 lead on Anderson's scoring runs of 2 and  
34 yards, the Falcons appeared to blow the game open when defensive 
end Chuck Smith picked up a loose ball and rambled to the end zone 
late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The play began when Terry Kirby dropped a lateral pass from  
Young, prompting a confused scramble on the Georgia Dome turf 
between Kirby and Henri Crockett. The ball popped into Smith's 
arms, but the officials ruled Kirby briefly had possession and was 
touched by Crockett while his knee was down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers took advantage of the call to score a touchdown and  
field goal in the final 1:10 of the half, going to the locker room 
with a 14-10 deficit instead of 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Falcons might have folded. The new Falcons stopped two  
San Francisco drives with interceptions, leading to field goals by 
Morten Andersen, then survived a late TD run by Young, whose final 
pass was William White's second interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``At halftime, (Reeves) told us we couldn't control what  
happened in the first half, so just go back out there and keep 
pounding and pounding,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons were glad to have Reeves back on the sideline,  
though the NFL coach of the year has not fully recovered from 
quadruple bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves kept his notorious temper in check, and a team physician  
was always close by. During kickoffs and punt returns, Reeves stood 
about 15 yards back from the sideline, and he occasionally wandered 
as far as 65 yards away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to have him back, even if he was just his  
semi-self,'' Mathis said. ``He's the leader, and we follow him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right to the NFC championship game.

<HEADLINE> Miami Hopes To Improve on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Jimmy Johnson was right last week when he said the  
Miami Dolphins faced almost insurmountable odds to win the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew the path to an NFL title would force his team to go on  
the road, where they stumbled repeatedly this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, the Dolphins' Super Bowl hopes evaporated into thin  
air Saturday. The Denver Broncos' 38-3 victory hammered home the 
lesson that the Dolphins must learn to win away games consistently 
before they can be considered a championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't play every game at home,'' All-Pro linebacker Zach  
Thomas said. ``I wish we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins went 8-1 at Pro Player Stadium this season and 3-6  
on the road. They allowed 11 points per game at home and 25 on the 
road. In the final two road games, Miami was outscored 76-19, and 
Saturday's loss was the most lopsided postseason defeat in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Is lack of experience the problem? The Dolphins had the  
second-youngest defense in the NFL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our young guys have been playing since they got here,  
so we can't use that as an excuse,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reasons for the road woes, they must be addressed  
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start playing on the road like we do at home,''  
Thomas said. ``We can beat anybody at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, Miami didn't beat a team with a winning record all  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	All signs Saturday pointed to a Denver victory. While the  
Dolphins are a bad road team, the Broncos are a great home team. 
The Dolphins had to contend with cool weather, playing at altitude, 
a rabid crowd and a Denver team eager to avenge its loss at Miami 
last month. The Dolphins were riddled by injuries, while the 
Broncos were well-rested after earning a first-round bye in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can write a Christmas list of excuses,'' linebacker Derrick  
Rodgers said. ``But they just played better than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson considered the bye crucial. While Denver rested during  
the first round of the playoffs, the Buffalo Bills took Miami to 
the limit before losing 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys were pretty well worn down coming out of last week,''  
Johnson said. ``Our tank was about empty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami was unable to overcome the handicap of being a wild-card  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players that you need to win enough games during  
the season to get a bye, get people healthy and get ready for an 
opponent,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't win enough games during the 
season to get that advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Johnson knows, a bye means the home-field advantage in  
the second round. That's a goal for next season.

<HEADLINE> Experiment Turns Egg Shells to Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Joe MacNeil tried just about  
everything: He pounded them, he ground them, he tried acid, bases 
and sandpaper. Still, the Penn State researcher could not solve the 
conundrum facing America's egg processors: How do you get that thin 
membrane off broken egg shells? 
</P>
<P>
	Sound like one of higher education's meaningless hypotheticals?  
Think again. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil finally has separated the shell from the membrane -- and,  
in the process, he has created two very lucrative products. His 
solution could be worth ... who knows? A whole lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you find a solution for this kind of problem and then  
find out these things are worth money,'' MacNeil said recently, 
grinning from ear to ear. ``That's the American way!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is simple. Four of 10 eggs produced in this country  
are cracked open by commercial producers. The whites and yolks are 
sold by the gallon to bakeries, hotels, fast food outfits and 
companies selling everything from cake mixes to mayonnaise to 
shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, processors break 50 million cases of eggs -- that's  
18 billion eggs -- and get rid of 120,000 tons of shells. 
</P>
<P>
	With the membrane attached, the shells are worth $20 a ton for  
chicken feed or maybe fertilizer. Most of the shells just end up 
taking space in landfills. Hauling it away costs money, about 
$100,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Scraping the membrane off the shell changes everything.  
</P>
<P>
	Egg shells are almost entirely calcium carbonate, which can be  
used in vitamin supplements, in toothpaste, in chemicals and as a 
pulp substitute by the paper industry. 
</P>
<P>
	More valuable is the membrane, which includes collagen, a  
protein used in a wide variety of medical products. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg processing companies would not just save money. They'd make  
more of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The egg shells might be worth $200 a ton. Pure collagen, used by  
researchers in the process of growing cells, can go for $1,000 per 
gram, though the chicken variety would be worth much less. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler Egg Products Inc. in Philadelphia has licensed MacNeil's  
research from Penn State. The family-owned company is studying how 
to process and market the shells and membranes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big undertaking and no one's ever done it before,''  
said Joel Cutler, chief executive officer. ``It's got huge 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collagenesis Inc. in Beverly, Mass., is one interested party.  
The fast-growing biochemical firm is researching ways the chicken 
collagen can be used in health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The membranes include the unusual Type 10 collagen, which  
prevents calcification. It could be used to make transplanted heart 
valves last longer and to treat osteoporosis. Egg membranes also 
contain the common Type 1 collagen, which could be used in 
cosmetics, plastic surgery and in sponges or powders as hemostats -- 
used in hospitals to stop bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to decide what we can do with it,'' said Dale  
DeVore, chief scientific officer for Collagenesis. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil and Penn State await approval of a patent on the  
deceivingly simple process to efficiently pull off the stubborn 
membranes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I say they're stuck together, I mean they're stuck  
together,'' said MacNeil, 67, a professor emeritus of food science. 
``I did every conceivable thing you could do and I couldn't unstick 
that thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil spent years looking at every attempt under a microscope  
in frustration -- wishing he could just use a knife. Then he 
thought, why not use thousands of knives? 
</P>
<P>
	Meat processors use a device called a comitrol, a cylinder that  
looks a little like an oil filter. On the inside are razor-sharp 
blades. MacNeil's procedure involves shooting the egg shells 
through the comitrol, producing a fluffy substance. When that's 
dumped in water, the shells fall to the bottom and the membrane 
float to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're solving an environmental problems as well as getting a  
profit,'' said Bernard Wentworth, a professor of poultry science at 
the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who was not involved in the 
research. ``It makes sense.''

	The old Falcons might have folded. The new Falcons stopped two  
San Francisco drives with interceptions, leading to field goals by 
Morten Andersen, then survived a late TD run by Young, whose final 
pass was William White's second interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``At halftime, (Reeves) told us we couldn't control what  
happened in the first half, so just go back out there and keep 
pounding and pounding,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves kept his notorious temper in check, and a team physician  
was always close by. During kickoffs and punt returns, Reeves stood 
about 15 yards back from the sideline, and he occasionally wandered 
as far as 65 yards away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to have him back, even if he was just his  
semi-self,'' Mathis said. ``He's the leader, and we follow him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right to the NFC championship game.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Impeachment Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impeachment trial of President Clinton  
stirred strategists from both political parties Sunday, with 
Republicans pressing to hear testimony from Monica Lewinsky and 
other witnesses, and the White House taking the measure of public 
opinion and urging an early dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''  
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. If 
House prosecutors say they need live testimony, ``It's going to be 
pretty hard for senators to vote against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., warned that the witness problem could  
destroy the Senate's fragile mood of cooperation. ``We are in a 
bipartisan mode for the opening kickoff, halftime is questionable 
and if we go into overtime, all bets are off,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats said testimony could unnecessarily prolong the  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Clinton plans  
to deliver the State of the Union speech as scheduled Jan. 19, even 
though the trial will be underway. ``We have no intention of being 
diverted from addressing the issues that are important to the 
country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans among the 13 who will prosecute the two  
articles of impeachment facing Clinton pressed for the right to 
call witnesses. They put Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern whose affair with Clinton triggered the case, at the top of 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
	She's the key witness, said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``She ought to be the one to present the story.'' 
Breaux and Hatch also appeared on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	A carefully crafted compromise on how the trial will proceed,  
which Senate Republicans and Democrats worked out last week, put 
off the witnesses question. Under the plan, the Senate will vote on 
whether to allow specific witnesses only after House prosecutors 
and the White House present their arguments and senators have a 
chance to ask questions. That's about two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I can make a decision,'' said Sen. Susan  
Collins, R-Maine, on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``without hearing from 
someone firsthand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine reported in its edition on newsstands Monday  
that the House prosecutors have promised not to ask Ms. Lewinsky 
details about her sexual encounters with Clinton. Another of the 
prosecutors, Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition'' that Ms. Lewinsky could be questioned ``without dealing 
with any of the salacious material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors say they want to call Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton's  
personal secretary Betty Currie, his friend Vernon Jordan, White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal and possibly other, unidentified women 
who have claimed that Clinton made sexual advances in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he and his prosecutor  
colleagues could call six or seven witnesses and still finish their 
case by the middle of February. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers would have the right to seek their own  
witnesses. But Kennedy said Sunday they still hope that after 
hearing opening presentations the Senate will vote to dismiss the 
impeachment charges on the grounds they do are not grave enough to 
remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	A Time/CNN poll released Saturday found that 62 percent do not  
believe Clinton should be removed from office, compared to 34 
percent who believe the Senate should remove him. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,067 people was taken Thursday and had  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, on CBS'  
``Face the Nation,'' said he doesn't think Ms. Lewinsky ``can add 
one iota of additional information.'' He said the hope is to 
conclude the trial in a couple of weeks, but ``clearly if witnesses 
are agreed to, this is going to take a lot longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise provides for a motion to dismiss the charges  
after the initial presentations, but Sen. John Chafee, a Republican 
moderate from Rhode Island whose vote the Democrats would need to 
accomplish that, said it won't pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we want to hear this case out, and I think I'd be  
surprised if a motion to dismiss at that early stage prevailed,'' 
he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Chafee said he would not 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to  
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which would require a 
two-thirds majority, or 67 of the 100 senators. A motion to dismiss 
would need 51 votes and so Democrats would need some Republican 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The next stage of the trial is Monday, when the House and the  
White House must file motions. On Thursday the House prosecutors 
begin what could be up to 24 hours of prosecution -- Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that they wouldn't 
need that much time -- and then the White House would get 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared certain the trial will be in progress on Jan. 19,  
when Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address 
in Congress. Most Republicans, and a few Democrats, said Sunday he 
should either postpone the speech or submit it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio said on NBC that a Clinton speech  
during the trial is ``clearly going to be awkward.'' Democrat 
Dianne Feinstein of California said that, after spending a day at 
the trial, ``It is almost schizophrenic then to turn around and go 
that evening into a State of the Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her fellow California Democrat, Sen. Barbara Boxer, whose  
daughter is married to a brother of first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, said that while it may be uncomfortable, ``The people 
deserve to hear from their president. I hope he will go on and do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he and Sen. Paul Wellstone,  
D-Minn., will introduce a motion to open to the public Senate 
debates on how to proceed with the trial, which under current rules 
will be closed. ``The best political disinfectant is sunshine,'' 
Harkin said on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who chairs the Senate Rules  
Committee, said on CNN that is unlikely to happen. ``We are much 
better able to relate to each other and deal with each other and 
reach compromises when we are not under the glare of the camera,'' 
McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Returning Online Buys Not So Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brenda Nashawaty is one of a growing number of  
people who have bought something online, in part because of the 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to return things she bought, however, was problematic.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is easy to buy online, but is hard if you don't want  
something. That's where the convenience of the Internet breaks 
down,'' said Ms. Nashawaty, who has returned books and shoes this 
year. ``I shopped online because I don't have a lot of time, but I 
ended up wasting a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an incredible holiday season for Internet merchants, with  
sales soaring well above expectations. An estimated $3 billion was 
spent online during the holidays, nearly tripling from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Enticing many shoppers to the Internet was its convenience. With  
a computer in hand, they could buy from home, work or hotel, and 
had access to an unthinkable number of merchants. But now that 
Christmas is over, consumers are seeing that the high-tech online 
world has some low-tech glitches -- with returns topping the list. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to returning goods to many online merchants, you  
still need to phone in, wait for a representative who can give you 
a return authorization number, pack up the items and schlep to the 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Many retailers require consumers to notify them before sending  
an item back -- that involves time on the phone to get a return 
confirmation number. Most insist on a prepaid, insured delivery 
method, which means waiting on line at UPS, Federal Express or the 
post office. 
</P>
<P>
	While that is similar to catalog returns, many shoppers who were  
lured to the ease of the Internet simply didn't expect such 
hands-on hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people tried buying online this year, but they didn't  
check the return policies and now they're getting bitten,'' said 
Preston Gralla, author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online 
Shopping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many online merchants hired outsiders to run their Web sites,  
but not all handle exchanges. That means some shoppers are finding 
another unexpected inconvenience: they must first return the item 
and get a refund before purchasing something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants, like Shopping.com, will only accept the item if  
it is shipped in the packaging it came in, which means holding on 
to boxes and wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
	And many others, including Victoria's Secret and Wal-Mart, won't  
let shoppers return most goods to their brick-and-mortar stores. 
That's frustrating for shoppers who chose to buy from traditional 
retailers' Web sites because they assumed they could make returns 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no wonder the consumers are confused,'' said Jim Daniell,  
chief executive of OrderTrust, which runs the online services for 
some well-known merchants like SkyMall and Catalog City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Returns are a key element of customer service and retailers  
have to get their arms around this issue this year. It has to be 
easier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing consumers' complaints, some online retailers are  
already taking action. Amazon.com, for instance, has extended its 
holiday returns deadline until Jan. 31, instead of its usual policy 
of 30 days after purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Many others are agreeing to pay shipping for returns if a  
customer complains about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	One new Internet mall, Buyitonline.com, is going so far as to  
offer a no-hassle return policy. The site, which launches Monday 
with more than 100 small merchants, will send UPS to a shopper's 
home to pick up any unwanted item. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have consumers come to our site and everything is good  
except for the problems with the returns, then we've ruined the 
whole buying experience for them and they might not come back,'' 
said Michael Clebnik, president and chief operating officer at 
Buyitonline.com.

<HEADLINE> Russia Oil Outlook Called Gloomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's oil industry is no longer in a position  
to drive the economy forward, a top oil executive conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Russian economy has been dependent on the oil  
industry, which has provided the county with its largest source of 
foreign currency and has led to big deals with foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a drop in world oil prices last year sent Russia's  
economy reeling, ultimately contributing to the economic crisis 
that began in August, when the government effectively devalued the 
ruble and defaulted on foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantin Potapov, vice president of the Sibneft oil company,  
said Saturday that the outlook for the industry remains gloomy, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference in Omsk, about 1,400 miles east of  
Moscow, Potapov said Sibneft's output declined 4 percent in 1998 
and its refining operations were cut back by 18 percent. He also 
said the company had suspended several projects with foreign 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he saw no likelihood of stability in the industry in the  
next two years.

<HEADLINE> 'Civil Action' Scores at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The legal drama ``A Civil Action'' was No. 1  
in its first weekend of wide release but the overall box office 
suffered from cold weather and the usual post-holiday letdown, 
according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta as a vain attorney who  
wagers everything on a toxic waste case, had $14.5 million to lead 
the North American box office. It played on just two screens for 
two weeks before expanding to 1,802 locations last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It had one of the best January weekends for a movie, trailing  
only ``Titanic'' and the reissue of ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, overall grosses for the top films were off nearly 15  
percent from the same weekend last year as attendance dropped for 
``Patch Adams'' and plunged sharply for others, according to 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With two down weekends in a row now, the movie year is getting  
off to a slower start than ``Titanic''-powered 1998, which set 
records in both ticket sales and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're facing last year which had the all-time granddaddy in  
'Titanic.' We're going to pale in comparison to that,'' said Chuck 
Viane, a Walt Disney Co. distribution executive. ``But when you 
look at the depth of the movies -- 11 films did over $1 million 
Saturday -- it's very, very good for the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snowy and chilly weather in the Northeast also played a factor  
for the second straight weekend, and people returned to work and 
school after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' had $12 million for second place. The Robin  
Williams-starring story of a medical student who heals with humor 
lost 37 percent of its business in its third week to bring its 
total to $82.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The next five movies showed drop-offs between 42 percent and 49  
percent. But in eighth place, ``Shakespeare in Love'' had a 26 
percent increase with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II epic ``The Thin Red Line'' continued to do well  
in limited release, collecting $1.2 million on 61 screens for a 
per-location average of $19,672. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``A Civil Action,'' $14.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Patch Adams,'' $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Stepmom,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``You've Got Mail,'' $7.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Mighty Joe Young,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``A Bug's Life,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Faculty,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Enemy of the State,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' $3 million.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Could Learn From Cunningham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The young man will learn one day what the old  
man finally knows. The NFL is too tough a business to try and get 
it done by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look back on my career and at the mistakes I made,'' Randall  
Cunningham said Sunday, ``and I tell myself, `I don't want to make 
those mistakes anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not throw this comment at the kid on the other sideline.  
Not intentionally, anyway. But the Arizona Cardinals had better 
hope that Jake Plummer was paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't figure that a quarterback who retired himself two  
seasons ago to cut kitchen countertops would be better at 35 than 
25. More patient, absolutely. Wiser, probably. Even tougher, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cunningham is better by every measure. And after the  
Vikings' 41-21 win over the Cardinals, he is also deeper into the 
postseason than he's ever been. And a better supporting cast in 
Minnesota than he ever had in Philadelphia explains only some of 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after kickoff Sunday, the Cardinals found out what a  
few charities in the Twin Cities have been counting on for a long 
time: The only thing that consistently stops the Vikings is the 
clock. Before the game, two local charities pocketed checks for 
$556,000 and $64,000 from sponsors who pledged $100 for every 
Minnesota point and $1,000 for every touchdown scored during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	That was long before anyone in town had any idea that the backup  
quarterback with the bad reputation and Randy Moss, the rookie 
receiver with an even worse one, would turn out to be the best 
throw-and-catch act in the NFL this season. It was also one big 
reason the Cardinals headed back home to Arizona empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason was Plummer. It was an impressive feat just to  
remain vertical in the face of the Vikings' pass rush, let alone 
attempt 41 passes. But he completed only 23 to his own guys, and 
the two that went to Minnesota's Robert Griffith were quickly 
converted into scores that put the Vikings ahead 17-0 barely four 
minutes into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it was pretty much a mop-up operation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm young,'' the 24-year-old Plummer said quietly, ``but I  
don't want to keep using that as an excuse. I wanted to make a big 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, meanwhile, isn't so old or so far removed from his  
first NFL go-round that he can't recall the feeling. He was labeled 
an ``athlete'' and a ``game-breaker'' during his stint with the 
Eagles, from 1985-95, and he fit the bill of particulars. Good and 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham would juke pass rushers, outrace linebackers and  
throw it beyond the safeties -- sometimes all on the same play. 
</P>
<P>
	That made the temptation to try it on every play almost  
irresistible. But that was precisely Cunningham's problem -- he 
wanted to be the guy who did it all. Guys like Joe Montana, John 
Elway and Brett Favre do it occasionally -- and are lionized for it. 
</P>
<P>
	But anybody who plays in the NFL long enough learned at some  
point that getting deep into the postseason means making the 
high-percentage play, not relying on the spectacular one. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham didn't learn easily. He was 2-5 in the playoffs  
coming into this season, after starting only five games the 
previous season. And that after an entire year back home in Las 
Vegas working in a marble and granite business he had expected to 
spend the rest of his days building. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't want to play football -- at least until the phone calls  
from clubs desperate for a backup rolled in. So many front-liners 
were down with injuries and so few young prospects were rounding 
into form. Cunningham, despite a reputation for selfishness, was a 
hot commodity again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings knew his arm was still strong, What they were unsure  
of was whether he was more reliable than he had been. It took an 
injury to Minnesota starter Brad Johnson in the second game of the 
season to get Cunningham the opportunity to prove it -- to the club 
and himself. He did it once more Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing third-and-3 at the Arizona 40, with 6:49 left to play and  
his Vikings already ahead 34-21, Cunningham was flushed out of the 
pocket to his right. Somehow, he eluded Andre Wadsworth, rushing 
from his blindside. Then he stutter-stepped to make Simeon Rice 
miss and suddenly 10 yards of open field materialized ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Cunningham would have run or thrown the ball all the way  
up the sideline. Instead, he stopped, set his feet and arched a 
10-yard throw to Moss just behind Aeneas Williams. The play gained 
16 yards. The Vikings finished the drive with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, I used to press to make things happen, because I  
thought that's what I was supposed to do. Now, I see other guys can 
get the job done and I hand the ball off. They make 7 yards, then 
there's only 3 left to go for another shot,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a huge difference, not sitting in the pocket for that  
extra second or scrambling around the corner all the time. It wears 
you out, trying to throw the impossible touchdown every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer often finds himself in the same boat. In barely more  
than two dozen starts, he's already dug the Cardinals out of 
fourth-quarter holes nine times -- seven times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after he engineered the last one, the Cardinals handed  
Plummer a four-year, $29.7 million deal. But he won't pay the kind 
of championship dividends Cunningham delivered Sunday. Not without 
learning he can't do it by himself.

<HEADLINE> Doorman Helped Senate Beat Clock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On long-ago evenings, with midnight  
approaching and the clock running out, a white-bearded man named 
Isaac Bassett walked across the Senate chamber and turned back 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Time was easier to deal with deep in the 19th century, 12  
decades or more before the millennium bug threatened to unglue the 
computerized world of the newborn information age. 
</P>
<P>
	All Bassett had to do, after the vice president whispered an  
order in his ear, was climb atop a chair and use a long pole to 
turn back the hands of the Senate clock by 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed the chamber just enough extra time to meet its  
midnight deadline and pass the final bills appropriating money to 
run the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassett, a Senate doorman, was a bit of a time machine himself.  
He had been named a Senate page by the great Daniel Webster in 
1831. He remembered tall, slender, deep-voiced Henry Clay, the 
``Great Compromiser,'' as the greatest orator he had ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Bassett died in 1895 he had served the Senate for 64  
years and was deemed a Father Time in reverse, setting time 
backward rather than forward. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time of President Franklin Pierce in the mid-1850s, ``I  
have continued to turn back the hands of the clock at the close of 
every session,'' Bassett wrote. ``I have nothing to say whether it 
was constitutional or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure of time in even earlier days was taken from the  
clock set in the wheel of the marble chariot that carried the muse 
of history from Greek mythology over the old chamber of the House 
of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressman Abraham Lincoln stood under that clock in 1848 and  
challenged American involvement in the war with Mexico. History 
presumably recorded his words for posterity with her marble pen. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, as the 20th century neared its limit, John  
Muffler, who started working for presidents in the Truman 
administration, kept the antique clocks of the executive mansion 
oiled, well-wound and running even as Congress considered 
impeaching President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is nice point to study the right time,'' Rep. James A.  
Garfield told his journal on June 12, 1884, giving timing credit 
for success in the House and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, time has moved both fast and slow while clocks  
tick at the standard 60 seconds a minute. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Breezes in San Pasqual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Silver Charm, on pace to become racing's  
first $10 million horse, breezed to victory Sunday in the $200,000 
San Pasqual Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning a busy three-month stretch of traveling and racing,  
the newly turned 5-year-old Silver Charm seemed to have an almost 
effortless trip as he beat Malek by 1 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty Friend finished another 3 1/2 lengths back in third. Only  
five ran in the Santa Anita feature for 4-year-olds and up, with 
Musical Gambler scratched because of an ankle problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the former Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion  
racing for the first time since Nov. 7, is scheduled to make three 
more starts by late March -- the $500,000 Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream, the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap and the $4 million 
Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silver Charm, with $6,633,006 in career earnings, win  
those three races, that would leave him just some $66,000 shy of 
Cigar's career earnings record of $9,999,815. 
</P>
<P>
	The $120,000 San Pasqual winner's share vaulted Silver Charm  
over John Henry and into fourth place on the career earnings list, 
behind Alysheba in third and Skip Away in second. Skip Away retired 
last year with earnings of $9,616,360. 
</P>
<P>
	With regular rider Gary Stevens up, Silver Charm lagged behind  
early in the San Pasqual as Crafty Friend and Dramatic Gold set a 
slow pace, then began moving toward the front in the final turn of 
the 1 1-16 mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as five lengths off the lead on the backstretch, Silver  
Charm rapidly made up ground and took clear command in midstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, who finished fourth behind winner Silver Charm in the  
Dubai World Cup, came from far back in the San Pasqual but could 
not catch the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm carried high weight of 125, six more than Malek,  
and was clocked in 1:41 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent off as the 3-10 favorite, Silver Charm paid $2.60, $2.20  
and $2.10. Malek, ridden by Alex Solis, returned $2.80 and $2.10. 
The show payoff on Crafty Friend, Corey Nakatani and 116 pounds, 
was $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the first Kentucky Derby winner to race as a  
5-year-old since 1991 champion Strike The Gold, has won 12 of 20 
career starts.

	Lewinsky Testimony Sought by GOP  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors have promised not to ask  
Monica Lewinsky details about her sexual encounters with President 
Clinton should she stand as a witness before the Senate impeachment 
trial, Newsweek magazine's Monday edition reports. Rep. Christopher 
Cannon, R-Utah, said on CNN that the former White House intern 
could be questioned ``without dealing with any of the salacious 
material.'' With the trial set to resume Monday, Republicans and 
Democrats still must decide whether witness will be called at all. 
Under a carefully crafted compromise, the Senate will vote on 
whether to allow specific witnesses. Sen. John Breaux, D-La., 
warned that the witness debate could destroy the fragile mood of 
cooperation the Senate found last week.

	Neighbors Encourage Iraq Revolution  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Saudi Arabia and Egypt today issued the  
first direct call by Arab governments for Saddam's Hussein's 
ouster, a few days after the Iraqi president exhorted Arabs to rise 
up against rulers ``who boast of friendship with the United 
States.'' In a commentary, the official Saudi Press Agency accused 
Saddam in the deaths of thousands of his own people. Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that Saddam is ``shaming the 
entire Arab region through his politics.''

	Amnesty Seeks Ban on Child Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Amnesty International released a report supporting  
a campaign to raise the minimum age for military recruiting to 18, 
instead of 15. The human rights group said the international 
community lacks the political will to take a first step toward 
banning child soldiers by the year 2000. Amnesty's report coincides 
with a meeting of the working group of the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, which is deliberating whether to recommend 
setting the higher age.

	Inmates Spending More Time in Jail  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prisoners are spending more time behind bars  
as states enact laws to narrow the gap between sentences handed 
down and the time offenders actually serve, the government said 
today. Violent offenders released in 1997 spent an average of 49 
months in prison, up from 43 months in 1993, a study by the Justice 
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics showed. On average, 
violent offenders freed in 1997 had served 54 percent of their 
sentences. In 1993, they had served 47 percent.

	Monitors Try To Hold Kosovo Peace  
</P>
<P>
	STARI TRG, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav armored vehicles and  
troops stood on alert near this northern village today while 
international monitors tried to avert an explosion of the Kosovo 
crisis, urging ethnic Albanian rebels to free eight captive 
soldiers. Reflecting fears that the talks' failure could prompt an 
all-out government offensive, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
appealed in Brussels, Belgium, for the soldiers' release and called 
on both sides to show restraint. Although there was no sign of 
resolution, a spokesman for the Kosovo monitors expressed cautious 
optimism the mediation would succeed in heading off a military 
showdown.

	Turkey Radiation Blamed on Metal

<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Atomic energy experts today blamed a  
2-ton block of metal in an Istanbul scrap yard that contained a 
radioactive isotope for causing 10 people to be hospitalized. 
Experts believe the remains of medical equipment used to give 
cancer patients radiation therapy were emitting the radiation, the 
Anatolia news agency reported. The hunk of metal apparently 
contained Cobalt 60, a heavy radioactive isotope used in some 
therapy.

ex-wife published a critical book about their marriage that was 
splashed across the front pages of most of Britain's national 
newspapers. In the book, serialized in The Sunday Times newspaper, 
Margaret Cook criticizes her former husband's character and alleges 
he had a series of adulterous relationships before their 28-year 
marriage broke up in 1997 and a drinking problems. ``A cheat, a

<HEADLINE> Futral Debuts in Met 'Lucia' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A stunning debut by the young American soprano  
Elizabeth Futral went a long way to brighten the Metropolitan 
Opera's dreary new production of ``Lucia di Lammermoor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Futral, who gave the first of two performances as  
Donizetti's psychotic heroine Friday night, is a most welcome 
addition to the company's roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina native is a first-rate singing actress,  
blessed with an attractive voice, excellent coloratura technique 
and lively dramatic instincts. 
</P>
<P>
	She clearly had her own ideas about the character -- which is  
fortunate since director Nicolas Joel seems to have had none. Her 
Lucia was no generic chirping bird in the Lily Pons tradition. 
Instead, she used telling gestures and distinctive phrasings to 
trace the emotional path of a vibrant, vulnerable young woman who 
grows despondent and ultimately demented as she is trapped by her 
brother into marrying a man she does not love. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Miss Futral, however, could not completely rise above the  
static production with its ugly sets by Ezio Frigerio and 
unimaginative costumes by Franca Squarciapino. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Joel has contrived to ruin the dramatic impact of  
the Mad Scene by making Lucia -- who has just killed her new husband 
-- wander out of doors alone in her blood-soaked wedding dress, 
instead of displaying her dementia before the horrified guests 
inside Lammermoor castle. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Miss Futral, Friday's cast had another welcome addition  
-- the sturdy British baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore as Lucia's 
brother, Enrico. Bass Paul Plishka was in fine voice as the family 
tutor, Raimondo, and tenor Ramon Vargas repeated his ravishingly 
sung performance as Lucia's true love, Edgardo. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Futral, who showed not a trace of debut nerves, has been a  
fast-rising star on the operatic scene. She sang a much-admired 
``Lakme'' at the New York City opera recently, and last fall her 
Stella virtually stole the show from Renee Fleming's Blanche in the 
world premiere of Andre Previn's ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' at 
the San Francisco Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's hope the Met brings her back soon -- and in a production  
worthy of her talents.

<HEADLINE> More Cougars Found in Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Northern New England's largest, most  
reclusive predator is living up to its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmed sightings of cougars in Maine and Vermont in recent  
years and a Christmas Eve video have some people excited about the 
prospects of the creature's return to its original habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people out there who believe that wolves would come  
back on their own and mountain lions would come back on their 
own,'' said Rosemary Conroy of the Society for the Preservation of 
New Hampshire Forests. 
</P>
<P>
	As for herself, Conroy said she believes cougar sightings are  
more likely a rural myth but added that ``as long as there are 
large blocs of land out there, it's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire biologists remain skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Fish and Game biologist Kent Gustafson said  
sightings in the Northeast are notoriously difficult to document. 
While it is rare to spot one of the shy creatures in Western 
states, where they are much more common, it is even more rare in 
the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain lions, also called cougars, pumas, panthers and  
catamounts, are the largest native North American cat. Gustafson 
said mature cougars typically range from 90 to 120 pounds and are 5 
feet to 6 feet long from head to tail. They primarily hunt deer. 
</P>
<P>
	Solitary animals, they roam territories of up to 150 square  
miles. They have big yellow eyes, a keen nose and the ability to 
sprint 40 mph and leap 20 feet into a tree. Wild cougars live to 
about 10 or 12 years, while captive ones can live to be 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Settlers in the Northeast killed them off and pushed them north  
while trying to protect their farms, Gustafson said. By the late 
1800s, they were believed to be eradicated from the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Although New Hampshire hasn't had a confirmed cougar sighting  
since 1885, Maine and Vermont have had more recent run-ins with the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, lab tests confirmed a report of a mountain lion in Cape  
Elizabeth, Maine. In August, several unconfirmed sightings in the 
Fryeburg area and over the New Hampshire border prompted Maine 
wildlife officials to ask selectmen to warn residents. 
</P>
<P>
	A confirmed mountain lion sighting was reported in Craftsbury,  
Vt., in the winter of 1994-1995. State game wardens followed the 
animals' tracks and recovered scat and other physical evidence they 
sent to the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife's forensics lab 
for DNA analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tests confirmed that hair in the scat came from mountain  
lions. Subsequent tests called into question the initial findings, 
but after additional review, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife 
Department stood by its initial assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent sighting came on Christmas Eve morning. Maureen  
Clark, a photographer and bear trainer in Lincoln, said she and a 
nephew saw the small, rusty colored, long-tailed animal clearly in 
her backyard. However, by the time she grabbed her camera, the 
animal had wandered away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like it was a monster, but it wasn't a house cat,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish and Game biologists have studied the 6-second tape but  
reached no conclusion because the view of the animal is largely 
blocked by trees and leaves. Spokesman Eric Aldrich said some 
believe the animal could be a mountain lion, but Gustafson and 
biologist Mark Ellingwood are more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustafson and Ellingwood pointed to what seems to be a striped  
tail and pointed ears on the cat in the video. They said mountain 
lions normally are solid colored with rounded ears. Gustafson 
speculated that it could be a large feral cat or the much more 
common bobcat with an unusually long tail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellingwood said biologists would love to confirm sightings, but  
they must rely on hard evidence such as tracks, scat, hair or 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like chasing ghosts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandel, Wife To Sale Malibu Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Comedian and talk show host Howie Mandel is  
working too hard to hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	So Mandel and his wife, Terry, are putting their four-bedroom  
Malibu retreat up for sale. The price comes in at just under $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're selling because he works 14 hours a day, and he has  
been on the beach eight nights in two years,'' listing agent Jay 
Rubenstein told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry -- the Mandels and their three children have another  
home closer to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandel, 43, has a syndicated talk show, does comedy road shows  
and HBO specials and is the writer, executive producer and main

<HEADLINE> Geena Davis To Host Pre-Oscar Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fashion-challenged actors will have a  
half-hour of safe time before this year's Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Geena Davis has been named the host of an officially sanctioned  
pre-Oscar show on March 21, muscling in on talk show host Joan 
Rivers and others who have made watching the stars walk into the 
ceremony a lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I can guarantee that it will not include is  
anyone yelling, `Who made your dress?''' Davis said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' show will be telecast on ABC, followed by the award  
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	During the show, other networks will be barred from televising  
the stars as they enter the theater. That puts a crimp in the plans 
of people like Rivers, who critiques the actors' and actresses' 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and ABC saw a  
booming pre-show business and wanted in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be in control of this kind of material and  
programming,'' said Robert Rehme, president of the Academy.
