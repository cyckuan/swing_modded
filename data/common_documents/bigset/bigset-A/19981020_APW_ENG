Report: Indonesia predicts increase in textile exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Textile Association
estimates that the country's textile exports for 1998 will increase
2 percent this year to dlrs 7.45 billion from dlrs 7.3 billion in
1997, a report said Monday.
	   Quoting the association's secretary general Irwandy Muslim, The
Jakarta Post reported that Indonesia's economic crisis had pushed
textile producers to enter foreign markets.
	   Irwandy said the improving performance of the country's textile
exports proved that it was not a ``sunset'' industry as some had
previously labelled it.
	   ``You see the textile industry is one of those in Indonesia that
has managed to survive the economic turmoil,'' he said.
	   Irwandy predicted Indonesia's textile exports could reach
between dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 12 billion after the turn of the
century.
	   Indonesia's textile exports reached 130 countries this year,
compared to 85 countries in 1990. He said the main markets are
Europe, with an annual textile trade of dlrs 50 billion, and the
United States with dlrs 47.7 billion.
	   Earlier this month, the U.S. raised the import quota on
Indonesian textile imports for the rest of the year, after
Indonesia exhausted its annual quota last month.

Typhoon Babs intensifies, threatens Philippines' southern Luzon,
</HEADLINE>
central Visayas

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs gathered strength
Tuesday as it pushed toward the central Philippines, threatening to
hit some of the poorest regions in the country.
	   At noon (0400 GMT), Babs, with maximum sustained winds of 150
kilometers (94 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 185 kph (116
mph), was over the Pacific Ocean about 240 kilometers (150 miles)
east-southeast of Borongan in Eastern Samar province, weather
forecaster Susan Dampog said.
	   She said Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this season,
was moving northwest at 11 kph (7 mph) but its movement was too
erratic to determine exactly when it would hit land.
	   ``It's difficult to determine where it will proceed,'' she said.
``But we are sure it will continue to gain more strength before it
hits land.''
	   Dampog said the typhoon will begin to be felt in Samar and
Luzon's southern Bicol region by late Tuesday or early Wednesday.
	   She said the bureau is advising against sea travel because the
typhoon is likely to create large waves. Residents of the eastern
coastline also have been told to move to higher ground because the
typhoon is expected to create ``surges'' that could engulf coastal
villages, she said.
	   Another typhoon, Zeb, struck the northern Philippines last week,
leaving at least 74 people dead and 65 others missing. About
415,000 people fled their homes at the height of the typhoon but
most have now returned.
	   After hitting the Philippines, Zeb skirted Taiwan, where 18
died, before cutting a swath across Japan, where it killed at least
12 people.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)_ Leftist rebels Monday night admitted
triggering the explosion at an oil pipeline over the weekend, but
suggested the Colombian army set a subsequent fire which engulfed a
nearby village, killing 47 people.
	   The surprise accusation was made in a statement read Monday
night to a radio station by Nicolas Rodriguez, top commander of the
15,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's

	   ``We assume the responsibility for the blowing up of the

within our ranks,'' the rebel chief said, breaking silence on the
incident.
	   Government officials had suspected the ELN in the blast, and
were demanding they clarify their role.
	   There was no immediate response from President Andres Pastrana,
who had been careful in statements not to directly accuse the
rebels who have a long history of attacking oil pipelines.
	   Colombia's armed forces chief denied his men were involved.

	   The Ocensa pipeline, a 510-mile (820-kilometer) facility
carrying crude from eastern oil fields to Caribbean ports, is
jointly owned by the Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol and a
consortium including U.S, French, British and Canadian companies.
	   The rebels, who have carried out more than 60 pipeline attacks
this year, say they are protesting excessive government concessions
to foreign oil interests.
	   In his statement, ELN commander Rodriguez admitted guerrillas
set off an explosion at 2:00 a.m. Sunday in the vicinity of
Machuca, the rural hamlet in central Antioquia state devastated by
the weekend's blaze.
	   But Rodriguez said the subsequent fire which raged through the
village of gold miners, killing 47 people and injuring 60 more, was
set off an hour later, possibly by soldiers at an army base located
near where the fire allegedly began.
	   ``The people of this region are well aware of this type of army
behavior,'' Rodriguez said, claiming the military had set fires
after other guerrilla pipeline attacks.
	   The majority of the dead were women and children who were asleep
in simple wooden houses when the flames sped through Machuca.
	   News that leftist rebels were involved could poison the
atmosphere for peace talks to put an end to Colombia's 34-year
civil war.
	   Pastrana is set to begin negotiations Nov. 7 with the country's
other leading guerrilla faction, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia.
	   Separate, preliminary peace talks are scheduled to get under way
with the ELN in February.

Major U.S.-South Korea military exercises to be held
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. and South Korean troops will
begin a major, joint field exercise next week that North Korea is,
as usual, denouncing as a preparation to invade it.
	   This year's ``Foal Eagle'' exercise will be the 37th since 1961,
and North Korea's propaganda machine is being harshly critical for
the 37th time.
	   Washington and Seoul defend the exercises as ``routine and
defensive,'' designed to test responses if North Korea invades
South Korea again and infiltrates troops into rear areas.
	   As in the past, this year's drill will be staged mostly in areas
well south of the border with the North, the U.S. Military Command
said Tuesday. It will begin next Tuesday and end in early November.
	   The exercise will involve most of South Korea's 650,000-strong
military and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed here, the command
said.
	   The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk and several other warships of
the U.S. 7th Fleet will participate in an amphibious landing
operation on the southeast coast, officials said.
	   Even before the announcement was made, North Korea called the
exercise ``preparations for a new war in the 21st century.''
	   ``If the U.S. persistently takes the line of war behind the
curtain of dialogue, we will have to take countermeasures,'' the
North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary
last week.
	   The United States, China and the two Koreas are scheduled to
begin four days of talks in Geneva on Wednesday aimed at achieving
permanent peace on the Korean peninsula. The talks are third since
late last year and the first since March.
	   ``It must not go unnoticed that the adventurous maneuvers will
be staged three days after the third round of the four-way talks,''
the KCNA commentary said.
	   ``This adds to the suspicion that the four-way talks that the
U.S. describes as peace talks are a subterfuge to conceal its war
preparations against the DPRK (North Korea),'' it said.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s that ended without a peace treaty.

	   Oil company officials said they found a 1.5-meter (4-foot) deep
by 2-meter (6-foot) wide crater in the ground where the pipeline
was ruptured.
	   ``The conclusion is that criminal hands were at work, that it
was an attack,'' said Jorge Suarez, support manager for the
pipeline, which is jointly owned by the state oil company,
Ecopetrol, and a foreign consortium including British Petroleum,
U.S.-based Triton Energy Ltd., Total S.A. of France and two
Canadian companies.
	   Suarez said the crater was ``typical of an explosives attack.''

were spilled and that they expected to have the pipeline repaired
and back in operation on Tuesday.

Thailand gives 40 tons of pesticides to help Myanmar with malaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has donated about 40 tons of
pesticides and drugs to neighboring Myanmar to help eradicate
malaria, a senior public health official said Tuesday.
	   Areas along parts of the Thai-Myanmar border are home to some of
the world's most resistant strains of malaria, a parasitic disease
carried by mosquitos.
	   ``We have been able to control the spread of malaria on our
side, but the problem on the Myanmar side appears to be more
serious,'' said Yuth Potharamik, director general of the Department
of Communicable Diseases at the Ministry of Public Health.
	   ``We have to keep in mind that malaria is borderless,'' he said.
	   Myanmar's military government had steadily decreased its
spending on health care over the past decade, according to World
Bank statistics. Many of the border areas are populated by ethnic
groups which historically have had difficult relations with the
government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, and receive little
assistance from Yangon.
	   The first batch of insecticides and drugs were donated to
Myanmar malaria control project director Soe Aung on Monday in the
border province of Tak, 370 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of
Bangkok.
	   Thailand plans to donate another 60 tons of insecticides to
Myanmar to help eradicate malaria in Kaya, Karen, and Mon States,
where the problem is widespread, Yuth said.
	   Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Indonesia and Cambodia have been
working together for several years on the issue of malaria control,
he said.

Philippine trade deficit narrows 83.3 percent in first eight months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' trade deficit
narrowed 83.3 percent to dlrs 1.29 billion in the first eight
months of the year from dlrs 7.76 billion a year earlier as imports
continued to decline, the government said Tuesday.
	   For August alone, the country registered a trade surplus of dlrs
144 million following a deficit of dlrs 1.029 billion in the
year-earlier month.
	   Imports fell 14.4 percent to dlrs 20.35 billion in January to
August compared to a year earlier, while exports rose 18.9 percent
to dlrs 19.06 billion.
	   The import decline reflects an economic slowdown caused by
Asia's currency crisis, which has also made imports more expensive
in terms of Philippine pesos.
	   In a sign of a further slowdown, imports of capital goods, which
accounted for 39.4 percent of total imports, declined 28.6 percent
in August from a year earlier to dlrs 988.45 million. Imports of
consumer goods fell 7.4 percent to dlrs 249.86 million.
	   The exception to the import trend was electronics and
components, many of which are used to assemble products for export.
The category rose 20.1 percent to dlrs 560.1 million.
	   The United States was the biggest source of imports in August
with payments of dlrs 566.73 million, up 3.1 percent from
year-earlier month. Shipments from the United States accounted for
22.6 percent of the total import bill for August.
	   The government announces export and import data separately each
month. Earlier it said exports rose 18 percent in August from a
year earlier to dlrs 2.65 billion.
	   Electronics remained the Philippines' top export earner for
August, accounting for 51 percent, or dlrs 1.36 billion, of total
receipts, 37 percent more than a year earlier.

Cargo restrictions aim to head off more trouble at Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
airport &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's main cargo handler imposed
restrictions on exports from the new airport Tuesday, hoping to
lessen the impact of a power failure that slowed shipments,
newspapers reported.
	   Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. began accepting freight only
the day before it was to be shipped, after a power failure threw
computer systems into disarray Thursday and slowed down processing
of containers, the South China Morning Post reported.
	   Officials at the cargo operation, known as HACTL, declined any
immediate comment to The Associated Press.
	   The reported problems were the latest _ but not nearly the most
serious _ in a series of snags that have plagued Chek Lap Kok
airport since it opened in July. The airport's early operations
broke down into a costly fiasco as computer breakdowns and system
problems crippled both passenger and cargo services.
	   A ban on all cargo except perishables and essential goods that
lasted for over a month was estimated to have cost Hong Kong 0.35
percent of this year's gross domestic product.
	   In order to avoid any serious troubles, the latest restrictions
will clear the space at the cargo terminal by half and ``relieve
container storage system,'' the Post quoted HACTL managing director
Anthony Charter as saying.
	   Chek Lap Kok airport was built on reclaimed land off a remote
outlying island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport located
in a congested Kowloon neighborhood.

	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ His name sways
from welcome banners hanging from stop lights and trees that
escaped Hurricane Georges. His number, 21, is carved on donkey
carts. His achievement, 66 home runs this season, is blazoned on
shop and car windows.
	   Amid the debris of the storm that devastated his home town, sign
writers hurriedly painted new billboards to welcome home their
hero.
	   A victory procession through San Pedro Macoris will fete Sammy
Sosa when he arrives Tuesday afternoon, ending on the Malecon, a
seaside drive that was lined with palm trees before Georges smashed
them to the ground three weeks ago.
	   ``We await the most beloved gentleman for now and forever _
Sammy Sosa!'' declared Cristian Castro, a writer in San Pedro, as
he stood outside a bar in Plaza 30-30, where Sosa's three-foot
statue poses on the follow through of a swing. The shopping mall
owned by Sosa commemorates his two seasons of more than 30 home
runs and 30 stolen bases, in 1993 and 1995.
	   This year, Sosa's 60 homers provided the only cause for
celebration while Hurricane Georges raked the nation on Sept. 22.
The storm killed at least 283 people in the Dominican Republic and
left more than 100,000 homeless, many in San Pedro.
	   Dominicans followed every step of Sosa and Mark McGwire's battle
to surpass Roger Maris' Major League record of 61 home runs in a
season. Each home run, each strikeout was chronicled in
excruciating detail by the country's newspapers.
	   While McGwire took the crown with 70 homers, Sosa's achievement
fills his countrymen with pride.
	   When he arrives Tuesday morning in Santo Domingo, the capital,
President Leonel Fernandez plans to present him with the Order of
Duarte, Sanchez and Mella, the Caribbean country's highest civilian
honor.
	   Thousands of well-wishers will get free bus rides to Santo
Domingo's international airport to cheer Sosa's arrival.
	   And his homecoming Tuesday has been declared a day of national
celebration even though the country still is coping with the
ravages of Hurricane Georges.
	   Since the storm struck, Sosa has been busy in the United States,
receiving the keys to New York City, throwing a ceremonial first
pitch in the World Series and also raising funds for hurricane
relief.
	   His foundation has sent medical supplies, food and money to San
Pedro, but Sosa is seen as much more than a wealthy benefactor.
	   ``Many times, Sosa made us feel happy with his home runs,'' said
Miguel Contreras, a bar patron in Santo Domingo. ``Now it's right
that we make him feel good.''
	   In San Pedro, motorcycle taxi driver Luis Alex, who wears black
Franklin brand batting gloves on both hands just like his idol,
said, ``Sammy is not someone for what he gives away. He's someone
we hold here inside,'' he signaled to his heart, ``for what he
gives as pride.''

	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying British holiday-makers
collided with a car early Tuesday near this Aegean port, killing at
least seven people and injuring 35 others, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   The tourists were traveling to Izmir's airport from Kusadasi,
and were on their way home to Britain from the resort.
	   According to Anatolia, the bus collided with a car at 2:20 a.m.
(2220 GMT), killing all five passengers in the car and two Britons
on the bus.
	   The driver and passengers in the car were believed to be
Turkish, said Anita McErlean, a spokeswoman for the British holiday
company Airtours, which hired the bus.
	   One British woman on the bus was killed instantly, while another
Briton died later in hospital, said Ajay Sharma of the British
Embassy in Ankara.
	   The bus was carrying 40 people, including 38 tourists, a tour
company representative and the driver, when it collided head-on
with a taxi, McErlean said.
	   She said several bus passengers were undergoing treatment for
injuries at four local hospitals.
	   The identities of the victims were not immediately available.
Police was unavailable for comment.

Former Filipino sex slaves condemn Japanese court decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A group of elderly Filipinos who were
forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War
II condemned a ruling by a Japanese court that rejected their
claims for compensation and an official apology for their ordeal.
	   About 60 former sex slaves and their supporters rallied at the
Japanese Embassy on Tuesday, denouncing the Oct. 9 ruling by the
Tokyo District Court which turned down claims by 46 Filipino women
for 20 million yen (dlrs 169,000) each in compensation.
	   The court said the international law under which the plaintiffs
sought damages did not permit compensation demands by individuals.
	   ``The rejection of the grandmothers' claims is like reliving the
Japanese Imperial Army's raping of the women in World War II,''
said Retchilda Extremadura, coordinator of Lila-Pilipina, an
organization of former wartime sex slaves.
	   Some of the former sex slaves, many in their 70s, wept as they
held up pictures of others who have already died.
	   Later they burned black posters on which the Japanese court's
decision was written.
	   Ms. Extremadura said the decision was ``a big blow to the
survivors ... and an affront to the rights of the women of the
world.''
	   To date, seven of the Filipino plaintiffs have died, including
Maria Rosa Henson, the first Filipino woman to publicly admit she
was forced into sexual slavery for Japan.
	   The protesters also criticized the Philippine government, saying
it had helped little in their cause.
	   Japan has provided aid to some former sex slaves through a
private fund. Most of the women have refused to accept the payment,
saying it is not enough and is part of attempts by Japan to avoid
taking official responsibility for its wartime actions.
	   Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans but also
Filipinos, Chinese and Dutch, were forced into sexual slavery
during the war.
	   In the Philippines, 169 have been documented so far.
	   It was only in 1992 that the Japanese government admitted that
its Imperial army was involved in establishing and running the
front-line brothels.
	   Japan maintains, however, that all questions of compensation for
the war already have been settled with the various nations
involved.

Australia to seek greater trade liberalization at leaders' forum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will use next month's Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in Malaysia to push the
case for further trade liberalization and better regional economic
governance, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday.
	   ``We as a government are placing a very great emphasis on this
year's APEC summit,'' Downer told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   ``It's going to be important that the APEC summit not only come
up with a further commitment to the trade liberalization agenda,
and we want to keep the momentum of trade liberalization going at
this difficult time for the region, but also to address the broader
economic governance issues in the region.''
	   Australia is pushing the case for further trade liberalization
ahead of next year's World Trade Organization talks, which are
expected to cover further scrapping of agricultural trade barriers.
	   Getting APEC support for such moves is seen as a crucial test of
support for Australia's case for further trade reform.
	   The Australian newspaper reported that the government will also
use the APEC summit to push its neighbors to accelerate economic
reforms in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
	   The Australian strategy to be presented to APEC's 21 members
would represent a fundamental change in the organization's role,
the newspaper said.
	   It said the strategy would seek to shift the forum's focus away
from the push for freer trade and towards moves to greater economic
and financial transparency.
	   Downer also said that Prime Minister John Howard was considering
visiting Jakarta on his way to the APEC meeting in mid-November,
although no final decision had been made.

Six Japanese arrested for allegedly assaulting U.S. Marines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Six Japanese, including five teenagers, were
arrested Tuesday for allegedly assaulting and injuring two U.S.
Marines, a police spokesman said.
	   The six were among more than 10 people, mostly teen-age boys and
girls, who allegedly attacked the U.S. Marines on a street in
Hiroshima the night of June 20, said Kozo Tanaka, a police
spokesman in Hiroshima.
	   A group of about 50 teen-age members of a hot-rod gang
surrounded the four Marines on the street, with two of the
servicemen receiving minor injuries to the face and arms after
being beaten, Tanaka said.
	   The four were from U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni,
located just south of Hiroshima about 722 kilometers (448 miles),
southwest of Tokyo.
	   Base authorities reported the case to Hiroshima police the
following day, Tanaka said.
	   Arrested were Hideo Terasako, 22, and five others between the
ages of 16 and 18. As minors, their names were withheld by police.
	   ``We were instructed by an acquaintance who is a criminal gang
member to hunt foreigners,'' Tanaka quoted one of the arrested
teenagers as saying.
	   Police were trying to identify and arrest the others implicated
with the attack as well as the gangster, Tanaka said.
	   If convicted, those charged with assault and inflicting injuries
face up to three years in prison or a fine of 300,000 yen (dlrs
2,600).
	   There are about 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in
Japan under mutual security arrangements.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Conflict prevention and rebuilding after military
disputes topped the agenda Tuesday as an international African
development conference entered its second day, organizers said.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan planned to deliver a speech at
a dinner for participants of the 2nd Tokyo International Conference
on African Development. Annan was to arrive in Tokyo later Tuesday.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened the conference and
vowed to maintain Japan's commitment to African aid despite his
country's severe economic difficulties.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action''
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and development.
	   Besides Annan, participants in the conference include the
leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Djibouti,
Mozambique, Botswana and Benin.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attended the
conference's opening on Monday.
	   The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

South Korea to open door to Japanese culture
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea lifted a ban on the import
of selected Japanese movies, videos and cartoons Tuesday, legally
permitting something it has long been unable to stop.
	   The decision was the first step in fulfilling President Kim
Dae-jung's promise during a visit to Japan earlier this month that
he would speed the opening of South Korea to Japanese culture.
	   ``The measures taken today are very meaningful, because they
will lead the Japan-South Korea relationship to a higher level,''
Culture and Tourism Minister Shin Nak-kyun told a news conference.
	   ``It is a prelude to a mature bilateral relationship,'' she
said.
	   South Korea has banned Japanese music, movies, theatrical and
cultural performances since the country was liberated from Japanese
occupation in 1945 at the end of World War II.
	   Anti-Japanese sentiment still runs deep in South Korea. Many
accuse Japan of trying to bury its past, without fully facing up to
its crimes, including the induction of thousands of Korean women
into sexual slavery.
	   But many younger South Koreans, especially teenagers, are
already familiar with a broad range of Japanese culture through
smuggled films, books, magazines, recordings and international
satellite TV channels.
	   Officials said detailed procedures for imports will be worked
out before the end of the year by a committee to be formed with
government and civilian cultural representatives of both countries.
	   The first beneficiaries of the South Korean decision will be
cartoon books and magazines and international award-winning
Japanese movies, the officials said.
	   The import of violent, lewd and pornographic products as well as
cartoon movies will continue to be banned, the officials said.

Pro-government supporters protest outside Philippine Embassy

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the first pro-government rally
since Malaysia's political crisis erupted, several hundred people
demonstrated Tuesday against the Philippine president, accusing him
of meddling in their country's internal politics.
	   The crowd of mostly businessmen and members of the ruling
National Front coalition waved placards in front of the Philippine
Embassy calling for President Joseph Estrada to stop backing jailed
dissident, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``Estrada is insane. You go look after your own country,'' said
a poster held by several women wearing t-shirts imprinted with an
image of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's face on the front.
	   ``Long live Mahathir!'' shouted another supporter, clad in a
business suit and tie. ``Estrada, you can have Anwar!''
	   Estrada's public support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal
friend, has angered the Malaysian government.
	   Though Estrada ended speculation about boycotting a summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum by confirming his
attendance, he said he would also try to meet with Anwar in jail.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and subsequently
arrested for organizing rallies against his former boss. He will
face trial from Nov. 2 for 10 counts of illegal homosexual acts and
corruption.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday he had
contacted his Philippine counterpart Domingo Siazon to express
Malaysia's ``uneasiness'' over Estrada's statements.
	   Abdullah said that the Philippine foreign minister had assured
him that Estrada's statements were made in his ``personal
capacity'' and wasn't the government's stance.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, large protests in Malaysia have been
organized several times a week to demand his release and Mahathir's
resignation.

Rebel troops surrender, return to garrison in western Georgia

	   SENAKI, Georgia (AP) _ Most of the soldiers who mutinied against
the Georgian government were back in their garrison by Tuesday, and
the tanks, trucks and machine guns they'd used to block roads were
returned to the army's arsenal.
	   However, government troops were still searching for the leader
of the one-day revolt and one of his followers who escaped arrest
Monday, Capt. Zurab Kvitsiani said. The leader, Akakiy Eliava, and
some of his men have been charged with treason.
	   Initial reports put the number of mutineers at about 200, but
military officers in Senaki said Tuesday the number of troops
involved was closer to 50. Others were local residents who joined
in the revolt.
	   The soldiers, who are fiercely opposed to President Eduard
Shevardnadze, took over their garrison in the western town of
Senaki on Monday and advanced toward the heart of Georgia.
	   Troops were sent to intercept rebels on the road to Georgia's
second-largest city, Kutaisi, some 230 kilometers (140 miles) west
of the capital Tbilisi. At least one soldier and four mutineers
were killed in clashes.
	   After talks with government negotiators, the rebel troops agreed
to return to their garrison at Senaki, about 50 kilometers (31
miles) west of Kutaisi. The majority were back in their barracks by
Tuesday, military officials said.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
over the violence and voiced support for Shevardnadze and ``the
stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.
	   He called on Georgia's opposition on Monday ``to resolve their
differences with the government through peaceful and democratic
means rather than by armed confrontation.''
	   Eliava, the leader of the revolt, is a military commander who is
also a supporter of the late Georgian president, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9 attack
on his motorcade that killed two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards. At
least eight suspects have been arrested.

Dollar inches higher, Tokyo stock prices close up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, midafternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices closed higher Tuesday for the
third straight session on buying by government funds. The U.S.
dollar edged up against the yen.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed up 240.85
points, or 1.78 percent, to 13,808.05 points _ its highest level
since Oct. 7. On Monday, the Nikkei closed up 286.66 points, or
2.16 percent.
	   Public fund buying ahead of the listing of NTT Mobile
Communications Network Inc., or NTT DoCoMo, triggered a late surge
in Tokyo's benchmark stock index, which had hovered above Monday's
closing level for most of the day.
	   NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, is
scheduled to go public Thursday, and government funds have been
anxious to support the market to help the launch go smoothly.
	   An overnight gain on Wall Street also encouraged investors in
Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.69 points _ or 0.6 percent _ to finish
Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   ``With the recent strong recovery in U.S. stocks and ahead of
DoCoMo's major debut, the Tokyo market's sentiment has improved
substantially,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general manager at Meiko
Securities Co.
	   Many investors remained cautious, however, as they waited to see
if the government would enact additional stimulus steps to lift
Japan's moribund economy, dealers said.
	   Kaoru Yosano, head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told reporters Monday that the government may come up
with a new set of economic stimulus measures next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section finished up 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, to
1,043.02 points. The TOPIX closed up 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent,
the day before.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 114.79 yen at
midafternoon, up 0.07 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above
its New York level of 114.28 yen late Monday.
	   The dollar's strength against the German mark led Japanese
short-term players to buy back the U.S. currency against the yen.
	   The dollar continued to benefit from speculation that the
Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may lower interest rates at its
policy-setting meeting on Thursday, traders said.
	   But they said overall sentiment on the dollar remains weak.
Fears that hedge funds may continue to unwind long dollar positions
and concerns about the health of the U.S. economy are forcing many
traders to dump the greenback on rallies.
	   ``Right now, market strategy is operating on unease more than
anything else,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign exchange manager
at Nomura Trust and Banking. ``Overseas hedge funds are still
lowering their dollar exposure, spurring selling by everyone else
in the market.''
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.810 percent from Monday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price up to 108.86 yen from 108.82 yen.

China opens human rights conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China opened an international conference on world
human rights Tuesday, in a sign of its growing confidence in a
field where it has faced much criticism.
	   While not focused specifically on China, the two-day symposium
reflected China's greater willingness to entertain discussions on
rights issues following moves by many foreign governments to tone
down public criticism of China's human rights record.
	   It also offered China an opportunity to promote its views, among
them that the cultural, social, historical and economic differences
between countries are bound to create arguments over human rights
that should be discussed without confrontation.
	   ``It is only natural that countries in the world do not have
complete agreement on how to define, approach and realize human
rights,'' Vice Premier Qian Qichen said in an address to the
meeting. ``No country's human rights situation is perfect.''
	   More than 80 delegates from 27 countries attended the
conference, sponsored by a government-backed society to mark this
year's 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. The Chinese delegation included government officials,
retired officials and academics but no known dissidents.
	   In a statement, Qin Yongmin, a dissident from southern China,
attacked the meeting as an official effort to ``cheat international
opinion.''
	   British lawmaker and delegate Jeremy Corbyn said he planned to
raise individual human rights cases with Chinese officials,
including that of imprisoned labor activist Liu Nianchun. He also
hoped to discuss general concerns about Tibet, labor camps and
religious freedom.
	   Corbyn, from Britain's governing Labor Party, welcomed the
symposium as ``an opportunity to at least raise these general
issues because that wouldn't have happened in the past.''
	   ``But the danger is that unless it goes anywhere it's a complete
waste of time and it will be seen as window dressing,'' he added.
	   The symposium follows a decision by the United States and the
European Union this year to drop efforts to censure China at the
U.N. Human Rights Commission. They said quiet diplomacy could be
more effective in pushing China to reform and release dissidents.
	   The decision marked a victory for China's efforts to silence the
vocal foreign criticism that dogged it after the Chinese army
crushed pro-democracy protests on Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   Zhu Muzhi, a former bureaucrat who heads the government-backed
human rights society that co-sponsored the symposium, alluded to
the change in his opening speech.
	   ``Differences in the field of human rights still exist in the
international community,'' he said. ``But the voices calling for
dialogue and opposing confrontation are increasingly rising above
the crowd.''
	   Organizers said the meeting was the first international
symposium on human rights organized by China academics. China,
however, has held other meetings at which human rights have been a
major topic, including a China-Europe human rights symposium.

Israeli foreign minister ignores Arafat in U.S. talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has
refused, despite U.S. encouragement, to back down and shake the
hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during U.S.-brokered peace
talks.
	   Sharon and Arafat ignored each other when the hardline Israeli
politician entered the room where Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton were meeting,
Israel radio said Tuesday.
	   ``General Sharon has arrived,'' Netanyahu said, in announcing
Sharon's entrance, but Arafat did not even look in the direction of
the minister, who has labeled the Palestinian leader a
``terrorist,'' the radio said.
	   The U.S. organizers tried to break the ice between the two by
seating them across from each other in the meeting. But Sharon and
Arafat did not shake hands or acknowledge each other's presence,
the radio said.
	   Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister just prior to the
beginning of the peace talks last Thursday at Wye Plantation,
Maryland, in an apparent effort to appease nationalist critics in
his coalition who have warned against making concessions to the
Palestinians.
	   Upon his appointment, Sharon immediately reiterated that he
would not shake Arafat's hand.

Thai finance chief says Japan supportive of aid requests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thailand's finance minister said Tuesday the
Japanese government has been ``very supportive'' of his requests
for aid to help his country battle its economic crisis.
	   Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda met with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to request financial aid under the dlrs 30 billion Asian
aid package Japan announced earlier this month.
	   Tarrin said the Japanese assistance will consist of ``various
types of facilities from various agencies,'' without elaborating.
He also said that the amount of the assistance would not be
disclosed until later.
	   ``They are very supportive,'' Tarrin said after the Miyazawa
meeting.
	   Tarrin and Miyazawa said in a joint statement that Miyazawa
intends to send a mission to Thailand in early November ``to
discuss and identify the needs of Thailand.''
	   Miyazawa will then work out ways under the new aid program to
meet those needs, the statement said.

Jets 24, Patriots 14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ While Bill Parcells' aura hogged
the attention, the usually invisible Kyle Brady stole the game for
the New York Jets.
	   Brady caught two touchdown passes from Vinny Testaverde,
including the winning 1-yarder with 8:54 to go Monday night as the
Jets surprised the New England Patriots 24-14. Parcells, who left
New England for New York before last season, is 2-1 against the
Patriots, whom he led to the AFC title before departing.
	   Testaverde, who replaced inconsistent starter Glenn Foley this
week, threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns. The 12-year
veteran, who also was 2-0 when Foley was injured earlier this
season, clinched it with a 44-yard strike to Dedric Ward with 3:29
to go.
	   For much of the night, the game lacked the fervor and excitement
of Parcells' return to Foxboro last year, a 27-24 overtime victory
for the Patriots. It had all the elements for a classic: eight
former Patriots in Jets uniforms; a New England team and coach
seeking to put aside the shadow of the highly publicized former
coach; a Monday night audience; New York fighting to stay alive in
the AFC East against the first-place team.
	   Instead, it was a workmanlike victory for the Jets (3-3) _ but
still their biggest under Parcells, who is considered by some New
Englanders to be a deserter.
	   While Robert Edwards, the first-round pick from Georgia who has
replaced Curtis Martin in New England's backfield, was setting an
NFL record with touchdown runs in his first six games, Martin was
just as effective. Martin, signed as a restricted free agent in the
offseason, rushed for 107 yards and Edwards had 104.

Chinese activist fired over Japanese campaigning, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese campaigner for war reparations from
Japan has been fired from his government job because of his
activism, a human rights group reported Tuesday.
	   Tong Zeng was fired last week from his job as a researcher on
aging at an institute under the Civil Affairs Ministry, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said in a statement.
	   Tong, 42, had been active in recent years in pressing the
Japanese government to pay reparations to victims of wartime
atrocities and criticizing its control of a group of East China Sea
islands that China claims.
	   Both issues are delicate ones for China. While not wanting to
harm its trade and diplomatic relations with Japan, Beijing fears
public criticism for failing to stand up to Tokyo, which many
Chinese still regard as untrustworthy.
	   In recent years, police have tried to silence Tong by detaining
him for short periods of time or forcing him to leave Beijing
during visits by foreign dignitaries.
	   Although the Chinese government relinquished claims to
compensation from Japan when diplomatic relations were restored in
1972, it has not officially prohibited individuals from seeking
redress.
	   An official at the China Research Center on Aging who refused to
give her name confirmed Tong had been fired. But she said his
inattentiveness to his work and a failed performance review were
the reasons for his dismissal.
	   Calls to Tong's home were not answered.
	   The Hong Kong rights group said Tong used his spare time to
campaign for Japanese reparations, but his employer had warned him
he would be fired unless he gave up pushing claims against Tokyo.
	   Before a visit by then Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
last year, Tong organized a petition demanding that the Japanese
leader apologize for atrocities in World War II and curb what the
petitioners called resurgent militarism in Japan.
	   It also called on Japan to provide compensation for wartime
losses and give up claims to the contested East China Sea islands _
called the Diaoyus by Chinese and the Senkakus in Japan.
	   China claims that 35 million of its people were killed during
Japan's 1931-45 occupation of much of China.

Following talks, Taiwan's Lee renews recognition appeal to Beijing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TPE101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui said Tuesday he
favors continued dialogue with mainland China, while reiterating
his demand that Beijing recognize Taiwan's sovereignty.
	   Lee met with Taiwanese envoy Koo Chen-fu the day after Koo
returned from what Taiwan termed an ``ice-melting visit'' with
leaders in China. According to Taiwan TV, Lee told Koo that Taiwan
and China can improve their relations if they ``honestly face the
fact of division and continue contacts and dialogue.''
	   Koo was quoted earlier by the official Central News Agency as
saying that while disputes with China remain unchanged, an
agreement to continue contacts marked a ``rare'' development.
	   Koo won high marks for his performance in China, the highest
level contact between the two sides since Beijing broke off
structured negotiations in June 1995. Koo met Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and secured a commitment from his Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan, probably next spring.
	   More than 85 percent of respondents to a survey commissioned by
a ruling Nationalist Party foundation said they approved of the
visit and more talks.
	   But more than 65 percent said that if Lee visited China, he
should do so only in his capacity as Taiwan's president, an
indication that the public backs the government's insistence on
being treated as an equal.
	   The telephone survey of 2,401 respondents, conducted Oct. 17-19
with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent, showed overall
support for punitive restrictions on investment with China. But 36
percent of the respondents said the rules should be loosened,
reflecting their unpopularity with Taiwan's business community.
	   China has claimed Taiwan as a breakaway province since Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists fled here in 1949 after being swept out of
the mainland by Mao Tse-tung's Communists.
	   Four decades of tense standoff ended with a 1993 meeting between
Koo and Wang in Singapore. Two years of talks on practical matters
such as resolving fishing disputes followed, though no agreements
were reached.
	   An outraged China froze talks after Lee visited the United
States, a trip it saw as evidence he was turning away from
reunification. In the months that followed, China attempted to
intimidate Lee supporters by lobbing missiles into waters near the
island and staging threatening war games, raising tensions to the
highest level in decades.
	   Tentative contacts renewed last November, but China now insists
that Taiwan agree to discuss political issues related to
reunification. Taiwan wants talks to pick up where they left off.
	   Scholarly observers warned that despite Koo's visit, the
diplomatic confrontation between Taipei and Beijing will likely
only worsen.
	   Wooing away Taiwan's handful of diplomatic allies and blocking
its attempts to join international organizations is China's best
way to assert its claim to the island, said Pan Hsi-tang, of the
Institute of China Studies at Tamkang University.
	   ``People here want peace, but they have the confidence to face
their foe,'' said Chao Chun-shan, a scholar at National Chengchi
University.

Sleeping with a reptile: woman wakes up bitten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A woman awoke in bed Tuesday to find
a carpet snake wrapped around her arm and its teeth embedded in her
leg.
	   Katherine Bell, 34, said she was sleeping alongside her
6-year-old daughter Carla when she felt a pain in her leg at about
4 a.m.
	   ``I thought it was my cat playing on my bed,'' said Bell, of
Brisbane.
	   ``I went to move my arm to turn on the bedside light but it (the
snake) was wrapped around my arm and its mouth was biting my
knee.''
	   Bell staggered out of bed, flailing wildly to free herself from
the snake.
	   Loosing herself from the two-meter (two-yard)-long reptile, she
threw it to the floor before fleeing the room.
	   The snake escaped into nearby woodlands through a sliding door.
	   Ambulance officers took Bell to nearby Redland Bay Hospital for
treatment to puncture wounds on her leg, knee and finger while
police called in a snake handler, who found the reptile.
	   Carpet snakes are not poisonous, but can inflict a painful bite.
	   ``The snake handler said it attacked me because I moved,'' Bell
said.
	   Bell said it was not the first time she had had a close
encounter with a snake.
	   Last year, she said, she saw three carpet snakes on the fence at
her home, which she believed were trying to get to her pet
hamsters.
	   Bell said she now planned to get rid of pet mice she also kept,
but would keep her cat.
	   A spokesman for Queensland state police said those who see
snakes on their property should leave them alone and call police or
a professional snake catcher.

Hurricane death toll rises in Haiti; Caribbean toll surpasses 500

	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Nearly a month after Hurricane
Georges struck Haiti, the Caribbean nation's death toll has risen
to 213 and is likely to top 240, a civil defense official said.
	   Poor communications in Haiti delayed reports on deaths, injuries
and damages from the storm, which killed at least 509 people across
the Caribbean, including 283 in the Dominican Republic.
	   ``It is not easy to communicate with remote rural sections of
Haiti,'' civil defense official Dieufort Deslorges said Monday. A
report on storm damage from Haiti's northern district has yet to be
completed, he said.
	   Some 30 people were reported missing and feared dead from the
storm, which struck Haiti on Sept. 23, Deslorges said.
	   Most of the Haitian deaths were blamed on flooding and mudslides
in rural, mountainous areas. For generations, Haitian peasants have
cut down trees to make charcoal, denuding mountains and leaving
them unable to absorb rainfall. A flash flood nearly destroyed the
southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where 102 people died.
	   Georges destroyed thousands of homes and killed more than 56,000
head of livestock, Deslorges said. Finance and Economics Minister
Fred Joseph has estimated agricultural damage at more than dlrs 300
million.
	   The United States has provided dlrs 12 million in relief aid,
Taiwan dlrs 300,000 and the U.N. Development Program dlrs 100,000.
Canada, Germany and Japan also have donated relief funds and
supplies.
	   Georges killed five people in Cuba, three in Puerto Rico, three
in St. Kitts and Nevis, and two in Antigua.

Philippine official: use of ASEAN currencies in regional trade not
</HEADLINE>
viable &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A proposal to use Southeast Asian
currencies instead of U.S. dollars in trading in the region is not
viable, a Philippine official was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said governments in
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations could set up procedures
for using regional currencies, but the process would be too
cumbersome and would not be viable in the long run, according to
reports in several Manila newspapers.
	   He said businessmen would prefer dollars because they are easy
to convert and not likely to lose value rapidly.
	   In the case of the Philippines, the peso can be readily swapped
with the dollar because it is traded in large volumes on the
foreign exchange market daily, Medalla said.
	   ``If you are a trader, you don't want to be saddled with
payments, for instance, in rupiah because it is not easily
convertible to pesos,'' the Manila Times quoted Medalla as saying.
	   Attempts to contact Medalla were not immediately successful
Tuesday.
	   ASEAN officials have proposed the scheme as a way to lessen the
region's reliance on U.S. dollars and strengthen its economic and
financial integration.
	   A leading Filipino businessman, Jose Concepcion, said recently
that the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei plan to have a framework ready for bilateral trade payments
using local currencies by the end of the second quarter of 1999.
	   Concepcion, who heads a committee representing ASEAN's chambers
of commerce and industry, said the less developed members of ASEAN
_ Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam _ are not expected to participate in
the scheme for some time.
	   In a report to ASEAN trade ministers who met recently in Manila,
ASEAN secretary-general Rodolfo Severino said the group recognized
the initiative isn't a ``cure-all'' for the continued volatility of
regional currencies.
	   But he said there was good reason to hope the bilateral payments
would help, given the magnitude of intra-ASEAN trade, which totaled
dlrs 86 billion in 1997.

Asian Football Federation complains about overage players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Countries sending players to Asian
youth soccer tournaments will soon have to provide documents to
prove the players aren't over the age limit of 16.
	   The Asian Football Confederation said in a statement Tuesday the
use of overage players by some countries is thwarting the progress
of Asian soccer.
	   Confederation general secretary Peter Velappan said stringent
action will be taken soon against countries found sending overage
players.
	   ``From the 16th Asian Youth Championship staged last month, we
have identified at least seven players who looked suspiciously
overage,'' he said.
	   Velappan said the confederation is doing its best to counter
this problem.
	   ``We are in the process of appointing a team to visit the
countries involved for an in-depth investigation. I am confident
that we will soon see results in fighting this problem,'' Velappan
said.
	   He said some countries were sending overage players because they
wanted to see quick results.
	   ``Cheating serves only to retard the growth of Asian football
and defeats the very ideal of fair play,'' Velappan said.

Congolese rebels say they captured 16 Zimbabwean soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rebels in eastern Congo said Tuesday they
captured 16 Zimbabwean soldiers in recent fighting with government
troops.
	   In the Zimbabwean capital, the Defense Ministry acknowledged the
capture of the 16 soldiers who had been fighting alongside
Congolese troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   It is the first evidence of Zimbabwean involvement in eastern
Congo, where the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, had been
making steady gains since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   ``It is true, we hold 16 Zimbabwean soldiers prisoner. They are
being treated as prisoners of war,'' rebel leader Arthur Ngoma said
by telephone from the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma.
	   They were taken prisoner during recent fighting in eastern
Congo, Ngoma said. He could not say where or when they were
captured, nor where they were being held.
	   Officials in Rwanda, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the prisoners were being held in Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
southwest of Goma, which fell to the rebels 10 days ago.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia helped Kabila fend off a rebel
offensive on the capital, Kinshasa, in mid-August.
	   But there have been no signs of their involvement in eastern
Congo, where the rebels reportedly advanced towards Mbuji-Mayi,
capital of the diamond-rich Eastern Kasai Province, after capturing
Kindu and its airport.
	   On Monday, Rwandan Minister of State Patrick Mazimhaka appealed
to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to persuade Kabila to seek a
political solution to the 2 1/2 monthlong war. Mazimhaka said
Rwandan and Ugandan officials had succeeded in persuading the
rebels to negotiate.
	   In South Africa, officials said President Nelson Mandela made
another attempt to get Kabila and the rebels to negotiate directly.
If successful, the negotiations could take place as early as next
week, Mazimhaka said.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. The two
countries say they have legitimate security interests in Congo and
accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common border of Rwandan and
Ugandan rebels.

Maslyukov: Russia must ratify Start II treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian official said in an interview
published Tuesday that Russia should ratify the START II arms
control treaty and begin working toward START III while maintaining
its military industry at a high level and improving its strategic
nuclear forces.
	   If Russia does not ratify START II, ``no one in the world will
understand us,'' First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov told
Krasnaya Zvezda, the daily newspaper of the Defense Ministry.
	   ``Then, we would deprive ourselves of the possibility of
influencing the process of controlling weapons of mass destruction,
which is so topical today in a world of nuclear explosions in India
and Pakistan and nuclear ambitions of a series of other
countries,'' Maslyukov was quoted as saying.
	   ``The main thing is that today, like no time before, we're
interested in normal foreign relations. A confrontation with the
West, a new, uncontrollable arms race, would be like death for
us.''
	   The START II treaty was signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S.
Senate in 1996. The treaty would halve the nuclear arsenals in both
countries.
	   But the Russian parliament has balked at ratification. Many
lawmakers say it would hurt Russia's national security and argue
the country does not have the money to destroy its weapons.
	   Maslyukov told Krasnaya Zvezda that in Russia's poor economic
situation, the armed forces could get new conventional weapons no
earlier than in 2005, and a maximum of several hundred nuclear
warheads by 2007-2010.
	   He said that the government should work with the parliament to
guarantee financing for the strategic nuclear forces, and that
hard-currency proceeds from weapons sales should be invested back
into the military industry.
	   Maslyukov also called for bringing no fewer than 35-45 Topol-M
rockets annually into Russia's arsenal after 2000, putting several
Yuri Dolgoruky-class submarines into service by 2010, modernizing
the combat guidance systems for the strategic nuclear forces ``in
extraordinary situations,'' and not permitting decay of missile
warning systems, space intelligence and navigation.

Former Philippine Muslim leader asks comrades to help release
</HEADLINE>
kidnap victims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Muslim guerrilla leader
has asked his comrades to help open new negotiations with
kidnappers who are holding 10 people, including five foreigners,
his spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Moro National Liberation Front founder Nur Misuari, now governor
of an autonomous Muslim region, is using thousands of former
followers in efforts to contact disgruntled former rebels suspected
of involvement in the spate of kidnappings in the south, said his
spokesman, Abdurahman Jamasali.
	   Jamasali said Misuari began talks with his former followers
after President Joseph Estrada sought his help Saturday to solve
the kidnappings. Other negotiators failed to make headway in more
than a month of talks.
	   He said Misuari, who has assumed overall responsibility in the
negotiations, formed committees to open new talks with the
different kidnappers. Misuari also asked the military to halt
rescue efforts that could endanger the new talks.
	   The victims were abducted in separate incidents last month. They
include an Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti; the family
of a Taiwanese businessman; and two Hong Kong citizens and a
Malaysian.
	   One of two wealthy Filipino traders seized recently by
kidnappers in Mindanao was released Friday in a forest and rescued
by government troops. Hours after his release, another businessman
was taken by a group of armed men.
	   Kidnappings are rampant in the Philippines despite a
high-profile government attempt to eliminate them.
	   Misuari's MNLF was the biggest Muslim rebel faction until it
signed a peace agreement with the government in 1996. Two smaller
groups are still at war with the government.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the month since former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was arrested, Malaysia's once-dormant
opposition groups have become more strident and calls for the prime
minister to resign have spread.
	   Demonstrations against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad have
become commonplace, even in rural areas, and despite stern police
warnings and hundreds of arrests.
	   On Saturday, police for the first time resorted to whipping
protesters with canes when water cannons failed to contain the
10,000 who had marched in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali appealed to Malaysians
on Tuesday to stop the protests, saying in the New Straits Times
newspaper that those disenchanted with Mahathir should wait until
the general election to express their frustrations. The election
must be held by 2000.
	   But from his jail cell on the outskirts of the capital, Anwar
has accused Mahathir of abusing his power to crush the dissent.
	   ``It is time for change,'' said Anwar, who was arrested Sept. 20
on charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He says he
was beaten unconscious by police that night, and insists the
charges have been trumped up by his political opponents.
	   For now, Mahathir appears to be in control. But the fierce
protests are a first in a nation where even opposition parties
never used to hold demonstrations.
	   Riding the wave of popular sympathy for Anwar, nearly a dozen
Islamic opposition groups have pushed themselves onto the national
scene.
	   Never before active in national politics, they now hold news
conferences, circulate statements and organize street protests that
have drawn thousands in Kuala Lumpur and other towns. The efforts
are spearheaded by the main Islamic opposition group, the Parti
Islam SeMalaysia, or PAS.
	   Dozens of volunteer agencies have joined the protests and
university students are defying a law that bars political activity.
	   PAS and the other groups have organized huge rallies, even in
rural areas traditionally controlled by Mahathir's party.
	   Mahathir's refusal to name a replacement for his imprisoned
former heir-apparent has created uncertainties in a nation where
there has always been a No. 2 man to smooth transfers of power.
	   Unlike in many other Asian countries, the Malaysian military has
traditionally stayed out of politics and there has never been the
threat of a coup.
	   Mahathir, 72, says he will allow the party to choose Anwar's
successor, but the new person may have to wait for some time to
reach the top slot.
	   ``I have to give some time for my successor to do his work
before I can step down. I don't know how long,'' he said over the
weekend.
	   Mahathir, who has undergone one heart bypass operation, has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years. He became Asia's longest-serving
leader after Indonesia's President Suharto was ousted in May.
	   While the government-controlled press has remained largely
silent about the growing protests, Anwar has managed to irritate
the government by continuing to grab international attention.
	   His 18-year-old daughter, Nurul Izzah, infuriated Mahathir by
traveling overseas last week to meet the presidents of Indonesia
and the Philippines.
	   In the first pro-government rally since Anwar's arrest, several
hundred Malaysians demonstrated in front of the Philippine Embassy
in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday, protesting Philippine President Joseph
Estrada's open support of Anwar.
	   ``You go look after your own country,'' said a poster held by
several women wearing T-shirts with Mahathir's image.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following ethnic Albanian attacks on
Serb police, the government has moved tanks and troops into a
frontline in central Kosovo, raising fears for future of the the
U.S.-brokered agreement to end the violence in the province.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark visits Belgrade on Tuesday to
discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to meet the
alliance's Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo or face
airstrikes.
	   Also Tuesday, a 20-member U.N. team is heading for Kosovo to
serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in
the province. The team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, is
expected to stay until Friday and gather information on efforts to
halt the fighting.
	   The visits were set amid increased signs of battle preparedness
in parts of Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   More Yugoslav army troops were positioned southwest of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital, after a surge of weekend violence that left
three Serb policemen dead and led to mutual accusations between
authorities and radical Albanians on who started the bloodshed.
	   Western officials, concerned about the skirmishes, indicated
that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were to blame.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday the
skirmishing was unacceptable, regardless of which side opened fire
first.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on separatists, and
hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes to escape the
violence. As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian
disaster if the refugees are not allowed to return home.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Yugoslavia were
distressed about the agreement Holbrooke reached last week with
President Slobodan Milosevic. The agreement headed off NATO
airstrikes against Serb forces for the time being, disappointing
ethnic Albanians who want outright independence.
	   A 2,000-member international verification force is being
organized by the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia honors its
promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the monitors are
in Kosovo.
	   Rubin said U.S. mediator Christopher Hill was telling Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas they should not try to provoke Serb
forces into taking actions that would heighten the possibility of
airstrikes against them.
	   It would be a mistake, Rubin said, for the rebel group ``to
consider NATO its air force. That will not be tolerated by the
U.S.''
	   He said Yugoslav compliance with commitments to disarm in Kosovo
has been mixed. Over the past month, he said, about half of the
Yugoslav Army units that had moved into Kosovo earlier this year
have left the province.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed this year in Milosevic's
crackdown on separatists, and hundreds of thousands more have fled
their homes to escape the violence.
	   In Paris, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Monday the
recent upsurge in violence doesn't undermine the accord on Kosovo.
	   ``I think there are provocateurs and provocations, but we must
continue to hold the line'' and carry out the accord, Solana said.
	   Milosevic has until Oct. 27 to reduce the level of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces in Kosovo or face airstrikes by the Atlantic
alliance.
	   Solana avoided comment on how pressure could be placed on the
Kosovo Albanians not to attack the Serb forces.
	   The Yugoslav army troops who moved out of Pristina to the
southwest on Sunday are normally stationed in the capital, and
therefore could remain in the province under the withdrawal plan.
	   Serb officials on Monday again blamed the violence on the KLA,
saying the guerrillas want to provoke a fight that would jeopardize
the agreement and bring NATO intervention.
	   The worsening security situation was documented by the Sunday
disappearance of two journalists working for Yugoslavia's state-run
Tanjug news agency in the area of the newest violence.
	   The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it feared
they were abducted by the Kosovo Liberation Army and demanded their
release.

Western journalists during its invasion of East Timor 23 years ago,
including new allegations that Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah
personally ordered the killings.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Tuesday that a
Timorese member of the attacking force, Olandino Maia Guterres,
claims that the journalists were killed by plainclothes Indonesian
special forces under the direct command of Capt. Yunus Yosfiah.
	   The ABC said Capt. Yunus used the alias Major Andreas at the
time and that he is now the minister of information in President
B.J. Habibie's government.
	   Guterres said four of the journalists were shot and one was
knifed in the back while trying to surrender, the ABC reported. He
heard Capt. Yunus shout to his men: ``Just shoot. Just shoot,'' it
added.
	   Minister of Information Lt. Gen. Mohammad Yunus, who was
previously known as Yunus Yosfiah, denied Tuesday that he was
involved in the killings.
	   ``People can say anything. But I was not involved,'' Yunus told
reporters in Jakarta.
	   The British newspaper Independent reported Monday that in a
meeting in Jakarta last month, Habibie had promised an
investigation to British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian government
would welcome a closer examination of the killings by Indonesia,
and that suggestions Yunus was involved had been around for some
time.
	   ``But we don't make selections about who Indonesian ministers
are and we don't have any control over the Indonesian judicial
system either, so it's a matter for them to investigate,'' Downer
told ABC radio.
	   ``If they do investigate the murder or death of the journalists
in 1975 then we'd welcome that.''
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens; reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and soundman
Tony Stewart, 21, both Australians; and cameraman Gary Cunningham,
27, a New Zealander, were killed in an attack against independence
fighters on Balibo village on Oct. 16, 1975.
	   Indonesia claims the men were killed in a cross fire. But
allegations they were deliberately targeted by Indonesian troops
during the invasion have persisted.
	   An Australian inquiry in 1996 found there was no deliberate
attempt to eliminate the men.
	   East Timor independence campaigner and Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Jose Ramos Horta said Yunus was one of many people in
positions of power in Indonesia who were involved in the killings.
	   He said an Indonesian government investigation could not be
trusted.
	   ``If President Habibie wants to show his good faith in
investigating the killing of the Australian and British and New
Zealand journalists, then at least involve some international
independent experts,'' Horta said.
	   ``Otherwise it will be a whitewash again by the Indonesians
because there are many people involved in the killing of the
journalists who are still there in power.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon snubbed
Yasser Arafat during their first face-to-face encounter, while the
Palestinian leader stood up and saluted his one-time nemesis during
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace talks.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Arafat were holding talks Monday night when Netanyahu
announced: ``General Sharon has arrived,'' Israel radio said.
	   Arafat got up and saluted Sharon, but the Israeli minister
strode past him, then pointedly shook hands with Clinton and
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The U.S. organizers tried to break the ice between the two by
seating them across from each other, to no avail.
	   Arafat's adviser, Ahmed Tibi, said Sharon's refusal to shake
hands was inappropriate for a diplomat. ``This is superfluous and
petty'' Tibi said of Sharon's behavior.
	   As defense minister in the early 1980s, Sharon invaded Lebanon
to drive Arafat's PLO guerrillas out and succeeded in forcing the
Palestinian leader and thousands of his fighters to leave Beirut.
	   Sharon has labeled the Palestinian leader a ``terrorist'' and
insisted even after being named Israel's foreign minister earlier
this month that he would not shake Arafat's hand.
	   Netanyahu appointed Sharon to the new job in an apparent effort
to appease nationalist critics in his coalition who have warned
against making concessions to the Palestinians.

Former Chilean dictator vows he'll fight extradition to Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Spanish magistrate has broadened his charges
against former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to include
genocide, while a Chilean exile group reportedly plans to bring
criminal proceedings against him in Britain.
	   The 82-year-old former strongman, arrested Friday in his
hospital bed in London, vowed Monday to fight attempts to extradite
him to Spain. His lawyers argued that his arrest at a London clinic
violated his diplomatic immunity.
	   The exile group, Chile Democratico, indicated it will bring the
charges in London under a law that allows anyone to launch criminal
proceedings as long as they are willing to fund them, today's
Guardian newspaper reported. If the proceedings go forward and
Pinochet is found guilty, he could face jail time.
	   ``If we allow Pinochet to go to Spain, it will be very difficult
to get him back here,'' group spokeswoman Julia Gonzales told the
newspaper.
	   Chile's ambassador to Britain delivered a formal protest to the
Foreign Office on Monday. And Pinochet said through his lawyers
that he is confident he'll win the legal battle.
	   ``Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP,'' said the statement
by the London law firm Kingsley Napley. ``Permission for him to
enter and stay in this country was stamped in his diplomatic
passport.''
	   Meanwhile, Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon widened the basis
of his original detention request to include charges of genocide,
torture and murder in the disappearance of 94 people, mostly
Chileans.
	   Diplomatic immunity does not apply in cases of genocide.
	   Pinochet, who is expected to be hospitalized for two more weeks,
faces a long battle through British courts to avoid extradition,
questioning by Garzon and another Spanish judge who instigated the
proceedings, and a humiliating appearance before London's Bow
Street magistrate's court.
	   Pinochet's 17-year-rule in Chile was marked by torture and other
human rights abuses against political opponents in which more than
4,000 were killed or vanished. He remained Chilean army
commander-in-chief until March and is immune from prosecution in
Chile as a senator-for-life.
	   Britain says diplomatic immunity is reserved for accredited
diplomats or foreign government officials on official visits, which
doesn't cover Pinochet.
	   But lawmakers of the opposition Conservative Party accused Prime
Minister Tony Blair's 18-month-old Labor Party government of
``gesture politics.''
	   In Conservative government days, Pinochet was welcomed on
regular visits that included tea with former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
	   The Times of London reported today that Pinochet was entertained
by Thatcher at her home on Oct. 5, four days before he had a spine
operation.
	   Chilean ambassador Mario Artaza said Pinochet was sedated when
police woke him up with the arrest warrant. ``He didn't understand
what was going on and the doctors treating him were taken out from
his room,'' Artaza said.
	   Garzon, the Spanish magistrate, is probing Pinochet's alleged
role in Operation Condor, in which military juntas in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay cooperated to snuff out opposition to their
rule in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Presidents of those South American countries condemned the
arrest Monday, saying Garzon had no authority to try crimes
committed outside Spain.
	   Another Spanish judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, who is
investigating human rights violations in Chile, also has asked to
question Pinochet in London.
	   The Spanish government has opposed the probes, saying they could
set a bad precedent and upset delicate political dynamics in
countries that suffered years of military rule.
	   Spanish prosecutors say Garzon has no jurisdiction outside Spain
and moved Monday to block his planned trip to London.

Philippine police seize cocaine, methamphetamine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Customs police on Tuesday seized more
than half a kilogram (more than a pound) of cocaine in a parcel
sent from Brazil to a woman already in custody on charges of heroin
smuggling, officials said.
	   Customs official Celso Templo said the cocaine was addressed to
Minda Santos, who was arrested Oct. 10 as she collected another
package containing nearly half a kilogram (one pound) of heroin
from Thailand.
	   ``The packages were sent out at the same time but had different
dates of arrival,'' Templo said.
	   Templo said the cocaine, valued at 30 million pesos (about dlrs
700,000), originated from Brazil.
	   The cocaine was to be shipped to the United States, as was the
heroin that was seized earlier, he said.
	   In a related development, police said they arrested a Chinese
man Monday as he tried to sell three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of
crystal methamphetamine, locally known as ``shabu,'' to a police
officer posing as a buyer.
	   The man, identified as Willy Chong, will be charged with drug
trafficking, which carries the death penalty in the Philippines.

Vietnamese party chief warns of increased drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Despite intensified government efforts,
drug trafficking is on the rise in Vietnam, with bigger quantities
of hard drugs and formation of international mafia-like gangs,
according to a warning from Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu.
	   Phieu told a conference Monday that drugs are a more dangerous
enemy than outside invaders because they can ruin a nation.
	   The newspaper Youth reported Tuesday that he urged law
enforcement agencies and citizens to step up efforts to stop drug
trafficking from outside the country and educate residents,
especially ethnic minorities, not to grow poppy plants.
	   Phieu was addressing a two-day conference reviewing
implementation of a year-old decision by the prime minister on
fighting drugs in 1998-2000.
	   Nguyen Duc Minh, deputy director general of the General
Department of Customs, said his agency has been equipped with
better facilities to detect drugs at checkpoints.
	   Drug-detecting dogs will be deployed at Hanoi's Noibai
International Airport and a checkpoint in central Quang Tri
province bordering Laos, Minh said.
	   A report at the conference said courts have sentenced 34 drug
traffickers to death and 19 others to life in prison in the first
eight months of 1998 among 4,306 drug-related defendants in 2,807
cases.
	   This brings the number of drug-related death penalties to 83 and
life sentences to 60 since 1993, when the government launched a
national anti-drug program.
	   The report said there are 80,000 drug addicts with police
records nationwide, including 9,611 in Hanoi and 10,038 in Ho Chi
Minh City.
	   It is estimated there are 134,000 drug addicts in Vietnam.
	   The report said law enforcement forces in the first eight months
this year have discovered 11,075 people involved in drugs in 5,347
cases and seized 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of heroin and 588
kilograms (1,296 pounds) of opium.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stock prices gain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS UP with late dollar, bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Buying by government funds sent Japanese stock
prices higher Tuesday for the third consecutive session. The U.S.
dollar edged up against the yen.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 240.85
points, or 1.78 percent, closing at 13,808.05 _ its highest level
since Oct. 7. On Monday, the Nikkei had gained 286.66 points, or
2.16 percent.
	   Government funds snapped up shares ahead of the listing of NTT
Mobile Communications Network Inc., or NTT DoCoMo, causing a late
surge after the Nikkei had hovered above Monday's closing level for
most of the session.
	   NTT DoCoMO, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, is
scheduled to go public Thursday, and government funds have been
anxious to prop up the market to make sure the launch is a success.
	   An overnight gain on Wall Street also encouraged investors in
Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.69 points _ or 0.6 percent _ closing
Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   ``With the recent strong recovery in U.S. stocks and ahead of
DoCoMo's major debut, the Tokyo market's sentiment has improved
substantially,'' said Takeshi Kubota, general manager at Meiko
Securities Co.
	   Many investors remained cautious, however, waiting to see
whether the government would enact additional stimulus measures to
lift Japan's moribund economy, dealers said.
	   Kaoru Yosano, head of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, told reporters Monday that the government may come up
with a new set of economic stimulus measures next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, to 1,043.02. It
had climbed 16.24 points, or 1.61 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 422 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 470.99 million
Monday. Advances outnumbered retreats 764 to 335, while 186 issues
were unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 115.14 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.42 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its
New York level of 114.28 yen late Monday.
	   The dollar's strength against the German mark led Japanese
short-term players to buy back the U.S. currency against the yen.
	   The dollar continued to benefit from speculation that Germany's
central bank might lower interest rates at its policy-setting
meeting Thursday, traders said.
	   But they said overall sentiment for the dollar remains weak.
Fears that hedge funds may continue to unwind long dollar positions
and concerns about the health of the U.S. economy are leading many
traders to dump the dollar when it rises.
	   ``Right now, market strategy is operating on unease more than
anything else,'' said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign exchange manager
at Nomura Trust and Banking. ``Overseas hedge funds are still
lowering their dollar exposure, spurring selling by everyone else
in the market.''
	   The U.S. currency ranged between 114.35 yen and 115.60 yen in
Tuesday's trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.810 percent from Monday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price up to 108.86 yen from 108.82 yen.

Greek Cypriots, Greeks begin six-day war games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus began Tuesday a six-day
joint war exercise in which thousands of Greek Cypriot troops will
be joined by Greek warplanes and ships, state radio reported.
	   The participation of Greek jets is certain to heighten tension
in Cyprus between NATO partners and arch-rivals Greece and Turkey.
	   Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974,
when it invaded the island following a coup by Greek Cypriots who
wanted to unite Cyprus with Greece.
	   Greeks and Turkish Cypriots have been living apart since, with a
U.N. force patrolling a cease fire line separating the two
communities.
	   Speaking on state radio, Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said
an air base near the western town of Paphos would be used during
the war games, suggesting that Greek warplanes would land there.
	   The Greek Cypriots don't have an air force and the facility,
completed in February, was built for use only by Greek warplanes
under a 1993 defense pact between the Greek Cypriots and the
Greeks, their closest allies.
	   Tension rose dramatically on the island last March when Greek
jets landed at the base. Turkey responded by dispatching its own
warplanes to the north of the island to show its support for
Turkish Cypriots , who declared a breakaway state in 1983 in the
northern third of Cyprus.
	   The Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally
recognized administration on the island, whose unofficial division
since 1974 has over the years frustrated many attempts by the
United Nations and others to reconcile the two communities.
	   The latest bid by the United Nations to reunite the island
started last week when New Zealander Ann Hercus, the U.N. envoy in
Cyprus, began separate talks with Greek Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
	   The U.N. says the talks are open-ended and without an agenda.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ One of Greece's largest media groups began
selling shares Tuesday in the first step by a major publisher to
list on the fast-growing Athens Stock Exchange.
	   Lambrakis Press, whose holdings include Greece's top-selling
daily Ta Nea, is offering up to 21 percent of the company to
investors.
	   Five million shares are being floated at 3,500 drachmas (dlrs
12.50) each, while a further 250,000 shares will be privately
placed with employees and others, the company said. The offer ends
Friday. It was not immediately known when Lambrakis would be listed
on the exchange.
	   Lambrakis also publishes the English-language newspaper Athens
News, the weekly To Vima and business and general interest
magazines. Ta Nea's daily circulation is about 100,000.
	   The company's 1997 consolidated pre-tax earnings were 4 billion
drachmas (dlrs 14 million), compared with 6.1 billion drachmas
(21.7 billion) in 1996, according to Egnatia Securities.
	   Lambrakis is the first large publishing group to offer shares.
Shareholders also have a minority stake in Tiletypos, the operator
of the private Mega television channel.

Philippine official: use of ASEAN currencies in regional trade not
</HEADLINE>
viable &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments Tuesday by economic planning
secretary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A proposal to use local currencies
instead of U.S. dollars in trading within Southeast Asia is not
viable, a Philippine official said Tuesday.
	   Officials in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have
proposed the scheme as a way to lessen the region's reliance on
U.S. dollars and strengthen its economic and financial integration.
	   Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said Southeast Asian
governments could establish procedures for using regional
currencies, but the process would be too cumbersome and would not
be viable in the long run.
	   He said businessmen would prefer dollars because they are easier
to convert and not likely to lose value rapidly.
	   Medalla compared holding a regional currency to owning an
expensive painting.
	   ``If you have two months to sell it you're OK, but if you are
forced to sell it today because your kid is in the hospital, you're
likely to lose a lot,'' he said.
	   He said central banks in the region would have to maintain
substantial reserves of ASEAN currencies to make trading with those
currencies viable. However, doing so would be risky because the
currencies could lose their value and result in huge losses.
	   In the case of the Philippines, the peso can be readily swapped
with the dollar because it is traded in large volumes on the
foreign exchange market, Medalla said.
	   A leading Filipino businessman, Jose Concepcion, said recently
that the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei plan to have a framework ready for bilateral trade payments
using local currencies by the end of the second quarter of 1999.
	   Concepcion, who heads a committee representing ASEAN's chambers
of commerce and industry, said the less developed members of ASEAN
_ Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam _ are not expected to participate in
the scheme for some time.
	   Medalla said he was aware the Philippines is supporting the
scheme but that he has told other Philippine economic officials
that it is not viable.
	   In a report to ASEAN trade ministers who met recently in Manila,
ASEAN secretary-general Rodolfo Severino said the group recognized
the initiative isn't a ``cure-all'' for the continued volatility of
regional currencies.
	   But he said there was good reason to hope the bilateral payments
would help, given the magnitude of intra-ASEAN trade, which totaled
dlrs 86 billion in 1997.

Incoming German chancellor faces fire over tax plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said he
would look at tweaking his incoming government's tax reform plans
to ease any negative effects on small businesses.
	   Schroeder said he would look to see whether ``one or the other
measure'' could be changed, ``for example, possibilities for giving
tax breaks for investments.''
	   His comments to German television Monday night came amid broad
criticism of the center-left coalition's proposed tax reform as
insufficient to make a significant dent in Germany's high
unemployment rate _ Schroeder's key campaign promise.
	   Germany's six leading economic institutes, in a report released
Tuesday, said the plan was too limited and ``would hardly
contribute to higher growth and more employment.''
	   Announced last week, the proposal stresses cuts for lower and
medium-income households with the hope of boosting domestic demand
and creating jobs.
	   But business groups call it a job-killer for raising the burden
on family-owned firms. The Federation of German Industry on Monday
called for more radical tax cuts for entrepreneurs as investment
incentives.
	   Schroeder's intended economics minister, Jost Stollmann, refused
the post at the last minute Monday partly because of what he said
were imbalances in the tax plan.
	   ``I'm worried whether the framework exists to combat
unemployment,'' he said.
	   The economics institutes also criticized another of the new
government's job-creation plans: raising energy taxes to help
finance cuts in non-wage labor costs.
	   While an ``ecological tax reform'' may make sense for promoting
energy conservation, most studies have found little effect on the
job market, they said.
	   Nevertheless, the institutes said they expected unemployment to
continue its slow downward trend, although mainly in the west. New
jobs created in eastern states in recent months were almost
entirely due to government-financed make-work measures, they said.
	   The institutes predicted the average jobless rate for 1998 would
be 11.2 percent and drop to 10.7 percent next year.
	   While they called for a more radical tax reform, including
lowering tax rates and closing loopholes, they underlined that the
government will have to meet the 3 percent deficit-to-GDP ratio
stipulated in the European stability and growth pact for the coming
single currency.
	   To achieve that goal, the institutes recommend further cuts in
public spending.
	   They revised their forecast for economic growth in 1999 downward
to 2.3 percent from 2.7 percent last spring, blaming the effects of
global economic crises.

Malaysian leader says dissident trying to avoid trial

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim is trying
to use street protests to topple the government and avoid facing
trial, the country's prime minister said Tuesday.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as deputy
prime minister and finance chief last month. The dissident was
subsequently arrested after launching a campaign calling for
Mahathir's ouster.
	   ``He is hoping that the Malaysian government will ... be brought
down by street demonstrations,'' Mahathir told reporters in Tokyo.
``If that happens, of course, he will not be tried.''
	   Mahathir said that Anwar _ his former protege and heir apparent
_ was also planning to come back into power as prime minister after
overthrowing the government.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. He
has appeared in court with a black eye and a neck brace, accusing
police of beating him.
	   Demonstrations by thousands calling for Anwar's release have
posed the most serious threat yet to Mahathir's 17 years in office.
	   Mahathir was quoted as saying Tuesday at a separate seminar that
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, could be arrested if she gets involved
in demonstrations in support of her husband.
	   ``I hope the police won't arrest (her), but I don't know. That
is the police business,'' Japan's Kyodo News agency quoted Mahathir
as saying.
	   Azizah appeared briefly Saturday at a rally of some 10,000 Anwar
supporters in Kuala Lumpur. She has been warned by police that she
would be arrested if she tried to rally support for Anwar, Mahathir
said.
	   Mahathir spoke at the end of a five-day trip to Japan, where he
met with business leaders and bankers. Malaysia is negotiating with
Tokyo for aid to help it survive the Asian financial crisis.
	   Mahathir said the Malaysian economy has shown signs of
improvement since he pegged the Malaysian ringgit to the dollar and
limited trading in the currency to prevent speculative attacks.
	   International reserves are rising, the balance of trade is
improving and sales of autos and homes _ hard hit by Asian economic
turmoil _ are creeping back up, he said.
	   ``There are many other statistical figures to show that after
the exchange control had been initiated, business has improved and
the economy is picking up,'' Mahathir said.
	   The Malaysian leader also lashed out at the foreign media,
accusing them of unfairly criticizing his government's economic
policies and favoring Anwar in his court fight.
	   ``The media has decided that the government of Malaysia is bad,
wrong,'' he said. ``It is the media that has convicted the
government _ not the government that has convicted Anwar.''
	   The arrest and Anwar's treatment in jail have attracted
attention among Malaysia's neighbors. Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has been sympathetic to Anwar, and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi reportedly expressed concern about the case in a
meeting with Mahathir on Monday night.
	   Mahathir said Tuesday that Anwar will be tried fairly by
independent courts, and he said other countries were free to
express their opinions _ whether or not they were justified.

Primakov: Russian government might print money to pay wage debts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday that the government might print new money to pay off its
huge debts, but pledged that any boost in the money supply would be
backed by hard currency reserves.
	   The government will pay off its wage debts to state workers
before the end of the year and resolve all back wages to the
military by the end of January, Primakov said after meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin. He said that the debts owed to pensioners
could not be paid until the end of next year.
	   Primakov said that the government might need to print new money
to cover the debts, but insisted that the amount would be ``very
insignificant'' and fully backed by gold and hard currency
reserves.
	   The Russian government has been promising to pay off wage
arrears for years, yet millions of workers still receive their
salaries months late.
	   The government's has been unable to collect the taxes to pay off
the debts, and the two-month-old economic crisis has made the
situation worse.
	   Primakov is trying to develop a plan to deal with the crisis,
and a draft budget for the final three months of the year has a
deficit of around 100 billion rubles (dlrs 6 billion).
	   In another development, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told
investors that the government will have to ask the Central Bank to
print new money.
	   The practice led to high inflation in 1992-94, and the
government had pursued tight money policies in recent years, which
brought down inflation and made the ruble relatively stable until
the crisis hit in August.
	   Inflation in Russia is up about 50 percent this year, and could
hit 200 or even 300 percent by year's end, the Central Bank has
forecast.
	   Russia ``can't escape the use of the Central Bank to finance the
budget,'' Vyugin said, but didn't say how much money the bank might
need to print.
	   Primakov on Tuesday assailed the economic policies of the
previous governments as the root of the current crisis and called
for more state control over the economy.
	   ``The theory that the market will resolve everything on its own
hasn't justified itself,'' Primakov said at a meeting with Russian
industrialists. ``The state must assume regulatory functions and
ensure order in the country before real market relations take
root.''
	   The new government has only taken stop-gap measures and has yet
to offer a comprehensive economic program.
	   ``We are doing everything deliberately slowly in order not to
deceive anyone,'' Primakov said at the start of his meeting with
Yeltsin. ``We could have invented some flashy action, but the
government is doing serious work and is only going to take real
steps to stabilize the situation.''
	   The International Monetary Fund wants the government to provide
a credible economic plan as a condition for the delivery of the
next disbursement of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that was
frozen when the crisis hit.
	   An IMF team was en route to Moscow on Tuesday for more talks,
but little is expected to come of the visit.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of French police were placed on maximum
alert Tuesday to prevent disturbances during high school students'
second major nationwide protest in less than a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of high school students were expected to
demonstrate across the country to press demands for more teachers,
better equipment and buildings and a lighter course load.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities.
	   Hours ahead of the Paris march, groups of students began
arriving at the starting point in the Place d'Italie, in southern
Paris. The march route ends at a major Left Bank intersection, not
far from the National Assembly, where lawmakers were to debate the
new budget.
	   ``Our buildings are old, and our computers are terrible. We have
too many kids in our classes. All we want is to be able to study
properly,'' said Gwladys Dumot, 15, from suburban Yerre, south of
Paris.
	   Wary of the political damage done by university student protests
30 years ago, the government appears to be taking no chances in
letting Tuesday's demonstrations get out of control.
	   At least 4,000 police were mobilized to contain any outbreaks of
violence among Paris protesters.
	   Police planned to follow the Paris demonstration on television
monitors in the basement of their headquarters in hopes of
identifying hooligans. Police technicians set up monitoring cameras
Tuesday morning at the Place d'Italie and towed cars from streets.
Cafes, hairdressers, even banks, were closed.
	   Extra police were to be deployed in suburban trains leading to
Paris.
	   Adult monitors wearing white helmets also were to march
alongside the students to help maintain calm.
	   The government has promised to provide more money soon, but it
has no quick remedy for the ailing education system or for high
youth unemployment _ a deep fear for many French teen-agers.
	   But Dumot and other students were skeptical their demands would
be satisfied.
	   ``I would be very surprised if the government can do anything.
It costs a lot of money. We won't see anything, but we're fighting
for those students who come after us,'' said Spresa Mamud, 15.
	   Both girls were roughed up in last week's demonstration, and
they worry that violence could overwhelm Tuesday's protest.
	   ``There are those who come just to make trouble, and I'm worried
that we might lose because of them,'' said Dumot.
	   Last Thursday's student protests were badly marred by violence,
instigated, officials said, mainly by rowdy youths bent on
disrupting the demonstrations.
	   Some 150 people were arrested. In Paris, five people were
injured, 50 shops were looted and more than 100 cars were damaged,
some of them burned.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, a former Education Minister, have promised to come up with
funds to prevent the crisis from deepening.
	   Six weeks after the school year has begun, some students are
still without teachers. Many schools, especially in disadvantaged
working-class neighborhoods, are badly in need of modernization.
	   Polls show the students have widespread public support. And at
least two teachers' unions called on their members to join
Tuesday's march.

Record number of bodies found in Japan's `suicide forest'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a grisly trend authorities suspect is linked to
Japan's souring economy, a record number of suicide victims have
been found this year in a sprawling forest at the foot of Mount
Fuji.
	   More than 300 police and firefighters scoured the huge forest
southwest of Tokyo on Tuesday in an annual search for victims. They
found three bodies, bringing to 58 the number found in the area
this year.
	   The previous record was set in 1994, when 57 bodies were found
in the forest, which investigators have been searching for suicide
victims once a year since 1971. Last year, 55 were found.
	   The forest is considered a prime suicide spot because of its
isolation, and was recommended in a book about suicide a few years
ago, said Masaaki Mochizuki, spokesman for Fujiyoshida police.
	   Mochizuki said it was unclear why more people are committing
suicide there, but Kyodo News agency quoted unidentified
authorities as saying the country's deep recession could be behind
the increase.
	   Suicide in Japan is often seen as an honorable way out of a
shameful situation, and experts say more Japanese are killing
themselves rather than bear the humiliation of failure in business
or at work.
	   In 1997, a total of 24,391 Japanese killed themselves _ up 5.6
percent from 23,104 the previous year, the National Police Agency
said.
	   Japan's overall suicide rate is high, at 17.2 per 100,000
people. That compares with 12 in the United States and 7.5 in
England, but is well below Finland's 27.3, according to Japan's
Health Ministry.
	   The Aokigahara forest is as isolated as it gets in crowded
Japan. At 621 square kilometers (248 square miles), the forest _
known as the ``sea of trees'' _ covers an area the size of Tokyo.
	   The latest three victims were found Tuesday by a team of 342
police and firefighters. The other victims were discovered by
hikers, picnickers and students who explore caves in the area.
	   About 40 other people have gone to the forest to commit suicide
so far this year but failed, Mochizuki said.

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) _ A British Airways plane bound
for London made an emergency landing in eastern Canada Tuesday
after the captain noticed smoke in the cockpit.
	   The Boeing 747 had left Washington at 9:55 p.m. EDT Monday (0155
GMT Tuesday) and was due in Heathrow Tuesday morning, but the pilot
issued an emergency signal and diverted course to St. John's,
Newfoundland.
	   BA Flight 222 had 211 passengers on board when it made the
unscheduled landing about 2 a.m. local time. (0430 GMT).
	   Engineers were examining the plane and another aircraft was
diverted to collect the passengers.
	   Eric Bridges of Richmond, Virginia, said some fellow travelers
were clearly upset by the situation.
	   There have been several emergency landings in Canada ever since
a Swissair MD-11 jetliner crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia on
Sept. 2. All 229 people aboard were killed when the Swissair plane
went down attempting to reach Halifax after its pilot reported
smoke in the cockpit.
	   The investigation into that crash continues but authorities
suspect a faulty type of common wiring insulation may be to blame.

Thai-Malaysian joint venture ships first LPG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai-Malaysian joint venture on
Tuesday made its first delivery of liquefied petroleum gas from
southern Thailand to Malaysia, Thailand's state oil company
announced.
	   KELOIL-PTT LPG was set up for LPG bottling and wholesale
operations in northern Malaysia. It is 60 percent owned by the
Malaysian company KELOIL and 40 percent by the state Petroleum
Authority of Thailand.
	   The shipment made Tuesday from the Songkhla Petroleum terminal
in southern Thailand will be bottled by the company at Bachok in
Kota Bharu in Malaysia's Kelantan State and then distributed to
customers.
	   About 1,300 tons of LPG will be sent each month to a 140-ton LPG
storage tank and a bottling plant with a capacity of 3,500 tons a
month, recently completed at a cost of dlrs 6.2 million.
	   A second-stage, dlrs 16.8 million investment is planned to
construct a 2,000-ton storage tank and a 1,000-ton capacity jetty,
while dlrs 2.9 million is earmarked for another bottling plant with
a 3,500-ton per month capacity.
	   Most Malaysian LPG bottling plants are in central and southern
Malaysia. Plants set up in Malaysia's northern states can be easily
supplied from Thailand's Songkhla Petroleum Terminal and Khanom Gas
Separation Plant, the Thai company said.

Trucks block road on Russian-Azeri border to demand lower taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 150 trucks blocked a checkpoint on the
border with Azerbaijan for a third day Tuesday to demand lower
customs duties on produce from the Caucasus nation, a news report
said.
	   Drivers of the trucks said they will keep blocking the
one-kilometer (half-mile) stretch of the road through the
Yarag-Kazmalyar checkpoint in Russia's southern republic of
Dagestan until customs duties are lowered, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A delegation of customs officials from Dagestan and the federal
headquarters in Moscow was to meet with the protesters, who are
also demanding that senior officials on the Dagestani customs
committee be fired, the report said.
	   Dagestani officials say they have no power to resolve the
conflict, because customs rates are established by the Russian
government, ITAR-Tass reported. They also said the protest was
staged to destabilize the situation in the restive republic of
Dagestan.
	   This is the third such incident in two months, ITAR-Tass said.

South Korea to compete in 33 events in Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Despite its economic woes, South Korea
plans to send 710 athletes to compete in all but three of the 36
events at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, officials said
Tuesday.
	   No South Koreans will compete in wushu or karate _ both martial
arts _ or in the South Asian tag-like sport of kabaddi, officials
at the Korea Sports Council said.
	   ``Because of the bad economy, we couldn't form a bigger
delegation. But we did our best to keep our delegation to the level
of the last games,'' said Hur Eun-hee, a council official.
	   At the last Asian Games, in 1994 in Hiroshima, Japan, 725 South
Korean athletes competed in 31 of the 33 events, winning 63 gold,
56 silver and 64 bronze medals. South Korea ranked third out of 43
countries in Hiroshima.
	   The Asian Games are held every four years.

	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying British holiday-makers
collided with a car early Tuesday near this Aegean port, killing at
least six people and injuring 35 others, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   The tourists were traveling to Izmir's airport from Kusadasi,
and were on their way home to Britain from the resort.
	   Anatolia initially reported that the bus collided with a car at
2:20 a.m. (2220 GMT), killing all five passengers in the car and
two Britons on the bus. It later said five car passengers and one
British tourist were killed.
	   The driver and passengers in the car were believed to be
Turkish, said Anita McErlean, a spokeswoman for the British holiday
company Airtours, which hired the bus.
	   The British embassy and consulate in Izmir said they could only
confirm the death of one British woman.
	   The bus was carrying 40 people, including 38 tourists, a tour
company representative and the driver, when it collided head-on
with a taxi, McErlean said.
	   She said several bus passengers were undergoing treatment for
injuries at four local hospitals. A British consulate official said
several bus passengers were in a serious condition and were
undergoing operations.
	   Meanwhile some passengers have been released from hospital, the
British embassy said, and Airtours was expected to repatriate them
later Tuesday or Wednesday.
	   The identities of the victims were not immediately available.
Police were unavailable for comment.

Cook says West will oppose separatist aspirations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Western nations will continue opposing
the aspirations of ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo for full
independence from Yugoslavia, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Tuesday.
	   He said Britain is ``firmly committed to the territorial
integrity and security of the countries in this region.''
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters after
talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   Cook arrived late Monday on the first stop on a Balkan tour
during which he is also scheduled to visit Romania and Macedonia.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Office said, Cook may meet leaders of
Kosovo Albanians.
	   On Monday, Cook said in London that Britain will continue
pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure he
complies with agreements made to end civilian deaths and fighting
in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during more
than seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. Some 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been displaced from their homes in the province,
which is predominantly ethnic Albanian.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher
Tuesday, boosted by hefty gains in Tokyo and expectations of
further cuts in local interest rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 43.70 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 9,642.75. On Monday, the index had slumped 177.96
points.
	   Turnover fell to 7.35 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 942
million) from Monday's 8.27 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.06 billion).
	   Brokers said the market reacted to gains on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, where the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 240.85 points, or 1.78 percent, to 13,808.05, its
highest level since Oct. 7.
	   They said investors also expect the Hong Kong Association of
Banks to reduce interest rates again in the coming weeks after a
0.25 percentage point cut last Friday.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 2.50 Hong Kong dollars to
175.50, Hutchison Whampoa rose 70 cents to 50.50, Sun Hung Kai

Italian premier-designate D'Alema works to finalize Cabinet list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Armed with an official mandate to lead Italy's 56th
postwar government, Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema worked
Tuesday to finalize a list of Cabinet ministers.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro asked the former Communist to
form a government Monday, after D'Alema reported that he had
assembled a parliamentary majority. D'Alema spent several days
bargaining with centrist and leftist parties to secure support.
	   D'Alema is expected to announce his Cabinet choices by Wednesday
and then go to Parliament for the vote of confidence that would
make him premier in time to attend the European Union summit in
Austria on Friday and Saturday.
	   In his first appearance as premier-designate, D'Alema joined
Scalfaro Tuesday at the presidential palace for a long-scheduled
official visit by Pope John Paul II.
	   The Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, was sharply
critical of the decision to tap D'Alema because of his Communist
past. D'Alema on Monday said he had no arguments with the pope and
had nothing to clear up.
	   D'Alema has outlined policies in line with those of former
Premier Romano Prodi, who guided Italy into the European economic
and currency union.
	   The parties in his center-left coalition pledged to pursue
privatization at the pace Prodi had set, to strive for a 35-hour
work week and to tackle unemployment with government funds linked
to private investment in infrastructure projects
	   D'Alema has also vowed to try again at constitutional reform, a
project he spearheaded but which the conservative opposition sank
earlier this year.
	   Communist hard-liners, upset by a 1999 budget they said did not
do enough to stimulate jobs, provoked the crisis which led to
Prodi's Oct. 9 resignation. Communist Refoundation's leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, has refused to join D'Alema's government.
	   Another wing of the Italian Communists, which broke away from
Refoundation over the budget impasse, have pledged support to
D'Alema.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-long center-left coalition lasted longer than
all but one government in Italy since World War II.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of French police were placed on maximum
alert Tuesday to prevent disturbances during high school students'
second major nationwide protest in less than a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of high school students were expected to
demonstrate across the country to press demands for more teachers,
better equipment and buildings and a lighter course load.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities.
	   ``No promises. Action,'' read banners at a morning march in
Bordeaux in southwest France that, police said, drew 10,000
students. A second demonstration was set for the afternoon.

Murder suspects beheaded by vigilantes in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In a gruesome wave of revenge, angry
mobs have beheaded suspects in a serial murder case and then
carried their severed heads on sticks through village streets,
police said Tuesday.
	   The parades occurred Sunday and Monday in a district at the
eastern end of the main island of Java.
	   Vigilante groups were formed after more than 150 people, many of
them Muslim clerics and others accused of witchcraft, were
mysteriously murdered. Witnesses said the killers wore masks and
dressed in black.
	   Frustrated by the seeming inability of the police and military
to end the murder spree, some village groups have taken the law
into their own hands.
	   Capt. Pangarso, police chief in Turen district, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, said a crowd beheaded three
suspects and burned another alive in the village of Wonorejo on
Sunday.
	   ``They placed one of the heads on the end of a stick, then
carried it on the back of motorcycle in a convoy that drove for
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) through the district,'' he said.
	   He said another crowd in neighboring Wonokerto village beheaded
another two suspects Monday.
	   Again a severed head was paraded in the streets along with a
mutilated body.
	   Two other police officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the killings of suspects.
	   An official at Syaiful Anwar Hospital in the nearby city of
Malang said at least 10 people have been killed in the area since
Saturday.
	   The official, who also requested anonymity, said the badly
disfigured corpses were being kept in the hospital's morgue.
	   There have been numerous reports of mob violence and killings of
murder suspects in recent days.
	   Police have arrested dozens of murder suspects but say they have
not yet established a motive for the killings that began in August.
	   Many of the dead had belonged to the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, or NU, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization.
	   Its leaders have called for calm and have condemned revenge
killings by vigilantes.
	   ``NU strictly prohibits the action of taking the law into our
own hands because this is against religious and state laws,'' The
Jakarta Post quoted Hasyim Muzadi, chairman the East Java branch of
the organization, as saying.
	   The Post quoted Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto as saying
that conflict among the country's political elite might behind the
murders.
	   Indonesia is in a state of turmoil as the nation of 202 million
people grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Political uncertainty has beset it since former President
Suharto was forced to quit power after a wave of riots and protests
in May.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to institute
sweeping democratic reforms and to hold elections next year.
	   The government has rejected a claim by NU leader Abdurahman
Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind the
killings.

Ferry from Estonia damaged in hard weather
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A ferry with a bow door similar to the
one on the doomed ferry Estonia was damaged while crossing the
Baltic Sea, officials said Tuesday.
	   There were no injuries among the 383 people aboard the Baltic
Kristina, but the incident had echoes of the 1994 Estonia sinking,
when 852 people died after high Baltic waves tore off the boat's
bow door and water poured into the vehicle deck.
	   Like the Estonia, the Baltic Kristina has a bow door that raises
like a visor to give access to the vehicle deck. Also like the
Estonia, it was travelling to Stockholm from the Estonian capital
of Tallinn.
	   The ship ''had a dent in the deck between the visor and the
vehicle ramp and damage to the gunwale and shield around the bow,''
Pekka Pirainen, an inspector with the Swedish National Maritime
Administration, was quoted as saying Tuesday by the news agency TT.
	   He said the damage appeared to be caused by high waves, he said.
	   The ship's operator, the Estline company, informed the maritime
agency of the damage after the ship arrived in Stockholm on Monday.

Congolese rebels capture 16 Zimbabwean soldiers

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese rebels captured 16 Zimbabwean
soldiers in eastern Congo, state television reported Tuesday.
	   The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. said the defense ministry
confirmed the soldiers were disarmed and taken prisoner Monday
after their troop carrier airplane landed near the eastern town of
Kabalo.
	   The defense ministry said the airplane crew believed the town
was in the hands of President Laurent Kabila's troops, not rebels
fighting to topple him, the television reported.
	   It is the first evidence of Zimbabwean involvement in eastern
Congo, where the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, had been
making steady gains since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   The rebels, in their eastern rebel stronghold of Goma, said the
Zimbabweans were taken prisoner in recent fighting.
	   ``It is true, we hold 16 Zimbabwean soldiers prisoner. They are
being treated as prisoners of war,'' rebel leader Arthur Ngoma said
by telephone from Goma.
	   Officials in Rwanda, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the prisoners were being held in Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
southwest of Goma, which fell to the rebels 10 days ago.
	   Zimbabwe has strike jets, helicopters and transporters
supporting its 3,000 troops deployed in the Congo.
	   Zimbabwean and allied southern African troops from Angola and
Namibia repulsed a rebel advance on the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, in August.
	   Last week, President Robert Mugabe held two days of talks with
Kabila in the southeastern town of Lubumbashi and said the allies
were considering advancing on rebel strongholds in the east.
	   Zimbabwe has admitted nine of its soldiers killed in fighting in
the Congo in the past two months.
	   Until now, there have been no signs of Zimbabwe's involvement in
eastern Congo, where the rebels reportedly advanced towards
Mbuji-Mayi, capital of the diamond-rich Eastern Kasai Province,
after capturing Kindu and its airport.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has launched another
attempt to get Kabila and the rebels to negotiate directly.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. The two
countries say they have legitimate security interests in Congo and
accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common border of Rwandan and
Ugandan rebels.

International Maritime Bureau condemns China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The International Maritime Bureau
condemned China on Tuesday for setting free 12 Indonesians held in
connection with the hijacking of a Malaysian-registered oil tanker.
	   In a statement obtained by The Associated Press, the
London-based bureau accused China of violating international pacts
on piracy and suggested the move was part of ``a deep plot to cover
up China's participation in criminal activity.''
	   The Malaysian government notified Beijing in June of its wish to
extradite the 12 Indonesians. They were being sought on charges of
armed robbery and hijacking of the vessel, the Petro Ranger.
Malaysia and China have an extradition treaty.
	   Chinese marine police detained the 12 Indonesians for
questioning after the vessel was discovered in Chinese waters on
April 26, but there was no word of charging the Indonesians. China
had the first option to try the men after taking them into custody.
	   According to the IMB's statement, however, Chinese authorities
released the suspected pirates on Oct. 15 and sent them back to
Indonesia.
	   ``It is unbelievable that the 12 persons who had committed a
serious offense of hijacking a vessel were simply sent home without
being prosecuted,'' said the statement signed by Jayant Abhyankar,
deputy director of the IMB, which monitors piracy worldwide.
	   ``This is not the first time the Chinese ports have been used to
shelter hijacked vessels,'' said the statement, dated Oct. 16.
	   The Petro Ranger disappeared April 17, one day after it set sail
from Singapore to Vietnam with 11,000 tons of diesel and kerosene.
The cargo was worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Chinese authorities detained the vessel on April 26 in the South
China Sea. The information was not reported until May 1.
	   China released the ship's 21-member crew on May 30 and detained
the 12 additional men suspected as hijackers for investigation.
Neither the ship's Singapore-based agent nor the Chinese
authorities have said what happened to the cargo.
	   ``Yet another attempt to deal with piracy has been thwarted by
the Chinese authorities,'' the statement said.
	   It added that repatriating the suspects was ``in blatant
disregard'' of various international pacts, notably the Rome
convention of 1988, of which China is a signatory. It obliges
member states to submit piracy cases for prosecution.
	   ``The industry can only conclude that China is not sincere about
the part it says it wants to play in international maritime
affairs,'' the statement said.

Israeli medical team barred from Qatar conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Israeli doctors have been barred from
participating in a medical conference to be held in this Gulf
sultanate in December, an organizer said Tuesday.
	   A team of three Israeli doctors had expressed interest in
attending the conference of bone specialists but was rejected, said
Nasser Abdullah al-Subeie, the conference organizer.
	   ``We refused to allow them into Qatar and refused to have them
participate in the conference,'' said al-Subeie.
	   He did not give a reason but the decision was apparently
political.
	   Qatar froze fledgling relations with Israel because of stalled
peace talks and has not accepted any Israeli delegations since an
economic conference last November.
	   More than 150 bone specialists will participate in the 6th Gulf
Cooperation Council Orthopedic Association Conference from Dec. 5
to 8, including 12 doctors from Iraq, al-Subeie said.
	   Qatar has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but established
trade ties with the Jewish state in 1995 after historic peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993.
	   Israel established a trade office in Doha but plans for a Qatari
trade mission in Israel were scrapped when hard-line Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in 1996 and reneged on the
peace agreements with the Palestinians made by his predecessors.
	   Qatar says relations with Israel will remain frozen until there
is progress in peace talks with the Palestinians.

South African firm to shake up Ugandan telecommunications market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A major South African player promises to
shake up the Ugandan telecommunications market with offers of
better service and lower rates.
	   Mobile Telephone Network officially enters the competition
Wednesday with cellular telephone service, followed by fixed phone
service in January.
	   In response, the restructured state firm, Uganda Telecomms Ltd.,
has launched an aggressive program to collect back payments from
subscribers whom it fears will switch to MTN, which is offering
free installation.
	   Private telephone service, particularly via cellphone, is
spreading rapidly in most of East Africa, with the exception of
Kenya, where the state-owned Kenya Post and Telecommunications has
not relaxed its grip.
	   MTN will soon begin service in Rwanda. It already operates in
South Africa and Swaziland. Congo, Burundi and Tanzania have had
private cellphone service for several years.
	   MTN plans to install up to 50,000 telephone lines in Uganda.
	   Its fixed line service will operate parallel to UTL, which is
being prepared for sale as part of Uganda's ongoing privatization
process.
	   The South African company said it has already invested dlrs 30
million of the dlrs 70 million it plans to inject into its
communications ventures in Uganda.
	   MTN is advertising cellular telephone service for 160 shillings
(12 cents) per minute to other MTN phones inside Uganda, 200
shillings (15 cents) to non-MTN clients and 2,200 shillings (dlrs
1.70) per minute for international calls.
	   Cellular Telephones or Celtel, the other, private cellular
service that was launched three years ago, charges 600 shillings
(46 cents) a minute for calls in Uganda. International calls cost
about dlrs 3 per minute.
	   ``As of now we have got 500 customers for cellular services, and
we will get many more,'' said MTN marketing manager Eric Van Veen.
	   Celtel has invested nearly dlrs 40 million in the market and has
about 15,000 subscribers, said Celtel spokesman Peter Waiswa.
	   The company recently placed an ad in Kampala papers apologizing
for a technical failure and offering every subscriber a
13,000-shilling (dlrs 10) rebate.
	   The ad quoted managing director Aloysius Semmanda saying
Celtel's rates were changing but not by how much.
	   Celtel charges up to dlrs 100 to install a fixed telephone line,
down from about dlrs 400 a few months ago.
	   MTN will install for free and charge 36,400 shillings (dlrs 28)
a month for rental. The Celtel charge is dlrs 50.
	   About five companies, most of them back by foreign investors,
have entered the Ugandan telecommunications market since
liberalization began in 1992. Some are just Internet providers and
others do only pager service or fax service.
	   In order to retain market share, UTL has slashed domestic and
international fax rates.
	   It is also trying to collect on back bills from some 2,000
subscribers whose service has been suspended for nonpayment.
	   Many subscribers, fed up with poor service and being billed for
calls they did not make, refused to pay.
	   Management says the company fails to recover much of the 45,000
billion shillings (dlrs 34 million) it bills annually.
	   UTL has a switching capacity of 80,000 lines, but only operates
45,000 through 13 exchanges nationwide.
	   The MTN consortium is 50 percent owned by MTN International; 30
percent by Telia Overseas, a Swedish multinational
telecommunications company; 10 percent by Invesco (Ugandan
Investment Company); and 10 percent by Tristar (Rwanda Investment).

Ukraine negotiating with IMF, European Union, Japan over financial

aid &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An International Monetary Fund mission is
scheduled to arrive in Kiev this weekend to consider the
disbursement of new installments of its recently approved loan to
Ukraine, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The IMF team is to discuss with Ukrainian officials new measures
to increase the budget revenues that the cash-poor government needs
to finance its welfare expenditures, Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov
said, according to Interfax.
	   ``Balancing budget revenues and expenditures is going to be the
main, the most serious, topic of our negotiations,'' Mitiukov said.
	   The IMF dist republic will receive another dlrs 125 million
from the IMF by the end of the year if it meets the fund's
requirements for granting the aid.
	   Ukraine's government is chronically short of cash due to poor
tax collection. It's suffered another blow to its shaky financial
system from the the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   The government has asked the European Union for an ECU 150
million (dlrs 182 million) loan to support its currency market and
provide for currency reserves to be used by importers.
	   An EU delegation is currently negotiating with government
officials in Kiev over disbursing an ECU 50 million (dlrs 60.6
million) tranche of the loan by the end of 1998, according to Joly
Dixon, who is heading the visiting EU team.
	   Dixon said Monday that disbursement of the EU loan would depend
on Ukraine's taking quick measures to liberalize foreign trade, and
reform the banking system and energy sector.
	   Ukraine has already asked the Japanese government for a dlrs 80
million credit, and hopes to finalize the deal soon, Mitiukov said.

Record number of bodies found in Japan's `suicide forest'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS prediction that full year number will exceed 70, 3rd
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a grisly trend authorities suspect is linked to
Japan's souring economy, a record number of suicide victims have
been found this year in a sprawling forest at the foot of Mount
Fuji.
	   More than 300 police and firefighters scoured the huge forest
southwest of Tokyo on Tuesday in an annual search for victims. They
found three bodies, bringing to 58 the number found in the area so
far this year.
	   By year's end, the 1998 toll ``would be more than 70 bodies,''
Masaaki Mochizuki, spokesman for Fujiyoshida police, predicted.
	   The previous record was set in 1994, when 57 bodies were found
in the forest, which investigators have been searching for suicide
victims once a year since 1971. Last year, 55 were found, including
20 in the year's last three months.
	   The forest is considered a prime suicide spot because of its
isolation, and was recommended in a book about suicide a few years
ago, Mochizuki said.
	   He said it was unclear why more people are committing suicide
there, but Kyodo News agency quoted unidentified authorities as
saying the country's deep recession could be behind the increase.
	   Suicide in Japan is often seen as an honorable way out of a
shameful situation, and experts say more Japanese are killing
themselves rather than bear the humiliation of failure in business
or at work.
	   In 1997, a total of 24,391 Japanese killed themselves _ up 5.6
percent from 23,104 the previous year, the National Police Agency
said.
	   Japan's overall suicide rate is high, at 17.2 per 100,000
people. That compares with 12 in the United States and 7.5 in
England, but is well below Finland's 27.3, according to Japan's
Health Ministry.
	   The Aokigahara forest is as isolated as it gets in crowded
Japan. At 621 square kilometers (248 square miles), the forest _
known as the ``sea of trees'' _ covers an area the size of Tokyo.
	   The latest three victims were found Tuesday by a team of 342
police and firefighters. The other victims were discovered by
hikers, picnickers and students who explore caves in the area.
	   About 40 other people have gone to the forest to commit suicide
so far this year but failed, Mochizuki said.

Russian agricultural production slides more than 9 percent in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian agricultural production slid by 9.4
percent in the first nine months of 1998, compared with the same
period last year, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Because of a crippling financial crisis that broke in August,
farm production was down almost across the board, the Interfax news
agency said, citing figures from the State Statistics Committee.
	   By Oct. 1, the country had 16 percent fewer sheep and goats, 9
percent fewer cattle, and 3 percent fewer pigs, Interfax said. As a
result, meat production was down by 4 percent and milk production
dropped slightly by .6 percent.
	   Only egg production edged upward, by 3 percent.
	   In September of 1998, the country produced farm goods worth 53
billion rubles (dlrs 3.1 billion), down 15 percent from 1997
levels.
	   Still, overall farming production was 0.4 percent higher than it
was in 1996, Interfax said.
	   Last week the State Statistics Committee reported that Russia
had harvested only half as much grain so far this year as it did in
the same period last year.
	   Though the government has said Russia will not face food
shortages this year, leaders on Monday welcomed offers of food aid
from the International Monetary Fund.

Bavarian court confirms deportation of convicted Turkish juvenile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Bavarian court on Tuesday upheld a
lower court's order to deport a 14-year-old Turkish delinquent
whose case became an election-year symbol for Germans demanding
action against ``criminal foreigners.''
	   The Bavarian administrative court denied a defense appeal to
force Munich city officials to renew the youth's residency permit.
The decision clears the way for officials in the southern state to
deport the boy, known simply as Mehmet, to Turkey.
	   Mehmet was sentenced to one year in jail two weeks ago on a
conviction of robbery and causing bodily harm. Though suspected of
more than 60 offenses, he only has been tried for the one case _
the only one committed after he turned 14, the age of legal
responsibility under German law.
	   Munich officials had refused to renew the residency permit based
on the 60 offenses, and the conviction only strengthened their
case. German law allows deportation of any foreigner sentenced to a
year or more in prison.
	   The liberal Greens' party cited the Mehmet case as an example of
problems in Germany's citizenship laws during election-year
campaigning.
	   Those laws are set to change under the incoming federal
government of Social Democrats and Greens, to take office next
week. The future partners on Tuesday signed an agreement that will
grant automatic citizenship to some German-born foreigners to
promote integration of the 7 million foreigners, including 2
million Turks, living here.
	   Though born and raised in Germany, Mehmet would not be eligible
for automatic citizenship under the proposed new laws. That right
would be granted only to German-born foreigners who have at least
one parent who is a permanent resident and was either born in
Germany or has resided here since age 14.

Typhoon Babs intensifies, threatens central Philippines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with typhoon strengthening further in 2nd graf, rescue
officials on standby in 6th graf, comments by defense secretary in
7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs gathered strength
Tuesday as it pushed toward the southern tip of Luzon Island and
the central Philippines, threatening to hit some of the poorest
regions in the country.
	   At 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), Babs, with maximum sustained winds of 160
kilometers (100 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 195 kph (122
mph), was over the Pacific Ocean about 230 kilometers (144 miles)
east-southeast of Borongan in Eastern Samar province, weather
forecaster Susan Dampog said.
	   She said Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this season,
was moving northwest at 11 kph (7 mph) but its movement was too
erratic to determine exactly when it would hit land.
	   ``It's difficult to determine where it will proceed,'' she said.
``But we are sure it will continue to gain more strength before it
hits land.''
	   Dampog said the typhoon will begin to be felt in Samar and
Luzon's southern Bicol region by late Tuesday or early Wednesday.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said military rescue units,
including air force helicopters and navy vessels, are on standby.
	   ``They know what to do but we are praying that we will not have
a direct hit,'' he said.
	   Dampog said the bureau is advising against sea travel because
the typhoon is likely to create large waves. Residents of the
eastern coastline also have been told to move to higher ground
because the typhoon is expected to create ``surges'' that could
engulf coastal villages, she said.
	   Another typhoon, Zeb, struck the northern Philippines last week,
leaving at least 74 people dead and 65 others missing. About
415,000 people fled their homes at the height of the typhoon but
most have now returned.
	   After hitting the Philippines, Zeb skirted Taiwan, where 31
died, before cutting a swath across Japan, where it killed at least
12 people.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was
arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's
office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic
controversy over the move.
	   Pinochet, who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to
Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks
with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in
London's elite Belgravia district four days before he was
hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9.
	   ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington,
spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister
from 1979-90.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish
magistrate's request.
	   In Conservative government days, Pinochet was welcomed on
regular visits that included tea with the prime minister.
	   He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its
1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands.
Pinochet and Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of
right-wing economics.
	   The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago,
ending 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign
Office on Monday, saying Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic passport and is
also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him from
prosecution there.
	   Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture and other human
rights abuses against political opponents in which, the Chilean
government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. He
remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March.
	   The magistrate broadened his charges Monday to include killings
of Chileans as well as Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is
no diplomatic immunity.
	   Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during
Pinochet's rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with
diplomatic immunity and senator status.
	   ``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' Artaza said
in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. ``What we
are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government is
the special situation of a senator in our transition who many
people do not understand and many people don't like.''
	   ``We're not discussing his record during his period of
dictatorship, that the present government does not support at
all,'' added the ambassador.
	   A Chilean specialist in international law was traveling to
London for further meetings with British officials, Artaza said.
	   Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized for perhaps two more weeks
faces a long battle through British courts to avoid extradition,
questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated the proceedings,
and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's court.
	   British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government
of ``gesture'' politics and pandering to the party's left-wing.

Britain urges Bulgaria to clarify umbrella murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on
Monday urged Bulgarian officials to clarify circumstances of the
sensational 1978 umbrella murder of dissident Georgi Markov.
	   Cook, on a working visit to Sofia, discussed the matter with
President Petar Stoyanov.
	   After the meeting Stoyanov told journalists he had assured Cook
that this is a painful issue for all democrats in Bulgaria.
	   ``We don't want you to assume that the current government does
not want to assist the investigation, but communism is gone, taking
along some of its secrets. Part of them are those linked with
Georgi Markov's murder,'' Stoyanov told the British Foreign
Secretary.
	   Markov, a writer and journalist who left communist Bulgaria in
the early 1970s, worked for the Bulgarian language service of the
British Broadcasting Corp. Investigators said he was jabbed with
the poisoned tip of an umbrella.
	   The Markov case has never been solved, but British investigators
long have suspected Bulgarian agents.
	   Former KGB agent Oleg Kalugin has said that Bulgaria asked
Moscow for help in the assassination.
	   Bulgaria was the most loyal Soviet ally under decades of
communist rule. Post-communist leaders have vowed to clear the
Markov case in an effort to clean up Bulgaria's image.

China, Vietnam call for more talks on disputed border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Foreign Ministry
official saying premiers want more border talks &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BEJ102-103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and Vietnam have agreed to step up
negotiations to settle much of their disputed land and sea borders,
a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji agreed Monday on accelerated border talks to meet a 2000
deadline set last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said.
	   Making the first visit by a Vietnamese premier since the once
hostile communist neighbors normalized relations in 1991, Khai also
discussed the disputed border with Li Peng, head of China's
legislature, and also met with President Jiang Zemin, state media
reported.
	   Jiang, who heads China's Communist Party, and Vietnamese
Communist Party General Secretary Do Muoi agreed last year to
demarcate by 2000 the land border and the waters of the Tonkin
Gulf, known to the Chinese as the Beibu.
	   Demarcating the border would ``bring a peaceful, friendly and
stable boundary between China and Vietnam,'' said Tang, the Chinese
spokesman. He added that many rounds of negotiations have produced
``some progress.''
	   China invaded Vietnam in 1979 to punish Hanoi for ousting
Beijing's Khmer Rouge allies in Cambodia. Although the border war
was brief, relations remained tense throughout the 1980s, and their
navies skirmished in 1988 over the disputed Spratly islands.
	   The islands _ a set of shoals and reefs in the South China Sea _
are not a part of the border demarcation talks and are a constant
source of friction between Vietnam and China and four other
regional governments that claim them wholly or partly.
	   Last month, China accused Vietnam of sending troops who built
structures on two reefs. Vietnam said the reefs were not part of
the Spratlys.
	   Despite the border disagreements, trade between China and
Vietnam has boomed, from dlrs 30 million in 1991 to dlrs 1.44
billion last year, according to one Vietnamese newspaper.
	   Vietnam's Khai and China's Zhu discussed ways to promote trade
and investment, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. Senior
economic officials were accompanying the two premiers in the talks.
	   Afterward, Chinese and Vietnamese officials signed a treaty on
judicial assistance in civil and criminal cases, a border trade
agreement and a consular treaty. Xinhua gave no details, but
problems between the two countries include smuggling and poor
quality goods.

Arab foreign ministers to discuss Syrian-Turkish crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Foreign ministers of eight Arab countries
are expected to meet next month to discuss closer military
cooperation in the wake of a recent standoff between Syria and
Turkey, news reports and diplomats said Tuesday.
	   The Nov. 11-12 meeting in Qatar will discuss the eight
countries' game plan should Turkey carry out its threats to use
military force against Syria in their row over Turkish Kurd rebels,
the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The countries participating in the conference are Egypt, Syria
and the six Arab Gulf nations: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait.
	   The eight countries are part of a political alliance called the
Damascus Declaration, which for long has unsuccessfully tried to
forge a regional military cooperation pact.
	   Al-Khalij, the main newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said
the ministers will review ``a new formula for security
cooperation.''
	   It said this has become necessary due to ``the threats which the
Arab region faces on the security level.''
	   Arab diplomats in Cairo said members of the alliance are worried
that Turkey might actually use the military option against Syria if
the current diplomatic efforts fail to resolve the crisis.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Kurdish rebels fighting for
autonomy from Turkey, and wants them expelled. Syria denies hosting
the rebels or supporting them.
	   On Monday, Turkey warned that talks now taking place between
Turkish and Syrian officials were Syria's last chance for a
peaceful solution.
	   The two countries also are at odds over how to share water from
the Euphrates river and Turkey's growing ties with Israel.
	   The eight-country Arab alliance was born out of their common
opposition to Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War following its occupation of
Kuwait. It has tried to gain an economic impetus by discussing
Egypt's long-cherished dream of setting up a common Arab market.
	   The economic goals will again be discussed during the Qatar
meeting, said the diplomats.

Official: IMF team will discuss loans, not humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund mission arriving
in Moscow on Tuesday will not discuss food aid, officials said
Tuesday.
	   ``The question of sending humanitarian aid to Russia, the need
for which was declared by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus a
few days ago, will not be discussed,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The IMF isn't a charity institution,'' he said.
	   Camdessus said it was necessary for the European Union to
subsidize deliveries to Russia of chicken and pork in order to
prevent food shortages in Russia this winter and avert social
unrest.
	   The Russian government responded with a statement Monday
expressing gratitude and interest but reiterating its request for
new credits.
	   ``They offer pork and chicken instead of new loans,'' the
liberal daily Segodnya said in a front-page commentary on Tuesday.
``Food is a good thing, but Russian authorities expected to get
some money.''
	   The IMF leads a group of international lenders that amassed a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package for Russia last summer. Only
about dlrs 4.7 billion was delivered before the crisis hit in
August.
	   The IMF suspended further payments, saying it wants the
government to put forward a credible economic plan and evidence it
is being implemented. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has
yet to offer any comprehensive program, and little is expected to
come out of the IMF visit.
	   ``A call for humanitarian aid is merely a diplomatic way to
soften the refusal of loans,'' the business daily Kommersant said
on Tuesday.
	   It added, however, that food aid wouldn't be unwelcome against
the background of this year's grain harvest _ the lowest in decades
_ and a sharp drop in imports caused by the ruble's devaluation.
More than half of the food sold in stores recently has been
imported.
	   While no serious food shortages are expected, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said the government wants to be prepared in case
of hardship this winter. The government has already set up
emergency food reserves at a cost of dlrs 600 million. They are
supposed to last for two weeks and cover the needs of one-third of
the population.

Russian defense minister touts Asia-Pacific stability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Russia has a vested interest in ensuring
stability in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in avoiding a
nuclear arms race, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said
Tuesday.
	   Sergeyev, speaking to Russian reporters after his arrival in
Hanoi to start a three-nation trip, pointed out that two-thirds of
his country's territory lies in Asia.
	   ``The development dynamics of the Asian Pacific are making the
region one of the most important political and economic centers of
the world,'' Russia's Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
	   ``Unfortunately, sources of tension and potential conflicts
still remain in Asia, primarily because territorial, ethnic and
other clashes have not been settled.''
	   Sergeyev is spending two days in Vietnam, which the former
Soviet Union supported during its protracted war against the
U.S.-backed government in what used to be South Vietnam before the
nation was reunified in 1975.
	   Although ties between Russia and Vietnam are nowhere near as
close as they used to be, there have been increasing signs of an
improved climate in relations.
	   The Vietnamese are interested in Russian weaponry to modernize
their military, along with spare parts. The ITAR-Tass news agency
says Hanoi is planning to buy up to 24 Su-27 jet fighters worth
about dlrs 800 million, along with MiG-29s, patrol and torpedo
boats and Molnia-class missile-firing vessels.
	   Sergeyev was to confer Tuesday afternoon with Vietnamese Defense
Minister Pham Van Tra on the future of the Cam Ranh air base, a
former U.S. naval base rented to the Soviet navy in 1979.
	   Russia and Vietnam signed an agreement in 1993 allowing the
Russian navy to continue using the base until 2004. Hanoi wants to
renegotiate the deal, saying Russia has reduced the amount of arms
it gives Vietnam as compensation for using the base.
	   Sergeyev also is to visit China and India. He indicated that the
latter stop will include talks on a possible nuclear arms race
between India and Pakistan, both of which exploded test bombs
earlier this year.
	   He said he also was concerned about the spread of missile
technology and ``the attempts of the United States to involve some
Asian countries in joint development of an anti-missile defense
theater,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``In our opinion, the fulfillment of such intentions in the
future may shift the balance of power in the region,'' he said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of French police were placed on maximum
alert Tuesday to prevent disturbances during high school students'
second major nationwide protest in less than a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of high school students were expected to
demonstrate across the country to press demands for more teachers,
better equipment and buildings and a lighter course load.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities.
	   By mid-day, students filled the streets of numerous French
towns, with at least 7,500 students in Rouen, in Normandy, 4,000 in
Nancy, in the east, 6,000 in Avignon in the south. In nearby
Aix-en-Provence, 2,500 youths blocked the A8 highway, officials
said.
	   ``No promises. Action,'' read banners at a morning march in
Bordeaux in southwest France that, police said, drew 10,000
students. A second demonstration was set for afternoon.

Asian stock markets close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Monday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur soaring nearly 7 percent
on local institutional buying ahead of the unveiling of Malaysia's
budget later this week.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is to present the 1999
federal budget in Parliament on Friday.
	   Mahathir, who is also finance minister, has said Malaysia will
introduce new taxes in the budget, but will also bring in new
fiscal stimulus measures to boost the country's economy.
	   He said the government had projected economic growth of 1.0
percent in 1999, compared with a forecast of 4.8 percent
contraction this year.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks
prices of 100 key stocks, rose 26.71 points, or 6.7 percent,
closing at 422.97.
	   Thai shares also surged, with the key index gaining 5.5 percent
as local investors bought banking and finance stocks ahead of
third-quarter results due later this week, dealers said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 17.19 points to
331.36.
	   In Tokyo, share prices closed higher for the third straight
session.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 240.85
points, or 1.78 percent, closing at 13,808.05 _ its highest level
since Oct. 7. On Monday, the Nikkei had gained 286.66 points, or
2.16 percent.
	   Government funds snapped up shares ahead of the listing of NTT
Mobile Communications Network Inc., or NTT DoCoMo, causing a late
surge after the Nikkei had hovered above Monday's closing level for
most of the session.
	   An overnight gain on Wall Street also encouraged investors in
Tokyo. The Dow rose 49.69 points _ or 0.6 percent _ closing
Monday's session at 8,466.45.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.14 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.42 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its
New York level of 114.28 yen late Monday.
	   South Korea shares also closed sharply higher as worries eased
over the takeover of ailing Kia Motors Corp. by Hyundai Motor Co.
	   Investors were worried earlier that the takeover would put heavy
financial strain on the Hyundai group.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 14.38 points, or 3.8 percent, to 388.35.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher, boosted by hefty gains in
Tokyo and expectations of further cuts in local interest rates. The
Hang Seng Index rose 43.70 points, or 0.5 percent, closing at
9,642.75.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on lingering concerns over
companies' third-quarter earnings. The market's key Weighted Stock
price Index fell 55.84 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,848.72.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 17.57 points, or 0.9 percent,
to 1,804.55.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on profit-taking. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 21.66, or 1.5
percent, to 1,467.69.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly steady. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 1.1 points to 2,516.9.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed, with the key index falling
on profit-taking in some blue-chip stocks. The Straits Times Index
fell 10.85 points, or 1 percent, to 1,108.75.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Composite
Index edged up 0.158 point to 336.578.

Hong Kong's recession worse than first feared
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's recession has been slightly worse
than officials first believed, with the economy shrinking by 5.2
percent in the second quarter, or 0.2 percentage point more than
originally estimated, the government said Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong officially went into recession after the economy
contracted for two successive quarters in the first half of the
year.
	   The figures for April-June were gloomier than expected because
of ``the further slackening in local consumer demand and export
performance,'' the government said Tuesday in releasing revised
statistics.
	   Officials noted, however, that the downturn was somewhat
exaggerated by a surge in growth during the second quarter of 1997.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which had grown by around 4.5 percent
annually over the past decade, expanded 5.3 percent in 1997 before
the Asian economic crisis started taking its toll.
	   In August, the government estimated the economy would contract
by 4 percent this year, compared with 3.5 percent growth forecast
earlier this year. No new official estimates were given Tuesday.
	   ``Local consumer demand continued to be depressed by slackening
income, rising unemployment and further slump in asset prices,''
the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department said.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 5 percent and property
prices have fallen by up to 50 percent since their peak last year.
Meanwhile, a broad measure of Hong Kong's inflation dipped to 1.6
percent in the second quarter, from 4.2 percent in the first
quarter.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recovering
from a respiratory infection, returned to the Kremlin on Tuesday
and reaffirmed he would not seek re-election.
	   During a meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Yeltsin
reiterated that he had no intention of running for a third
presidential term in 2000.
	   ``I have said so many times that I will not run in 2000,''
Yeltsin said.
	   ``But they have brought it to a point where this is being
reviewed by the Constitutional Court. I will not run, so why are
you tormenting me?'' he said.
	   Russia's Constitution appears to rule out another term for
Yeltsin, but presidential aides have said that his first term began
before the constitution was adopted, and therefore should not count
toward the two-term limit.
	   Despite Yeltsin's repeated denials of any intention to run, the
parliamentary opposition has asked the court to rule on the issue.
Hearings began last week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the rest of his term, and adamantly deny speculation that he has
serious health problems _ a suggestion that is raised every time
Yeltsin catches a cold.
	   But the influential magazine Itogi quoted top Yeltsin aides in
its Tuesday issue as saying the president is seriously ill and his
staff is trying to ``pull the president through'' the remaining 20
months of his term.
	   Much of that time will be taken up by parliamentary and then
presidential election campaigns, as well as Christmas and New Year
celebrations and summer vacations.
	   So ``the president will not particularly interest anybody,''
Itogi quoted an unidentified Kremlin aide as saying.
	   But this ``scheme for turning the president into a political
ghost'' may be derailed by political opposition or the worsening
economic crisis, Itogi said.
	   ``So pulling the president, like a cotton-wool mattress, over
the remaining year and half, will likely fail,'' Itogi said.
	   During the meeting with Yeltsin, Primakov also denied
suggestions that he planned to run for president in 2000.
	   ``This is nonsense and has nothing to do with reality,''
Primakov said. ``I would not be able to head the government now if
I was thinking about the presidency.''
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin also discussed the government's measures to
pay state workers' back wages and pensions during a meeting with
Primakov and other officials, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin also met with Defense Minister Sergei Stepashin, head of
the Federal Security Service Vladimir Putin, and Border Guards
chief Konstantin Totsky, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Totsky was to travel to the Central Asian country of Tajikistan
later Tuesday to look into the tense situation on the country's
border with Afghanistan, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russia and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia are
worried about a possible spillover of violence and influx of
weapons and refugees from Afghanistan.
	   Yeltsin's latest illness forced him to cut short a visit to
Central Asia earlier this month, and he spent most of last week at
a country residence outside Moscow. The president also has canceled
a trip to Malaysia scheduled for next month.
	   Yeltsin has been plagued by recurring health problems in recent
years. He had heart bypass surgery two years ago, and has made
fewer and fewer public appearances since then.

Defense industries suggest they produce oil equipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing sharp declines in government orders,
Russian defense enterprises suggested Tuesday that they produce
equipment for the oil and gas industry, a news report said.
	   During a conference of leaders from the defense and energy
industries in Votkinsk, 1000 kilometers (625 miles) southeast of
Moscow, senior defense executives released a document calling for
the government to provide funds in 2000-2006 for the conversion,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The defense officials said they could produce oil and gas
equipment that would be competitive with foreign-made machinery.
	   Leaders at the conference also urged the government to scale
back imports of foreign-made oil and gas equipment. They said
foreign companies should invest more in Russia and start more joint
ventures with Russian firms instead.

International Maritime Bureau condemns China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from China, graf 4; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The International Maritime Bureau
condemned China on Tuesday for setting free 12 Indonesians held in
connection with the hijacking of a Malaysian-registered oil tanker.
	   In a statement obtained by The Associated Press, the
London-based bureau accused China of violating international pacts
on piracy and suggested the move was part of ``a deep plot to cover
up China's participation in criminal activity.''
	   The Malaysian government notified Beijing in June of its wish to
extradite the 12 Indonesians. They were being sought on charges of
armed robbery and hijacking of the vessel, the Petro Ranger.
Malaysia and China have an extradition treaty.
	   A spokeswoman for China's Hainan province, where the vessel had
been detained, confirmed the Indonesians were repatriated Friday.
The spokeswoman, who identified herself only as Miss Fu, said the
12 were accused of smuggling but Malaysia had never filed any
formal extradition documents.
	   Chinese marine police held the Indonesians for questioning after
the vessel was discovered off the southern port of Haikou on Hainan
Island on April 26. There was no word, however, of charging the
Indonesians. China had the first option to try the men after taking
them into custody.
	   According to the IMB's statement, however, Chinese authorities
released the suspected pirates on Oct. 15 and sent them back to
Indonesia.
	   ``It is unbelievable that the 12 persons who had committed a
serious offense of hijacking a vessel were simply sent home without
being prosecuted,'' said the statement signed by Jayant Abhyankar,
deputy director of the IMB, which monitors piracy worldwide.
	   ``This is not the first time the Chinese ports have been used to
shelter hijacked vessels,'' said the statement, dated Oct. 16.
	   The Petro Ranger disappeared April 17, one day after it set sail
from Singapore to Vietnam with 11,000 tons of diesel and kerosene.
The cargo was worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Chinese authorities detained the vessel on April 26 in the South
China Sea. The information was not reported until May 1.
	   China released the ship's 21-member crew on May 30 and detained
the 12 additional men suspected as hijackers for investigation.
Neither the ship's Singapore-based agent nor the Chinese
authorities have said what happened to the cargo.
	   ``Yet another attempt to deal with piracy has been thwarted by
the Chinese authorities,'' the statement said.
	   It added that repatriating the suspects was ``in blatant
disregard'' of various international pacts, notably the Rome
convention of 1988, of which China is a signatory. It obliges
member states to submit piracy cases for prosecution.
	   ``The industry can only conclude that China is not sincere about
the part it says it wants to play in international maritime
affairs,'' the statement said.

Like it or loathe it: Britain's Millennium Dome becoming a reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The roof is up, the cast for its splashy
performances is being auditioned and the big marketing push has
begun.
	   Like a giant insect, 758 million pound (dlrs 1.2 billion)
Millennium Dome rises next to the River Thames _ and with it the
government's hopes of showing that Britain is a happening place as
the third millennium strikes.
	   The idea for the world's largest dome was born in 1993, when
U.S. television networks began calling the Old Royal Observatory to
book locations astride the Greenwich Meridian, marker of longitude
zero degrees, for millennium broadcasts.
	   Skeptics initially ridiculed the idea of a millennium
spectacular, complete with permanent wide-ranging exhibits and
multimedia spectaculars on the theme of time, saying it was
unworkable.
	   But Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, the Dome's guru, insists
Britain is the only country that has shown the ambition and
boldness to create what he dubs ``the most famous building offered
to the world in the year 2000.''
	   While construction in southeast London is on schedule, a third
of the necessary sponsorship is still missing. Some exhibits had to
be redesigned. And critics doubt that the dome, tucked onto an
isolated finger of industrial land, will have the transportation
links to cope with a huge influx of visitors in the year 2000.
	   Work on a subway link has been delayed and will be finished only
just in time.
	   ``I am deep in disbelief that they can get 12 million people
down to Greenwich in a year'' as the English Tourist Board
predicts, historian Sir Roy Strong said recently.
	   Twice as big as the current record-holder, Atlanta's Georgia
Dome, the Millennium Dome covers 20 acres (eight hectares), has a
circumference of two-thirds of a mile (one kilometer) and is 165
feet (50 meters) high. Forty-four miles (70 kilometers) of cabling
support the Teflon-coated glass fiber roof.
	   Designed by British architect Sir Richard Rogers, it can
accommodate up to 37,000 people.
	   In the center stands a vast 12,500-seat arena, surrounded by 14
lifestyle zones that use hands-on technology to explore themes
including national identity, the mind, the spirit, rest, global,
play and work.
	   In the body zone, visitors will walk around inside a giant human
figure bigger than the Statue of Liberty. Rest will take the form
of a giant dreamscape with floating 16-seater boats designed to
look like beds.
	   The multi-faith spirit zone, which has had to be scaled down
because it was too heavy for its foundations, will include a
Christian monastic cloister and a Japanese Zen garden.
	   Britain's national lottery is providing 400 million pounds (dlrs
680 million); the rest will come from private sponsorship and
ticket sales, merchandising and media rights.
	   Many tour companies and local businesses can't wait for it to
open. Still, realtors say other locals are leaving, fearing traffic
jams and increased pollution. And environmentalists complain that
dome-inspired development is destroying rare bird habitats.
	   The government insists the dome will recycle wherever possible.
Cars will be limited to distant park-and-ride sites, and most
visitors will arrive by boat, train or the new subway extension.
	   ``Initially, I was skeptical _ it is costing a lot,'' said Jill
Vonberg from Stowmarket, eastern England, who toured Greenwich's
millennium visitor center recently for a preview.
	   ``Now,'' she said, ``I think it will be something to leave to
our children.''

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A man irritated by noise from a
construction site across the street from his home called in a bomb
threat in order to get peace and quiet, the state news agency MTI
said Tuesday.
	   Police investigators turned up no bomb but did track down a man
they identified only as Laszlo J., 52, whom they said admitted to
the threat.
	   Despite the man's plea that the noise drove him to make the call
out of desperation, police initiated criminal proceedings.

Russian lawmakers to request putting impeachment motion on agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers seeking to impeach Boris Yeltsin will
ask parliament's scheduling committee on Friday to put an
impeachment motion on the agenda, a lawmaker said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary foes met Tuesday to discuss their
campaign to impeach the president, said hard-line chairman of
parliament's Defense Committee, Viktor Ilyukhin.
	   The campaign started long before Russia's current economic
crisis, and appears likely to fail, as several previous attempts
have.
	   Impeachment supporters accuse Yeltsin of instigating the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union, sending troops and tanks against his
hard-line foes in the previous parliament in 1993, and launching
the unsuccessful war in separatist Chechnya.
	   Parliament's Communist speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he will
support the impeachment motion, but conceded it may be difficult
for the motion to gather the two-thirds majority vote it needs to
pass in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma.
	   ``Accusations of the abuse of office on three counts evoke no
doubts on my part,'' Seleznyov was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   But ``we will have to score 300 votes in the State Duma, and it
will not be easy,'' Seleznyov told reporters during a trip to the
Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk.
	   If an impeachment motion is passed in the Duma, it would then
need to be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament's upper
house, and by both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts _ all of
which have many Yeltsin supporters.

Trial of dismissed intelligence officer starts

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A former intelligence officer went on
trial Tuesday before a military court, accused of violating state
secrets in a case the defendant claims was politically inspired.
	   The case underscores the difficulty faced by Hungary and other
former Soviet Bloc states in combating crime and corruption while
protecting the rights of individuals in countries with bitter
memories of abuse of power under communism.
	   Laszlo Foeldi, 41, was recalled from his post as a liaison
officer with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and charged in
March 1997 with illegally copying material from ``Operation
Birch,'' which was launched three years ago to gather information
on organized crime in eastern Hungary.
	   If convicted, he could face five years imprisonment.
	   The government charged that ``Operation Birch'' was aimed at
illegally gathering information on Hungarian politicians, a
practice reminiscent of the communist era, which ended here in
1990.
	   In an interview last year with The Associated Press, Foeldi said
that the operation was not specifically directed against
politicians but that information on some of them was obtained in
the course of investigations.
	   Foeldi said someone told the Cabinet minister who was overseeing
the operation, Istvan Nikolits, that the intelligence service was
targeting politicians. That led to an investigation and the
charges.
	   ``I naively thought the minister would be interested in my
views,'' Foeldi said. ``Politicians at the top have contacts with
organized crime, mostly unwittingly.''
	   He refused to identify them but said he was ready to do so in
court.
	   Foeldi said that during the communist era, when Hungary was part
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, the government directed all its
intelligence resources toward spying on the West.
	   After the fall of Communism, the Hungarian intelligence service
shifted its operations to fighting organized crime, much of which
is based in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet Bloc states.
	   Earlier this month, the Hungarian government signed an agreement
with the United States to provide FBI agents, laboratory assistance
and legal aid to help the country fight growing Russian-speaking
crime groups operating in Hungary.
	   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno called Hungary ``a key
battleground'' in the fight against organized crime in Central
Europe.
	   Imre Konya, former head of the House National Security
Committee, agreed that politicians were not specifically targeted.
	   ``Agents were gathering data on corruption and organized crime
in the region and came across these and other individuals in some
way or another,'' Konya said.
	   But the issue is sensitive in former Soviet Bloc countries
because of the widespread practice by Communist intelligence
services of spying on politicians, opposition figures, journalists
and thousands of others.
	   Foeldi's lawyer, Gyoergy Barandy, said many other agents
involved in ``Operation Birch'' were fired. As a result, he added,
``in the future, agents will not report on politicians.''

Latvia believes in early EU membership

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said
Tuesday he was certain Latvia would be one of the first among 11
candidate countries to join the European Union.
	   ``We are convinced that our results are so good that we do not
need to ask this question,'' Ulmanis said, when asked whether
Latvia would be part of a first or second wave of countries to join
the Union.
	   The president of the EU executive Commission, Jacques Santer,
said, ``It's too early to say.''
	   Until now Latvia - as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and
Lithuania - are on a slow track to EU membership.
	   Another group of countries - Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia begin detailed negotiations with the
EU next month and can hope to join the 15-nation bloc sometime in
the middle of the next decade.
	   Latvia believes it meets the economic and political criteria to
join the fast-track countries.
	   Earlier this month it took a key political step towards future
EU membership when a majority of Latvians voted in a referendum to
ease citizenship rules for ethnic Russians who make up almost half
the population.
	   The EU welcomed the move. Latvia's naturalization laws placed
high obstacles for stateless Russians who wanted to become
citizens, requiring many of them to wait until the next millennium
even to apply.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A scream heard at the apartment block
where a Saudi diplomat was murdered a week ago may have come from
him moments before he died, Australian Federal Police said Tuesday.
	   Detective Sgt. Greg Ranse said a resident in the building heard
a scream and saw a man holding something as he ran from the
apartment complex and got into a car.
	   Abdullah Al-Ghamdi, 54, with his throat cut, was found Oct. 13
lying on the kitchen floor of his apartment in Kingston, a suburb
of Australia's national capital near Parliament House.
	   He was discovered by a Saudi Embassy colleague after he had not
turned up for work that day.
	   Ranse said the scream may have come from Al-Ghamdi.
	   He said the object the man was carrying was described as about
12 inches (30 centimeters) long, but it was difficult to say
whether it was a weapon.
	   Police have said Al-Ghamdi was repeatedly stabbed and his throat
was slashed with a thin-bladed knife in the early hours of Oct. 13.
	   They are searching for a dark-colored Hyundai Excel, and Ranse
appealed for anyone in the area with such a car to come forward.
	   He said 26 investigators were working on the case.
	   Police had interviewed Al-Ghamdi's ex-girlfriend, known as
Layla, but she told police she had not seen Al-Ghamdi for some
time.
	   A motive had not been identified and embassy staff were unable
to shed light on the case, Ranse said.
	   He said Al-Ghamdi's body would be handed over to relatives in
the next few days to be returned to Saudi Arabia.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A man irritated by noise from a
construction site across the street from his home called in a bomb
threat in order to get peace and quiet, the state news agency MTI
said Tuesday.
	   Police investigators turned up no bomb, but did track down a man
they identified only as Laszlo J., 52, whom they said admitted to
the threat.
	   Despite the man's plea that the noise drove him to make the call
out of desperation, police initiated criminal proceedings.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police seized 560 kilograms (1232
pounds) of heroin and detained 15 people on smuggling charges in a
nationwide operation, authorities announced Tuesday.
	   The drugs, with an estimated street value of dlrs 36 million,
were uncovered last week in the Istanbul area and in the southern
province of Hatay bordering Syria.
	   Two Iranians and 13 Turks were being detained, Istanbul's Chief
of Police, Hasan Ozdemir, said.
	   Due to its geographical position, Turkey is a major hub for
drugs being smuggled from Asia and the Middle East into Europe and
North America.

Military officers convicted of ruining missiles to steal gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian court convicted three military officers
of stealing platinum, gold and silver components from the air
defense missiles they oversaw, a news agency reported on Tuesday.
	   The court in the city of Ulan-Ude, in the Eastern Siberian
region of Buryatia on Russia's border with Mongolia, sentenced a
lieutenant colonel and two majors to prison terms of four to five
years in prison, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Their civilian
accomplice received the same sentence.
	   The convicts had stolen missile components worth 825,000 rubles
(dlrs 48,500) and sold them to businessmen from the former Soviet
republic of Armenia. The theft has incapacitated the missiles
beyond repair, the report said.
	   The thieves published classified ads in local newspapers
offering ``components used in military hardware.'' The ads alerted
officials and led to the thieves' arrest.
	   Thefts of weapons and other hardware have become increasingly
common in the beleaguered Russian military, crippled by a severe
fund shortage and low morale.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Monday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur soaring nearly 7 percent
on local institutional buying ahead of the unveiling of Malaysia's
budget later this week. Malaysia is expected to introduce new
taxes, but also bring in new fiscal stimulus measures to boost the
economy. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose
26.71 points, or 6.7 percent, closing at 422.97. Thai shares also
surged, with the key index gaining 5.5 percent as local investors
bought banking and finance stocks ahead of third-quarter results
due later this week. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose
17.19 points to 331.36. In Tokyo, share prices closed higher for
the third straight session. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rose 240.85 points, or 1.78 percent, closing at
13,808.05 _ its highest level since Oct. 7. On Monday, the Nikkei
had gained 286.66 points, or 2.16 percent. An overnight gain on
Wall Street also encouraged investors in Tokyo. Meanwhile, the U.S.
dollar was quoted at 115.14 yen in late afternoon, up 0.42 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo. South Korea's main index rose 14.38 points,
or 3.8 percent, to 388.35. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday that the government might print new money to pay off its
huge debts, but pledged that any boost in the money supply would be
backed by hard currency reserves. The government will pay off its
wage debts to state workers before the end of the year and resolve
all back wages to the military by the end of January, Primakov said
after meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. He said that the debts
owed to pensioners could not be paid until the end of next year.
Primakov said that the government might need to print new money to
cover the debts, but insisted that the amount would be ``very
insignificant'' and fully backed by gold and hard currency
reserves. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Friends and foes alike expect the U.S. House
of Representatives and Senate to vote decisively in favor of a dlrs
500 billion spending package that finally would end this session of
Congress and send lawmakers home for re-election battles. The House
planned to vote Tuesday on the massive measure, a compromise that
congressional leaders reached last week with President Bill
Clinton. Senate passage is likely Wednesday _ less than two weeks
from the Nov. 3 congressional elections. The package _ said to be
4,000 pages long _ would finance dozens of U.S. agencies from the
huge Department of Health and Human Services to the tiny U.S.
Institute of Peace. It also has billions for financially ailing
farmers and the Pentagon, dlrs 18 billion for the International
Monetary Fund, and modest tax breaks for some businesses and
families. (US-CONGRESS IN REVIEW)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said he
would look at tweaking his incoming government's tax reform plans
to ease any negative effects on small businesses. His comments to
German television Monday night came amid broad criticism of the
center-left coalition's proposed tax reform as insufficient to make
a significant dent in Germany's high unemployment rate _
Schroeder's key campaign promise. Germany's six leading economic
institutes, in a report released Tuesday, said the plan was too
limited and ``would hardly contribute to higher growth and more
employment.'' Announced last week, the proposal stresses cuts for
lower and medium-income households with the hope of boosting
domestic demand and creating jobs. But business groups call it a
job-killer for raising the burden on family-owned firms. The
Federation of German Industry on Monday called for more radical tax
cuts for entrepreneurs as investment incentives. Schroeder's
intended economics minister, Jost Stollmann, refused the post at
the last minute Monday partly because of what he said were
imbalances in the tax plan. (GERMANY-TAXES)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has opened
preliminary takeover talks with Bankers Trust, according to a
published report. The possible deal, which would require the
approval of the Federal Reserve and banking regulators in New York,
would be the largest takeover of an American bank by a non-U.S.
bank, the Financial Times said in Tuesday's edition. Bankers Trust,
based in New York, is the seventh-largest bank holding company in
the United States in terms of assets. The newspaper said sources
close to the talks, whom they do not name, stress the discussion is
in its early stages, but that it is the ``key element'' of the
German bank's efforts to acquire a leading U.S. investment bank.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the report Tuesday morning.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A major South African company promises to
shake up the Ugandan telecommunications market with offers of
better service and lower rates. Mobile Telephone Network officially
enters the competition Wednesday with cellular telephone service,
followed by fixed phone service in January. In response, the
restructured state firm, Uganda Telecomms Ltd., has launched an
aggressive program to collect back payments from subscribers whom
it fears will switch to MTN, which is offering free installation.
Private telephone service, particularly via cellphone, is spreading
rapidly in most of East Africa, with the exception of Kenya, where
the state-owned Kenya Post and Telecommunications has not relaxed
its monopoly. MTN will soon begin service in Rwanda. It already
operates in South Africa and Swaziland. Congo, Burundi and Tanzania
have had private cellphone service for several years. The South
African company said it has already invested dlrs 30 million of the
dlrs 70 million it plans to inject into its communications ventures
in Uganda. (UGANDA-PHONE RACE)

category codes:
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ With dozens of charred bodies littering
the town, authorities begin burying at least 500 people killed when
a fountain of fuel turned into a fireball in Nigeria. The fire,
which began Saturday as gasoline spilled from a pipeline, left at
least 100 hospitalized, military officials said. The area's
hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of doctors and nurses
and little in the way of burn care _ were overwhelmed by the
disaster. A mass grave was being dug at the edge of the town to
bury hundreds of unidentified corpses, many burned beyond
recognition. Separate burials were held Monday for at least 52 of
the dead, and dozens of people took corpses back to surrounding
villages. (NIGERIA-EXPLOSION)
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ President Bill Clinton canceled a
political fund-raising trip to California so he could return
Tuesday to the Chesapeake Bay retreat where he has pushed Israeli
and Palestinian leaders into a sixth day of bargaining over a West
Bank peace deal. The talks, which began Thursday, were complicated
by a terrorist attack Monday in which a Palestinian hurled two
grenades into a crowded bus stop in Beersheba, south of Jerusalem.
Sixty-four Israelis were wounded. Even so, the Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators pressed ahead in the wooded seclusion of
the Wye River conference center on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Aides
kept to their practice of not commenting on the substance of the
talks, but described them as ``workmanlike.'' (US-MIDEAST TALKS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following ethnic Albanian attacks on
Serb police, the government has moved tanks and troops into central
Kosovo, raising fears for the future of the the U.S.-brokered
agreement to end the violence in the province. NATO commander Gen.
Wesley Clark prepared to visit Belgrade on Tuesday to discuss how
far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to meet the alliance's
Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo or face airstrikes.
Also Tuesday, a 20-member U.N. team is heading for Kosovo to serve
as the ``eyes and ears'' of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The
visits were set amid increased signs of battle preparedness in
parts of Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. More Yugoslav army troops
were positioned southwest of Pristina, the Kosovo capital, after a
surge of weekend violence that left three Serb policemen dead and
led to mutual accusations between authorities and radical Albanians
over who started the bloodshed. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels admitted triggering the
explosion at an oil pipeline over the weekend, but suggested the
Colombian army set a subsequent fire which engulfed a nearby
village, killing 47 people. The surprise accusation was made in a
statement read Monday night to a radio station by Nicolas
Rodriguez, top commander of the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN, Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group. There was
no immediate response from President Andres Pastrana, who had been
careful in statements not to directly accuse the rebels who have a
long history of attacking oil pipelines. Colombia's armed forces
chief denied his men were involved. The Ocensa pipeline, a 510-mile
(820-kilometer) facility carrying crude from eastern oil fields to
Caribbean ports, is jointly owned by the Colombian state oil
company Ecopetrol and a consortium including U.S, French, British
and Canadian companies. (COLOMBIA-PIPELINE ATTACK)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After the quickest negotiations in postwar
German history, the Social Democrats and Greens signed a coalition
pact Tuesday that paves the way for Germany's first center-left
government in 16 years. The deal reached after just over two weeks
of talks sets fighting unemployment at the new government's top
priority, along with a tax reform that includes higher energy costs
and an end to the use of nuclear power in Germany. Details on who
gets what Cabinet post were to be released at a news conference
later Tuesday. But most of the positions were already known,
including Greens leader and former peace activist Joschka Fischer
as foreign minister and Oskar Lafontaine, leftist chairman of the
Social Democrats, as head of a beefed-up Finance Ministry. The new
government also was expected to include five female Cabinet
members. The deal still must be approved at special party
conventions this weekend before Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
can be sworn in on Oct. 27 _ exactly one month after the election.

Death toll rises to nine from capsized Malaysian boat

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The death toll from a weekend boat
accident off Malaysia's western coast rose to nine Tuesday, and
rescuers searched for six more bodies, a news report said.
	   Fishermen discovered the bodies of three men floating in choppy
waters near the southwestern state of Malacca, the Bernama news
agency reported. Six bodies had been found earlier.
	   Eighteen others on board swam to safety or were rescued after
strong waves flipped the overcrowded boat at around midnight
Sunday. It was carrying mostly workers from a resort on the Pulau
Besar island.
	   Malacca marine officials said the vessel was a tourist boat that
had been rented to fill in for the normal ferry used to shuttle
workers from the Pandanusa Island Resort to the mainland.
	   Officials suspended the license of the boat's owner after
discovering 33 people had been crammed into the boat, which had a
capacity of 12.
	   ``We have suspended his license with immediate effect as
investigations showed that he had violated various procedures,''
acting Marine Department director-general Raja Malek Raja
Kamaruzaman was quoted as saying.
	   Police identified the three latest victims, all of whom were
boat workers, as Ridzuan Nordin, Ibrahim Tambul and Amran Zakariah.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher entertained former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was
arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's
office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic
controversy over the move.
	   Pinochet, who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to
Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks
with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in
London's elite Belgravia district four days before he was
hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9.
	   ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington,
spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister
from 1979-90.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish
magistrate's request.
	   In Conservative government days, Pinochet was welcomed on
regular visits that included tea with the prime minister.
	   He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its
1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands.
Pinochet and Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of
right-wing economics.
	   The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago,
ending 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   A Chilean exile group in London said Tuesday it is considering
bringing a private prosecution against Pinochet in British courts.
Carolos Reyes, president of Chile Democratico, said the group was
consulting lawyers about this.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recovering
from a respiratory infection, returned to the Kremlin on Tuesday
and reaffirmed he would not seek re-election.
	   During a meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Yeltsin
reiterated that he had no intention of running for a third
presidential term in 2000.
	   ``I have said so many times that I will not run in 2000,''
Yeltsin said.
	   ``But they have brought it to a point where this is being
reviewed by the Constitutional Court. I will not run, so why are
you tormenting me?,'' he said in a firm voice to reporters covering
the start of the meeting.
	   Russia's Constitution appears to rule out another term for
Yeltsin, but presidential aides have said that his first term began
before the constitution was adopted, and therefore should not count
toward the two-term limit.
	   Despite Yeltsin's repeated denials of any intention to run, the
parliamentary opposition has asked the court to rule on the issue.
Hearings began last week.
	   The president and his doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out
the rest of his term, and adamantly deny speculation that he has
serious health problems _ a suggestion that is raised every time
Yeltsin catches a cold.
	   But the influential magazine Itogi quoted top Yeltsin aides in
its Tuesday issue as saying the president is seriously ill and his
staff is trying to ``pull the president through'' the remaining 20
months of his term.
	   Much of that time will be taken up by parliamentary and then
presidential election campaigns, as well as Christmas and New Year
celebrations and summer vacations.
	   So ``the president will not particularly interest anybody,''
Itogi quoted an unidentified Kremlin aide as saying.
	   But this ``scheme for turning the president into a political
ghost'' may be derailed by political opposition or the worsening
economic crisis, Itogi said.
	   ``So pulling the president, like a cotton-wool mattress, over
the remaining year and half, will likely fail,'' Itogi said.
	   During the meeting with Yeltsin, Primakov also denied
suggestions that he planned to run for president in 2000.
	   ``This is nonsense and has nothing to do with reality,''
Primakov said. ``I would not be able to head the government now if
I was thinking about the presidency.''
	   On Tuesday, Yeltsin also discussed the government's measures to
pay state workers' back wages and pensions during a meeting with
Primakov and other officials, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin also met with Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, head
of the Federal Security Service Vladimir Putin, and Border Guards
chief Konstantin Totsky, ITAR-Tass reported.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Conflict prevention and rebuilding after military
disputes topped the agenda Tuesday as an international African
development conference entered its second day, organizers said.
	   Speaking before the 2nd Tokyo International Conference on
African Development, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata warned that war is retarding economic development on the
whole continent as refugees fleeing one conflict destabilize
neighboring countries.
	   ``Displacement is one of the main obstacles on the road to
economic prosperity,'' she said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to deliver a speech at
a dinner for participants after he arrived in Tokyo later Tuesday.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened the conference and
vowed to maintain Japan's commitment to African aid despite his
country's severe economic difficulties.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action''
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and development.
	   Besides Annan, participants in the conference include the
leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Djibouti,
Mozambique, Botswana and Benin.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attended the
conference's opening Monday.
	   The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

Ukrainian police uncover large illegal cigarette factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Tax police in western Ukraine uncovered an
illegal cigarette plant that was producing up to half a million
cigarettes a day, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The underground plant was located in the village of Hriada in
the Lviv region, on the premises of an unidentified joint venture,
the daily Fakty reported.
	   Its output of 25,000 packs of cheap Prima cigarettes per day was
worth some 17,500 hryvna (dlrs 5,000) at street prices.
	   Police found more than 2 tons (2.2 short tons) of Ukrainian-made
tobacco, large stocks of Czech cigarette paper and tens of
thousands of ready-made cigarette packs at the plant's warehouses.
	   Investigators, who are still looking for the plant's managers,
suspect that the underground enterprise had been operating since
last winter, Fakty said.
	   The government of Ukraine has been desperately battling illegal
sales of tobacco products in previous years, trying to capture the
tax revenues from cigarettes. Officials estimate that about a third
of cigarettes sold in Ukraine annually are either smuggled or
illegally produced.

Fighting marks opening of new Islamic Studies Center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Fighting broke out Tuesday at the
official opening of a new center for Islamic studies as angry
Iranians used the occasion to protest against the Tehran
government.
	   Faezeh Rafsanjani, daughter of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, had been due to give a speech at the opening but
canceled, saying her security could not be guaranteed.
	   Despite her absence, a handful of protesters stormed the podium
at Leiden University and began calling for more democracy in Iran.
Police broke up a number of scuffles and dragged protesters out of
the hall but there were no immediate reports of arrests.
	   State Secretary for Justice Job Cohen, who was present at the
opening, witnessed the scenes.
	   ``It is a shame,'' he told Dutch television. ``But I find it
understandable ... there are political opposites here.''
	   Members of a group called the Democratic Iranian Women's
Movement, who were among the protesters, described Rafsanjani's
daughter as ``one of the current leaders of the religious
dictatorship ruling Iran.''
	   The establishment of the new study center at the nation's oldest
and most prestigious university has been dogged by criticism that
it will provide a haven for Islamic extremists.
	   But Cohen said it was important to have such a center in the
Netherlands.
	   ``The Islamic world is increasingly important for our country,''
he said. ``I think that an academic environment should have room
for it.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Japanese company confirmed Tuesday that it is
participating in three major development projects in Kazakstan, a
news report said.
	   Marubeni Corp. said it has joined projects to renovate an oil
refinery and build a petrochemicals plant and a barge-building
facility, Nurlan Kapparov, the head of the Kazakoil Company, told
the Interfax news agency. Kazakstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev
met with a Marubeni delegation Tuesday.
	   The project to increase output at the refinery at the Atyrau oil
field in western Kazakstan will cost at least dlrs 500 million
alone, Interfax said. Marubeni is now doing a feasibility study for
the project.
	   Marubeni has a trade turnover of dlrs 700 million with countries
of the former Soviet Union. It plans to open a branch office in
Kazakstan's capital Astana, Interfax said.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The governing Nationalist Party dropped
President Lee Teng-hui's son-in-law Tuesday from a list of
politicians eligible to fill legislative seats to be given out by
party leaders following elections in December.
	   Lai Kuo-chow, head of the party's Youth Affairs Committee, had
been widely reported to be a favorite for one of the posts,
sparking widespread criticism against cronyism within the party
headed by Lee.
	   The China Times, one of Taiwan's two largest dailies, quoted
unnamed sources as saying Lai's name was dropped at the last minute
at Lee's intervention.
	   Lee has been Taiwan's president since 1988, but has said he
would retire after his present term ends in 18 months.
	   Many Taiwanese have kept a wary eye on Lai, worried he might be
unfairly moved ahead through favoritism. Lee's only son died of
cancer, and he is known to have treated Lai as his own son.
	   But Lai has some support. A dozen Nationalist cadres gathered
outside party headquarters Tuesday to protest the party's decision
in Lai's case. The decision became known earlier Tuesday, when the
Nationalist Party unveiled a list of 28 politicians eligible for
proportional representation in the Dec. 5 elections.
	   Forty-one legislative seats are set aside to be chosen by party
leaders _ based on the percentage of seats won in the popular
election. Voters will decide 168 seats, with 16 more seats reserved
for aboriginals and overseas Chinese.
	   As of Tuesday, the day before official registration was to end,
nearly 200 candidates had registered to run.
	   The Nationalists have controlled Taiwan since they fled mainland
China in 1949. But the party has been harmed by a
corruption-tainted image, and its grip on power has loosened in the
past decade since Taiwan began democratic reforms.
	   The Nationalist Party is expected to win just half of the
popular vote in December.

Zhirinovsky invites Taiwan's Lee, but Russia says ties unofficial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Russian ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky on Tuesday invited Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to
visit Moscow, but Russia's Foreign Ministry reaffirmed that ties
with the island are strictly unofficial.
	   Zhirinovsky, leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party,
praised the political and economic reforms that have transformed
Taiwan from an authoritarian state to a leading democracy and
economic powerhouse over the course of a decade.
	   Taiwan's example deserved study by Russia, Zhirinovsky told Lee,
according to a news release from the presidential office.
	   Lee said he would be ``very pleased'' to visit Moscow at an
``appropriate time.''
	   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said Zhirinovsky was acting as a private citizen, and reaffirmed
Russia's commitment to maintain only unofficial relations with
Taiwan out of deference to its ties with China.
	   ``Russian-Taiwanese ties and contacts in the trade, economic and
cultural spheres are of an unofficial character,'' Rakhmanin was
quoted as saying by the Tass news agency.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
international recognition. It strongly objects to exchanges of
high-level visits between Taiwan and countries that recognize
Beijing.

Palestinian security official: grenade attacker worked alone

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian who hurled two grenades
into a crowded bus stop, wounding 64 Israelis, acted alone and not
on orders from the militant Islamic group Hamas, a Palestinian
security official said Tuesday.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the West Bank security chief, acknowledged that
the suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, has ties to Hamas.
	   However, Rajoub said there were no indications that Sarsour
received help from Hamas in carrying out Monday's attack in the
Israeli desert town of Beersheb.
	   ``I believe he acted alone,'' Rajoub said.
	   Sarsour was overpowered and arrested by Israel immediately after
hurling the grenades outside the Beersheba central bus station.
	   Sarsour, a father of five, lives in the Palestinian-controlled
part of the West Bank town of Hebron and works as a plasterer.
	   Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious
fervor. He sports a large white prayer cap and his wife, Khaloud,
wears a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm
among observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin hangs in the Sarsour home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her five young children _ the
oldest is nine _ crowded around her as she spoke.
	   In 1982, Israel demolished the Sarsour family home and Sarsour
was jailed twice by Israel during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.

North Korean defector gets dlrs 185,200
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A prominent defector from North Korea
has received 250 million won (dlrs 185,200) in a cash reward from
the South Korean government, officials said Tuesday.
	   Hwang Jang Yop, 75, a former communist party secretary and
confidant to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, arrived in Seoul in
April 1997, becoming the highest-ranking North Korean official to
defect to rival South Korea.
	   Hwang's cash award was 36 times the dlrs 5,100 given to an
ordinary defector.
	   ``We are providing defectors with financial assistance according
to the quantity and quality of the data they bring with them,''
Unification Minister Kang In-duk told a parliamentary hearing
Tuesday.
	   Hwang first defected to the South Korean Embassy in Beijing last
year, creating an international diplomatic furor involving the two
Koreas and China. After 67 days and a side trip to the Philippines,
he was allowed to reach Seoul.
	   Hwang was said to have brought South Korean authorities valuable
information, including a rare insight into the thinking of the
reclusive North's leadership.
	   South Korea welcomes defectors from communist North Korea,
viewing them as living testimony to the superiority of its
capitalist system.
	   As food and fuel shortages have worsened in North Korea, more
than 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years, mostly through China.
	   But the upsurge in defectors has created budget problems for the
Seoul government, which has cut cash rewards to around dlrs 5,100,
down from the previous dlrs 10,000.
	   Korea has been divided into the communist North and capitalist
South since 1945. The two sides fought a bloody war in 1950-53.

Score of Diana `Candle' tribute to be auctioned for charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Producer George Martin's score for Elton John's
``Candle in the Wind '97,'' the best-selling single of all time,
will be auctioned for charity.
	   The arrangement, written hastily by the legendary Beatles
producer last year for the tribute to Princess Diana, is expected
to fetch about dlrs 100,000 when Sotheby's holds the sale in New
York in December, the auction house says.
	   A special sales award from the British Phonographic Industry
marking 33 million sales of the single also will be auctioned with
the score.
	   Martin, 72, was enlisted for the ``Candle in the Wind '97''
project after John performed the revised song at Westminster Abbey
for Diana's Sept. 6 funeral.
	   ``We met in the studio at 1 p.m. knowing that we had to work
fast,'' Martin said of the recording day. ``I had no preconceived
ideas about the arrangement so I took the precaution of booking a
string quartet and a couple of woodwind for the late afternoon.''
	   Within weeks, the single overtook the previous best-seller, Bing
Crosby's ``White Christmas,'' which had sold 30 million.
	   Proceeds from the December sale will go to Nordoff Robbins Music
Therapy, the BRIT Trust and the Royal National Institute for the
Blind's Redhill College.
	   In February, the handwritten lyrics to the new ``Candle'' sold
for dlrs 400,000 in Los Angeles to a children's foundation created
by Walt Disney's daughter.

Cambodian government displays seized timber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DEI EDH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's outgoing agriculture
minister showed off a load of seized timber to foreign aid
representatives Tuesday in a bid to demonstrate the government's
tough new stance on illegal logging.
	   However, the seizure appeared to be a drop in the bucket
compared to the vast illegal trade in logs that has deprived the
cash-strapped treasury of millions of dollars in export duties each
year.
	   Agriculture Minister Tao Seng Huor led representatives from the
U.N. Development Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization and
the Asian Development Bank to Dei Edh, a small village 20
kilometers (12 miles) downstream from Phnom Penh, to display 1,500
cubic meters (52,500 cubic feet) of logs seized from a river barge.
	   ``The two prime ministers have given orders to the ministry of
agriculture to take strong measures against illegal logging
anywhere in the country,'' Tao Seng Huor told his guests. ``We will
not allow any more anarchy in logging.''
	   On Oct. 12, Tao Seng Huor ordered the forestry department to
begin a crackdown on illegal logging. Environmentalists welcomed
the order, but remained skeptical, saying similar past directives
have had no real effect on the timber trade.
	   The London-based environmental group Global Witness reported
earlier this month that it had seen hundreds of barges loaded with
logs during a September research trip to the Cambodia-Vietnam
border.
	   Global Witness also said that on one day of the trip, it had
shot video footage of a convoy of 80 logging trucks crossing the
border.
	   The felling of Cambodia's forests is occurring at such a rate
that the environmental group estimates there will be no
commercially valuable trees left to cut in five years.
	   Tao Seng Huor said the seizure at Dei Edh was the second along
the Mekong since April and that armed forestry rangers had been
placed on main highways and around forests to deter illegal
loggers.
	   Although no arrests were made during the seizure, Tao Seng Huor
said ``armed men'' had cut the logs in the eastern province of
Kratie and sent them down the Mekong. The shipment was to be sold
at the Vietnamese border for dlrs 360,000, he said.
	   The minister would not answer questions about whether soldiers
from the Cambodian army, known to be a major player in the log
trade, were involved in the smuggling.
	   Untangling the web of corruption in the military and government
that drives the illegal logging will require the personal
endorsement of a sustainable forestry policy by Cambodian leader
Hun Sen, Global Witness says.
	   A sustainable forestry plan was completed earlier this year by
the forestry department with the help of the World Bank, but
implementation awaits funding being sought by the government.
	   The government's inability or unwillingness to curb illegal
logging and collect timber export tax revenues led the
International Monetary Fund to withhold dlrs 60 million in
subsidized loans to Cambodia in 1996 and 1997.
	   The IMF withdrew its staff from Cambodia last year shortly after
Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in
a violent coup.

Palestinian security official: Grenade attacker worked alone

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian who hurled two grenades
into a crowded bus stop, wounding 64 Israelis, acted alone and not
on orders from the militant Islamic group Hamas, a Palestinian
security official said Tuesday.
	   Jibril Rajoub, the West Bank security chief, acknowledged that
the suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, has ties to Hamas.
	   However, Rajoub said there were no indications that Sarsourr, a father of five, lives in the Palestinian-controlled
part of the West Bank town of Hebron and works as a plasterer.
	   Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious
fervor. He sports a large white prayer cap and his wife, Khaloud,
wears a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm
among observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin hangs in the Sarsour home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her five young children _ the
oldest is nine _ crowded around her as she spoke.
	   In 1982, Israel demolished the Sarsour family home and Sarsour
was jailed twice by Israel during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Some injured victims of the weekend
fireball that tore through this southern Nigerian town have been
taken from hospitals by friends and relatives who fear they may be
arrested for stealing gasoline, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   At least 100 people are believed to be in area hospitals after
the blaze, which began Saturday as crowds were scavenging gasoline
spilled from a pipeline. But hundreds more are believed to be
injured and receiving treatment at home, local officials say.
	   At least 500 people were killed when the gasoline exploded,
military officials said.
	   The area's hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of
doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn care _ were
overwhelmed by the disaster. Doctors were overworked and medicine
in short supply, local officials have said.
	   In addition, the government-owned Daily Times newspaper said,
some of the burn victims have been quietly pulled from hospitals
because their friends and relatives fear they could be arrested.
Officials have not said, however, if charges would be pressed.
	   The newspaper gave no figures for how many people have stopped
their treatment.
	   Drawn by rumors that a huge pool of gasoline was free for the
taking, hundreds of people converged on Jesse, about 300 kilometers
(180 miles) southeast of Lagos, over the weekend.
	   With dozens of charred, unidentified bodies littering the town
and flames still occasionally flaring up to 20 meters (65 feet)
high, authorities began the grim task Monday of burying the dead.
	   By Monday night, firefighters had stopped battling the flames
and waited for the blaze, which spread thick black smoke for miles
(kilometers), to burn itself out. But thousands of gallons of fuel
remained in the pipeline, and officials warned it could take days
for the fire to burn itself out.
	   A mass grave was being dug at the edge of the town to bury
hundreds of unidentified corpses, many burned beyond recognition.
Separate burials were held Monday for at least 52 of the dead, and
dozens of people took corpses back to surrounding villages.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter
Monday for a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for
medical treatment, but that there would be no compensation to
survivors, apparently because many of those killed were believed to
be scavenging fuel.
	   Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred by decades
of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to regularly
sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation.
	   The above-ground pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern
city of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with
the northern city of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles)
away.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed the pipeline
had purposely been punctured, and that scavengers tools had sparked
the explosion. Some newspaper reports, though, said a cigarette may
have started the conflagration.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages, skyrocketing black-market prices and long gasoline
lines.

 &UR; Israel will not foot the bill for West Bank army redeployment &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman said Tuesday
Israel would not foot the bill for new army bases and roads that
will be needed if Israel agrees to withdraw from more areas of the
West Bank.
	   Reports in the Israeli media have said Israel will need dlrs 500
million to dlrs 1 billion to redeploy its military forces, and that
Israel will ask the United States to assume the costs.
	   Neeman said Israel had already paid to build the West Bank bases
in the first place.
	   ``Why should the Israeli public pay?'' Neeman told The
Associated Press.
	   Asked why the American taxpayers should pay, Neeman said: ``I
didn't say the American public (should pay). You heard me say the
American public? I didn't say.''
	   He refused to say if Israel would turn to international donors
who have supported the Oslo accords to handle such costs but
insisted that Israel's economy was already too hard pressed to bear
the burden.
	   ``Unless we want to put the Israeli economy through more slow
down or to a big depression and to have the unemployment (go up),
we will have to find sources outside the budget of the state of
Israel,'' Neeman told a meeting of the Foreign Press Association.
	   With leaders still wrangling over security issues at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland, Neeman said it was ``too early'' for Israel
to raise the issue.
	   Israel currently receives about dlrs 3 billion in economic and
military aid, and Neeman has vowed that within 10 years there will
be no need to give Israel economic help.
	   Asked about the reported costs of up to dlrs 1 billion for
building new military facilities, Neeman said he could not
speculate until he knew which bases were being moved and what roads
had to be constructed.
	   ``I don't know, and I don't think anybody knows until the maps
will be drawn,'' he said.
	   A lasting peace accord with the Palestinians, Neeman said, would
spur economic growth - not only in Israel but the entire region.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the first pro-government rally
since Malaysia's political crisis erupted, several hundred people
demonstrated Tuesday against the Philippine president, accusing him
of meddling in their country's internal politics.
	   The crowd of mostly businessmen and members of the ruling
National Front coalition waved placards in front of the Philippine
Embassy calling for President Joseph Estrada to stop backing jailed
dissident Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``Estrada is insane. You go look after your own country,'' said
a poster held by several women wearing T-shirts imprinted with an
image of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's face on the front.
	   ``Long live Mahathir!'' shouted another supporter, clad in a
business suit and tie. ``Estrada, you can have Anwar!''
	   Estrada's public support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal
friend, has angered the Malaysian government.
	   Though Estrada ended speculation about boycotting a summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur by
confirming his attendance, he said he would also try to meet with
Anwar in jail.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar denied
having canceled an upcoming bilateral military conference with the
Philippines. He said the meeting was postponed.
	   ``Malaysia has no intention of breaking any bilateral
arrangement. I have instructed my officers to find a suitable
date'' for both sides to reschedule, Syed Hamid said. He adding the
postponement ``had nothing to do with strained relations.''
	   The comments were in response to Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado, who said Monday that Malaysia had canceled the
conference without any clear reason. He said it might have resulted
from ``strained relations'' over Anwar.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and subsequently
arrested for organizing rallies against his former boss. He will
face trial starting Nov. 2 on 10 counts of illegal homosexual acts
and corruption.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday he had
contacted his Philippine counterpart, Domingo Siazon, to express
Malaysia's ``uneasiness'' over Estrada's statements.
	   Abdullah said the Philippine foreign minister had assured him
that Estrada's statements were made in his ``personal capacity''
and were not the government's stance.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, large protests in Malaysia have been
organized several times a week to demand his release and Mahathir's
resignation.

Wounded Mormon missionary recovering from stab wounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Mormon missionary who suffered multiple stab
wounds is making a rapid recovery and has provided evidence about a
second man involved in the weekend attack in central Russia, a
Mormon official said Tuesday.
	   Bradley Borden, of Mesa, Arizona, was alert and has been able
get out of bed and take a few steps in his hospital room in the
city of Ufa, said Donald Jarvis, the head of the Mormon mission in
the region.
	   ``He's quite lucid and seems to be healing quite nicely,''
Jarvis said in a telephone interview from Ufa.
	   Borden, 20, was stabbed in the liver and the pancreas and fellow
missionary Jose Manuel Mackintosh, 20, was killed when they were
attacked Saturday evening coming out of an apartment building
following a visit with a church family.
	   Mackintosh's body was being prepared Tuesday for return to his
family in Hiko, Nevada, said Jarvis.
	   Police have arrested one suspect in the case, and Borden spoke
with church lawyers on Tuesday, providing evidence about a second
man involved in the attack.
	   The suspect under arrest, Sergei Chudakov, is an alcoholic who
was drunk at the time of the attack, said Valery Ryzhov, the
district prosecutor in Ufa.
	   Chudakov is also accused of stabbing another man earlier on
Saturday before the attack on the two missionaries, Ryzhov said.
The suspect has been charged with inflicting heavy physical
injuries and hooliganism, and is likely to be charged with
additional, more serious offenses as the cases proceed, Ryzhov
said.
	   Authorities have described the attack as a random act of
violence that was not aimed at the church.
	   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 24 young
missionaries working in Ufa and was reviewing procedures, but felt
that region was normally quite safe.
	   ``We don't think Russia is particularly dangerous, and the city
where this took place is quite calm,'' said Jarvis.
	   The Mormons have about 500 missionaries in Russia and some
57,000 worldwide.

Gayoom wins referendum to govern Maldives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the
Maldives, the longest serving head of state in South Asia, has won
a referendum for a fifth term in office, officials said Tuesday.
	   Gayoom, 61, who has been president since 1978, polled 91 percent
of the votes in Friday's referendum to govern another five years,
defeating four other candidates. The result was declared late
Monday.
	   He is credited with liberalizing the economy and turning the
low-lying atoll nation into a country with a successful tourism
industry.
	   About 91,000 people voted. The vote count took three days
because ballot boxes were ferried from 202 inhabited coral islands
scattered 800 kilometers (500 miles) across the equator in the
Indian Ocean.
	   The Maldives, which has a population of about 250,000 people,
most Sunni Muslims, began the referendum in September in a new
two-stage process to choose the president.
	   Under the earlier system, the 50-member citizens' majlis, or
assembly, nominated a presidential candidate. Eight members of the
assembly were nominated by the president himself. If the majlis
nominated more than one person, a secret vote chose the winner. The
sole remaining candidate then faced a referendum, requiring a 51
percent endorsement by the people.
	   In 1993, the majlis proposed three names and eventually chose
the incumbent, Gayoom, who comfortably bagged the referendum with
over 90 percent vote.
	   Friday's election was the first under a new constitution that
came into effect in January. Under the new law, any Maldivian man
over the age of 35 can contest. Four others contested Friday's
referendum.
	   Men and women over the age of 21 were eligible to vote, but
women could not contest the presidency because the president must
also be the spiritual leader of the country.

Hong Kong's recession worse than first feared
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-8 with comments from Hong Kong's financial
secretary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's recession has been slightly worse
than officials first believed, with the economy shrinking by 5.2
percent in the second quarter, or 0.2 percentage point more than
originally estimated, the government said Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong officially went into recession after the economy
contracted for two successive quarters in the first half of the
year.
	   The figures for April-June were gloomier than expected because
of ``the further slackening in local consumer demand and export
performance,'' the government said Tuesday in releasing revised
statistics.
	   Officials noted, however, that the downturn was somewhat
exaggerated by a surge in growth during the second quarter of 1997.
	   The Hong Kong economy, which had grown by around 4.5 percent
annually over the past decade, expanded 5.3 percent in 1997 before
the Asian economic crisis started taking its toll.
	   In August, the government estimated the economy would contract
by 4 percent this year, compared with 3.5 percent growth forecast
earlier this year.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said late Tuesday there was no
need to change the forecast.
	   ``This estimate is reliable,'' Tsang told reporters after
returning from a visit to the United States and Europe. Hong Kong's
economy would continue to be ``affected by external factors,'' with
recovery depending on the performance of key Western markets, he
added.
	   ``Local consumer demand continued to be depressed by slackening
income, rising unemployment and further slump in asset prices,''
the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department said.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 5 percent and property
prices have fallen by up to 50 percent since their peak last year.
Meanwhile, a broad measure of Hong Kong's inflation dipped to 1.6
percent in the second quarter, from 4.2 percent in the first
quarter.

Serbian parliament to pass restrictive media law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Serbian Parliament met Tuesday
to adopt a new information law which, its critics say, further
restricts independent media and leads the country back to
dictatorship.
	   The draft of the law, expected to be passed later Tuesday, bans
broadcasts of Serbian-language programs by foreign media and calls
for huge fines against media editors and owners who disobey the
decree.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
report is against the law, and places further restrictions on
working permits for media organizations.
	   Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic, of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, claimed during the session that
the new media law is ``highly liberal.''
	   He explained that the envisaged huge fines - ranging from the
equivalent of dlrs 41,000 to 82,000 - ``must be an adequate
punishment for the possible harmful consequences'' of ``the
anti-state information'' or foreign ``psychological propaganda''
programs.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists said the law is highly
restrictive and again introduces censorship which was formally
abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s.
	   ``This law represents the basis for a permanent rule of the
black-red coalition,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former Serbian
information minister and a columnist of the recently banned Dnevni
Telegraf daily. He was referring to the Serbian ruling
ultra-nationalist - neo-Communist coalition.
	   ``The repressive law brings us back to the period of the
single-party Communist state,'' said lawyer Rajko Danilovic. ``It
represents the return to the monopoly on information.''
	   The government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
has used NATO threats of strikes on military targets in Serb-led
Yugoslavia to clamp down on its opponents. It has issued a series
of decrees tightening state control in the country.
	   One such decree imposed a temporary ban on broadcasts of
Serbian-language programs by foreign media -- such as the Voice of
America, Radio Free Europe and BBC -- and demanded ``patriotic''
reporting from the Serbian independent media critical of
Milosevic's policies.
	   Throughout the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have
accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict. Last week, the
government shut down prominent Nasa Borba, Danas and Dnevni
Telegraf dailies, following eviction of the popular Index radio
from its premises.
	   The moves have triggered a wave of domestic and international
protests but to no effect.
	   During the parliament session Tuesday, the General Secretary of
Milosevic's Socialist party, Gorica Gajevic, accused foreign
``media industry of inventing news,'' and said ``this law will
protect the freedom of media from its abuse.'
	   She praised the state-run media, fully in government control,
for their ``highly professional, ethical and objective informing
which defends dignity and patriotic morale'' of the Serbs. Other
leftist and ultra-nationalist deputies labeled the independent
media as ``subservient and vassal'' to the West.
	   Average monthly salary in Yugoslavia amounts to no more that
dlrs 100, and private owners of the fledgling independent media say
they would not be able to cope with the proposed fines.
	   ``I would simply have to close my paper,'' said Slavko Curuvija,
the owner and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf. ``The regime wants
to destroy independent media.''
	   He and other media owners indicated they would evade the Serbian
law by publishing in Montenegro, the small republic which with
Serbia forms Yugoslavia and is ruled by a pro-Western coalition.

Philippine stocks fall on profit-taking; peso slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell in mixed
trading Tuesday as profit-taking on several index heavyweights
ended three straight sessions of gains spurred by a cut in U.S.
interest rates last week.
	   The peso, meanwhile, was weighed down by the slide of the
Japanese yen and by the central bank's reduction of key overnight
rates, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index declined 21.66
points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,467.69 after surging 51.99 points
Monday.
	   The broader All Shares Index slipped 4.1 points to 476.60 after
advancing 13.72 points Monday.
	   ``It's just a technical correction, plain and simple,'' said
Vicente Unson, analyst for Dharmala Securities.
	   ``The run-up was a bit fast. The market had to take a breather
to avoid overextending itself,'' he said.
	   Over the previous three trading days, the index had gained
165.13 points, or 12 percent.
	   Blue chips that led the rally, such as Philippine Long Distance
Telephone, San Miguel, Ayala Land and Manila Electric, also led
Tuesday's retreat.
	   Overall, decliners narrowly edged out gainers 58 to 56, with 41
issues unchanged.
	   BPI Securities senior analyst Spencer Yap said stocks may
retreat further since some are already near overbought levels.
	   ``It's a healthy correction that will allow the market to base
build,'' he said.
	   Yap said the market has yet to digest the impact of the slight
cut in the central bank's overnight interest rates, although the
peso weakened moderately against the dollar.
	   The central bank reduced by a quarter-percentage point its
overnight borrowing and lending rates to 13.75 percent and 15.75
percent, respectively.
	   Lower interest rates usually help inject needed liquidity into
the stock market.
	   The dollar, meanwhile, averaged 42.923 pesos for the day, up
from Monday's 42.761 pesos.
	   Traders said the interest rate cuts triggered slight arbitrage
trading but not enough to drive the dollar above 43 pesos.
	   The dollar was last traded at 42.88 pesos, near its intraday low
of 42.85 pesos, as demand for the U.S. currency fizzled out late in
the session on concerns the yen may resume its advance.
	   The yen's dramatic rise last week against the dollar provided
the peso with enough steam to breach the 43 peso-to-the-dollar
mark.
	   Traders said that if the yen slides further, the peso could
retreat to 43.20 pesos to a dollar Wednesday.
	   The central bank and some currency traders expect the peso to
advance against the dollar starting next month, when dollar
remittances from Filipinos working overseas start to increase in
preparation for Christmas.
	   The government estimates that the remittances will grow by 10
percent this year from last year's dlrs 5.7 billion.

Thailand hopes to take rugby sevens crown from Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's sports establishment is
hoping the fallout from Hong Kong's return to China will land a
plum _ a major international rugby sevens competition _ in its lap.
	   Over the past 22 years, the annual Hong Kong Sevens has
developed into perhaps the premier seven-a-side tournament,
attracting fans from around the world to both superb play and
after-game pub crawls.
	   Of much more recent vintage, Thailand's version has grown
steadily with this year's Oct. 31-Nov. 1 event drawing 24 teams
from 11 countries. It has high ambitions.
	   ``Perhaps the Hong Kong Sevens are losing a little interest. We
believe the Bangkok Sevens will soon rival (them),'' says a hopeful
David Dufall, chairman of the organizing committee.
	   This year's Hong Kong tournament, played in March, marked the
first time tickets were not sold out in a day. But the finals drew
a near capacity crowd of 40,000.
	   ``I think next year will tell,'' Dufall said of Hong Kong's
prospects, which officials there say are bright despite the loss of
some of the tourney's biggest boosters _ British expatriates whose
numbers have shrunk in the wake of Hong Kong's reversion to China.
	   With the former colony becoming de-Anglicized, some say the
rugbyesque atmosphere around the Sevens will be diluted and thus
over time fewer devotees will make the trip.
	   Hong Kong will also find it harder to field top flight players
because of the increasing number of test matches being played in
the leading rugby nations.
	   But Thailand, which invites clubs rather than national teams,
has a ways to go before it can fully take up any slack in Hong
Kong. For a start, the venue is an old university stadium for fewer
than 4,000 spectators.
	   And while the Thai Rugby Union celebrates its 60th anniversary
this year and the sport is enjoying healthy growth, most Thais
don't know a try from a scrum. Soccer and boxing are the sports of
mass appeal.
	   Top teams for the 4th Annual Carlsberg Rugby Sevens, the biggest
to date, will be coming from France, Australia, New Zealand,
Thailand and Fiji. The Pacific island's Davetalevu club is looking
to win for the third time.
	   Dufall said the friendly, easy going ambiance offered by the
Thais, as well as Bangkok's anything-goes night life, has
contributed to the growth of the Bangkok Sevens. The powerful Thai
army has also become a major patron.
	   Boosting this year's event will be the mounting sports fever as
Thailand prepares to host the 13th Asian Games Dec. 6-20. Rugby
will be among the sports played at Asia's edition of the Olympics.
	   A shorter, fleeter version of 15-a-side rugby, the sevens
originated in the small Scottish town of Melrose when a local
butcher, Adam Ned Haig, was seeking to shore up his financially
flagging rugby club.
	   He came up with the idea for a tournament, but since it was
impossible to squeeze several full-length, 15-a-side games into one
afternoon, he proposed shorter contests with fewer players.
	   The 1883 event was won by the hosts but the neighboring town,
whose team they beat, maintains to this day that Melrose didn't
play by the rules.

Thai public can e-mail complaints about army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The army, undergoing a series of
reforms under a new commander, will accept complaints and
suggestions from the public via telephone, mail and e-mail, local
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The idea is to obtain feedback from the general public about the
institution, army commander Gen. Surayuth Chulanon was quoted as
saying by the Bangkok Post.
	   Comments, suggestions and complaints are being collected on a
daily basis to present to Surayuth, the Post reported.
	   The army also plans to conduct an opinion poll about its move to
crack down on soldiers involved in organized crime.
	   Both army and police officers have reportedly been moonlighting
as enforcers and bodyguards for local crime bosses.
	   Army officers also have allegedly been running an extortion ring
targeting Bangkok nightclubs and discotheques.
	   Surayuth, recently appointed by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
has vowed to clean up the army, as well as keep it out of politics.
	   The army as an institution has long been involved in commercial
activities that have gone unaudited by the government. It has also
been a major power broker on the political scene.

Relief convoys resume in Kosovo, U.N. team arrives

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relief convoys rolled again Tuesday
in Kosovo after a one-day halt due to renewed violence, and a
20-member U.N. team arrived to serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the tense province.
	   Following ethnic Albanian attacks on Serb police last weekend,
the government has moved tanks and troops to a front line in
central Kosovo, raising fears for future of the the U.S.-brokered
agreement to end the violence in the province.
	   But while the military presence remained high Tuesday, there
were no immediate reports of new shelling or skirmishes and the
push resumed to get help to tens of thousands of displaced Kosovo
residents before the onset of winter.
	   Mercy Corps International and other humanitarian groups sent
some 150 tons of food, clothing, mattresses and other items to
Djinovce, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina,
delivering them in a convoy to an aid warehouse for distribution.
	   Other aid was being delivered elsewhere.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday had called off
two convoys of relief supplies headed to western Kosovo in the wake
of a Serb military buildup that followed weekend violence in which
at least three Serb police were killed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists. As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian
disaster if the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting,
thousands still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark was expected in Belgrade later
Tuesday to discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to
meet the alliance's Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo
or face airstrikes.
	   The newly arrived U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of
Sweden, consists of representatives of human rights, humanitarian,
political and peacekeeping offices.
	   They are expected to stay for about a week to gather information
on efforts to halt the fighting.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' said de Mistura, commenting on last week's
breakthrough agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   More Yugoslav army troops were positioned southwest of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital, after a surge of weekend violence that left
three Serb policemen dead and led to mutual accusations between
authorities and radical Albanians on who started the bloodshed.
	   Western officials, concerned about the skirmishes, indicated
that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were to blame.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday the
skirmishing was unacceptable, regardless of which side opened fire
first.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   As part of that deal, a 2,000-member international verification
force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia honors its
promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the monitors are
in Kosovo.

Defector says Odai Hussein operates 50 vessels to smuggle oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's oldest son, Odai, operates
a fleet of 50 vessels to smuggle oil through Iran in defiance of
U.N. sanctions, a former aide to Odai was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   The vessels are capable of carrying up to 10,000 tons of oil
products, which are eventually sold in the Gulf, Abbas al-Janabi, a
former personal secretary of Odai, was quoted as saying by the
respected Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   Al-Janabi said in an interview that Odai Hussein owns another
fleet of road tankers to smuggle fuel and oil to Turkey, the
London-based Arabic daily reported. The oil business earns Odai
hundreds of million of dollars, it quoted him as saying.
	   Al-Hayat did not say if al-Janabi provided any evidence to back
his claim, which adds to a plethora of similar reports of thriving
illegal oil trade from Iraq.
	   In May, the U.S. undersecretary of state, Thomas Pickering, said
Iraq sells more than 200,000 barrels of oil illegally each day.
	   Iranian and Turkish officials were not immediately available for
a comment.
	   Al-Janabi defected to the West last spring and lives in hiding
in Europe, fearing retribution by Iraqi authorities. Al-Hayat said
the interview was conducted in a European country.
	   Iraq is barred from freely selling oil. It can only export
limited quantities under U.N. supervision, and use the money to buy
food and humanitarian goods as an exception to the economic
sanctions imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Janabi did not say how the smuggling is done. But it is
believed that the vessels, sailing close to the shore, stop first
at Iranian ports where they obtain certification to show that the
oil is Iranian. This allows them to openly evade U.S.-led
multinational naval patrols hunting for Iraqi smugglers.
	   Al-Janabi said Odai is the prime beneficiary of the black
economy spawned by the sanctions, controlling the trade in whisky,
cigarettes, fuel oil and urea fertilizers.
	   Odai ``possesses a trade empire that extends to Turkey, Iran,
Jordan and Lebanon ... with a Paris-based coordination office,''
al-Janabi said.
	   He said Odai confiscated all food and medicine relief aid sent
by the United Arab Emirates and stored it in the warehouses of the
Olympics Committee which he heads.
	   The goods are being sold in Baghdad with labels identifying them
as UAE relief aid, he said.
	   Al-Janabi, 50, worked for the Iraqi national news agency and was
later appointed editor of Odai's daily newspaper, Babel. Odai, 34,
has no government post but is believed to be his father's political
heir.
	   Al-Hayat published another portion of the interview with
al-Janabi on Monday in which he said Odai stole more than 160 cars
and several boats as well as gold, jewelry and carpets from Kuwait
during Iraq's seven-month occupation of the emirate.

Former Philippine president testifies in congressional graft probe

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former President Fidel Ramos
testified Tuesday before a Senate committee investigating alleged
corruption in the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the
Philippines' declaration of independence.
	   Ramos, the country's first leader to be summoned by Congress,
said his appearance ``could open the floodgates'' for other
Philippine presidents to be summoned in congressional probes, but
added that he needed to defend the 2.4 billion peso (dlrs 55.8
million) centennial exposition.
	   ``A number of legal luminaries are one in saying that my
appearance before you will create a precedent,'' Ramos told the
Senate committee.
	   ``If such be the case, so be it. But I cannot and will not in
conscience allow the integrity of an excellent world-class
undertaking like the centennial expo to be unfairly sullied,'' he
said.
	   The project, which opened shortly before Ramos ended his term in
June, involved the construction of a historical theme park, theater
and trade exhibition complex at the Clark Special Economic Zone in
Pampanga province, north of Manila.
	   The complex was one of the major sites of celebrations on June
12 of the centennial of the Philippines' 1898 declaration of
independence from Spain.
	   Philippine senators are investigating allegations that former
officials under Ramos may have received huge kickbacks from the
project.
	   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, chairman of the Senate committee, said
it wants to find out why the project's budget ballooned from an
initial 1.2 billion pesos (dlrs 27.9 million).
	   He said there were indications construction costs were inflated
and contracts were awarded without required public bidding.
	   On criticisms that the project was extravagant and unnecessary
amid the country's economic difficulties, Ramos said the country
would ultimately benefit from it financially and Filipinos would be
reminded of their history.
	   While he defended the integrity of top aides involved in the
project, Ramos acknowledged corruption was possible ``down the
line.''
	   ``There could be anomalies, abuses, graft and corrupt practices
down the line, but there were safeguards put up,'' Ramos said.
	   While Ramos was not specifically accused of corruption, Sen.
Miriam Defensor Santiago, a long-time critic, said the former
president may have violated the law when he ordered the tourism
department to allocate part of its budget to a commission that took
charge of the centennial celebrations.
	   Santiago said Ramos may also have violated ethical standards for
government officials when he allowed the commission to solicit and
accept donations to fund the celebrations.
	   Ramos said he did not directly order such solicitations.

Relief convoys resume in Kosovo, U.N. team arrives
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relief convoys rolled again Tuesday
in Kosovo after a one-day halt due to renewed violence, and a
20-member U.N. team arrived to serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the tense province.
	   Following ethnic Albanian attacks on Serb police last weekend,
the government has moved tanks and troops to a front line in
central Kosovo, raising fears for future of the the U.S.-brokered
agreement to end the violence in the province.
	   But while the military presence remained high Tuesday, there
were no immediate reports of new shelling or skirmishes and the
push resumed to get help to tens of thousands of displaced Kosovo
residents before the onset of winter.
	   Mercy Corps International and other humanitarian groups sent
some 150 tons of food, clothing, mattresses and other items to
Djinovce, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina,
delivering them in a convoy to an aid warehouse for distribution.
	   Other aid was being delivered elsewhere.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday had called off
two convoys of relief supplies headed to western Kosovo in the wake
of a Serb military buildup that followed weekend violence in which
at least three Serb police were killed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists. As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian
disaster if the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting,
thousands still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark was expected in Belgrade later
Tuesday to discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to
meet the alliance's Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo
or face airstrikes.
	   The newly arrived U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of
Sweden, consists of representatives of human rights, humanitarian,
political and peacekeeping offices.
	   They are expected to stay for about a week to gather information
on efforts to halt the fighting.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' said de Mistura, commenting on last week's
breakthrough agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   More Yugoslav army troops were positioned southwest of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital, after a surge of weekend violence that left
three Serb policemen dead and led to mutual accusations between
authorities and radical Albanians on who started the bloodshed.
	   Western officials, concerned about the skirmishes, indicated
that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were to blame.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday the
skirmishing was unacceptable, regardless of which side opened fire
first.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

Israeli mayor, Prince Hassan discuss peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A visiting Israeli mayor on Tuesday met
with Crown Prince Hassan to discuss the stalled Mideast peace
process and closer cooperation between the two countries.
	   The meeting with Haifa mayor Amram Mitzna comes one day after
the prince held similar talks with the mayor of Umm el-Fahm, a
predominantly Arab town in northern Israel captured from the
British-mandate Palestine in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
	   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad said Mitzna was accompanied
by 15 business executives at the meeting. Hassan, who is King
Hussein's brother, is acting as regent while the monarch is
undergoing cancer treatment in the United States.
	   In Monday's meeting, Umm el-Fahm mayor Raed Salah Suleiman
briefed Hassan on clashes between the town's residents and Israeli
police over seizure of their land earlier this month, Jordanian
newspapers reported.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, hopes
for a swift settlement to the Palestinian conflict _ the core of
the Arab-Israeli dispute.
	   The government often hosts Israelis as part of a dialogue
underway with various Israeli political groups on Middle East
peacemaking.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian who hurled two grenades into a
crowded bus stop, wounding 64 Israelis, had some ties to the
Islamic militant group Hamas but acted alone, the Palestinians'
security chief in the West Bank said Tuesday.
	   The security chief, Jibril Rajoub, identified the suspect as
29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, a resident of the
Palestinian-controlled part of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   Sarsour was wrestled to the ground and arrested immediately
after Monday's grenade attack in the central bus station of the
town of Beersheba in Israel's southern Negev Desert.
	   On Tuesday, 27 people remained hospitalized, including a
45-year-old man was was in intensive care, said officials at
Beersheba's Sorokka Hospital.
	   In response to the attack, Israeli negotiators at the Mideast
summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland said they would only discuss
security-related issues with the Palestinians.
	   Israel has been bracing for a large terror attack by Hamas in
recent weeks, following Hamas threats to avenge the killings of two
of the group's top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Palestinian militants have so far mounted only smaller
operations, including drive-by shootings, stabbings and grenade
attacks.
	   Israeli commentator Ron Ben-Ishai said Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Hamas apparently have an understanding that the group
will, for the time being, refrain from large-scale attacks that
could dash all hopes of an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank. Instead, Hamas will carry out only smaller operations, such
as Monday's hand grenade incident in Beersheba, Ben-Ishai said.
	   Arafat can always claim that such attacks are spontaneous acts
by individuals that are impossible to predict and prevent,
Ben-Ishai wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   ``This is Hamas' way of hanging on to the terror stick at both
ends, and putting a spoke into the wheels of the negotiations,''
Ben-Ishai wrote.
	   Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, acknowledged that
Monday's assailant had ties to Hamas, and was imprisoned twice by
Israel during the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising.
	   However, Rajoub said there was no sign that Sarsour had acted on
behalf of the group when he hurled the hand grenades. ``I believe
he acted alone,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press.
	   Sarsour, a father of five, lives in the Palestinian-controlled
part of the West Bank town of Hebron and works as a plasterer.
	   Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious
fervor. He sports a large white prayer cap and his wife, Khaloud,
wears a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm
among observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin hangs in the Sarsour home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her five young children _ the
oldest is nine _ crowded around her as she spoke.
	   In 1982, Israel demolished the Sarsour family home and Sarsour
was jailed twice by Israel during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.

Kenyan teachers end strike on independence heroes day

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Teachers ended their 12-day strike
Tuesday, heeding pleas from religious leaders to return to their
posts to oversee national exams scheduled to begin Wednesday.
	   The decision came hours after President Daniel arap Moi
reiterated the government was unable to pay 200 percent pay
increases over five years, which he promised in a reelection
campaign a year ago.
	   ``I told teachers the truth,'' Moi said in Swahili at Nyayo
National Stadium in central Nairobi. ``There is no money! There is
no money! There is no money!''
	   The strike by 260,000 grade- and high-school teachers had idled
7 million students who were to begin national examinations which
will decide whether they can advance to the next level.
	   Moi had said he would send government workers, protected by
police, into schools to go ahead with the exams.
	   But to avoid what could have provoked a violent conflict between
teachers and authorities, Protestant and Catholic bishops
negotiated an end to the strike.
	   ``We are parents, we are professionals, we are human,'' said
John Katumanga, chairman of the Kenya National Union of Teachers.
``Arising from the fact that nonprofessionals were to invigilate
the exams, and if the results are bad it would be blamed on
teachers, we decided to postpone.''
	   But teachers expected clergy to continue to fostered
negotiations with the government, he said. ``We hope ... it will
not be necessary for us to call to resume the strike.''
	   Katumanga said teachers were not convinced the government had no
money.

Death toll rises to 11 from capsized Malaysian boat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to raise death toll, EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The death toll from a weekend boat
accident off Malaysia's western coast rose to 11 Tuesday, and
rescuers searched for four more bodies, a news report said.
	   Fishermen and rescue workers discovered the bodies of five men
floating in choppy waters near the southwestern state of Malacca,
the Bernama news agency reported. Six bodies had been found
earlier.
	   Eighteen others on board swam to safety or were rescued after
strong waves flipped the overcrowded boat at around midnight
Sunday. It was carrying mostly workers from a resort on the Pulau
Besar island.
	   Malacca marine officials said the vessel was a tourist boat that
had been rented to fill in for the normal ferry used to shuttle
workers from the Pandanusa Island Resort to the mainland.
	   Officials suspended the license of the boat's owner after
discovering 33 people had been crammed into the boat, which had a
capacity of 12.
	   ``We have suspended his license with immediate effect as
investigations showed that he had violated various procedures,''
acting Marine Department director-general Raja Malek Raja
Kamaruzaman was quoted as saying.
	   Police identified the five latest victims as Ridzuan Nordin,
Ibrahim Tambul, Amran Zakariah, Ahmad Shukri Muib and Mohd Sattar
Abdullah.

Report: Remains of Czar's two missing children found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Archeologists may have found the remains of Czar
Nicholas II's two missing children, solving one of the lingering
mysteries of the Russian Revolution, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The czar, his family and their servants were executed on July
17, 1918, in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and their
bodies dumped in an unmarked pit until they were unearthed in 1991.
	   After seven years of investigation and genetic tests, they were
buried in St. Petersburg in July.
	   But the remains of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne,
and one of his sisters _ either Maria or Anastasia _ were missing.
Anastasia's name was on one of the coffins this summer and
investigators say forensic tests lead them to believe the missing
remains are those of Maria.
	   An independent archaeological expedition has spent two months
searching for the two children's remains at the site where the
bodies were burned by the Bolsheviks after the executions,
Moskovsky Komsomolets reported Tuesday.
	   Researchers have found four topaz beads of the kind that had
been presented each year to Maria on her birthday, and some bones
believed to be remains of Alexei and Maria, said forensic expert
Sergei Nikitin, who took part in the expedition.
	   The archaeologists have also found several bullets, which had
apparently gotten stuck in the jewelry sewn into the girl's corset,
he said, according to the newspaper.
	   The Bolsheviks had to use bayonets to finish killing the women
because the jewelry caused some of the bullets to ricochet or get
stuck.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of more than dlrs 100 million in accounts belonging to
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ is frozen in Swiss bank
accounts. But the office is also requesting that Britain seize dlrs
24.5 million.
	   The office ``holds that the frozen funds in Swiss bank accounts
_ of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner _ constitute in part the
criminal proceeds of protection payoffs,'' it said in a statement.

Palestinians protest new army post in Hebron as violence grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Several dozen Palestinians staged a
sit-in protest Tuesday in the West Bank town of Hebron against a
new Israeli army outpost set up overnight on the roof of their
apartment building.
	   The Palestinians sitting on mattresses and chairs outside their
building in the Israeli-controlled part of the city said they would
not leave until the soldiers left.
	   The army set up its post near the Jewish enclave of Beit
Hadassah on the roof of a nearby Palestinian-owned building in the
night from Monday to Tuesday.
	   The army said that soon after soldiers moved into the new
outpost, several shots were fired toward it from the nearby
Palestinian-controlled area and several firebombs were thrown
nearby toward an army patrol.
	   The Israeli army withdrew to the center of Hebron in January
1997 to allow for the expansion of Palestinian autonomy in 85
percent of the city. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and some
130,000 Palestinians.

Germany commits to establishing a foundation for slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Reversing German policy, the new
center-left government pledged Tuesday to set up foundations to
compensate World War II slave laborers and ``forgotten victims'' of
the Nazis.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said no concrete plans or
figures had been set for either fund.
	   ``But we want to do something together with industry'' to
compensate former slave laborers, he said. ``We've already started
thinking about it.''
	   Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats of more at home
from Nazi-era victims, German firms in recent months have come
under increasing pressure to address the issue of slave labor.
	   For years they argued the government, as legal successor to the
Nazi regime, should be responsible for back wage claims. But
recently some of Germany's biggest firms have suggested they would
be willing to contribute to a publicly administered fund.
	   But outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl had rejected any government
involvement, saying companies are responsible for back wage claims.
	   Schroeder said German firms that used slave labor during the
Nazi era have ``a historical, moral duty to fulfill.'' But he also
stressed that they have ``a need for protection against legal
action that we have to guarantee.''
	   Volkswagen and electronics giant Siemens announced plans
separately to establish their own funds to compensate former slave
laborers forced to work for them by the Nazis during World War II.
	   The two companies, along with Krupp, Daimler-Benz, Audi and BMW,
are among those named in a New York lawsuit seeking a portion of
company profits for thousands of former slave laborers.
	   The coalition agreement signed by Schroeder and the small Greens
party also calls for a new government foundation to compensate
``forgotten victims'' of Nazi injustice.
	   Greens party leader and designated foreign minister Joschka
Fischer said they included homosexuals persecuted under the Nazis,
as well as Gypsies and other groups excluded from making claims
under current law.
	   Since World War II, the German government has paid billions in
compensation for health damage and imprisonment.

Muslim minister apologizes to Hindus in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A Muslim Cabinet minister who
criticized the daughter of Indonesia's founding president
apologized Tuesday after protests by members of the Hindu minority.
	   Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin last week reportedly dismissed the
chances of popular opposition faction leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
of being elected president next year by suggesting that she was a
Hindu.
	   ``Are the Indonesian people willing to have a Hindu president?''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Megawati's paternal grandmother came from the predominantly
Hindu island of Bali. However, both her parents, including the late
President Sukarno, followed Islam, Indonesia's main faith.
	   On Monday, a Bali youth group demanded that Saeffuddin be fired
over his remarks, which they said had insulted Hindus.
	   ``As a democrat, I am ready to apologize. But I had no intention
of harassing any religion,'' said Saefuddin, who is a leader of the
Muslim-based United Development Party and a presidential candidate.
	   Indonesia plans to stage parliamentary elections next May under
promised democratic reforms. Legislators are to select a new
president by the end of next year.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy and constitution.

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Fearing arrest, victims injured in the
deadly weekend fireball that tore through this southern Nigerian
town are being pulled from overwhelmed hospitals by family and
friends, hospital officials said Tuesday.
	   The injured, many of whom were apparently scavenging gasoline
spilling from a pipeline, are afraid they may be arrested, said a
hospital official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Officials have not said whether they intend to press charges in
the incident, which military officials said killed at least 500
people.
	   But even for those who remain hospitalized _ a number believed
to total about 100 _ the prognosis was poor.
	   The area's hospitals _ most of which have only a handful of
doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn care _ were
quickly overwhelmed by the disaster. Doctors were overworked and
medicine in short supply. Hundreds of people are believed to be
injured and receiving treatment at home.
	   ``We simply had to lock up our gate, we could not cope,'' said a
doctor at the small Okparavero Memorial Hospital, in the nearby
town of Sapele, speaking on condition his name not be used.
``Virtually everybody coming into this hospital and other hospitals
came with 100 percent burns. As they came in, they were dying.''
	   Eight people came to the hospital on Saturday, six of whom have
since died.
	   Drawn by rumors that a huge pool of gasoline was free for the
taking, hundreds of people converged on Jesse, about 300 kilometers
(180 miles) southeast of Lagos, over the weekend.
	   On Saturday, while as many as 1,000 were pressing to get at the
fuel collecting in a concrete well, the gasoline exploded.
	   On Tuesday, black smoke continued to billow into the sky and
flames shot into the air. Firefighters have stopped battling the
flames and are waiting for the blaze to burn itself out. But
thousands of gallons of fuel remained in the pipeline, and
officials warned it could take days for the fire to stop.
	   With dozens of charred, unidentified bodies littering the town,
authorities continued the grim task of burying the dead. Heavy
rains drenched the town Tuesday morning, and the stench of rotting
corpses repeatedly drove workers away.
	   A mass grave was being dug at the edge of the town to bury
hundreds of unidentified corpses, many burned beyond recognition.
Separate burials were held Monday for at least 52 of the dead, and
dozens of people took corpses back to surrounding villages.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter
Monday for a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for
medical treatment, but that there would be no compensation to
survivors, apparently because many of those killed were believed to
be scavenging fuel.
	   Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred by decades
of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to regularly
sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation.
	   The above-ground pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern
city of Warri, 350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with
the northern city of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles)
away.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed the pipeline
had purposely been punctured, and that scavengers tools had sparked
the explosion. Some newspaper reports, though, said a cigarette may
have started the conflagration.
	   Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government
misrule and corruption have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages, skyrocketing black-market prices and long gasoline
lines.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of more than U.S. dlrs 100 million in accounts
belonging to the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ is frozen in Swiss bank
accounts. But the office is also requesting that Britain seize dlrs
24.5 million.
	   Raul Salinas de Gortari, the imprisoned brother of a former
president, is in prison in Mexico pending completion of his trials
in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment.

Police seek American suspected of infecting Swedes with HIV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police on Tuesday hunted for an
American man suspected of infecting women with HIV after picking
them up in Stockholm nightspots.
	   The search was the top story on the midday national radio news
and in afternoon newspapers, but because of Sweden's tight laws on
criminal suspects his name and picture were not immediately
released.
	   According to reports, the 40-year-old man came to police
attention two weeks ago after a woman said she had gone home with
him and was given what she believed to be a drug-laced drink. Under
police questioning, the man said he was HIV-positive, the reports
said.
	   Prosecutors said they did not have sufficient evidence to hold
him in custody at the time. But a subsequent investigation turned
up an address book in which the man reportedly had listed the names
of 190 women, with marks indicating he had sexual intercourse with
at least 16 of them.
	   Police are now trying to contact all of the women listed in the
address book.
	   ''The women are very upset. They are getting help from doctors
and psychologists,'' police inspector Lone Callias was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   The man reportedly met many women in bars and told them he was a
party-arranger.
	   In Finland last year, former New York resident Stephen Thomas, a
rap singer and nightclub doorman, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison on 17 counts of attempted manslaughter for having
unprotected sex with women without telling them he was
HIV-positive.

Spanish judge seeks to unite case against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID Spain (AP) _ One of two Spanish judges pulled out of the
investigation of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet Tuesday, in an
apparent bid to strengthen the case to bring Pinochet to trial in
Spain, a lawyer close to the investigation said.
	   Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon, who has been investigating the
killing and disappearance of up to 4,000 people in Chile during
Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship, will hand over his files to fellow
National Court magistrate Baltasar Garzon, lawyer Joan Garces told
reporters staking out the court. Garces has worked closely with
both investigations.
	   British police acting on an international arrest order issued
last Friday by Garzon detained Pinochet as he recovered in a London
clinic from back surgery.
	   Garzon, wants to question the former dictator with a view to
extraditing him to Spain for trial on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   Garzon's arrest order against Pinochet details the alleged
killing or disappearance of 94 people.
	   Garces said that Garcia Castellon's decision could add 4,000
names to the list.
	   British authorities have yet to inform Garzon whether he can go
to London to question Pinochet.

Investment liberalization talks resume, France urged to rejoin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The world's club of industrialized nations on
Tuesday resumed troubled talks toward liberalizing international
investment, and the director urged France to come back to the
table.
	   Talks toward a Multilateral Agreement on Investment would help
restore investor confidence in the wake of recent global financial
earthquakes, said David Johnston, secretary-general of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
	   MAI is aimed at removing protectionist barriers and establishing
a more orderly system of international investment.
	   ```Patient capital' as opposed to short term `hot money' is what
the world needs,'' the OECD chief said in his opening speech. ``A
good international investment agreement would make an important
contribution to a new architecture for the international financial
system.''
	   But France, insisting on protecting its cultural and audiovisual
sectors from further American intrusion, spearheaded opposition to
the negotiations and forced a six-month break in the talks in
April.
	   Last week, France said it would skip Tuesday's new round.
	   Protesters from about two dozen countries staged a sit-in at the
Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce on Monday.
	   Among American protesters was the chant that MAI is ``NAFTA on
steroids,'' referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement
whose critics say undermines job and environmental protection
concerns.
	   The French are ``not alone in their concerns,'' Johnston
admitted. ``These concerns must be addressed either by
demonstrating in a satisfactory way to the French government that
the concerns are unfounded or that they are being resolved.''
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has urged new
negotiations at the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, as
Canada has also suggested.
	   A WTO agreement would likely take longer to reach and could be
weaker, due to protectionist policies of many member-developing
countries.
	   The OECD chief noted that all 29 OECD countries plus the
non-members who joined the talks account for 92 percent of the
world's direct foreign investment outflows.
	   Johnston concluded by saying he hoped the participating
countries ``will meet again before the end of the year'' to discuss
``concrete solutions.''

Luzhkov urges government give more attention to industry, farming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov urged the Russian
government Tuesday to pay more attention to the people who produce
food and goods in the country.
	   ``Such an approach is a must,'' said Luzhkov, who is planning to
run for president in 2000.
	   ``Producers must be supported in all spheres _ industry,
agriculture and other areas,'' he told a meeting of the Russian
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
	   Luzhkov said the Cabinet should come up with plans to revive the
auto, chemical, machine-building and other basic industries,
Interfax reported.
	   ``This does not mean a rollback from market reforms,'' he said.
``This will provide guidelines and understanding of what to do
under new conditions.''
	   Luzhkov also proposed that taxes, freight charges and energy
rates be reduced for industries.
	   He criticized ``the appalling, if not criminal, mistakes made by
previous governments in privatization, which have led to the
plunder and breakup of the national economy.''
	   Russia's privatization program has been marred by accusations of
insider deals.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday
he is taking the advice of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos, and will
try to balance his comments on Malaysia.
	   ``I have to follow the advice of the president, to go slow and
we have to be friendly with Malaysia,'' said Estrada. ``I've
expressed my feelings and that's enough.''
	   Estrada said a defense meeting between the Philippines and
Malaysia was postponed at Malaysia's request due to a scheduling
problem, and the delay was not connected with his support for
Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   He added that he did not think his support for Anwar would
jeopardize the interests of about 300,000 Filipinos working in
Malaysia.
	   Ramos met Estrada to report on a recent trip to promote economic
ties between the Philippines and Finland and Sweden.
	   Estrada's concern for Anwar, ``balanced'' by his commitment to
attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Malaysia,
shows ``very positive indications of our recognition of the broader
national interests,'' Ramos said, citing the welfare of the
Filipino workers in Malaysia.
	   Later, defense officials said the defense cooperation meeting,
normally held every three months, will be held Nov. 8.
	   The meetings are for consultation on joint border patrols aimed
at combating piracy and drug trafficking in the countries' common
ocean areas.
	   Estrada said Philippine-Malaysian relations remain strong, and
he is looking forward to meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad when he attends next month's APEC summit.
	   ``I am looking forward that it would be a very fruitful meeting
with him,'' said Estrada.
	   Malaysian-Philippines ties were strained after Estrada openly
expressed his support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal
friend.
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have spoken out
against Anwar's arrest and treatment in jail.
	   During his visit to Malaysia, Estrada said he is looking forward
to the chance to meet Anwar, for which he has Mahathir's
permission.
	   ``I am more worried about my friend Ibrahim. I hope that he'll
be given a little comfort of just being at home, that he will be
placed under house arrest, because he has served his country for
the last 20 years with dedication,'' Estrada said.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, 51, as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2
after the two differed on economic policy. Anwar began rallying
opposition to Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared at
court hearings with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace, saying
he was beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.

Primakov: Russian government might print money to pay wage debts

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday that the government might print new money to pay off its
huge debts, but pledged that any boost in the money supply would be
backed by hard currency reserves.
	   The government will pay off its wage debts to state workers
before the end of the year and resolve all back wages to the
military by the end of January, Primakov said after meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin. He said the debts owed to pensioners could
not be paid until the end of next year.
	   While Primakov said the government might need to print new money
to cover the debts, he insisted the amount would be ``very
insignificant'' and would be fully backed by gold and hard currency
reserves.
	   He dismissed warnings that printing money would lead to high
inflation. ``If we properly back the money supply (with gold and
hard currency), it isn't that dangerous, and sometimes not
dangerous at all,'' Primakov said.
	   The government has been promising to pay off wage arrears for
years, yet millions of workers still receive their salaries months
late.
	   The government has been unable to collect taxes to pay off the
debts, and its latest two-month-old economic crisis has made the
situation worse.
	   Primakov is trying to develop a plan to deal with the crisis,
and a draft budget for the final three months of the year has a
deficit of around 100 billion rubles (dlrs 6 billion).
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told investors that the
government will have to ask the Central Bank to print new money to
plug holes in the budget.
	   The practice led to high inflation in 1992-94. But in recent
years the had pursued tight money policies that brought down
inflation and made the ruble relatively stable until the crisis hit
in August.
	   Inflation in Russia is up about 50 percent this year, and could
hit 200 percent or even 300 percent by year's end, the Central Bank
has forecast.
	   The battered Russian currency was up slightly on Tuesday,
trading at 16.9 rubles to the dollar compared to 17.1 the previous
day. It stood at 6.2 rubles to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Primakov on Tuesday assailed the economic policies of the
previous governments as the root of the current crisis and called
for more state control over the economy.
	   ``The state must assume regulatory functions and ensure order in
the country before real market relations take root,'' Primakov said
at a meeting with Russian industrialists.
	   Primakov called for more state support to ailing Russian
industries and suggested cutting profit taxes and value-added taxes
to help them.
	   The new government has only taken stop-gap measures and has yet
to offer a comprehensive economic program.
	   ``We could have invented some flashy action, but the government
is doing serious work and is only going to take real steps to
stabilize the situation,'' Primakov said at the start of his
meeting with Yeltsin.
	   The International Monetary Fund wants the government to provide
a credible economic plan as a condition for the next disbursement
of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that was frozen when the
crisis hit.
	   An IMF team was en route to Moscow on Tuesday for more talks,
but little is expected to come of the visit.

Swiss authorities order confiscation of U.S. dlrs 114 million from
</HEADLINE>
Salinas &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, minor edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of more than U.S. dlrs 100 million in accounts
belonging to the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered confiscated is
in Swiss bank accounts. But the office is also requesting that
Britain seize dlrs 24.5 million.
	   Raul Salinas de Gortari, the imprisoned brother of a former
president, is in prison in Mexico pending completion of his trials
in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment.
	   The Swiss prosecutor's office ``holds that the frozen funds in
Swiss bank accounts _ of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner _
constitute in part the criminal proceeds of protection payoffs,''
it said.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants.
	   But, after a 2 1/2 year investigation, ``the findings inevitably
suggest money laundering activities,'' the federal prosecutor's
office said.
	   ``The business dealings Raul Salinas claims to be legal are for
all practical purposes unsound and incomprehensible and contrary to
customary business usage,'' the office added.
	   Swiss authorities said their own criminal case was no longer
necessary as Mexican authorities have started their own proceedings
against Salinas and others on charges of money laundering and
facilitating drug trafficking.
	   However, the case against Salinas' wife, Paulina Castanon, and
her brother, Antonio, was dropped because ``neither their alleged
involvement in drug offenses committed in Mexico nor charges of
their being involved in money laundering activities in Switzerland
could be proved.''
	   Swiss authorities arrested the two in 1995 after they allegedly
tried to withdraw money from a Geneva account of Salinas.
	   The pair were released four weeks later, when Swiss authorities
said they had been cooperative and had played only a secondary role
in the overall case.

Trial of reputed Hong Kong crime boss begins amid tight security

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Armed policemen and sharpshooters guarded a
court in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou as a reputed Hong
Kong crime boss and his underlings went on trial Tuesday on charges
of kidnapping, murder and smuggling, local media reported.
	   Hong Kong TV networks showed footage of Cheung Tze-keung, alias
``Big Spender,'' and 35 other members of his gang being escorted to
the city's Intermediate People's Court in a line of siren-blaring
police cars.
	   Cheung, who was arrested in July, was seen being led with his
hands manacled along a corridor in the court.
	   Reporters were not allowed inside the court, which was guarded
by police armed with AK-47 rifles and sharpshooters on the roof of
the building.
	   Large numbers of people, most of them relatives and friends of
the defendants, had their papers checked before entering the court
for the hearing.
	   Chinese police have charged Cheung and the others with murdering
a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, and with
armed robberies and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
	   The gang, which has been operating since 1990, also allegedly
kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Although no official information was ever released on the
kidnapping, Hong Kong newspapers said the two were believed to be
tycoons of two of Hong Kong's biggest property development
companies.
	   In Hong Kong, police detained 15 people in August for allegedly
laundering money for the gang.
	   Hong Kong police also have frozen the assets of 17 relatives of
Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 20.5
million) in property, bank accounts and vehicles is covered by the
order.
	   Press reports said the trial is expected to last two weeks.

 &UR; Palestinians say assailant had ties to Hamas, but acted alone &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with West Bank security chief saying the assailant
acted alone, 27 people still hospitalized, INCORPORATES
BC-Israel-Assailant; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian who hurled two grenades into a
crowded bus stop, wounding 64 Israelis, had ties to the Islamic
militant group Hamas but acted alone, the Palestinians' security
chief in the West Bank said Tuesday.
	   The security chief, Jibril Rajoub, identified the suspect as
29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, a resident of the West Bank town
of Hebron.
	   Sarsour was wrestled to the ground and arrested immediately
after Monday's grenade attack in the central bus station of the
town of Beersheba in Israel's southern Negev Desert.
	   Twenty-seven people remained hospitalized Tuesday, including a
45-year-old man who was in intensive care, Beersheba's Sorokka
Hospital reported.
	   In response to the attack, Israeli negotiators at the Mideast
summit in Maryland said they would only discuss security-related
issues with the Palestinians.
	   Israel has been bracing for a major terror attack by Hamas in
recent weeks, following Hamas threats to avenge the killings of two
of the group's top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Palestinian militants have so far mounted only small
operations, including drive-by shootings, stabbings and grenade
attacks.
	   An Israeli commentator said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Hamas apparently have an understanding that the group will, for the
time being, refrain from large-scale attacks that could dash all
hopes of another Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
Instead, Hamas will carry out only smaller operations, commentator
Ron Ben-Ishai said.
	   Arafat can claim that such attacks are spontaneous acts by
individuals that are impossible to predict and prevent, the
commentator wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   ``This is Hamas' way of hanging on to the terror stick at both
ends, and putting a spoke into the wheels of the negotiations,''
Ben-Ishai wrote.
	   Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, acknowledged that
Monday's assailant had ties to Hamas, and was imprisoned twice by
Israel during the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising.
	   However, Rajoub said there was no sign that Sarsour acted on
behalf of Hamas on Monday. ``I believe he acted alone,'' Rajoub
said.
	   Sarsour, a father of five, lives in the Palestinian-controlled
part of Hebron and works as a plasterer.
	   Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious
fervor. He wears a large white prayer cap; his wife, Khaloud, wears
a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm among
observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin hangs in their home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her five young children _ the
oldest is 9 _ crowded around her as she spoke.

Palestinian official says Clinton sides with Arafat on key issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An adviser to Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that
U.S. negotiators are siding with the Palestinians on three key
points of dispute in the U.S.-brokered talks at Wye Plantation.
	   The issues involve the PLO founding charter, the size of an
additional Israeli pullback in the West Bank and Israel's demand
that Arafat hand over 34 Palestinians accused of killing Israelis.
	   ``The Americans have expressed satisfaction with the Palestinian
position so the contacts and negotiations are now focusing on the
gap between Israel and the Americans,'' the Arafat adviser, Ahmed
Tibi, told Israel army radio.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinians reconvene the
Palestine National Council, which has hundreds of members, to annul
sections of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The Palestinians have said the PNC already revoked the
offending paragraphs in a special session in 1996, but Israel
claims the process was never completed.
	   Under a U.S. compromise, the Palestinians would have the PLO
Central Committee, a body with several dozen members, amend the
founding charter, and Tibi said the Americans have not changed
their position.
	   The negotiatior said the Americans also sided with the
Palestinians in their demand that an additional troop pullback be
determined in negotiations with Israel. The Americans reportedly
want to establish an Israeli-Palestinian committee that would have
three months to agree on the scope of that withdrawal.
	   Israel has said it alone has the right to decide on the scope of
the withdrawal, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he
would hand over no more than 1 percent.
	   On the third issue, the extradition of suspects, Tibi said
previous peace agreements stipulate that Palestinians accused of
killing Israelis do not need to be handed over to Israel if they
are being tried by Palestinian courts. He said the Americans agree
with that position.
	   Israel has demanded that Arafat hand over 34 Palestinians
suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Israel radio said the sides would continue talks at least until
Wednesday evening.

<TEXT>
	   Raul Salinas himself was questioned four times in the course of
the inquiry, Valentin Roschacher, who led the investigation, told a
news conference.
	   ``A great many witnesses'' testified that he had received
hundreds of million of dollars in payoffs from Colombian and
Mexican drug cartels between 1988 and 1994, when his brother was
president, according to the federal prosecutor's office.
	   They maintained that Salinas used his influence and protected
large-scale shipments transiting through Mexico from Colombia to
the United States.
	   The depositions came from a ``great number of different persons
with different viewpoints (which) agree with one another and add up
to a homogenous overall picture,'' the federal prosecutor's office
said.
	   The witnesses were not identified.
	   The Swiss have been investigating whether Raul Salinas helped
launder drug money while his younger brother was president from
1988 to 1994.
	   Authorities seized Swiss bank accounts belonging to Raul Salinas
in 1995.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of his
trials on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of a political
rival, and of illicit enrichment while he held a mid-level
government post during his brother's administration.
	   No specifically drug-related charges have been brought against
him, but he was charged with money laundering and acquitted on a
technicality.
	   He has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the money
in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by several
wealthy friends.

Pope's official visit filled with political significance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It was planned months ago, but Pope John Paul II's
official visit to Italy turned out to be filled with political
significance Tuesday as he greeted the first former Communist named
to head a West European government.
	   Massimo D'Alema, asked by the president a few hours earlier to
form Italy's 56th postwar government, sat in the front row during
the formal ceremony at the Quirinal presidential palace and lined
up to shake John Paul's hand just behind outgoing Premier Romano
Prodi.
	   The Vatican has already signaled its discomfort with the choice
of D'Alema, who rose through the ranks of what was then the largest
Communist party in the West. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he
transformed the party along social democrat lines.
	   ``Fifty years after the momentous victory of freedom and
democracy over communism, the head of state has entrusted the task
of forming a government to a man from the apparatus of the former
Italian Communist Party,'' the Vatican's newspaper L'Osservatore
Romano said earlier this week.
	   The Vatican and the Italian church had battled for four decades
to keep Italy's Communists out of power, seeing them as threats to
religious freedom in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Italy.
	   John Paul, an ardent foe of communism, has been credited with
helping to bring down communism in eastern Europe.
	   Touching on issues dear to the Italian left, John Paul had some
tough words in an exchange of speeches with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, saying that Italy must overcome the ``scourge'' of
abortion and defeat any attempt to legalize euthanasia.
	   The left was influential in passage of Italy's liberal abortion
law and has fought attempts by the church to overturn it.
	   John Paul also took up the call of Italy's bishops to provide
parents who send their children to Catholic schools with some form
of tax credits, an issue that has divided D'Alema's Democratic Left
party.
	   The Vatican is an independent city-state. In keeping with
tradition, John Paul was met by Italian officials as soon as his
open car crossed the unmarked border into Italian territory at the
edge of St. Peter's Square.
	   Before the pope's visit to the Quirinal Palace, D'Alema had
joked that he considered the Vatican ``a friendly country.''
	   The brief meeting was John Paul's second with D'Alema, the first
time in January when the pope visited Rome's city hall.
	   It was the Polish-born pope's third visit of his 20-year
pontificate to the Quirinal Palace, and he said that ``even coming
from a far-away country I fully feel as a Roman and an Italian.''
	   He recalled walking by the palace daily while studying theology
in Rome between 1946-48.

announced plans Tuesday to run for re-election in January.
	   ``I have decided to run for the post of head of state in this
difficult historic period,'' Nazarbayev was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Nazarbayev's government has often been criticized by
international human rights groups for restricting the activities of
opposition groups and the media.
	   Several other candidates are likely to run in the Jan. 10
election, including Communist leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin and
former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui called Tuesday for
expanded dialogue with Beijing, but said recognition of Taiwan as
an equal partner in talks was the only way to narrow the
differences between the two.
	   A smiling Lee greeted Taiwanese envoy Koo Chen-fu at the
presidential office the day after Koo returned from what Taiwan
termed an ``ice-melting visit'' with China's leaders. Taiwan and
China can improve their relations if they ``honestly face the fact
of division and continue contacts and dialogue,'' Lee's office
quoted him as saying
	   Taiwan and China should advance ``constructive dialogue,'' Lee
said, referring to Taiwan's newest proposal, which puts a subtle
twist on calls to restart talks on practical issues such as
resolution of fishing disputes.
	   Cabinet officials responsible for China policy said that concept
allows for more flexibility on an agenda for talks, a symbolic
response to China's demand for political dialogue.
	   Koo won high marks for his performance in China, the highest
level contact between the two sides since Beijing broke off
structured negotiations in June 1995. Koo met Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and secured a commitment from his Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan, probably next spring.
	   More than 85 percent of respondents to a survey commissioned by
a ruling Nationalist Party foundation said they approved of the
visit and more talks.
	   But more than 65 percent said that if Lee visited China, he
should do so only in his capacity as Taiwan's president, an
indication that the public backs the government's insistence on
being treated as an equal.
	   The telephone survey of 2,401 respondents was conducted Oct.
17-19 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.
	   China has claimed Taiwan as a breakaway province since Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists fled here in 1949 after being swept out of
the mainland by Mao Tse-tung's Communists.
	   Four decades of tense standoff ended with a 1993 meeting between
Koo and Wang in Singapore. Two years of talks on practical matters
such as resolving fishing disputes followed, though no agreements
were reached.
	   An outraged China froze talks after Lee visited the United
States, a trip it saw as evidence he was turning away from
reunification. In the months that followed, China attempted to
intimidate Lee supporters by lobbing missiles into waters near the
island and staging threatening war games, raising tensions to the
highest level in decades.
	   Tentative contacts resumed last November, but China now insists
Taiwan agree to discuss political issues related to reunification.
Taiwan wants talks to pick up where they left off.
	   Scholarly observers warned that despite Koo's visit, the
diplomatic confrontation between Taipei and Beijing will likely
only worsen.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said China
opposed Taiwan's offer to join an international consortium
struggling to fund nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   The consortium was founded under a U.S.-North Korean agreement
and ``should be composed of sovereign states. As a province of
China, Taiwan is not qualified to participate,'' Tang told a news
conference.
	   Wooing away Taiwan's handful of diplomatic allies and blocking
its attempts to join international organizations is China's best
way to assert its claim to the island, said Pan Hsi-tang, of the
Institute of China Studies at Tamkang University.
	   ``People here want peace, but they have the confidence to face
their foe,'' said Chao Chun-shan, a scholar at National Chengchi
University.

	   TURMOUS AYYA, West Bank (AP) _ Saieda Hamzeh remembers gently
caressing the young face of her 16-year-old son Muntasir. Three
years later, a full-grown beard now covers that face and barbed
wire keeps a mother's touch away.
	   Muntasir is serving a five-year sentence in Israel's Megiddo
prison for possessing and preparing explosives. The chances for
Muntasir's early release, like that of some 3,000 other
Palestinians in Israeli jails, is one of the issues on the table at
a Mideast summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   For Arafat, the issue is critical. The Palestinian leader,
already under pressure from opponents who claim he has conceded too
much to Israel, needs to bring back something from the talks.
	   Adding to the pressure Tuesday, the Palestinian legislative
council, made-up of mostly Arafat supporters, demanded in a
statement that any agreement reached at Wye Plantation include the
release of all Palestinian prisoners.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Teachers ended their 12-day strike
Tuesday, heeding pleas from religious leaders to return to their
posts to oversee national exams scheduled to begin Wednesday.
	   The decision came hours after President Daniel arap Moi
reiterated the government was unable to pay 200 percent pay
increases over five years, which he promised in a reelection
campaign a year ago.
	   ``I told teachers the truth,'' Moi said in Swahili at Nyayo
National Stadium in central Nairobi. ``There is no money! There is
no money! There is no money!''
	   Moi spoke on Jomo Kenyatta Day, honoring the late president and
others who lost their lives in the struggle for independence from
Britain, which was won in 1963.
	   The strike by 260,000 grade-and high-school teachers had idled 7
million students who were to begin national examinations which will
decide whether they can advance to the next level.
	   Moi had said he would send government workers, protected by
police, into schools to go ahead with the exams.
	   But to avoid what could have provoked a violent conflict between
teachers and authorities, Protestant and Catholic bishops
negotiated an end to the strike that began Oct. 5.
	   ``We are parents, we are professionals, we are human,'' said
John Katumanga, chairman of the Kenya National Union of Teachers.
``Arising from the fact that nonprofessionals were to invigilate
the exams, and if the results are bad it would be blamed on
teachers, we decided to postpone.''
	   But teachers expect clergy to continue to foster negotiations
with the government, he said. ``We hope ... it will not be
necessary for us to resume the strike.''
	   Katumanga said teachers were not convinced the government had no
money.
	   Moi, in a speech broadcast on state-owned radio and television,
acknowledged the country is beset by economic problems, but blamed
the world economy.
	   The International Monetary Fund has blamed high-level corruption
and mismanagement, and last year canceled a dlrs 200 million loan.
	   Opposition legislator Beth Mugo criticized Moi's remarks.
	   ``What has happened is not as a result of the global recession.
It is waste right here,'' she said.
	   Moi also told women, who are discriminated against in Kenya, not
to be attracted by liberation movements that swept through the West
decades ago, improving the lives of millions of women.
	   ``If you get carried away by these gender things, you will get
drunk,'' Moi said.

Congolese rebels capture 16 Zimbabwean soldiers

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow
their president captured 16 Zimbabwean soldiers in eastern Congo,
state television reported Tuesday, in the first evidence of
Zimbabwean involvement in the region.
	   The defense ministry confirmed the soldiers were disarmed and
taken prisoner Monday after their troop carrier airplane landed
near the eastern town of Kabalo, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
	   The defense ministry said the airplane crew mistakenly believed
the town was controlled by President Laurent Kabila's troops, not
by the rebels fighting to topple him, the television said.
	   It is the first evidence of Zimbabwean involvement in eastern
Congo, where rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, had been making
steady gains since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   The rebels, speaking from their eastern stronghold of Goma, said
the Zimbabweans were taken prisoner in recent fighting.
	   ``It is true, we hold 16 Zimbabwean soldiers prisoner. They are
being treated as prisoners of war,'' rebel leader Arthur Ngoma said
by telephone.
	   Officials in Rwanda, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the prisoners were being held in Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
southwest of Goma, which fell to the rebels 10 days ago.
	   Zimbabwe has strike jets, helicopters and transporters
supporting its 3,000 troops deployed in the Congo.
	   Zimbabwean and allied southern African troops from Angola and
Namibia repulsed a rebel advance on the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, in August.
	   Last week, President Robert Mugabe held two days of talks with
Kabila in the southeastern town of Lubumbashi and said the allies
were considering advancing on rebel strongholds in the east.
	   Zimbabwe has admitted nine of its soldiers killed in fighting in
the Congo in the past two months.
	   Until now, there have been no signs of Zimbabwe's involvement in
eastern Congo, where the rebels reportedly advanced towards
Mbuji-Mayi, capital of the diamond-rich Eastern Kasai Province,
after capturing Kindu and its airport.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has launched another
attempt to get Kabila and the rebels to negotiate directly.
	   He met on Monday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in
Pretoria and said on Tuesday he was satisfied with the talks.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. The two
countries say they have legitimate security interests in Congo and
accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common border of Rwandan and
Ugandan rebels.

Wounded Mormon missionary recovering from stab wounds

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Mormon missionary who suffered multiple stab
wounds is making a rapid recovery and has provided evidence about a
second man involved in the weekend attack in central Russia, a
Mormon official said Tuesday.
	   Bradley Borden, of Mesa, Arizona, was alert and has been able
get out of bed and take a few steps in his hospital room in the
city of Ufa, said Donald Jarvis, the head of the Mormon mission in
the region.
	   ``He's quite lucid and seems to be healing quite nicely,''
Jarvis said in a telephone interview from Ufa.
	   Borden, 20, was stabbed in the liver and the pancreas and fellow
missionary Jose Manuel Mackintosh, 20, was killed when they were
attacked Saturday evening coming out of an apartment building
following a visit with a church family.
	   Mackintosh's body was being prepared Tuesday for return to his
family in Hiko, Nevada, said Jarvis. Funeral services are scheduled
for Saturday, the family said.
	   Mackintosh's parents said it was ``his time to go'' and they
felt calm when told of their son's slaying. They were worshiping at
a temple when they were notified.
	   ``If my son was going to die, he better die the way he did _ in
the service of the Lord,'' Jose Mackintosh, the father, said in an
interview with Las Vegas television station KVBC.
	   Police have arrested one suspect in the case, and Borden spoke
with church lawyers on Tuesday, providing evidence about a second
man involved in the attack.
	   The suspect under arrest, Sergei Chudakov, is an alcoholic who
was drunk at the time of the attack, said Valery Ryzhov, the
district prosecutor in Ufa.
	   Chudakov is also accused of stabbing another man earlier on
Saturday before the attack on the two missionaries, Ryzhov said.
The suspect has been charged with inflicting serious physical
injuries and hooliganism, and is likely to be charged with
additional, more serious offenses as the cases proceed, Ryzhov
said.
	   Authorities have described the attack as a random act of
violence that was not aimed at the church.
	   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 24 young
missionaries working in Ufa and was reviewing procedures, but felt
that region was normally quite safe.
	   ``We don't think Russia is particularly dangerous, and the city
where this took place is quite calm,'' said Jarvis.
	   The Mormons have about 500 missionaries in Russia and 59,000
worldwide.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Conflict prevention and rebuilding after military
disputes topped the agenda Tuesday as an international African
development conference entered its second day, organizers said.
	   Speaking before the 2nd Tokyo International Conference on
African Development, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata warned that war is retarding economic development on the
whole continent as refugees fleeing one conflict destabilize
neighboring countries.
	   ``Displacement is one of the main obstacles on the road to
economic prosperity,'' she said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who addressed a dinner for
participants after he arrived in Tokyo later Tuesday, asked the
conference to come up with concrete proposals for spurring Africa's
economic development, Kyodo News service reported.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened the conference and
vowed to maintain Japan's commitment to African aid despite his
country's severe economic difficulties.
	   The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda for Action''
Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living in absolute
poverty by 2015 through economic growth and development.
	   Besides Annan, participants in the conference include the
leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Djibouti,
Mozambique, Botswana and Benin.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attended the
conference's opening Monday.
	   The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Margaret Thatcher entertained former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was
arrested in his London hospital bed, the former prime minister's
office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic
controversy over the move.
	   Pinochet, who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to
Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks
with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in
London's elite Belgravia district four days before he was
hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9.
	   ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington,
spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister
from 1979-90.
	   The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish
magistrate's request.
	   On Tuesday, a second Spanish judge pulled out of his
investigation of Pinochet, in an apparent bid to strengthen the
case to bring the former dictator to Spain for trial, a lawyer
close to the investigation said.
	   Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon, who has been investigating the
killing and disappearance of up to 4,000 people in Chile during
Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship, will hand over his files to fellow
National Court magistrate Baltasar Garzon, lawyer Joan Garces told
reporters.
	   It was Garzon's international arrest order, detailing the
alleged killing or disappearance of 94 people, that British
authorities acted on.
	   Garces said Garcia Castellon's decision could add 4,000 names to
the list.
	   Thatcher and Pinochet have long had warm relations. In
Conservative government days, he was welcomed on regular visits
that included tea with the prime minister.
	   Pinochet was the only Latin American leader to support Britain
in its 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands.
He and Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of right-wing
economics.
	   The current visit is Pinochet's first since Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago,
ending 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   A Chilean exile group in London said Tuesday it is considering
bringing a private prosecution against Pinochet in British courts.
Carolos Reyes, president of Chile Democratico, said the group was
consulting lawyers about the possibility.
	   Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign
Office on Monday, saying Britain has violated Pinochet's diplomatic
immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic passport and is
also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him from
prosecution there.
	   Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture and other human
rights abuses against political opponents in which, the Chilean
government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. He
remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March.
	   Garzon had broadened his charges Monday to include killings of
Chileans as well as Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is no
diplomatic immunity.
	   Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during
Pinochet's rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with
diplomatic immunity and senator status.
	   ``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' Artaza said
in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. ``What we
are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government is
the special situation of a senator in our transition who many
people do not understand and many people don't like.''
	   ``We're not discussing his record during his period of
dictatorship, that the present government does not support at
all,'' the ambassador added.
	   A Chilean specialist in international law was traveling to
London for further meetings with British officials, Artaza said.
	   Pinochet is expected to be hospitalized for perhaps two more
weeks.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with audit revealing thefts in the Strategic Missile
Forces in new 3 final grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian court convicted three military officers
of stealing platinum, gold and silver components from the air
defense missiles they oversaw, a news agency reported on Tuesday.
	   The court in the city of Ulan-Ude, in the Eastern Siberian
region of Buryatia on Russia's border with Mongolia, sentenced a
lieutenant colonel and two majors to prison terms of four to five
years in prison, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Their civilian
accomplice received the same sentence.
	   The convicts had stolen missile components worth 825,000 rubles
(dlrs 48,500) and sold them to businessmen from the former Soviet
republic of Armenia. The theft has incapacitated the missiles
beyond repair, the report said.
	   The thieves published classified ads in local newspapers
offering ``components used in military hardware.'' The ads alerted
officials and led to the thieves' arrest.
	   Thefts of weapons and other hardware have become increasingly
common in the beleaguered Russian military, crippled by a severe
fund shortage and low morale.
	   A recent audit of the Strategic Missile Forces revealed that
dlrs 600,000 worth of military hardware had been embezzled, the
liberal daily Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Tuesday.
	   Among other things, the military stole 5,000 kilometers (3,100
miles) of copper cable, the newspaper said.
	   Gen. Vyacheslav Meleshko, who was in charge of the strategic
forces' assets, has never faced any charges, the report said.
Meleshko is now an adviser to Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, who served as strategic forces chief before his
appointment to the ministry last year.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Under the eye of police, armed with tough orders to
keep the peace, high school students around France were holding
their second major protest in less than a week on Tuesday.
	   By mid-day, tens of thousands of students were marching in towns
nationwide to press demands for more teachers, better equipment and
buildings and a lighter course load. Hundreds of thousands were
expected.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities
-- a protest marred by violence.
	   Thousands massed in Paris at the Place d'Italie in the south,
moving out early along the march route toward Boulevard Saint
Germain, a half hour ahead of the official starting time. The
demonstration is to end at a major Left Bank intersection.
	   More than 4,000 police, many in riot gear, were mobilized for
the Paris march, being monitored by televisions in the basement of
police headquarters. Shops and other establishments along the march
route were ordered closed and cars removed.
	   Hours ahead of the Paris march, police were making arrests,
trying to weed out hooligans.
	   By 12:45 p.m., (1045 GMT), nearly two hours ahead of the
official march starting time, police said they had checked 3,000
identifications and jailed 22 people.
	   The all-news TV channel LCI reported 25 arrests in Nancy, in
eastern France, where some 4,000 people turned out for the protest.
	   Elsewhere, about 10,000 students turned out in the Norman town
of Rennes, an equal number in Bordeaux in the southwest, 6,000 in
Avignon in the south and more than 6,000 in Lyon, according to
various police reports. In nearby Aix-en-Provence, 2,500 youths
blocked the A8 highway, officials said.

`Lord of the Dance' star settles lawsuit with former manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Lord of the Dance'' star Michael Flatley on
Tuesday settled a multimillion-pound (dollar) lawsuit brought by
his former manager.
	   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Flatley ended
the weeks of court proceedings by agreeing to pay former manager
John Reid a ``substantial'' sum, plus legal costs, a spokesman for
the dancer said.
	   Reid, who also managed Elton John, claimed he was fired just as
the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged. He filed
suit in High Court seeking 10 million (dlrs 17 million)
compensation for what he contends was a breach of contract.
	   Reid claimed Flatley, 40, who hung up his dancing shoes in July,
dismissed him early into the British run of ``Lord of the Dance.''
	   Flatley countersued, claiming the managerial agreement was
reached by undue influence and amounted to a restraint of trade.
	   ``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind me,'' Reid said.
``It is a real shame that so much time and money and effort has
been wasted in the process of getting to the point which we could
have reached two years ago.''

Report: Israel willing to share Arrow missiles with Jordan, Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel would be willing to deploy Arrow missile
batteries in Jordan and Turkey in times of need, as long as the
United States agrees, an Israeli newspaper on Tuesday quoted a
senior Israeli defense official as saying.
	   David Ivri, a senior aide to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, told the Haaretz daily that nations in the Middle East
are in a race to deploy weapons of mass destruction and that the
West has failed to slow the proliferation of such weapons.
	   Israel's Arrow missile, expected to be operational by mid-1999,
is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles possessed by
Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies, such as Syria or Libya.
	   The Defense Ministry had no immediate comment on Ivri's remarks.
In the past, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
suggested sharing the Arrow technology with allies in the region.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A bank employee who revealed that
President Franjo Tudjman's wife has huge, undeclared assets turned
herself over to police after the report caused a nationwide stir,
independent media said Tuesday.
	   Ankica Lepej, 50, told the daily Jutarnji List last week that
Ankica Tudjman had deposited dlrs 140,000 in Zagrebacka Banka in
March.
	   Police began a criminal investigation at the bank's request. If
charged with breaching contracts of confidentiality and convicted,
she faces a sentence of one to five years in prison.
	   Lepej said she acknowledged late Monday disclosing the
controversial information after the bank had posted a one million
kuna (dlrs 166,000) reward to try to learn the source.
	   The discovery of Mrs. Tudjman's wealth came only a month after
her husband declared in a mandatory financial disclosure that his
spouse had no considerable valuables apart from a car.
	   Tudjman's office maintained in a statement late Monday that the
president was not required to declare liquid assets.
	   Lepej, a 23-year employee of the bank who is just 11 months shy
of the pension, said she was offered the reward but turned it down
so her colleagues wouldn't be harassed or come under extra
scrutiny. She said she acted out of moral convictions.
	   ``The president's family should be an example,'' Lepej was
quoted Tuesday as saying by Jutarnji List. ``I hope my example will
inspire others to free themselves from fear and silence.''
	   Independent media have often exposed the involvement of top
officials in corruption and financial scandals. However, the
transgressions have mostly gone unpunished because the legal system
is under the strong sway of Tudjman's ruling party.
	   Most Croats subsist on less than dlrs 500 per month. The
publicity over the bank account raised further doubts about the
legality of fortunes amassed by Tudjman's family since the
76-year-old leader's tenure began in 1990.
	   Although the founder of a humanitarian agency for children which
turns over millions of unaccounted dollars per year, Ankica Tudjman
is formally unemployed and receives a pension.

Power struggle: top Zeroual ally fights back despite resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The right-hand man to outgoing Algerian
President Liamine Zeroual may have quit the government, but he'll
still be involved in the upcoming presidential election, one of his
newspapers said Tuesday.
	   Mohamed Betchine, a retired general who had been seen as a
possible candidate to succeed Zeroual, resigned Monday amid press
reports accusing him of corruption and torture.
	   Defended by Zeroual to the end, Betchine had called the charges
part of a smear campaign amid an apparent power struggle within the
military-backed government of this petroleum-rich North African
nation.
	   Betchine ``must continue to play his political role,'' said a
commentary in the daily l'Authentique, part of his newspaper group.
In accepting Betchine's resignation, Zeroual merely ``decided to
give him back his freedom.''
	   The newspaper did not specify exactly what role Betchine would
play.
	   Zeroual, also a retired general, last month announced he would
cut short his five-year presidential term, holding early elections
before the end of February. His term was to end in the year 2000.
	   Officials have since said the election may take place in March.
	   Zeroual had drawn opposition from hardliners who opposed his
past contacts with Islamic militants. The insurgency that is in its
seventh year has left an estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   Betchine's resignation came a day after Justice Minister Mohamed
Adami, also caught up in controversy, announced his resignation.
Some newspapers have charged that Adami had sexual relations with
prisoners and prostitutes.
	   Both Betchine and Adami are leading members of the National
Democratic Rally party, considered Zeroual's party.
	   The pro-government El Moudjahid said that ``no longer held by
his obligations of reserve, he can contribute to a high-level
debate on the great preoccupations of Algerian society and that
which really blocks it.''
	   The independent newspapers El Watan and Le Matin accused
Betchine of embezzling two Italian lines of credit and of being
responsible for torture while security chief during riots in
October 1988.
	   The dailies are among five who the state-owned printing plants
stopped servicing since Saturday. Officials say it was due to back
payments since 1996, but the newspapers allege the timing was
politically motivated.
	   As a result, most independent newspapers have suspended printing
in a sign of solidarity.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Tuesday that the government might print new money to pay off its
huge debts, but pledged that any boost in the money supply would be
backed by hard currency reserves.
	   The government will pay off its wage debts to state workers
before the end of the year and resolve all back wages to the
military by the end of January, Primakov said after meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin. He said the debts owed to pensioners could
not be paid until the end of next year.
	   While Primakov said the government might need to print new money
to cover the debts, he insisted the amount would be ``very
insignificant'' and would be fully backed by gold and hard currency
reserves.
	   He dismissed warnings that printing money would lead to high
inflation. ``If we properly back the money supply (with gold and
hard currency), it isn't that dangerous, and sometimes not
dangerous at all,'' Primakov said.
	   The government has been promising to pay off wage arrears for
years, yet millions of workers still receive their salaries months
late.
	   The government has been unable to collect taxes to pay off the
debts, and its latest two-month-old economic crisis has made the
situation worse.
	   Primakov is trying to develop a plan to deal with the crisis,
and a draft budget for the final three months of the year has a
deficit of around 100 billion rubles (dlrs 6 billion).
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told investors that the
government will have to ask the Central Bank to print new money to
plug holes in the budget.
	   The practice led to high inflation in 1992-94. But in recent
years the had pursued tight money policies that brought down
inflation and made the ruble relatively stable until the crisis hit
in August.
	   Inflation in Russia is up about 50 percent this year, and could
hit 200 percent or even 300 percent by year's end, the Central Bank
has forecast.
	   The battered Russian currency was up slightly on Tuesday,
trading at 16.9 rubles to the dollar compared to 17.1 the previous
day. It stood at 6.2 rubles to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Farm production, meanwhile, has been skewered by the crisis and
slid by 9.4 percent in the first nine months of 1998 compared with
the same period last year, Interfax cited the State Statistics
Committee as saying. Russia has fewer sheep, goats, cattle and
pigs, and meat production is down 4 percent.
	   Primakov on Tuesday assailed the economic policies of the
previous governments as the root of the current crisis and called
for more state control over the economy.
	   ``The state must assume regulatory functions and ensure order in
the country before real market relations take root,'' Primakov said
at a meeting with Russian industrialists.
	   Primakov called for more state support to ailing Russian
industries and suggested cutting profit taxes and value-added taxes
to help them.
	   The new government has only taken stop-gap measures and has yet
to offer a comprehensive economic program.
	   ``We could have invented some flashy action, but the government
is doing serious work and is only going to take real steps to
stabilize the situation,'' Primakov said at the start of his
meeting with Yeltsin.
	   The International Monetary Fund wants the government to provide
a credible economic plan as a condition for the next disbursement
of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that was frozen when the
crisis hit.
	   An IMF team was en route to Moscow on Tuesday for more talks,
but little is expected to come of the visit.

Estrada suspends gold mining in southern Philippine province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Tuesday
ordered gold mining suspended in a southern mountain area while the
government takes steps to ensure miners' safety.
	   Estrada also wanted a government task force to introduce
safeguards against environmental damage and settle disputes among
the miners on the slopes of Mount Diwalwal, a vast gold-mining area
in Davao del Norte province.
	   Environment Secretary Antonio Cerilles, chief of the task force,
said it would delineate areas assigned to small- and large-scale
miners to prevent disputes.
	   The government also would offer its gold ore processing
facilities, which are safer for miners, and restrict the use of
harmful chemicals and explosives, he said.
	   Last year, officials banned the use of mercury in the mines
after a check on residents showed several children were suffering
from mercury poisoning.
	   Many of the miners, however, then shifted to the use of cyanide,
another toxic chemical, officials said.
	   There have been indications that chemicals like mercury have
seeped into river tributaries near Diwalwal, local officials said.
	   Cerilles said gold mining would be allowed to resume once the
planned safeguards are in place.
	   The government said it also plans to set up a central bank
station near Diwalwal to monitor and buy some of the gold being
mined there.

Relief convoys resume in Kosovo, U.N. team arrives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs claiming new attack by rebels, KLA
representative denying that guerrillas have violated their
cease-fire &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relief convoys rolled again Tuesday
in Kosovo after a one-day halt due to renewed violence, and a
20-member U.N. team arrived to serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the tense province.
	   Following ethnic Albanian attacks on Serb police last weekend,
the government has moved tanks and troops to a front line in
central Kosovo, raising fears for future of the the U.S.-brokered
agreement to end the violence in the province.
	   But while the Serbs accused the guerrillas of another attack on
police Tuesday, Kosovo appeared mostly calm Tuesday and the push
resumed to get help to tens of thousands of displaced residents
before the onset of winter.
	   Mercy Corps International and other humanitarian groups sent
some 150 tons of food, clothing, mattresses and other items to
Djinovce, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina,
delivering them in a convoy to an aid warehouse for distribution.
	   Other aid was being delivered elsewhere.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday had called off
two convoys of relief supplies headed to western Kosovo in the wake
of a Serb military buildup that followed weekend violence in which
at least three Serb police were killed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists. As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian
disaster if the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting,
thousands still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark was expected in Belgrade later
Tuesday to discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to
meet the alliance's Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo
or face airstrikes.
	   The newly arrived U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of
Sweden, consists of representatives of human rights, humanitarian,
political and peacekeeping offices.
	   They are expected to stay for about a week to gather information
on efforts to halt the fighting.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' said de Mistura, commenting on last week's
breakthrough agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   More Yugoslav army troops were positioned southwest of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital, after a surge of weekend violence that left
three Serb policemen dead and led to mutual accusations between
authorities and radical Albanians on who started the bloodshed.
	   On Tuesday, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug claimed a
Serb policeman was wounded Tuesday morning when ``terrorists''
attacked a police patrol near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina. The incident could not be verified.
	   Western officials, concerned about the recent skirmishes,
indicated that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were
to blame.
	   But the KLA's political representative, Adem Demaci, maintained
Tuesday that the rebel force had adhered to the cease-fire it
proclaimed Oct. 8, and accused the Serbs of continued shelling of
ethnic Albanian villages.
	   ``The UCK avoids conflicts and reacts only when forced to,'' he
said, referring to the KLA by its Albanian acronym. ``The regime,
on the other hand, did not cease its actions for a single day.''
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

Swiss authorities order confiscation of more than dlrs 100 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on investigation, charges. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of more than dlrs 100 million in accounts belonging to
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   The brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, is in prison in Mexico
pending completion of trials in Mexico in a political assassination
and on a charge of illegal enrichment from 1984 to 1988 during his
brother's administration.
	   The prosecutor's office ``holds that the frozen funds in Swiss
bank accounts _ of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner _ constitute in
part the criminal proceeds of protection payoffs,'' it said in a
statement.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but
prosecutor's said the findings of a 2 1/2 year investigation
``inevitably suggest money laundering'' of drug profits.
	   ``The business dealings Raul Salinas claims to be legal are for
all practical purposes unsound and incomprehensible and contrary to
customary business usage,'' the office added.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered confiscated is
in Swiss bank accounts. But the office is also requesting that
Britain seize dlrs 24.5 million.
	   Salinas has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the
money in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by
several wealthy friends.
	   Prosecutors maintain that Salinas used his influence and
protected large-scale shipments through Mexico from Colombia to the
United States.
	   ``A great many witnesses'' testified that he had received
hundreds of million of dollars in payoffs from Colombian and
Mexican drug cartels between 1988 and 1994, when his brother was
president, according to the federal prosecutor's office. The
witnesses were not identified.
	   Swiss authorities said their own criminal case was no longer
necessary as Mexican authorites have started their own proceedings
against Raul Salinas and others on charges of money laundering and
facilitating drug trafficking.
	   Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995.
	   Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of his trials
on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose
Francisco Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a
midlevel government post in his brother's administration.
	   No drug-related charges have been brought against Raul Salinas,
but he was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.
	   His brother, who moved to Ireland shortly after leaving office,
has been charged with no crime.

Jewish history and culture neglected in Czech schools, reports
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Nine years after the demise of
Communism, Jewish history and culture are still taught inadequately
in Czech schools, the American Jewish Committee in Prague said
Tuesday.
	   The Treatment of Jewish Themes in Czech Schools was the second
in a series of reports prepared for the committee's Central and
East European Curriculum Review Project that focuses on countries
that have recently emerged from Communist rule. The first report
dealt with Poland.
	   According to the report, Czech textbooks devote less attention
to Judaism than to other religions, as Judaism is generally
included under Christianity in the curricula. The legacy of Jewish
monotheism is neglected and Judaism as a living religion of today
is completely ignored, the report said.
	   The study also complained that Jewish history is taught in an
unsystematic fashion without a larger historical context.
	   ``Based on the information available in the textbooks, it is
impossible to form a clear picture of the integral role of Jews in
modern history,'' the report says.
	   The author of the report, Leo Pavlat, told reporters that the
study is aimed at fighting intolerance and xenophobia in the Czech
population through education.
	   ``Our aim is not to simply announce the result and walk away,''
David Singer of the American Jewish Committee said, adding that in
the next several years the committee will try to monitor whether
the study had any practical result.
	   ``Attitude towards Jews is a barometer of general tolerance
within the society,'' Singer said.
	   ``It's not because the Jews would consider themselves a special
phenomenon that would require special treatment,'' Pavlat said.
``It's a historical experience.''
	   He said that Czech educators have said they want to improve the
situation but that there have been problems in ``translating the
good will in concrete deeds.''
	   He warned that should the education towards tolerance remain
limited to a few campaigns or handbooks, ``the endings cannot be
good.''
	   Prague traditionally was one of Central Europe's most important
Jewish cultural centers. But the Jewish community was decimated by
Nazi occupation in World War II, when some 80,000 Czech Jews
perished in death camps. Only some 10,000 Jews now live in the
Czech Republic.
	   Expressions of racism are now more often directed at the Gypsy
minority.

Doctors concerned about Aborigines trading land rights for health

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A deal in which a group of Aborigines
swapped their rights to claim a special form of land title for two
kidney dialysis machines was criticized by doctors Tuesday as
setting a dangerous precedent.
	   The Australian Medical Association said the deal traded
Aboriginal land rights for health services that should be provided
by government anyway.
	   In the first deal of its type in Australia, the Jawoyn
Association, representing Aboriginal people in the Katherine area
of the Northern Territory, said it will sign an agreement with the
territory's government to end a native title claim to about 2,470
acres (1,000 hectares) of Outback.
	   In exchange, the government will provide renal dialysis
facilities in Katherine and land for an alcohol rehabilitation
center.
	   Jawoyn leader Robert Lee said the government should provide
basic health services, but Aborigines could not afford to wait for
the slow wheels of bureaucracy.
	   ``We can't wait that long. A lot of people are dying,'' Lee told
The Australian newspaper.
	   Robyn Cahill, executive director of the territory branch of the
Medical Association, said the rate of final stage kidney disease in
the Northern Territory was the highest in the world and up to 50
times the Australian average. Most cases were in the Aboriginal
community.
	   Association figures show Australia's indigenous Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people die of diabetes _ a major cause of
kidney failure _ at a rate 12 to 17 times greater than white
Australians.
	   But trading land rights for public health services set a
dangerous precedent, said Cahill.
	   ``What we have here is a government doing deals for provision of
health care services that they are supposed to provide
regardless,'' Cahill said.
	   ``After this, Aboriginal groups with land claims across the
country will feel pressured into forgoing what they fundamentally
believe they should have (land rights) to get another thing that

Vietnam to double spending for agriculture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will double government spending
for agriculture, which has helped the country avoid the political
and social instability that some regional countries have faced, a
senior Communist Party official said Tuesday.
	   Nguyen Duc Trieu, a member of the decision-making party Central
Committee and chairman of the Farmers Association, said a committee
plenum decided last week to raise spending for agriculture and
rural development to 20 percent of state budget expenditures.
	   Allocations for other sectors may have to be cut as a result, he
said.
	   Most agricultural spending has focused in recent years on
irrigation projects. Now, it may expand to improve processing
industries to add value to farm products and research new seeds and
varieties to improve productivity, Trieu said.
	   Agriculture is very important for Vietnam, helping to ensure
stability and limit the impact of the Asian economic crisis, he
said.
	   ``Agriculture produces materials for processing industries, and
richer farmers will help to increase the society's purchasing
power, which in return helps to boost the economy,'' Trieu said.
	   About 80 percent of Vietnam's 78 million people live in the
countryside.
	   Spending for agriculture has fallen to about 10 percent of the
state budget in recent years from 21.7 percent in 1985, Trieu said.
	   The five-day plenum, which ended Saturday, has decided to lower
the national economic growth target to 5 to 6 percent for 1999. The
original 1998 goal of 9 percent was adjusted in July to 6 to 7
percent.
	   The 1999 target and doubling spending for agriculture must be
approved by the National Assembly, which starts a monthlong session
Oct. 28.

Holyfield-Lewis date and location due by end of week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lennox Lewis' manager expects to announce the date
and location of the heavyweight unification fight with Evander
Holyfield by the end of the week.
	   Frank Maloney said Tuesday he expects Lewis to sign a contract
for the fight in the next few days.
	   Lewis was expected to sign Monday, but Maloney blamed the delay
on ``legal problems and contract technicalities.''
	   Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, signed last week and is
expected to earn dlrs 20 million. Lewis, the WBC champion, is
expected to earn about dlrs 8 million.
	   Maloney said Mike Tyson victory's Monday in getting back his
boxing license would not affect the Holyfield-Lewis bout, expected
in February or March.
	   And he welcomed back Tyson.
	   ``I think it's good for boxing,'' Maloney said. ``You can't stop
a man from earning a living. I just hope he uses it for the good of
Mike Tyson and good of boxing.''
	   ``Mike Tyson is still the biggest money-maker in boxing,'' he
added. ``They made such a big thing out of something that happened
in the most physical and emotional sport we know. We all make
mistakes. There are things in my life I wish I hadn't done.''
	   Maloney said he expected Tyson to have two warm-up bouts before
being ready to fight _ as widely speculated _ the winner of the
Holyfield-Lewis fight.

Indonesian maids work in Singapore for a dollar a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ To escape poverty at home, hundreds of
Indonesian women are working for just one Singapore dollar (62
cents) a month as domestic servants in Singapore.
	   The regional economic crisis has increased the supply of
imported maids in this prosperous island state, prompting local
maid agencies to cut already low rates to a symbolic fee.
	   About 100,000 house maids work up to 90 hours a week in often
grueling conditions, and earn an average of 250 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 150) a month. Most of the maids are from the Philippines,
whose government recently declared it will not let them travel to
work in Singapore for anything less than 350 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 212) a month.
	   But in April, Singapore's Delijoy Employment Agency began
offering Indonesian maids at a dollar a month for the first five
months, after which their salary should increase to 230 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 140) a month. The agency receives a finder's fee from
the employers.
	   Protesting the token fee, the Indonesian government last week
suspended all maid exports to Singapore for the next three months.
So far, about 1,000 Indonesian women have agreed to work under the
new scheme, Delijoy said Tuesday.
	   ``I don't mind,'' Yuyun Juju, 28, told The Straits Times
newspaper. ``Life is difficult in the kampung. That is why I need
this job.''
	   Singaporeans, who rely on maids for their typical dual career
lifestyle, seem divided on the issue of cheap maids.
	   ``For us employers, we have nothing much to lose if we send the
maid back or when she runs away,'' said Leong Yoke Yeng, a
40-year-old businesswoman who had just hired an Indonesian maid
from Delijoy.
	   ``My experience with maids is that for the first few months when
they go without pay, they tend to be more hardworking,'' she said.
``Anyway, she doesn't really need money. Everything she needs she
can get at home, or I will pay.''
	   However, teacher Lim Su Mei, 29, disagreed with the cheap maids.
``I think it's disgusting. We're hiring a maid, not buying a
slave.''
	   Because most Filipinas speak English, they remain the most
sought-after maids in Singapore despite their relatively high
salaries. Indonesian maids mostly communicate in Bahasa Indonesia.
	   Though a maid's working hours or living conditions are not
regulated by any law, they live under severe restrictions. A maid
must not get pregnant or get married to a citizen while working in
Singapore. They are also regularly screened for pregnancy as well
as for venereal and other diseases.

Vietnam to hold followup meeting on 20/20 initiative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will be host for an international
meeting next week to assess the ``20/20 initiative,'' which was
aimed at increasing spending in poor countries for basic social
services.
	   Representatives from 29 developing countries, 21 donor nations
and 12 multilateral organizations are expected to attend the
three-day session opening Oct. 27.
	   Under the initiative, governments are supposed to allocate about
20 percent of their budgets _ and donors 20 percent of their aid
budgets _ to ensure basic education, primary health care,
reproductive health and population programs, nutrition programs and
safe water and sanitation.
	   According to a joint statement issued Tuesday by the U.N.
Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program and Vietnam's Labor
Ministry, partial data suggest that about 13 percent of national
budgets and 10 percent of donor funding is being allocated to such
basic services.
	   The first 20/20 initiative meeting was held in Oslo, Norway, in
April 1996.

Vietnamese court rejects scriptwriter's lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Hanoi Civil Court has rejected a
scriptwriter's lawsuit against a film company for allegedly
violating his copyright, a film company executive said Tuesday.
	   Nguyen Kim Anh, author of the novel ``Common-law Marriage,''
accused Film Studio No. 1 of the Ministry of Culture and
Information of changing his script without notifying him.
	   The court rejected his suit, the first in Vietnam's movie
industry, saying the director followed the script's main themes but
cut some parts because of budget problems, said the executive, who
spoke on condition he not be identified.
	   The court also ordered the author to pay dlrs 400 for the fees
of the script examining board.
	   The court rejected Anh's demand that the movie's title be
changed and his name removed from the credits. It said the movie
can be distributed and the studio does not have to apologize to
Anh, the executive said.
	   Anh could not be reached for comment. The Capital Police
newspaper reported that he vowed to appeal after the three-day
trial ended Monday.
	   Copyright violation is common in Vietnam, but very few cases
have been brought to court.
	   Vietnam and the United States signed a copyright agreement last
year, but the deal still is awaiting U.S. ratification.

Prayers for Wye summit turned into prayers for safe landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit.
	   A plane chartered by a prominent rabbi to encircle Israel seven
times and deliver prayers for the successful conclusion of the
Mideast peace talks was forced to make an emergency landing.
	   A little more than an hour into Monday's flight, the small
plane's electrical system malfunctioned.
	   ``We changed the subject of the prayers from the plight of the
Israeli people to our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of
Rabbi David Batsri and one of four passengers aboard.
	   ``My father ... called out the names of chapters in Psalms,
chapters named after angels, and then he asked them to come and
help,'' the younger Batsri said.
	   The pilot eventually brought the plane down safely in northern
Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri said the passengers' deliverance was
proof that a similar miracle could happen at the Wye talks.

Official: Small energy plants considered for Chernobyl zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to burn radioactive trees
from around the Chernobyl nuclear plant to produce electricity and
heat, an official said Tuesday.
	   The contaminated trees will be reduced to charcoal, which will
be easier to dispose of than other radioactive waste, said First
Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Volodymyr Kholosha.
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded and caught fire in April 1986
in the world's worst nuclear accident. The plant's immediate
surroundings were heavily contaminated.
	   Residents were evacuated from a 30-kilometer (19-mile) ``dead
zone'' around the plant. Only Chernobyl workers are allowed in on a
rotating basis.
	   Kholosha said only a few tree-burning factories will be built at
first while officials study whether the project is economically
sound, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   One of the stumbling blocks to closing the Chernobyl power plant
is Ukraine's insistence on foreign aid to come up with replacement
sources of electricity.

Relief convoys resume in Kosovo, U.N. team arrives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with relief delivered, U.N. team arriving, Serbs
accusing guerrillas of new attack on police, Cook reiterating that
West opposes independence for Kosovo. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relief convoys rolled again Tuesday
in Kosovo after a one-day halt due to renewed violence, and a
20-member U.N. team arrived to assess efforts to end the fighting
in the tense, separatist province.
	   Following attacks by ethnic Albanians on Serb police last
weekend, the government has moved tanks and troops to a front line
in central Kosovo, raising fears for the future of a U.S.-brokered
agreement to end the crisis.
	   While the Serbs accused the guerrillas of another attack on
police Tuesday, Kosovo appeared mostly calm and efforts resumed to
get help to tens of thousands of displaced residents before the
onset of winter.
	   Mercy Corps International and other humanitarian groups sent
some 150 tons of food, clothing, mattresses and other items to
Djinovce, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina,
delivering them in a convoy to an aid warehouse for distribution.
	   Other aid was being delivered elsewhere.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday had called off
two convoys of relief supplies headed to western Kosovo in the wake
of a Serb military buildup that followed weekend violence in which
at least three Serb police were killed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo, a southern province in Yugoslavia's dominant
republic of Serbia. As winter approaches, officials fear a
humanitarian disaster if the estimated 300,000 people displaced by
the fighting, thousands still living in the open, are not allowed
to return home.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark was expected in Belgrade later
Tuesday to discuss how far Yugoslav authorities still have to go to
meet the alliance's Oct. 27 deadline to pull troops out of Kosovo
or face airstrikes.
	   Under an agreement forged last week between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Milosevic, Yugoslavia must cease hostilities,
withdraw troops, begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians and allow
monitors into the province. The agreement led NATO to delay its
original pullout-or-airstrikes deadline by 10 days.
	   The newly arrived U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of
Sweden, is to serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. The representatives of human rights, humanitarian,
political and peacekeeping offices are expected to stay for about a
week to gather information on efforts to halt the fighting in the
province.
	   Yugoslav authorities and radical Albanians have traded
accusations about who was to blame for the weekend's surge of
bloodshed. Western officials, concerned about the skirmishes,
indicated that ethnic Albanian rebels as well as Serb forces were
to blame.
	   On Tuesday, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug claimed a
Serb policeman was wounded Tuesday morning when ``terrorists''
attacked a police patrol near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina. The incident could not be verified.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia were
distressed that the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement averted NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which they hoped would help their
goal of independence.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

Lukashenko: Belarus is to Europe as Japan is to Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus can play as important a role in
Europe as Japan does in Asia, President Alexander Lukashenko said
Tuesday.
	   ``Our future in Europe is equal to the role of Japan in Asia,''
Lukashenko said in an interview with Japanese journalists.
	   ``Belarus today, not possessing a huge potential of natural
resources, has a great intellectual potential, a high level of
education and a high enough level of technology,'' he said in a
portion of the interview broadcast on national radio.
	   ``Thus, in Europe, we must play the role you have played in
Asia,'' he said.
	   Lukashenko has done little to reform the Belarusian economy
since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is frequently criticized
by human rights groups for cracking down on dissent.
	   ``But for the Russian turmoil and the world financial crisis as
a whole, this year's economic indicators (in Belarus) would be
better,'' he told a separate group of reporters in Minsk.
	   He said an International Monetary Fund delegation was expected
in Belarus in November to negotiate a cooperation agreement.
	   Lukashenko also called for a restoration of the Soviet-era
Comecon trading bloc that linked the Soviet Union with its eastern
European and other Communist allies.

Guinea-Bissau's fighting spreads to interior, capital quietens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau government troops clashed
with rebels in the interior of the tiny west African nation
Tuesday, raising the prospect of a return to civil war, Portuguese
officials said.
	   Rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo Vieira
exchanged mortar fire in the second-largest city Bafata and in
Bambadinca, both about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the
capital Bissau, a spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry
said.
	   Clashes were also reported in Quebu, near the former Portuguese
colony's southern border with Guinea.
	   ``Our concern is that the fighting is spreading to the
interior,'' Vasco Colares Pereira told The Associated Press, adding
that the extent of the clashes was unclear.
	   Meanwhile, fighting in the capital Bissau subsided.
	   An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to
be identified, said there was sporadic fire in the capital during
the night, but everything was calm as morning broke.
	   Senegal and Guinea deployed troops in the neighboring country to
help Vieira contain Mane's rebels, but it was not clear whether
they were involved in the renewed fighting.
	   Hundreds of residents gathered at Bissau's port, looking to
leave the battered capital for the Bissagos islands, some 50
kilometers (30 miles) off its western coast, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Others were fleeing inland, according to Lusa, adding to some
300,000 already displaced by the conflict that began in early June.
	   A spokesman for the International Committe of the Red Cross said
the relief agency was organizing local volunteer teams to provide
first aid and transport the wounded to hospitals.
	   ``We don't know exactly how many refugees there are, because
it's hard to distinguish between newly and formerly displaced
people,'' Michael Kleiner said by phone from Geneva, where the ICRC
is based.
	   Hostilities restarted Sunday in the capital as army dissidents
led by Brig. Ansumane Mane and government soldiers clashed near the
presidential palace, breaking a 13-week truce.
	   The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, or CPLP, which
brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday called on both sides to
restrain their forces, Lusa said.
	   The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner _ the Economic
Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently resume a joint
mediation effort'', Lusa reported.
	   Fighting erupted June 7 in this country of 1 million, when a
rebel military faction seized Bissau's main army garrison and
airport, demanding that Vieira step down for alleged corruption.

	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia's defense minister resigned
Tuesday, following a scandal for accepting an apartment reserved
for members of the uniformed armed services.
	   Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek announced Tuesday he accepted
Alojz Krapez's resignation from the post of defense minister. No
replacement has been named.
	   Krapez, 40, came under fire three weeks ago when opposition
leaders brough to light that he was living in a military apartment.
Government officials have their own housing and are not allowed to
live in military quarters.
	   Krapez was named to the post in March 1998, after his
predecessor was forced to resign following a series of scandals
involving national security.
	   The opposition has also demanded a parliamentary debate
concerning Drnovsek's alleged attempt to cover up a top secret
agreement signed in 1995 between the Slovene head of intelligence
and the Israel. According to the Slovene constitution, all
bilateral agreements must be made public.
	   The parliament is expected to discuss the issue next month.
Should it decide the prime minister violated the constitution,
Drnovek could be dismissed.

Israel will not foot the bill for West Bank army redeployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman said Tuesday
that Israel would not foot the bill for new army bases and roads
needed if Israel agrees to withdraw from more of the West Bank.
	   Reports in the Israeli media have said Israel will need dlrs 500
million to dlrs 1 billion to redeploy its military forces, and that
Israel will ask the United States to assume the costs.
	   Neeman said Israel had already paid to build the West Bank bases
in the first place.
	   ``Why should the Israeli public pay?'' Neeman told The
Associated Press.
	   Asked why the American taxpayers should pay, Neeman said: ``I
didn't say the American public (should pay). You heard me say the
American public? I didn't say.''
	   He refused to say if Israel would turn to international donors
who have supported the Oslo accords to handle such costs but
insisted that Israel's economy was already too hard pressed to bear
the burden.
	   With leaders still wrangling over security issues at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland, Neeman said it was ``too early'' for Israel
to raise the issue.
	   Israel currently receives about dlrs 3 billion in economic and
military aid, and Neeman has vowed that within 10 years Israel will
need no more economic help.
	   A lasting peace accord with the Palestinians, Neeman said, would
spur economic growth in the entire region.

	   MERIDA, Spain (AP) _ Cuban leader Fidel Castro said putting only
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on trial, and not everyone
else responsible, runs the risk of making him a right-wing martyr.
	   ``It would be morally right that all those who participated in
the (1993 Chilean) coup should suffer the same fate as Pinochet ...
all those guilty,'' Castro said. ``I won't include (former
President Richard) Nixon because he's already dead.''
	   Castro said the detention of Pinochet risks creating political
problems in Chile, ``which is still not settled politically,'' by
strengthening the right and splitting the left.
	   Speaking to reporters while visiting the ruins of a Roman
amphitheater in this southwestern city, Castro said the detention
``could convert Pinochet into a martyr for the right and a cause of
division among the progressive forces.''
	   Pinochet, at 82 ten years older than the Cuban revolutionary,
was arrested Friday in London for questioning by a Spanish
magistrate probing human rights violations in Chile and Argentina.
The judge said he wanted to interrogate Pinochet with a view
towards extraditing him to Spain for trial.
	   ``From a moral point of view, it's just,'' said Castro. ``From a
judicial stance, it's questionable and from a political point of
view, it will create a complicated situation in Chile.''
	   Asked if he could suffer the same fate as Pinochet, Castro
replied: ``I'm not afraid to go anywhere. I come from a stock which
it would be difficult to arrest anywhere, not just on a moral basis
but also because of my life's story.''
	   Castro went to Merida Monday after attending a weekend
Ibero-American summit in Oporto, Portugal. He planned to meet Prime
Minister Jose Aznar in Madrid before leaving Spain.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Riot police were called to end a
blockade by angry women that trapped the Harare mayor and a
government minister, the state-controlled Herald reported.
	   Mayor Solomon Tawengwa and Local Government Minister John Nkomo
were surrounded for more than an hour until police broke a path
through the demonstrators and security men sped them away in
official cars on Monday.
	   The two officials were visiting a northern Harare township that
has had no running water for more than two weeks.
	   Many parts of Harare have had their water shut down for long
periods in recent weeks because the city council headed by Tawengwa
failed to pay the costs of pump repairs and maintenance contractors
stopped working on the pumping system.
	   The state power company has also cut off parts of the city's
electrified pumping system for non-payment of accounts.
	   Demonstrators on Monday called for the mayor to resign, accusing
him of squandering public money on a 30 million Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 850,000) mayoral mansion and other luxuries for council
officials while neglecting basic utilities.

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The president of
Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, concluded a state visit without
signing an expected deal on the delimitation of the two countries'
territorial waters.
	   The dispute over the reach of their exclusive economic zones was
expected
	   to be resolved during the three-day visit, but Obiang left late
Monday saying there were ``differences of interpretation'' over the
proposed text.
	   The disagreement, which has been simmering for years, came to a
head earlier this year when Sao Tome accused Equatorial Guinea of
drilling for oil
	   in Sao Tome waters.
	   Obiang and President Miguel Trovoada said at a news conference
that technical experts from their west African countries would
probably meet within the next two weeks to iron out the final
problems.
	   U.S.-based Environmental Remediation Holding Corp. is to start
drilling for oil off Sao Tome before the end of this year.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the
most active exploration areas in the African continent.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least 30 environment ministers from
across Africa were meeting this week in Nairobi with experts on
environmental changes.
	   The ministers expected to consult on multinational environmental
agreements on issues such as the ozone, biodiversity,
desertification and climate change, said Klaus Toepfer, executive
director of the U.N. Environment Program.
	   The ministers were expected to come up with a proposal to submit
to the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N.
Framework Convection on Climate Change to be held in Argentina from
Nov. 2-13.
	   The ministers were meeting at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A free-market advocate on Tuesday
denounced a proposed law that would ban tobacco advertising and
sponsorship, and smoking in public places, as something Nazi
Germany would have promoted.
	   ``I'm not saying this law does all the other things Hitler did,
but I am saying laws of this kind are characteristic of
authoritarian and totalitarian regimes,'' Free Market Foundation
executive director Leon Louw, told a parliamentary hearing.
	   Louw's group is independent and seeks to promote free-market
principals.
	   A lawmaker from the ruling African National Congress, Mtutuzeli
Mphele, called the assertion outrageous.
	   ``We are not making a law that sends people to the gallows. We
are making a law that saves a significant portion of our
communities,'' Mphele said.

Palestinian official says Clinton sides with Arafat on key issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mideast Talks &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An adviser to Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that
U.S. negotiators are siding with the Palestinians on three key
points of dispute in the U.S.-brokered talks.
	   The issues involve the PLO founding charter, the size of an
additional Israeli pullback in the West Bank and Israel's demand
that Arafat hand over 34 Palestinians accused of killing Israelis.
	   ``The Americans have expressed satisfaction with the Palestinian
position so the contacts and negotiations are now focusing on the
gap between Israel and the Americans,'' the Arafat adviser, Ahmed
Tibi, told Israel army radio.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinians reconvene the
Palestine National Council, which has hundreds of members, to annul
sections of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The Palestinians have said the PNC already revoked the
offending paragraphs in a special session in 1996, but Israel
claims the process was never completed.
	   Under a U.S. compromise, the Palestinians would have the PLO
Central Committee, a body with several dozen members, amend the
founding charter, and Tibi said the Americans have not changed
their position.
	   The negotiatior said the Americans also sided with the
Palestinians in their demand that an additional troop pullback be
determined in negotiations with Israel. The Americans reportedly
want to establish an Israeli-Palestinian committee that would have
three months to agree on the scope of that withdrawal.
	   Israel has said it alone has the right to decide on the scope of
the withdrawal, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he
would hand over no more than 1 percent.
	   On the third issue, the extradition of suspects, Tibi said
previous peace agreements stipulate that Palestinians accused of
killing Israelis do not need to be handed over to Israel if they
are being tried by Palestinian courts. He said the Americans agree
with that position.
	   Israel has demanded that Arafat hand over 34 Palestinians
suspected of killing Israelis.
	   Israel radio said the sides would continue talks at least until
Wednesday evening.

Turkmenistan agrees to gas pipeline across Caspian, Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ Turkey and Turkmenistan reached a
preliminary agreement Tuesday to build a pipeline for exporting
Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.
	   The deal was reached by visiting Turkish Energy Minister Cumhur
Ersumer and Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister Batyr Sardzhayev. It
would require Turkey to buy and transport up to 16 billion cubic
meters (560 billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas each year.
	   However, Turkmenistan is still considering other routes and will
favor whatever option promises quickest returns from gas exports,
Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov told Ersumer.
	   This impoverished former Soviet republic is eager to start
bringing in cash through lucrative gas sales.
	   Niyazov is expected to sign the agreement with Turkey during a
visit to the country on Oct. 29.
	   A pipeline to Turkey across the Caspian Sea is favored by the
United States, because the likely alternative would be a pipeline
through Iran _ a country that Washington considers too risky.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Under the eye of police, armed with tough orders to
keep the peace, angry high school students marched through the
streets of France on Tuesday.
	   But hooligans, undaunted by at least 4,500 police, threw rocks
and bottled in sporadic violence during the Paris protest,
mimicking troubles during nationwide demonstrations last week.
	   Tens of thousands of students marched throughout France to press
demands for more teachers, better equipment and buildings and a
lighter course load.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities,
but midway through the afternoon it appeared they would fail.
	   Police said about 25,000 students were marching in Paris -- far
below the hoped-for 45,000 demonstrators.
	   Hooligans intermittently threw bottles and stones toward police
flanking the marchers, who started at the Place d'Italie in the
south and moved to a Left Bank intersection at the Boulevard Saint
Germain.
	   Helmeted riot police made several charges, spraying from tear
gas canisters that sowed panic among the crowds.
	   Police, fearing for the worst Tuesday after last week's
violence, monitored the march on televisions in the basement of
police headquarters. Shops and other establishments along the march
route were ordered closed and cars removed.

China, Vietnam call for more talks on disputed border

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and Vietnam have agreed to step up
negotiations to settle much of their disputed land and sea borders,
a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji agreed Monday on accelerated border talks to meet a 2000
deadline set last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang said.
	   Khai is on the first visit to China by a Vietnamese premier
since the once hostile communist neighbors normalized relations in
1991. Ties have quickly recovered from the more than decade-long
chill that followed the brief, but bloody border war China started
in 1979 to punish Vietnam for ousting the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
	   In line with the improving political and economic relations,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin urged Khai Tuesday to encourage
Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu to visit
China next year, state television reported.
	   Jiang, who heads China's Communist Party, and Phieu's
predecessor, Do Muoi, agreed last year to demarcate by 2000 the
land border and the waters of the Tonkin Gulf, known to the Chinese
as the Beibu.
	   Jiang told Khai he was pleased with the ``important progress''
made in negotiations between the governments over the past year or
so, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The border talks, however, do not cover the sensitive Spratly
islands _ a set of shoals and reefs in the South China Sea that
have been a constant source of friction between China and Vietnam
and four other regional governments that claim them wholly or
partly.
	   China's and Vietnam's navies skirmished over the Spratlys in
1988. Last month, China accused Vietnam of sending troops who built
structures on two reefs. Vietnam said the reefs were not part of
the Spratlys.
	   Despite the border disagreements, trade between China and
Vietnam has boomed, from dlrs 30 million in 1991 to dlrs 1.44
billion last year, according to one Vietnamese newspaper.
	   Vietnam's Khai and China's Zhu discussed ways to promote trade
and investment, Xinhua reported separately. Senior economic
officials were accompanying the two premiers in the talks.
	   Afterward, Chinese and Vietnamese officials signed a treaty on
judicial assistance in civil and criminal cases, a border trade
agreement and a consular treaty. Xinhua gave no details, but
problems between the two countries include smuggling and poor
quality goods.

population and represented another step in the transformation from
white-minority rule to democracy, which began with all-race
elections in 1994.
	   During apartheid rule, white officials too scared to survey
black townships flew over in helicopters and estimated the
population. Door-to-door surveys were conducted only in Afrikaans _
spoken by descendants of Dutch settlers _ and English.
	   But in 1996, more than 80,000 interviewers spent 21 days with
questionnaires in all 11 official languages to count home-dwellers,
squatters and the homeless.
	   Officials at Statistics South Africa said the 40.58 million
figure represented an upward revision of about 2.6 million over
preliminary estimates released last year, to adjust for
undercounting in rural areas.
	   The information will be used in government planning that
includes new housing and telephone hook-ups, water and electricity
for a vastly underprivileged majority.
	   The ethnic breakdown departed little from previous estimates,
which showed 77 percent were African, or black, followed by 11
percent white, 9 percent mixed-race and 3 percent Indian or Asian.
	   Zulu remained the dominant mother tongue, with 23 percent,
followed by Mandela's native tongue, Xhosa, with 18 percent.
	   But Afrikaans, the language spoken by the white apartheid
culture, has dropped from 16 percent estimated previously by
language experts to 14 percent, indicating a steady erosion since
1994's first all-race elections.
	   Nine percent said English was their first language.
	   Income disparity ranged from the low end of 500 rand (dlrs 88)
per month to the 25 percent earning 2,500 rand (dlrs 439) or more
per month.
	   One-third of white women and two-thirds of white men earned more
than 3,500 rand (dlrs 615). Only one in 20 black males or females
earned that much.
	   Only 45 percent had inside water taps and 58 percent had
electricity.
	   But pointing to accomplishments since the survey was taken,
Mandela said the country should be proud that 750,000 new
telephones had been installed. One million households were added to
the electricity grid and 1.8 million people gained access to clean
water.
	   The census also showed that 54 percent live in urban areas, with
18 percent of the total population living in traditional dwellings
and 17 percent in shacks.
	   Nineteen percent of South Africans older than 20 years never
attended school.
	   The Zulu stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal had the most people with
8.4 million, followed by Gauteng _ where Johannesburg and the
goldfields are located _ with 7.3 million; and Eastern Cape, along
the Indian Ocean, with 6.3 million.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rocco Benetton is taking over as the new chief
executive of Benetton's Formula One racing team.
	   The 29-year-old Benetton, son of team co-founder Luciano
Benetton, steps into a void created Monday when David Richards
resigned over differences with the family regarding long-term
strategies for the team.
	   Benetton has yet to win a race this season and is third in the
constructors' championship going into the final race Nov. 1 in
Suzuka, Japan.
	   ``We could not agree on the future direction of the business,''
Richards said. ``Nonetheless, it's been a very exciting year and I
have a great belief in the potential of Benetton Formula.''
	   The Briton took over last September, replacing Italian Flavio
Briatore, who also left after the team failed to win consistently.
	   ``We are a young team and we want to be competitive,'' Benetton
said. ``To do this we have decided to strengthen our presence
through greater investments in human and technical resources.''

Nearly 2 million crimes registered in Russia in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly 2 million crimes were reported in Russia
during the first nine months of this year, and crime may continue
to grow because of the current economic crisis, a deputy interior
minister said Tuesday.
	   Col. Gen. Vladimir Vasilyev said the theft of weapons and
explosives was up 50 percent from the same period last year. He
reported the figures to Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, who
reviewed the ministry's performance Tuesday.
	   Vasilyev said nearly 60 percent of the more than 1.9 million
crimes registered in the first nine months of 1998 were ``grave''
or ``very grave,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Interior Ministry officials also sounded alarm about the growth
of white-collar crime. They blamed huge wage debts to coal miners,
which sparked nationwide protests this year, on ``incompetent,
often criminal actions'' of mine administrators, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Stepashin said economic crime has cost the country 3.6 billion
rubles (dlrs 212 million) in losses this year.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who met with Stepashin on Tuesday,
praised his work, saying the Interior Ministry's performance ``has
improved considerably in many spheres,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Yeltsin also signed a decree ruling that rallies and
demonstrations in Moscow may not start before 7 a.m. or last later
than 10 p.m., Interfax reported Tuesday.

Witnesses of Marines' flight begin offering depositions for
</HEADLINE>
courts-martial &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICIA THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTO, Italy (AP) _ About 40 Italians began telling
investigators Tuesday what they saw Feb. 3, the day a U.S. Marine
jet sliced a cable car line in the Alps, sending 20 people plunging
to their deaths.
	   The evidence is being collected by defense and prosecuting
attorneys preparing for the courts-martial of the EA-6B Prowler's
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 30, and navigator, Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, 31.
	   They are each charged with 20 counts of involuntary
manslaughter, 20 counts of negligent homicide, as well as
destruction of private property and military property and
dereliction of duty. If convicted, they could face life in prison.
	   Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too fast and too low when
it struck the gondola line which takes skiers up Mount Cermis, near
the town of Cavalese.
	   Defense lawyers say the gondola wasn't marked on the crew's map.
	   The witnesses were being asked questions about the plane's
altitude and flight path.
	   Asked whether he was sure he could recall the plane's path,
surveyor Mario Bleggi said,''I remember it very clearly because it
struck me to see a plane flying so low.''
	   Bleggi said he was taking measurements for a map when the plane
swooped down the valley, enabling him to provide precise details on
its trajectory.
	   Ashby, of Mission Viejo, California., and Schweitzer, of
Westbury, New York, were in the Trento courtroom throughout the
questioning.
	   After completing their questioning, expected to run through this
week, attorneys plan to simulate the Marines' EA-6B Prowler flight
path.
	   The U.S. government has approved more than dlrs 110,000 for
defense teams to spend on expert witnesses and crash
reconstruction.
	   Besides the manslaughter charges, both officers have also been
charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy stemming from
the disappearance of a videotape shot during the flight.
	   Ashby's trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 4 while Schweitzer's
starts Feb. 22. Both will be held in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
	   Charges against two rear-seat crewmen were dismissed by a judge
who concluded they had little control over the flight.

Earnings up 10 percent at SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pharmaceutical group SmithKline Beecham PLC said
Tuesday that its quarterly earnings rose 10 percent to 403 million
pounds (dlrs 665 million), thanks to strong sales of new drugs.
	   The company's net income compared with earnings of 385 million
pounds (dlrs 627 million) in the third quarter of 1997.
	   SmithKline Beecham said revenues rose 3 percent to 1.98 billion
pounds (dlrs 3.27 billion) in the quarter just ended, compared with
1.92 billion pounds (dlrs 3.13 billion) in the same period a year
earlier.
	   The results were dampened by the high value of the British
pound, which has hit the bottom line at virtually all British
multinationals.
	   Before currency costs were taken into account, SmithKline
Beecham said, its underlying drug sales jumped by 7 percent.
Pharmaceutical sales grew 8 percent, consumer healthcare 4 percent
and clinical laboratories 13 percent.
	   ``Excellent sales of new pharmaceutical products, which
accounted for 43 percent of pharmaceutical product sales, and
volume increases have driven our third-quarter results,''
SmithKline Chief Executive Jan Leschly said. ``Based on our
nine-month performance, we are confident we will meet our year-end
earnings per share goal.''

Swiss authorities order confiscation of dlrs 114 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with further details from news conference. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of some dlrs 114 million in accounts belonging to the
brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the
country's federal prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   The brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, is in prison in Mexico
pending completion of trials in Mexico in a political assassination
and on a charge of illegal enrichment during his brother's
administration.
	   Swiss Federal Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said the funds in the
accounts, of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner, came partly from
protection payoffs.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but
prosecutor's said the findings of a 2 1/2 year investigation
``inevitably suggest money laundering'' of drug profits.
	   Del Ponte told a news conference Switzerland could not itself
try Salinas as he is imprisoned in Mexico.
	   His lawyers can appeal the decision, taken Monday, within ten
days. That would send the case to Switzerland's supreme court, but
Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' it would uphold the
seizure.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered confiscated is
in Swiss bank accounts. But the office is also requesting that
Britain seize dlrs 24.5 million administered by a Swiss-based
financial institution in London.
	   Salinas has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the
money in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by
several wealthy friends.
	   Del Ponte's office countered that his business dealings ``are
for all practical purposes unsound and incomprehensible and
contrary to customary business usage.''
	   Prosecutors maintain that Salinas used his influence and
protected large-scale shipments through Mexico from Colombia to the
United States.
	   ``With all his contacts and his power, he could guarantee
protection for those loads,'' said Valentin Roschacher, who led the
Swiss investigation.
	   Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, following
agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs
could be transported through Mexico on certain routes, he added.
	   Many testified that he had received hundreds of million of
dollars in payoffs from Colombian and Mexican drug cartels between
1988 and 1994, when his brother was president, Roschacher said.
	   Among them were members of Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug
cartels, Del Ponte added.
	   The investigation concluded Raul Salinas ``had close personal
and business relationships both with Colombian and Mexican drug
dealers and with Mexican justice and administration officials,''
Roschacher said.
	   His contacts with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and
became more intense in the early 1990s, he continued.
	   Swiss authorities did not release the full police report into
Salinas. Both Del Ponte and Roschacher declined to say whether
investigations had shown Carlos Salinas to be involved with drug
money.
	   Del Ponte said a Swiss criminal case was no longer necessary as
Mexican authorities have started their own proceedings against Raul
Salinas and others on charges of money laundering and facilitating
drug trafficking.
	   Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995.
	   Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges
of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco
Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel
government post in his brother's administration.
	   No drug-related charges have been brought against Raul Salinas,
but he was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.
	   His brother, who moved to Ireland shortly after leaving office,
has been charged with no crime.

Record number of bodies found in Japan's `suicide forest'
</HEADLINE>

cited by potential suicides, last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a grisly trend authorities suspect is linked to
Japan's souring economy, a record number of suicide victims have
been found this year in a sprawling forest at the foot of Mount
Fuji.
	   More than 300 police and firefighters scoured the huge forest
southwest of Tokyo on Tuesday in an annual search for victims. They
found three bodies, bringing to 58 the number found in the area so
far this year.
	   By year's end, the 1998 toll ``would be more than 70 bodies,''
Masaaki Mochizuki, spokesman for Fujiyoshida police, predicted.
	   Police said most of the suicides were either by hanging or
poison. In some cases, only bones and a rope remained to indicate
what had happened months, or possibly years, before.
	   The newspaper Asahi said that since the breaking of Japan's
economic bubble of rising land and stock prices in the early 1990s,
most of the suicide cases found in the woods have been middle-aged
or older men.
	   The previous record was set in 1994, when 57 bodies were found
in the forest, which investigators have been searching for suicide
victims once a year since 1971. Last year, 55 were found, including
20 in the year's last three months.
	   The forest is considered a prime suicide spot because of its
isolation, and was recommended in a book about suicide a few years
ago, Mochizuki said.
	   He said it was unclear why more people are committing suicide
there, but Kyodo News agency quoted unidentified authorities as
saying the country's deep recession could be behind the increase.
	   Suicide in Japan is often seen as an honorable way out of a
shameful situation, and experts say more Japanese are killing
themselves rather than bear the humiliation of failure in business
or at work.
	   In 1997, a total of 24,391 Japanese killed themselves _ up 5.6
percent from 23,104 the previous year, the National Police Agency
said.
	   Japan's overall suicide rate is high, at 17.2 per 100,000
people. That compares with 12 in the United States and 7.5 in
England, but is well below Finland's 27.3, according to Japan's
Health Ministry.
	   The Aokigahara forest is as isolated as it gets in crowded
Japan. At 621 square kilometers (248 square miles), the forest _
known as the ``sea of trees'' _ covers an area the size of Tokyo.
	   The latest three victims were found Tuesday by a team of 342
police and firefighters. The other victims were discovered by
hikers, picnickers and students who explore caves in the area.
	   About 40 other people have gone to the forest to commit suicide
so far this year but failed, Mochizuki said.
	   The Asahi said that among those who discussed their motives with
police, most cited debts or problems in personal relations.

Aid workers say half a million Rwandans displaced by violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Nearly half a million people are displaced
in northwestern Rwanda, where the government forces appeared to
have stepped up attacks against Hutu rebels, aid workers said
Tuesday.
	   The number of the displaced has doubled since August, after
authorities gathered people scattered on the hillsides into
makeshift camps in order to avoid civilian casualties and to
isolate the rebels from the largely Hutu population, aid workers
said.
	   Steve Brown, the U.N. resident coordinator, said the United
Nations would appeal to donors for an emergency relief package,
probably later in this week.
	   According to the latest figures compiled by the local
authorities, the United Nations and the Irish relief agency
Concern, there were 478,637 displaced Rwandans in Ruhengeri and
Gisenyi prefectures, or a third of the total population in the most
densely populated region of Rwanda.
	   The northwestern corner of Rwanda is a traditional Hutu
stronghold. Rebels _ former Hutu soldiers and militiamen _ have
been relying on their families, friends and neighbors for food,
money and shelter.
	   The rebels are responsible for the 1994 Hutu
government-orchestrated genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The genocide ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
	   But attacks on army convoys, Tutsi genocide survivors, and more
recently Hutus who refused to cooperate with the rebels have
increased since 1996 when Hutu fighters mixed in with more than a
million Hutu civilians who returned from exile in neighboring
Congo.
	   Since August, Rwandan troops have been fighting in Congo where
they said President Laurent Kabila had failed to rid the forested
border area of remaining Hutu fighters, many of whom are believed
to have crossed back into Rwanda.
	   The government said it had killed 378 Hutu fighters between Oct.
6 and 11 in northwestern Rwanda, including two lieutenants in the
former government army.
	   Aid workers, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
seemingly organized, large-scale displacement of people into
makeshift camps and communal centers during the planting season
could result in serious food shortages.
	   The fertile northwest is the country's breadbasket, but since
1996 the area has been dependent on food aid for survival. The U.N.
World Food Program said it has been supplying food for 364,000
people displaced since January.

Joschka Fischer said Tuesday that his government would not allow
World War II-era disputes to delay the integration of Poland and
the Czech Republic into the European Union.
	   ``This government will not burden the necessary discussions with
the past,'' Fischer said. ``For us the common future is the measure
for our policies and not the past.''
	   His remarks at a news conference were an apparent reference to
compensation claims by Germans forced from land that was given to
Poland and then-Czechoslovakia after World War II.
	   The exile groups in Germany have sought to block the two
countries from joining the EU until their demands are met.
Politically influential, the exiles got a sympathetic hearing from
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative government, although
he never agreed to any linkage.

	   SENAKI, Georgia (AP) _ Most of the soldiers who mutinied against
the Georgian government were back in their garrison by Tuesday, and
the tanks, trucks and machine guns they'd used to block roads were
returned to the army's arsenal.
	   However, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said the leader
of the one-day revolt and 15 to 20 of his supporters were believed
to be hiding in a forest. The leader, Akakiy Eliava, and some of
his men have been charged with treason.
	   ``This group will be found and tried,'' Shevardnadze told a news
conference in capital Tbilisi. The revolt ``was a move against the
country's independence and democracy.''
	   Initial reports put the number of mutineers at about 200, but
military officers in Senaki said Tuesday the number of troops
involved was closer to 50. Others were local residents who joined
in the revolt.
	   The soldiers, who are fiercely opposed to Shevardnadze, took
over their garrison in the western town of Senaki on Monday and
advanced toward the heart of Georgia.
	   Troops were sent to intercept rebels on the road to Georgia's
second-largest city, Kutaisi, some 230 kilometers (140 miles) west
of the Tbilisi. At least one soldier and four mutineers were killed
in clashes.
	   After talks with government negotiators, the rebel troops agreed
to return to their garrison at Senaki, about 50 kilometers (31
miles) west of Kutaisi. The majority were back in their barracks by
Tuesday, military officials said.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
over the violence and voiced support for Shevardnadze and ``the
stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.
	   He called on Georgia's opposition on Monday ``to resolve their
differences with the government through peaceful and democratic
means rather than by armed confrontation.''
	   Eliava, the leader of the revolt, is a military commander who is
also a supporter of the late Georgian president, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9 attack
on his motorcade that killed two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards. At
least eight suspects have been arrested.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Alpha Credit, one of Greece's largest
privately owned banks, launched operations here Tuesday, saying its
move to Cyprus was a ``natural step'' after its expansion in EU
countries and the Balkans.
	   Alpha Credit last month bought a 75 percent stake that had been
held by Britain's NatWest Group in the island's Lombard NatWest
Bank. No price was officially given for the transaction, but
various press reports have put it at 35 million pounds (dlrs 72.8
million). The remaining 25 percent of the bank is owned by Cypriot
investors.
	   Lombard NatWest has a 5 percent share of the highly competitive
retail banking market in Cyprus.
	   Alpha Credit chairman Uannis Costopoulos told reporters that the
bank planned to seek a listing on the local stock exchange.
	   ``We must be here for a year and show some results before we can
attract investors,'' he said.
 &UR; ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The capitalization of companies traded on
the the Cyprus Stock Exchange stood at 1.21 billion pounds (dlrs
2.51 billion) at the end of last month, a decline of 4.34 percent
from August.
	   The bourse's capitalization also registered a fall in September.
It dipped by 1.63 percent to stand at 1.88 billion pounds (dlrs
3.91 billion), the stock exchange said in its monthly report.
	   The banking sector accounted for nearly 65 percent of the
market's capitalization at the end of last month, with
manufacturing a distant second at 10.05 percent.
	   The official all-share index fell by 3.07 percent in September
from the previous month. About 60 securities are traded on the
exchange.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Central Bank of Jordan said Tuesday
that its foreign currency reserves and gold deposits dropped 2.2
percent to 2.4 billion dinars (dlrs 3.5 billion) in August from the
previous month.
	   A report from the bank attributed the decrease to a growing
demand for cash to pay for projects financed by commercial banks in
Jordan and to cover imports.
	   The report said cash deposits in hard currency amounted to 1.3
billion dinars (dlrs 1.8 billion) in August, and gold reserves
totaled 144 million dinars (dlrs 203 million).
	   Money owed to the treasury by banks, public and private
institutions and governments was 887 million dinars (dlrs 1.2
billion). Bonds and treasury bills were worth 80 million (dlrs
112.7 million), the report said.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's planning minister is in the United States
seeking investors for several major projects in this small Gulf
state, including the building of a new city, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The minister, Ali al-Moussa, told the state-run agency in
Washington that the projects ranged from construction to
communications, electrical power and environment.
	   He did not give specifics but said he urged American companies
to make direct contact with Kuwaiti companies to participate.
	   The Cabinet earlier this month approved a plan to build a 1.8
billion dinar (dlrs 5.96 billion) city in Subiya, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) from the Iraqi border.
	   It is expected to take 30 years to complete Subiya, which is
designed to house around 250,000 people.
	   Al-Mousa said another city, Al-Zour, was being considered south
of the capital.
	   The United States led the international coalition that fought
the 1991 Gulf War and ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait.
 &UR; ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Textile production by state-owned
companies was valued at 12.7 billion Syrian pounds (dlrs 276
million) in 1997, compared with 2.9 billion pounds (dlrs 63
million) two years earlier, Tishreen daily reported Tuesday.
	   It said that production also was up sharply in the private
sector, registering 25.4 billion pounds (dlrs 552 million) in 1995,
more than 10 times the total a decade earlier.
	   Private-sector exports of textiles reached dlrs 85 million last
year, the paper said.

Fate of thousands of Palestinian prisoners to be determined in Wye
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Palestinian legislature demanding
release of all prisoners. &QL; 
 &UR; With Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TURMOUS AYYA, West Bank (AP) _ Saieda Hamzeh remembers gently
caressing the young face of her 16-year-old son Muntasir. Three
years later, a full-grown beard now covers that face and barbed
wire keeps a mother's touch away.
	   Muntasir is serving a five-year sentence in Israel's Megiddo
prison for possessing and preparing explosives. The chances for his
early release, like that of some 3,000 other Palestinians in
Israeli jails, is one of the issues on the table at a Mideast
summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   For Arafat, the issue is critical. The Palestinian leader,
already under pressure from opponents who claim he has conceded too
much to Israel, needs to bring back something from the talks.
	   The Palestinian legislative council, made up of mostly Arafat
supporters, demanded in a statement Tuesday that any agreement
reached at the summit at the Wye River conference in Maryland
include the release of all Palestinian prisoners.
	   For Netanyahu, prisoner release is one of the more difficult
concessions. The prime minister was highly critical of his
predecessors for releasing prisoners and has accused Arafat of a
revolving-door policy regarding militants in Palestinian custody.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said
Monday that police submitted a list of 100 Palestinian prisoners to
the Israeli delegation at Wye, but would not say if some or all
would be released.
	   Her boss, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, told Israel
radio that up to 100 prisoners, primarily those who are sick or
jailed for non-violent crimes, could be freed soon.
	   But Arafat will need to hold out for a more significant offer in
order to satisfy his public.
	   ``Arafat feels the pressure, the street reminds him everyday of
the importance of the prisoners,'' Mrs. Hamzeh said.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians marched Monday in the Gaza Strip to
demand the release of relatives held in Israeli jails.
	   Holding pictures of husbands, fathers and sons, some 700
Palestinian women and children demanded that the Palestinian
delegation to the Mideast summit secure the release of prisoners
held for security offenses.
	   ``Our people cannot accept any agreement without the release of
all the prisoners,'' said Sufian Abu Zaida, an official in the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Such protests have been a daily occurrence in
Palestinian-controlled cities, even before the start of the summit.
	   Though skeptical, the 49-year-old Hamzeh is hopeful that her
son, now 19, will be released once a deal is reached, because the
explosives her son prepared were never used in an attack and he did
not cause the death of anyone.
	   But her next door neighbor is not so confident. Summana Jabara's
father is serving a life sentence for planting a bomb in a
Jerusalem market 23 years ago that killed and injured Israelis.
	   Israel has said it would never release Palestinians who have
``blood on their hands.''
	   ``People like my father, no one even mentions them any more,''
said Jabara, who was three months old when her father Ahmed was
arrested. ``I have no hopes that he will be released.''
	   Mrs. Hamzeh said she will hold her son to a promise he made to
get his high school diploma and enroll in college.
	   She also said that if her son is released, she'll make sure he
stays out of trouble.
	   ``Before he was arrested he would get frustrated and stomp out
of the house when I ask him what he was doing or where he was
going,'' Mrs. Hamzeh said. ``Now, he won't get away with that.''

BBC programs disrupted by afternoon strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Broadcasting Corp. programs were disrupted
Tuesday as 10,000 journalists and technicians across the country
staged a three-hour strike over pay.
	   Members of three unions walked out at noon (1100 GMT) to protest
their 4 percent pay raise, compared with a 9 percent increase for
BBC executives.
	   The biggest casualty was the 30-minute ``World at One'' news
program, which was replaced by a pre-recorded documentary.
	   Rallies were held in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland to mark the walkout.
	   ``Members out on outside broadcasts, drama shoots, news stories
and those based in BBC buildings around the country demonstrated by
their actions today how angry they are that the senior management
can ask them to show wage restraint while exercising no pay
restraint when it comes to their own salaries,'' said Gerry
Morrissey, assistant general secretary of the technicians' union.
	   The taxpayer-sudsidized BBC said August's 4 percent raise wss
``fair and reasonable,'' given market trends, inflation and the
corporation's ability to pay.
	   Unions member called on the BBC governors, who meet Wednesday,
to ensure executives are not given a higher pay raise than staff
next year.

Iraq says it is lowering quality to boost quantity in oil sales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BAG-101
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq confirmed reports Tuesday it had
lowered the quality of its crude oil exports in order to boost
sales and revenue.
	   Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid told a news
conference that Iraqi crude now had a lower API gravity and higher
sulfur content.
	   Local oil experts said this was caused by the decision to pump
about 150,000 barrels of highly sulfurous oil into the giant fields
of Kirkuk, from where Iraq currently extracts up to half its daily
exports.
	   The government had decided to mix the Kirkuk oil, which is of
superior quality, with the low grade product as it no longer had
the ability to refine the 150,000 barrels to a marketable standard,
the experts said.
	   Iraq has long complained that U.N. sanctions imposed after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait have led to a serious deterioration of its
refineries.
	   Experts also told The Associated Press that the country is
facing ``an acute shortage'' of clean water which it injects into
the wells to raise the oil level and increase the volume of
pumping.
	   The Cypriot-published Middle East Economic Survey reported
Monday that Iraq had reduced quality in the fight to push volume
and gain more revenue.
	   Rashid admitted the reinjection of the sulfurous oil had
degraded the country's premier wells.
	   ``Definitely damage is being done,'' Rashid said, ``but we hope
that, with good reason prevailing in the (U.N.) Security Council,
this will come to a halt.''
	   Rashid said his ministry had no alternative but to pursue the
current production level of 2.6 million barrels per day, the level
required the reach the government's new target of earning dlrs 3.5
billion from the current fourth phase of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``We will reach more than what we have promised ... about 15 per
cent more than we committed ourselves to under the fourth oil
phase,'' Rashid said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has granted exemption from sanctions
for Iraq to buy $300 million worth of much-needed spare parts for
Iraq's oil industry. Its sanctions committee has also taken steps
to speed up the delivery of the parts.
	   But the minister said Iraq had so far received no spare parts
and none were expected to arrive before the six-month phase ends on
Nov. 25.
	   ``Some contracts (for parts) were circulated, but they are far,
far below what is required,'' Rashid said.
	   The United Nations has approved 56 contracts, worth a total of
dlrs 62 million, U.N. spokesman John Mills said Monday. Another 61
contracts, worth a total of dlrs 40 million, have been put on hold.

Turkey calls talks with Syria positive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's defense minister on Tuesday
described as ``positive'' the outcome of security talks between
Turkish and Syrian officials but indicated he wanted to see a
crackdown by Damascus on Kurdish rebels.
	   Officials from both countries met for a second day Tuesday to
address Ankara's claims that Syria was sheltering rebels.
	   Turkey called the talks the last chance for a peaceful solution
to the crisis.
	   ``There are some very positive results. These results will be
put on paper,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told reporters. ``But
this is not enough. Care must be taken in the application of the
results.''
	   ``We have to verify that our Syrian friends and neighbors are
acting in line with the agreement they have made,'' he added.
	   Just what might have been agreed upon wasn't immediately
revealed.
	   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said Turkey wanted a way
to verify if Syria had halted alleged support for the rebels.
	   Relations between the two neighbors deteriorated sharply in
recent weeks after Turkey suggested it might take military action
against Syria if it failed to end alleged support to the rebels
which launch cross-border attacks on Turkey.
	   Despite Sezgin's remarks, Ankara moved several tanks and armored
personnel carriers to the Turkish-Syrian border in preparation for
exercises planned for the first week of November, private NTV news
channel reported Tuesday.
	   The exercises are seen as Turkey's display of military prowess
in a sharp warning to Syria. Turkey boast the second largest armed
forces within NATO after the United States.
	   Fears of a regional conflict have led to various mediation
attempts by Egypt and Iran.
	   Officials tried to keep the venue for the security talks secret,
but Turkish media reported the meetings were held in the southern
town of Seyhan, some 550 kilometers (344 miles) south of Ankara.
	   Turkish officials were looking for proof that Syria was closing
down alleged Kurdish rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon.
	   Turkey also accuses Syria of harboring rebel Kurd leader
Abdullah Ocalan. Syria has denied the accusations. Ocalan, in a
statement to a Kurdish news agency denied Monday that he was in
Syria.
	   Analysts believe that Turkey may resort to pinpoint attacks on
rebel targets in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon if the security
talks fail.
	   Close to 37,000 people have died since 1984 when the rebels
launched a war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast.

Festina team doctor to be released on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French court decided on Tuesday to free
the jailed doctor of the Festina cycling team which became the
center of a doping scandal during the Tour de France.
	   Eric Ryckaert, a Belgian, is to be released on 100,000 francs
(dlrs 182,000) bail and remain under judicial surveillance. He has
been jailed since July 17.
	   Ryckaert has admitted the use of banned doping products at
Festina, though its star rider, Richard Virenque, continues to deny
that he knowingly took such substances.
	   Festina team director Bruno Roussel and masseur Willy Voet are
also under investigation.
	   The Festina scandal blew open days ahead of the Tour de France
when customs officials stopped Voet at the France-Belgium border.
His car contained more than 400 doping products, including the
performance-enhancing drug, EPO, which increases oxygen in red
blood cells.
	   Ryckaert is the last of the three Festina officials to be
released from detention.
	   Meanwhile, the daily Le Parisien reported that two retired
businessmen in Poitiers, southwest of Paris, have been questioned
for allegedly providing drugs to amateur cyclists in the
Poitou-Charentes region.
	   According to Le Parisien, which did not cite sources, the two
sold a powerful cocktail of amphetamines, cocaine, heroine,
morphine and other painkillers to cyclists seeking to enhance their
endurance.
	   The existence of the so-called ``Belgian cocktail'' was revealed
after a cyclist who had taken one suffered serious heart
palpitations and high fever during an amateur race last spring, Le
Parisien reported.
	   A police investigation showed that more than 30 racers had taken
``Belgian cocktails,'' the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin emphasized Tuesday that he
does not plan to run for re-election, and expressed irritation at
lawmakers who asked the Constitutional Court to rule whether he
could legally seek a third term.
	   Several Russian newspapers and magazines reported Yeltsin was
unable to perform all his current duties because of his health and
would make no more foreign trips during his presidency.
	   ``I have said so many times that I will not run in 2000,''
Yeltsin said at the Kremlin, where he returned to work despite a
lingering cold.
	   ``But they (opposition lawmakers) have brought it to a point
where this is being reviewed by the Constitutional Court. I will
not run, so why are you tormenting me?'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's comments to reporters, at the start of a meeting with
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, were broadcast on national
television. He looked a little tired, but spoke firmly and clearly.
	   Yeltsin and his doctors insist the president will serve out the
less than two years that remain in his term, and deny persistent
speculation that he is seriously ill.
	   Such rumors surface every time Yeltsin gets sick, such as last
week when he was forced to cut short a trip to Central Asia because
of a respiratory infection.
	   The Kommersant business newspaper quoted Yeltsin's chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, as saying Yeltsin would make no more
foreign trips during his presidency. He canceled a trip to Malaysia
for an Asian summit next month, although he is still scheduled to
go to Austria later this month.
	   The influential Itogi magazine quoted unidentified top Yeltsin
aides Tuesday as saying the president is seriously ill and that his
staff is trying to ``pull the president through'' until elections
scheduled for sometime in 2000.
	   ``Starting now, all talk about healthy president who works
normally should stop,'' Itogi quoted one high-ranking official in
the president's office as saying at a meeting with 30 Russian
journalists.
	   The magazine did not specify the nature of the illness. Yeltsin
has been plagued by health problems in recent years, including
quintuple heart bypass surgery in 1996.
	   Vlast (Power) magazine said that Yeltsin had become a
``bystander'' in the political process.
	   ``The Kremlin tacitly acknowledges that the president's ability
to work is limited,'' it said.
	   Yeltsin has repeatedly said he does not plan to seek a third
term, but opposition lawmakers asked the Constitutional Court to
rule on the legality anyway and hearings began last week.
	   Yeltsin's aides have said his first term began in the Soviet era
before the current Russian Constitution began, so it should not
count toward the two-term limit.
	   Meanwhile, legislation drafted by a Communist lawmakers that
would require Yeltsin to undergo an independent medical exam will
be submitted to three parliamentary committees, said deputy speaker
Vladimir Ryzhkov.
	   It will be studied by the committees on security, legislation
and health care, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's first
door-to-door census showed how far the country must travel to
overcome the legacy of a divided past, President Nelson Mandela
said Tuesday.
	   Fewer than half its 40.58 million people have running water in
their homes and a quarter earn as little as 500 rand (dlrs 88) a
month, the report showed.
	   The results ``show a society in which the lines between rich and
poor were, with little qualification, the historical lines of a
racially divided society,'' Mandela said at the census release in
Pretoria.
	   The figures ended decades of guessing about South Africa's
population and represented another step in the transformation from
white-minority rule to democracy, which began with all-race
elections in 1994.
	   During apartheid rule, white officials too scared to survey
black townships flew over in helicopters and estimated the
population. Door-to-door surveys were conducted only in Afrikaans _
spoken by descendants of Dutch settlers _ and English.
	   But in 1996, more than 80,000 interviewers spent 21 days with
questionnaires in all 11 official languages to count home-dwellers,
squatters and the homeless.
	   Providing the most authoritative figures on unemployment to
date, the survey showed that 33.9 percent of adults 15 to 65 years
old were out of work.
	   That figure contradicted the government's recent estimate of
about 22 percent.
	   Officials at Statistics South Africa said the 40.58 million
figure represented an upward revision of about 2.6 million over
preliminary estimates released last year, to adjust for
undercounting in rural areas.
	   The information will be used in government planning that
includes new housing and telephone hook-ups, water and electricity
for a vastly underprivileged majority.
	   The ethnic breakdown departed little from previous estimates,
which showed 77 percent were African, or black, followed by 11
percent white, 9 percent mixed-race and 3 percent Indian or Asian.
	   Zulu remained the dominant mother tongue, with 23 percent,
followed by Mandela's native tongue, Xhosa, with 18 percent.
	   But Afrikaans, the language spoken by the white apartheid
culture, has dropped from 16 percent estimated previously by
language experts to 14 percent, indicating a steady erosion since
1994's first all-race elections.
	   Nine percent said English was their first language.
	   Income disparity ranged from the low end of 500 rand (dlrs 88)
per month to the 25 percent earning 2,500 rand (dlrs 439) or more
per month.
	   One-third of white women and two-thirds of white men earned more
than 3,500 rand (dlrs 615). Only one in 20 black males or females
earned that much.
	   Only 45 percent had inside water taps and 58 percent had
electricity. Flush or chemical toilets were available to 99 percent
of whites but only 33 percent of blacks.
	   But pointing to accomplishments since the survey was taken,
Mandela said the country should be proud that 750,000 new
telephones had been installed. One million households were added to
the electricity grid and 1.8 million people gained access to clean
water.
	   The census also showed that 54 percent live in urban areas, with
18 percent of the total population living in traditional dwellings
and 17 percent in shacks.
	   Nineteen percent of South Africans older than 20 years never
attended school.
	   The Zulu stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal had the most people with
8.4 million, followed by Gauteng _ where Johannesburg and the
goldfields are located _ with 7.3 million; and Eastern Cape, along
the Indian Ocean, with 6.3 million.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's defense minister on Tuesday
described as ``positive'' the security talks between Turkish and

talks are continuing and have not reached a conclusion.''

Britain urges Bulgaria to clarify umbrella murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time element in lead to Tuesday; UPDATES with more
quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on
Tuesday urged Bulgarian officials to clarify circumstances of the
sensational 1978 umbrella murder of dissident Georgi Markov.
	   ``I have asked for a response to the request we have made for
access to the information on the investigation ... which was
carried out in 1991 and I have been assured that I will get a
response on that point,'' Cook said after separately meeting
President Petar Stoyanov and Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova.
	   After the meeting Stoyanov told journalists he had assured Cook
that this is a painful issue for all democrats in Bulgaria.
	   ``We don't want you to assume that the current government does
not want to assist the investigation, but communism is gone, taking
along some of its secrets. Part of them are those linked with
Georgi Markov's murder,'' Stoyanov told the British foreign
secretary.
	   Cook said there was no dispute with the current government on
the matter.
	   ``We have to be realistic on that matter and recognize that when
communists left rule, they did not leave behind a full and intact
set of files,'' he added. ``It may well be that in Gerogi Markov's
case as on many other cases that the files were removed by those
who saw power removed from them.''
	   Markov, a writer and journalist who left communist Bulgaria in
the early 1970s, worked for the Bulgarian language service of the
British Broadcasting Corp. Investigators said he was jabbed with
the poisoned tip of an umbrella.
	   The Markov case has never been solved, but British investigators
long have suspected Bulgarian agents.
	   Former KGB agent Oleg Kalugin has said that Bulgaria asked
Moscow for help in the assassination.
	   Bulgaria was the most loyal Soviet ally under decades of
communist rule. Post-communist leaders have vowed to clear the
Markov case in an effort to clean up Bulgaria's image.

Germany's incoming center-left government to sign coalition pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details on agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After the quickest negotiations in postwar
German history, the Social Democrats and Greens signed a coalition
pact Tuesday that paves the way for Germany's first center-left
government in 16 years.
	   The deal reached after just over two weeks of talks sets
fighting unemployment at the new government's top priority, along
with a tax reform that includes higher energy costs.
	   Bolstered by a clear election victory that gives the coalition a
21-seat majority in parliament, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder
declared a mandate for change, enshrined in the agreement that
shifts Germany's course to the left.
	   From a loosening of Germany's blood-based citizenship law to a
commitment to end the use of nuclear energy to repeals of welfare
state reforms, the program defines a markedly different Germany
than the one Helmut Kohl led for 16 years.
	   The new government also pledged to set up foundations to
compensate World War II slave laborers and ``forgotten victims'' of
the Nazis, a reversal of German policy.
	   Key members of Schroeder's new Cabinet include Greens leader and
former peace activist Joschka Fischer as foreign minister and Oskar
Lafontaine, leftist chairman of the Social Democrats, as head of a
beefed-up Finance Ministry.
	   The new government includes five female Cabinet members _ three
more than outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition.
Gunda Roestel, another Greens leader, called the pact ``good for
women.''
	   The deal still must be approved at special party conventions
this weekend before Schroeder can be sworn in on Oct. 27 _ exactly
one month after the election.
	   Not included in the government is the political outsider
Schroeder had wanted as his economics minister: Jost Stollmann.
	   The millionaire computer entrepreneur backed out Monday, saying
he was unhappy with plans to take European economic policy from his
office and give it to the Finance Ministry.
	   He also criticized the incoming government's left-leaning
agenda, saying it would result in higher tax burdens on small firms
and strayed from the business-friendly ``new center'' approach
Schroeder had campaigned on.
	   ``This country needs a policy of modernization and renewal,'' he
said. ``I hope that Schroeder will be able to push through his
ideas of the `new center' because that is the right kind of
policy.''
	   Schroeder played down Stollmann's complaints, saying that as
future chancellor, he had to take a bigger picture view of
government policy.
	   He also insisted Stollmann's departure did not mean he was
abandoning the political middle.
	   ``If the `new center' consisted of just one person, that'd be
underrating it,'' Schroeder said.

Festina team doctor to be released on bail

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French court decided on Tuesday to free
the jailed doctor of the Festina cycling team which became the
center of a doping scandal during the Tour de France.
	   Eric Ryckaert, a Belgian, is to be released on 100,000 francs
(dlrs 18,350) bail and remain under judicial surveillance. He has
been jailed since July 17.
	   Ryckaert has admitted the use of banned doping products at
Festina, though its star rider, Richard Virenque, continues to deny
that he knowingly took such substances.
	   Festina team director Bruno Roussel and masseur Willy Voet are
also under investigation.
	   The Festina scandal blew open days ahead of the Tour de France
when customs officials stopped Voet at the France-Belgium border.
His car contained more than 400 doping products, including the
performance-enhancing drug, EPO, which increases oxygen in red
blood cells.
	   Ryckaert is the last of the three Festina officials to be
released from detention.
	   Meanwhile, the daily Le Parisien reported that two retired
businessmen in Poitiers, southwest of Paris, have been questioned
for allegedly providing drugs to amateur cyclists in the
Poitou-Charentes region.
	   According to Le Parisien, which did not cite sources, the two
sold a powerful cocktail of amphetamines, cocaine, heroine,
morphine and other painkillers to cyclists seeking to enhance their
endurance.
	   The existence of the so-called ``Belgian cocktail'' was revealed
after a cyclist who had taken one suffered serious heart
palpitations and high fever during an amateur race last spring, Le
Parisien reported.
	   A police investigation showed that more than 30 racers had taken
``Belgian cocktails,'' the newspaper said.

Swiss authorities order confiscation of dlrs 114 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with further details from news conference. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has ordered the
confiscation of some dlrs 114 million in accounts belonging to the
brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the
country's federal prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   The brother, Raul Salinas de Gortari, is in prison in Mexico
pending completion of trials in Mexico in a political assassination
and on a charge of illegal enrichment during his brother's
administration.
	   Swiss Federal Prosecutor Carla del Ponte said the funds in the
accounts, of which Raul Salinas is a co-owner, came partly from
protection payoffs from drug traffickers.
	   Most of the money _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered confiscated is
in Swiss bank accounts frozen in 1995. But the office is also
requesting that Britain seize dlrs 24.5 million administered by a
Swiss-based financial institution in London.
	   Salinas has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the
money in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by
several wealthy friends.
	   Del Ponte's office countered that his business dealings ``are
for all practical purposes unsound and incomprehensible and
contrary to customary business usage.''
	   His lawyers have 10 days to appeal the Monday decision. That
would send the case to Switzerland's supreme court, but Del Ponte
said she was ``very confident'' it would uphold the seizure.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but
prosecutors said the findings of a 2 1/2 year investigation suggest
the money was laundered drug profits.
	   Del Ponte told a news conference Switzerland could not try
Salinas since he is imprisoned in Mexico. She also said a Swiss
criminal case was no longer necessary since Mexican authorities
have started their own proceedings against Salinas and others on
charges of money laundering and facilitating drug trafficking.
	   Prosecutors maintain that Salinas used his influence and
protected large-scale shipments through Mexico from Colombia to the
United States.
	   ``With all his contacts and his power, he could guarantee
protection for those loads,'' said Valentin Roschacher, who led the
Swiss investigation.
	   Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, following
agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs
could be transported through Mexico on certain routes, he added.
	   Many testified that he had received hundreds of million of
dollars in payoffs from Colombian and Mexican drug cartels between
1988 and 1994, when his brother was president, Roschacher said. Del
Ponte said the syndicates included Colombia's Medellin and Cali
cartels.
	   His contacts with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and
became more intense in the early 1990s, he continued.
	   Swiss authorities did not release the full police report into
Salinas. Both Del Ponte and Roschacher declined to say whether
investigations had shown Carlos Salinas to be involved with drug
money.
	   The former Mexican president, who moved to Ireland shortly after
leaving office, has been charged with no crime.
	   Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges
of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco
Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel
government post in his brother's administration.
	   No drug-related charges have been brought against Raul Salinas,
but he was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.

Sri Lankan business leaders want to help end Tamil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Frustrated with the separatist war
that is bogging down the economy, Sri Lanka's top entrepreneurs are
taking a lead to help find a solution to the 15-year-old
insurrection, a spokesman for the forum said Tuesday.
	   Top representatives from the Chambers of Commerce, Industries,
Employers Federations, Exporters Associations and private
businessmen will be meeting in Colombo Thursday with political
parties, to discuss how best the Tamil separatist issue can be
resolved, said Anusha David, who is coordinating the conference.
	   Embassies and non-governmental organizations have also been
invited to take part in the talks.
	   The meeting has been welcomed by the government.
	   ``It is a national issue that civil society cannot ignore. We
strongly support the initiative,'' said Constitutional Affairs
Minister Lakshman Peiris.
	   Among the business leaders taking part in the meeting are Ken
Balendra, a Tamil, who is chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of
Commerce and chief of Keels, Sri Lanka's best known supermarket
chain, and Deshamanya Lalith Kotewala, chairman of the Ceylinco
Group, a top trading house that runs banks and insurance companies.
Kotewala is a Sinhalese.
	   Sri Lanka's economy grew at an annual rate of around 5 percent
in the past five years. If the war were resolved, economists say it
could pick up to about 7 percent.
	   While the forum is unlikely to solve the ethnic conflict, it can
send a message that talks between rebels and the government is the
only way to end the protracted war.
	   Sri Lanka's top opposition party has urged the government to
unconditionally resume talks with the Tamil Tigers. President
Chandrika Kumaratunga has said she is ready for talks, but only if
the guerrillas first disarm. The Tigers have expressed no interest
in reviving the talks that broke down in 1995.
	   Sri Lanka's modern civil war was born of an ancient ethnic
conflict between the majority Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 76
percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people, and the largely Hindu
Tamils who are 18 percent of the population.
	   About 55,000 people have been killed since the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam led a Tamil insurrection for independence in 1983.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Communists and other opposition groups
walked out of Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday to protest the
government's failure to submit a 1999 draft budget and other
economic data.
	   Communist leader Petro Symonenko, who controls more than
one-quarter of seats in the 450-member Verkhovna Rada, making his
the largest faction, threatened to boycott future sessions.
	   Symonenko said the Communists want a clear answer from Cabinet
as to when it plans to present the budget and specific measures to
combat the country's economic crisis.
	   Several smaller leftist factions and the centrist opposition
Hromada movement joined the protest.
	   Symonenko said the government was violating the constitution by
failing to present the required information.
	   Parliamentary speaker Oleksander Tkachenko condemned the
walkout, saying it would do no good for either parliament or the
Communist party.
	   ``When it's necessary to work together, they don't want to,''
Tkachenko said of the Communists, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The government had promised to submit a revised 1999 draft
budget draft by last Thursday, after parliament rejected an earlier
version last month, saying Ukraine's financial crisis made the
document's figures unrealistic.
	   Lawmakers ordered the Cabinet to draft a new budget that takes
into account the fall of the hryvna currency and increased
inflation, which have struck Ukraine following the economic turmoil
in Russia.
	   Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Tuesday that his
Cabinet would submit its action plan and the revised budget draft
to parliament by the end of the week.
	   He also defended his government's policies, saying the Cabinet
was ``controlling the implementation of the budget and the level of
budget deficit and maintains control over the currency market.''
	   The Cabinet's anti-crisis measures have helped Ukraine avoid ``a
collapse of the financial and currency markets, prices and the
banking system and avoid consumer panic,'' Pustovoitenko said,
according to Interfax.
	   Meanwhile, Symonenko, the Communist leader, warned that
parliament might still reject the government's anti-crisis plan and
bring the Cabinet down.
	   A week ago, Symonenko's Communists and other opposition groups
failed to pass a vote of no-confidence in Pustovoitenko's
government over its handling of the economic crisis.

	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A bus carrying British holiday-makers
collided with a car early Tuesday near this Aegean port, killing at
least six people and injuring 35 others, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   The tourists were traveling to Izmir's airport from Kusadasi
resort to fly back to Britain.
	   Anatolia initially reported that the bus collided with a car at
2:20 a.m., killing all five passengers in the car and two Britons
on the bus. It later said five Turkish car passengers and one
British tourist were killed.
	   The British embassy and consulate in Izmir said they could only
confirm one death, that of a British woman.
	   The bus, carrying 38 tourists, a tour company, representative
and the driver when it collided head-on with a taxi, said Anita
McErlean, a spokeswoman for the British holiday company Airtours,
which hired the bus.
	   An embassy official said that four of the bus passengers were in
intensive care suffering from broken bones and internal injuries.
	   ``We have not heard of any life-threatening injuries,'' said Jon
Benjamin of the British embassy in Ankara.
	   A dozen injured had been released from hospital, he said.
	   Airtours was expected to repatriate them later Tuesday or
Wednesday.
	   Identities of the victims were not available.

Cook says West will oppose separatist aspirations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from news conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Western nations will continue opposing
the aspirations of ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo for full
independence from Yugoslavia, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Tuesday.
	   He said Britain is ``firmly committed to the territorial
integrity and security of the countries in this region.''
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters after
talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   ``The international community has never given its support to an
independent Kosovo. We believe that the way forward is for the
countries of the region to cooperate together to break down the
barriers between them rather than to try to create new
boundaries,'' Cook told a news conference.
	   He also said the people of Kosovo do not accept autonomy as a
sufficient statement of their aspirations and that it is the right
of the Kosovars to run their own affairs and to have control on
their own police.
	   ``That is why we have called for the self-government of
Kosovo,'' Cook said and added that there should be elections within
the next nine months and that those elections should be supervised
``not by Belgrade but by the OSCE.''
	   Cook arrived late Monday on the first stop on a Balkan tour
during which he is also scheduled to visit Romania and Macedonia.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Office said, Cook may meet leaders of
Kosovo Albanians.
	   On Monday, Cook said in London that Britain will continue
pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure he
complies with agreements made to end civilian deaths and fighting
in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during more
than seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. Some 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been displaced from their homes in the province,
which is predominantly ethnic Albanian.

German unions want to end extended work hours for banks, financial
</HEADLINE>
markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Four German unions on Tuesday demanded
the incoming center-left coalition government roll back laws that
extend working hours at banks and financial markets.
	   In a letter to Germany's incoming Social Democrat-led
government, which earlier in the day signed a coalition deal with
the smaller Greens party, the unions said extending opening hours
at banks and financial markets was ``sacrificing holidays to the
golden calf of profit.''
	   Reinhard Droenner, spokesman for banks at the German Employees
Union, said the law, introduced quietly in the spring by outgoing
chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition, could oblige
employees to work any day of the year except for Christmas and New
Year's Day.
	   The letter was also signed by unions representing transport and
public workers, postal employees and white-collar banking and
insurance employees.
	   Germany's outgoing chancellor Helmut Kohl regarded the
relaxation of Germany's tightly regulated work laws as a test of
German industry and competitiveness. Unions have consistently
opposed the changes, including extension of shopping hours on
weekday evenings and Saturdays.
	   Business leaders are watching carefully for signs the unions may
be able to exert more power over German politics with the country's
new, left-leaning government.

Castro says Pinochet's arrest risks making him political martyr

	   MERIDA, Spain (AP) _ Cuban leader Fidel Castro said that putting
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on trial _ without his
accomplices _ runs the risk of making him a political martyr.
	   The Cuban leader warned that the detention could destabilize
Chile by strengthening the right and splitting the left in the
South American nation.
	   The detention ``could convert Pinochet into a martyr for the
right and a cause of division among the progressive forces,''
Castro said at the ruins of a Roman amphitheater in the
southwestern city of Merida, during a visit to Spain.
	   ``From a moral point of view, it's just,'' said Castro. ``From a
judicial stance, it's questionable and from a political point of
view, it will create a complicated situation in Chile.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested Friday in London for questioning by a
Spanish magistrate probing human rights violations in Chile, where
more than 4,000 political opponents were believed killed during his
17-year rule. The judge is considering extraditing him to Spain for
trial.
	   Castro went to Merida on Monday after attending a weekend
Ibero-American summit in Oporto, Portugal. He planned to meet Prime
Minister Jose Aznar in Madrid before leaving Spain.
	   He urged the government to prosecute all of Pinochet's
accomplices, including the U.S. leaders who authorized a CIA
campaign to help overthrow his leftist predecessor, Salvador
Allende, in 1973.
	   ``It would be morally right that all those who participated in
the coup should suffer the same fate as Pinochet,'' Castro said.
``I won't include (former U.S. President Richard) Nixon because
he's already dead.''
	   Asked if he could suffer the same fate as Pinochet, the
72-year-old Castro replied: ``I'm not afraid to go anywhere.''

Serbian parliament passes restrictive media law

charges. Other details.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Serbian Parliament adopted
Tuesday a new information law which critics say further restricts
independent media and leads the country back to dictatorship.
	   The draft of the law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media and calls for huge fines against media
editors and owners who disobey the decree.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
report is against the law, and places further restrictions on
working permits for media organizations.
	   Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic, of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, claimed during the session that
the new media law is ``highly liberal.''
	   He explained that the envisaged huge fines - ranging from the
equivalent of dlrs 41,000 to 82,000 - ``must be an adequate
punishment for the possible harmful consequences'' of ``the
anti-state information'' or foreign ``psychological propaganda''
programs.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists said the law is highly
restrictive and again introduces censorship which was formally
abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s.
	   ``This law represents the basis for a permanent rule of the
black-red coalition,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former Serbian
information minister and a columnist of the recently banned Dnevni
Telegraf daily. He was referring to the Serbian ruling
ultra-nationalist, neo-Communist coalition.
	   ``The repressive law brings us back to the period of the
single-party Communist state,'' said lawyer Rajko Danilovic. ``It
represents the return to the monopoly on information.''
	   The government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
has used NATO threats of strikes on military targets in Serb-led
Yugoslavia to clamp down on its opponents. It has issued a series
of decrees tightening state control in the country.
	   One such decree imposed a ban on broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media -- such as the Voice of America, Radio
Free Europe and BBC -- and demanded ``patriotic'' reporting from
the Serbian independent media critical of Milosevic's policies.
	   Throughout the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have
accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or carrying
foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   Last week, the government shut down prominent Nasa Borba, Danas
and Dnevni Telegraf dailies, following eviction of the popular
Index radio from its premises. Since coming to power in 1987,
Milosevic has used virtual monopoly over electronic media to
consolidate his hard-line rule.
	   The bans have triggered a wave of domestic and international
protests but to no effect.
	   At the parliament session, ultra-nationalist leader Vojislav
Seselj listed several independent media editors as NATO's
``collaborators'' and ``traitors'' because of their meeting with
the alliance's Secretary General, Javier Solana, during his visit
to Belgrade last week.
	   Milos Vasic, the head of an independent media union, said he
will file slender charges against Seselj. ``We'll let him prove how
come we have not been arrested by Yugoslavia's secret service if we
really are NATO spies,'' Vasic told independent B-92 radio.
	   ``Solana didn't care about media freedom in Serbia when he was
deciding whether to bomb Serb women and children,'' Seselj said.
	   The secretary-general of Milosevic's Socialist party, Gorica
Gajevic, accused the foreign ``media industry of inventing news,''
and said ``this law will protect the freedom of media from its
abuse.'
	   She praised the state-run media for their ``highly professional,
ethical and objective informing which defends dignity and patriotic
morale'' of the Serbs.
	   Other leftist and ultra-nationalist deputies labeled the
independent media as ``subservient and vassal'' to the West.
	   Some 40 deputies of the Serbian Renewal Movement, former staunch
opponents of Milosevic, left the 250-seat Serbian parliament before
the vote in protest of the law. Out of the 179 deputies who
remained, 170 voted for the law, 5 were against while four
abstained.
	   Average monthly salary in Yugoslavia amounts to no more that
dlrs 100, and private owners of the fledgling independent media say
they would not be able to cope with the proposed fines.
	   ``I would simply have to close my paper,'' said Slavko Curuvija,
the owner and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf. ``The regime wants
to destroy independent media.''
	   He and other media owners indicated they would evade the Serbian
law by publishing in Montenegro, the small republic which with
Serbia forms Yugoslavia and is ruled by a pro-Western coalition.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Serbian Parliament met Tuesday
to adopt a new information law which critics say further restricts
independent media and leads the country back to communist-style
control of the news.

Roche asks doctors to monitor livers of Tasmar patients
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Pharmaceutical firm Roche Holding AG
confirmed Tuesday that it sent an advisory letter to doctors asking
them to report any liver troubles in patients taking the drug
Tasmar for Parkinson's disease.
	   ``Roche encourages health care professionals to report any new
case of adverse liver reactions or other adverse reactions'' to the
drug, the company wrote in the letter.
	   Six cases of Tasmar users suffering from probable hepatitis had
been reported and two of those died, the letter said. One was from
Switzerland and the other was from the United States.
	   Around 60,000 people have taken Tasmar. The letter said that
although the six patients were being treated with Tasmar, in some
of the cases there were other factors which could have caused or
contributed to the liver problems.
	   Roche say it is likely most cases of liver cell injury can be
prevented by attention to patient symptoms. The company has urged
doctors to perform frequent liver function tests on their Tasmar
patients.
	   Roche has insisted it will carry on with global sales of Tasmar
that began last year. Calling the drug a success in treating
Parkinson's, Roche said it will strengthen the labeling to stress
monitoring of liver enzymes in patients given the drug.
	   For 2003, the fifth year of global Tasmar marketing, the company
projects sales of between 300 million and 400 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 225/300 million).
	   Market analysts project total Roche sales of around 36 billion
francs (dlrs 27 billion) in that year.

Spanish judge seeks to boost case against Pinochet

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of judge's decision, prosecutor's action
to halt extradition process &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge pulled out of an
investigation of Augusto Pinochet on Tuesday in a bid to strengthen
a fellow judge's effort to have the former dictator extradited for
trial in Spain on charges of genocide and other crimes.
	   Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon said he has decided to abandon his
investigation into the killing and disappearance of up to 4,000
people in Chile during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   In a legal statement, Garcia Castellon said he would hand over
the evidence gathered in his probe to fellow National Court
magristrate Baltasar Garzon, whose international arrest order
prompted British police to detain Pinochet in his London hospital
bed Friday as he recovered from minor back surgery.
	   ``This will strengthen the extradition attempt judicially,
procedurally and materially,'' said Joan Garces, a private lawyer
who has worked closely with Garcia Castellon and Garzon.
	   Garzon's arrest order was issued with a view to extradicting the
82-year-old former strongman to Spain for trial on charges of
genocide, terrorism and torture. It is based on Pinochet's alleged
involvement in the killing or disappearance in Argentina of 94
people, mostly Chileans.
	   According to Garces, the order can now be broadened to include
the approximately 4,000 cases from Garcia Castellon's abandoned
probe. Garzon is awaiting authorization from Britain to travel to
London to question Pinochet.
	   Meanwhile, Garzon's arrest warrant and both of the
investigations that underpin it are being challenged by the
prosecutors who argue that Chile's murky past is none of Spain's
business.
	   ``We think that these crimes should be judged in the countries
where they took place, or in an international tribunal, but not
here,'' said Eduardo Fungarino, chief prosecutor at the National
Court.
	   Fungarino said he expected the court's plenary to meet next week
to decide whether Spanish judges were competent to probe human
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina.
	   If the plenary decides they are not, then Garzon's detention
order against Pinochet would have to be annulled and the question
of extradition would be redundant, Fungarino said.
	   The decision is likely to hang on how genocide is defined, as
this crime is specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code.
	   But for Fungarino, ``the elimination of the political opposition
has nothing to with genocide.'' He said genocide refers to ``an
ethnic or a religious group.''
	   Meanwhile, the split within the legal community has a political
parallel.
	   Left-leaning opposition parties support Garzon's bid to
extradite Pinochet to Spain and accuse Fungarino, who is a
political appointment, of being an apologist for Pinochet.
	   Under a European extradition convention, Garzon has 40 days to
formalize an extradition request and get it approved by the Spanish
government.
	   If the National Court plenary rules in favor of Fungarino and
says Garzon lacks jurisdiction, the government could avoid the
uncomfortable position of having to decide what to do about
Pinochet.
	   ``Perhaps the government will not have to say anything,'' Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Tuesday.
	   Aznar earlier qualified his promise to respect judicial
decisions with a call for caution in this delicate case that
threatens to damage relations with Chile.
	   In recent years key Spanish companies _ including major banks,
the communications company Telefonica and electricity company
Iberdrola _ invested heavily in Chile.

Russia seeks foreign cash, not chickens and pork
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with IMF delegation ariving, official
saying no more than 50 billion rubles would be printed. CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government said Tuesday it wants cash
from an International Monetary Fund delegation in town for talks on
a frozen loan package, not handouts of chicken or pork.
	   ``The question of sending humanitarian aid to Russia ... will
not be discussed'' with the IMF officials who arrived Tuesday, said
Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin.
	   ``The IMF is not a charity institution,'' he said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, and has said it is counting on disbursement of a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package negotiated before the latest economic
crisis erupted in mid-August.
	   The IMF has said it won't hand over any more money until it sees
the government's plan to cope with the crisis, and signs that it is
being implemented.
	   Russia is also suffering from one of the worst harvest in
decades. Coupled with a drop in imports caused by the crisis, that
has prompted the government to seek humanitarian aid from the
European Union and discuss grain sales with the United States.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said recently it was
necessary for the European Union to subsidize deliveries of chicken
and pork to prevent food shortages in Russia this winter and avert
social unrest.
	   The Russian government responded with a statement Monday
expressing gratitude and interest but reiterating its request for
new credits.
	   ``They offer pork and chicken instead of new loans,'' the
liberal daily Segodnya said in a front-page commentary on Tuesday.
``Food is a good thing, but Russian authorities expected to get
some money.''
	   The Kommersant business newspaper echoed that thought: ``A call
for humanitarian aid is merely a diplomatic way to soften the
refusal of loans.''
	   No serious food shortages are expected in Russia this winter,
although the government has set up a dlrs 600 million emergency
food reserve that could feed one-third of the population for two
weeks.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Tuesday the
government might print new money to pay its huge debts, but said
any boost in the money supply would be backed by an increase in
gold and foreign currency reserves.
	   Primakov insisted the amount would be ``very insignificant.''
Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit
department, said it would be not more than 50 billion rubles (dlrs
2.9 billion).
	   A return to the Soviet-era practice of paying bills by printing
new rubles would likely lead to high inflation.
	   Primakov said the government will pay all overdue wages to
government workers by the end of the year and to the military by
January. Pensioners will have to wait until the end of 1999 to
receive all their unpaid money.
	   Primakov blamed the economic policies of the previous government
for the current crisis and called for more state control over the
economy.
	   ``The state must assume regulatory functions and ensure order in
the country before real market relations take root,'' Primakov said
at a meeting with Russian industrialists.
	   He called for more government support to ailing Russian
industries and suggested cutting taxes to help them.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Tens of thousands of angry high school students
demanding major educational reform held marches Tuesday throughout
France, but their movement failed to build on huge protests last
week.
	   Some 4,500 police mounted a massive security operation in Paris,
seeking to deter the kind of violence that marred last Thursday's
protests. At least 40 youngsters were arrested in the capital.
	   Students were hoping to maintain the momentum after last
Thursday's marches by a half-million students in nearly 350 cities
and towns, but it appeared they had failed.
	   Radio reports said a quarter-million demonstrated nationwide _
half the size of last week's protest. Police said about 25,000
students marched in Paris _ far below the hoped-for 45,000
demonstrators.
	   In the capital, hooligans threw rocks and bottles at police, who
charged at them several times, spraying tear gas from aerosol cans
to keep order.
	   The students are frustrated by overcrowded classrooms, outmoded
equipment and buildings, and a heavy course load they claim doesn't
prepare them well for future employment.
	   Fearing for the worst after last week's violence, police
monitored the Paris march on televisions in the basement of police
headquarters. Shops, banks and other establishments along the march
route were shuttered up and cars removed.
	   Police checked identity papers as students came out of the
subway to join the protest.
	   LCI television reported 25 arrests in Nancy, in eastern France,
where some 4,000 people turned out.
	   About 10,000 students turned out in the Normandy town of Rennes,
an equal number in Bordeaux, 6,000 in Avignon and more than 6,000
in Lyon, according to police. In Aix-en-Provence, 2,500 youths
blocked the A8 highway.
	   ``No promises. Action,'' read a banner in Bordeaux. ``No
teachers, no future,'' read one Paris banner. ``High schools must
change,'' read another.
	   ``Our buildings are old, and our computers are terrible,'' said
Gwladys Dumot, 15, from suburban Yerre, south of Paris. ``We have
too many kids in our classes. All we want is to be able to study
properly.''
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, a former education minister, have promised to come up with
funds soon. But they have no quick remedy for the ailing education
system or for high youth unemployment _ a deep fear for many French
teen-agers.
	   The students were skeptical their demands would be satisfied.
	   ``I would be very surprised if the government can do anything,''
said Spresa Mamud, 15. ``It costs a lot of money. We won't see
anything, but we're fighting for those students who come after
us.''
	   Six weeks after the school year began, some students are still
without teachers. Many schools, especially in disadvantaged
working-class neighborhoods, badly need modernizing.
	   Polls show the students have widespread public backing, and some
teachers joined Tuesday's march to support their students.
	   ``I'm proud of them. They're trying to do something to improve
their lives,'' said Beatriz Gutiererez, a Spanish teacher. ``I want
to show I'm with them.''

Kohl honored by Poland with highest distinction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski awarded
outgoing German Chancellor Helmut Kohl his country's highest honor
Tuesday for his efforts to integrate Poland into the West.
	   Kohl was the first German to receive the award since World War
II.
	   ``You are a symbol for us of a new epoch in relations of Poles
and Germans,'' said Kwasniewski, awarding Kohl the White Eagle
Order.
	   On a one-day visit to Warsaw, Kohl pledged to continue his
support for Poland's integration with NATO and the European Union,
causes he championed while chancellor. He lost a bid for
re-election in September to Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.
	   ``This award is an impetus for me to continue working for
friendship and partnership between our nations,'' said Kohl. He
encouraged Poland to maintain the course of reform.
	   ``Let me say something from my experience. There is no future
without vision,'' Kohl said.
	   ``The European Union without Poland would be truncated,'' said
Kohl, adding it was ``unthinkable'' that the borders of the
European Union should end at the Oder and Neisse rivers, which form
a natural border between Germany and Poland.
	   Championed by Germany, Poland was among the first former Warsaw
Pact countries invited to join NATO and is on the short list for
early EU entry as well.
	   In 1991, Germany and Poland signed a landmark friendship treaty
aimed at burying long-standing enmity. Germany invaded Poland in
1939, signaling the start of World War II.
	   Kohl called for closer ties with Poland in his re-election
campaign, saying postwar Germany's success at converting its
western neighbor France from historic foe to close ally can and
should be repeated across the eastern border.
	   However, relations have been sometimes strained by calls from
conservatives within Kohl's camp for Poland to do more to meet
land-compensation demands from Germans forced out of Poland after
World War II.
	   Kohl also met with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, who has invited
Schroeder to visit Poland in early November.

Show goes on at troubled Apollo Theatre

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Angela Surauw had waited a lifetime for this
moment. There she was, belting out an R and B tune on stage at the
Apollo Theatre, hoping to be discovered just as James Brown was 50
years ago.
	   Young black talent searching for fame and fortune has been the
Apollo's bread and butter for years. In its heyday, the theater
showcased big names, from Billie Holiday to Bill Cosby.
	   But the state-owned theater in Harlem has hit hard times,
scrabbling even in New York City's economic boom. Its facade is
crumbling and its interior needs repair.
	   ``This is almost like taking a couple of stars out of the
American flag,'' Brown said in a telephone interview from Augusta,
Georgia. ``That's like tearing down the White House.''
	   Desegregation, bigger venues and an economic downturn on 125th
Street _ the once-great epicenter of Harlem _ sent the Apollo into
bankruptcy by the 1970s, and it has struggled ever since.
	   Even the limited success the theater found in the 1990s with
``Showtime at the Apollo,'' a nationally syndicated television
show, is endangered and the TV contract could be lost.
	   Many of its supporters say the Apollo is too small to attract
big acts and too far from other attractions to consistently draw
good crowds. New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco also contends
that sweetheart deals and dubious bookkeeping have cost the theater
up to dlrs 4 million.
	   ``It's a 1,400-seat theater that's used twice a week. There's
something wrong with that,'' Vacco said.
	   The theater opened for burlesque in 1914, then became a
vaudeville showcase and was named the Apollo in 1934. In the late
1930s and '40s, it drew the likes of Count Basie, Bessie Smith,
Sarah Vaughn and Nat King Cole.
	   But big acts soon began going to other theaters and in the 1970s
the Apollo closed, declaring bankruptcy. In 1982, it was granted
landmark status, barring developers from knocking it down. It
reopened briefly in the mid-1980s before closing again until 1992,
when the Apollo Theater Foundation took over.
	   It now runs two shows _ ``Showtime at the Apollo'' and ``Amateur
Night'' _ and rents out for gospel productions and religious
revivals.
	   The foundation kicked off a five-year campaign last year to
raise dlrs 30 million for renovations and the creation of a
preservation trust fund. Records show donations have fallen
woefully short.
	   State and city officials, meanwhile, have held up loans and
grants over questions about the use of state and federal aid.
	   At a recent ``Amateur Night,'' patrons said they believe the
theater's problems lie in its size and location, not in politics or
shady dealings.
	   ``I never hear about the shows here. I don't think they have a
big advertising budget,'' said first-time Apollo-goer Margaret
Tafuri, a 31-year-old music promoter from Brooklyn.
	   Another woman pointed across the street to a group of homeless
people. ``There are a lot of people who think it's unsafe. It's not
true, but that's what they think,'' she said, declining to give her
name.
	   None of the theater's problems fazed Ms. Surauw on a recent
``Amateur Night.'' As the music thumped, she closed her eyes, took
a breath and began belting out the ballad ``Lay Me Down.''
	   Seven hundred fans rose to their feet. She won the talent show.

Tunisia still backs Libya, urges end to U.N. air embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ As Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
convalesced in a Tunisian oasis after a hip injury, Tunisia on
Tuesday reaffirmed its support for Tripoli in an international
dispute over terror suspects.
	   Tunisia supports ``a peaceful, negotiated and honorable solution
to this affair,'' a government spokesman quoted President Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali as saying a day after Gadhafi arrived on a surprise
visit.
	   But the spokesman provided no comment from Gadhafi, who still
refuses to turn over two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Since 1992, Libya has struggled with U.N. Security Council
sanctions that ban direct flights to and from the country, aimed at
forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans.
	   Tunisia on Tuesday also reiterated its call to lift the embargo
that has isolated its oil-rich neighbor, the government spokesman
said on customary anonymity.
	   Ben Ali met Monday night with Gadhafi when the Libyan leader
began his first known trip abroad since officials said he injured
his hip while exercising in June. Officials have not said how long
Gadhafi was staying.
	   The two leaders, who met in the southern oasis of Tozeur, also
agreed on the need to revitalize cooperation within the Arab
Maghreb Union, a grouping of Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania
and Libya, the spokesman said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has agreed to suspend the sanctions
once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges
according to Scottish law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British
proposal.
	   Gadhafi has offered to hand them over but demands any sentences
be served in Dutch or Libyan prisons.

Ronaldo returns, but only for 45 minutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ronaldo is back, just in time to try to rescue
Inter Milan's faltering bid for Champions Cup glory on Wednesday.
	   But the Brazilian star warned Tuesday he may only play half of
the game against Spartak Moscow, the only team among the 24 with a
perfect record from two games.
	   Tendinitis in both knees has meant that the world's top player
has played in only one of Inter's five Serie A games. But even 45
minutes of Ronaldo is welcome after Saturday's 5-3 loss to Lazio
and with tough games against Spartak and Juventus to come.
	   ``I have recovered, and I'm ready to play,'' the Brazilian
striker said on the eve of the game at San Siro. ``For sure I'll
not play the entire match because I must be cautious.''
	   Inter beat Spartak twice in last season's UEFA Cup semifinal,
with Ronaldo scoring twice in the second leg. The Italian club
needs the Brazilian now but doesn't want to rush him into 90
minutes of knee-jarring action.
	   Ronaldo's fitness, both psychological and physical, has been in
doubt since his pre-World Cup final breakdown and his poor
performance in the 3-0 loss to France in Paris.
	   After his long absence, he knows he's in the spotlight once
again.
	   ``I hope my return to action is going to end all controversies
and allegations,'' said Ronaldo, who was barely noticed in the 2-0
Group C loss to Real Madrid in September.
	   With Roberto Baggio still sidelined, he likely will team up with
rising Italian Nicola Ventola, French forward Youri Djorkaeff, with
Chilean veteran Ivan Zamorano as substitute.
	   Yegor Titov, who scored Spartak's matchwinning goal in the 2-1
victory at Real Madrid, misses the game through suspension.
	   An Inter loss at halfway in the group stage of the championship
will virtually mean elimination for the Italian giant.
	   Spartak would then have nine points to Inter's three and
defending champion Real Madrid, having already beaten Inter, is a
hot favorite to beat last place and pointless Sturm Graz of Austria
to take its total to six.
	   Only the group winner is guaranteed a place in the quarterfinal
and Spartak isn't the only surprise leader after two rounds of
matches.
	   Olympiakos heads Group A ahead of Ajax on goal difference and
the two teams meet in Athens Wednesday with the Dutch team forced
to field several stars who are carrying injuries.
	   Twins Frank and Ronald de Boer, defenders Ole Tobiasen and
Sunday Oliseh, right winger Tijani Babangida and Ajax's all-time
top scorer in European competition, Jari Litmanen, face the Greeks
despite fitness problems.
	   Ajax coach Morten Olsen blamed the injury list on his players'
international duties last week, although Georgian internationals
Shota Arveladze and Georgi Kinkladze were able to test the form of
the Olympiakos stars in the Euro 2000 game against Greece.
	   Turkish club Galatasaray tops Group B with Italy's Juventus and
Norway's Rosenborg two points behind. The Turks go to Rosenborg
while Juve, with Alessandro Del Piero returning to form with two
Euro 2000 goals for Italy last week, needs a win at Athletic de
Bilbao to mount a stronger challenge after two drawn games so far.
	   After a tie at Manchester United and victory over Denmark's
Brondby, Barcelona heads Group D with four points and goes to last
place Bayern Munich, which has one.
	   Although trailing, Bayern is racing ahead in the German
Bundesliga under new coach Ottmar Hitzfeld with seven wins and a
tie. Like Inter, however, the German club daren't lose on
Wednesday.
	   ``If we don't win against Barcelona, that means we can write off
the Champions League,'' said Brazilian striker Giovane Elber.
	   Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, whose late
blunder cost his team a victory in a 2-2 tie Munich, hopes to
return from a stomach muscle injury to face his former club,
Brondby, which is second with three points.
	   England internationals David Beckham and Nicky Butt are
suspended as United tries to improve on two ties.
	   Top of Group E, Arsenal hosts last place Dynamo Kiev at Wembley
with coach Arsene Wenger wary of the Kiev strike partnership of
Andrei Shevchenko and Sergei Rebrov, who scored 11 goals between
them in last season's Champions Cup.
	   ``The fact that they have started this season so badly surprises
me but I still consider them a serious threat to our chances to our
chances of reaching the last eight,'' said the Gunners manager,
whose team has four points.
	   Second place Panathinaikos is a point behind and goes to French
champion Lens, which has two from two draws.
	   Though struggling in seventh place in the Bundesliga, 12 points
behind Bayern, Kaiserslautern tops Group F with four points from a
win and a tie and hasn't conceded a goal.
	   The German titlist crosses into the Netherlands to visit second
place PSV Eindhoven with Bobby Robson's Dutch team missing
virtually its entire first choice defense through injury or
suspension.
	   Benfica, back at the top of the Portuguese league after a spell
in the shadow of FC Porto, is behind PSV on goals scored with both
teams tied on three points and hopes for a win at winless HJK
Helsinki.
	   Veteran striker Joao Pinto, who scored twice in Portugal's 3-0
Euro 2000 qualifying victory at Slovakia Saturday, is doubtful with
a toe injury.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's first
door-to-door census showed how far the country must travel to
overcome the legacy of a divided past, President Nelson Mandela
said Tuesday.
	   Fewer than half its 40.58 million people have running water in
their homes and a quarter earn as little as 500 rand (dlrs 88) a
month, the report showed.
	   The results ``show a society in which the lines between rich and
poor were, with little qualification, the historical lines of a
racially divided society,'' Mandela said at the census release in
Pretoria.
	   The figures ended decades of guessing about South Africa's
population and represented another step in the transformation from
white-minority rule to democracy, which began with all-race
elections in 1994.
	   During apartheid rule, white officials too scared to survey
black townships flew over in helicopters and estimated the
population. Door-to-door surveys were conducted only in Afrikaans _
spoken by descendants of Dutch settlers _ and English.
	   But in 1996, more than 80,000 interviewers spent 21 days with
questionnaires in all 11 official languages to count home-dwellers,
squatters and the homeless.
	   Providing the most authoritative figures on unemployment to
date, the survey showed that 33.9 percent of adults 15 to 65 years
old were out of work.
	   That figure contradicted the government's recent estimate of
about 22 percent.
	   Officials at Statistics South Africa said the 40.58 million
figure represented an upward revision of about 2.6 million over
preliminary estimates released last year, to adjust for
undercounting in rural areas.
	   The information will be used in government planning that
includes new housing and telephone hook-ups, water and electricity
for a vastly underprivileged majority.
	   The ethnic breakdown departed little from previous estimates,
which showed 77 percent were African, or black, followed by 11
percent white, 9 percent mixed-race and 3 percent Indian or Asian.
	   Zulu remained the dominant mother tongue, with 23 percent,
followed by Mandela's native tongue, Xhosa, with 18 percent.
	   But Afrikaans, the language spoken by the white apartheid
culture, has dropped from 16 percent estimated previously by
language experts to 14 percent, indicating a steady erosion since
1994's first all-race elections.
	   Nine percent said English was their first language.
	   Income disparity ranged from the low end of 500 rand (dlrs 88)
per month to the 25 percent earning 2,500 rand (dlrs 439) or more
per month.
	   One-third of white women and two-thirds of white men earned more
than 3,500 rand (dlrs 615). Only one in 20 black males or females
earned that much.
	   Only 45 percent of all households had inside water taps and 58
percent had electricity. Flush or chemical toilets were available
to 99 percent of white households but only 33 percent of their
black counterparts.
	   But pointing to accomplishments since the survey was taken,
Mandela said the country should be proud that 750,000 new
telephones had been installed. One million households were added to
the electricity grid and 1.8 million people gained access to clean
water.
	   The census also showed that 54 percent live in urban areas, with
18 percent of the total population living in traditional dwellings
and 17 percent in shacks.
	   Nineteen percent of South Africans older than 20 years never
attended school.
	   The Zulu stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal had the most people with
8.4 million, followed by Gauteng _ where Johannesburg and the
goldfields are located _ with 7.3 million; and Eastern Cape, along
the Indian Ocean, with 6.3 million.

Turkey calls talks with Syria positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with premier saying rebel leader in hiding in Moscow &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's defense minister on Tuesday
described as ``positive'' the security talks between Turkish and
Syrian officials but indicated he wanted to see a crackdown by
Damascus on Kurdish rebels.
	   Officials from both countries met for a second day Tuesday to
address Ankara's claims that Syria was sheltering rebels.
	   The foreign ministry said early Tuesday evening that ``security
talks are continuing and have not reached a conclusion.''
	   It said Foreign Minister Ismail Cem would hold a meeting tonight
with other officials ``to assess the direction the meetings were
taking.''
	   Turkey called the talks the last chance for a peaceful solution
to the crisis.
	   ``There are some very positive results. These results will be
put on paper,'' Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told reporters. ``But
this is not enough. Care must be taken in the application of the
results.''
	   ``We have to verify that our Syrian friends and neighbors are
acting in line with the agreement they have made,'' he added.
	   Just what might have been agreed upon wasn't immediately
revealed.
	   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said Turkey wanted a way
to verify if Syria had halted alleged support for the rebels.
	   Relations between the two neighbors deteriorated sharply in
recent weeks after Turkey suggested it might take military action
against Syria if it failed to end alleged support to the rebels
which launch cross-border attacks on Turkey.
	   Despite Sezgin's remarks, Ankara moved several tanks and armored
personnel carriers to the Turkish-Syrian border in preparation for
exercises planned for the first week of November, private NTV news
channel reported Tuesday.
	   The exercises are seen as Turkey's display of military prowess
in a sharp warning to Syria. Turkey boast the second largest armed
forces within NATO after the United States.
	   Fears of a regional conflict have led to various mediation
attempts by Egypt and Iran.
	   Officials tried to keep the venue for the security talks secret,
but Turkish media reported the meetings were held in the southern
town of Seyhan, some 550 kilometers (344 miles) south of Ankara.
	   Turkish officials were looking for proof that Syria was closing
down alleged Kurdish rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon.
	   Another accusation Turkey directed against Syria was that it was
harboring rebel Kurd leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   However, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Tuesday that Ocalan
has been hiding out for the last few days in a Moscow suburb and
that Turkey had requested extradition form Russia.
	   Analysts believe that Turkey may resort to pinpoint attacks on
rebel targets in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon if the security
talks fail.
	   ``We have made the necessary steps,'' Yilmaz told reporters
without elaborating.
	   Close to 37,000 people have died since 1984 when the rebels
launched a war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast.

Guinea-Bissau's fighting spreads to interior, capital calms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau government troops clashed
Tuesday with rebels in the interior of the west African nation,
raising the prospect of a return to civil war, Portuguese officials
said.
	   A 13-week truce was in effect until Sunday, when army dissidents
led by Brig. Ansumane Mane and soldiers clashed near the
presidential palace in the coastal capital, Bissau.
	   On Tuesday, rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo
Vieira exchanged mortar fire in the second-largest city Bafata and
in Bambadinca, both about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bissau,
a spokesman for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said.
	   Clashes were also reported in Quebu, near the former Portuguese
colony's southern border with Guinea.
	   ``Our concern is that the fighting is spreading to the
interior,'' Vasco Colares Pereira said. He added that the extent of
the clashes was unclear.
	   Meanwhile, fighting in the capital subsided.
	   An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to
be identified, said there was sporadic fire in the capital during
the night, but everything was calm as morning broke.
	   Neighboring Senegal and Guinea deployed troops to help Vieira
contain Mane's rebels, but it was not clear whether they were
involved in the latest fighting.
	   Fighting erupted June 7 in this country of 1 million, when a
rebel military faction seized Bissau's main army garrison and
airport, demanding that Vieira step down for alleged corruption.
	   Hundreds of residents gathered Tuesday at Bissau's port, looking
to leave the battered capital for the Bissagos islands, some 50
kilometers (30 miles) off its western coast, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Others were fleeing inland, according to Lusa, adding to some
300,000 already displaced by the conflict that began in early June.
	   A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross
said it was organizing local volunteers to provide first aid and
transport the wounded to hospitals.
	   ``We don't know exactly how many refugees there are, because
it's hard to distinguish between newly and formerly displaced
people,'' Michael Kleiner said by phone from Geneva, where the ICRC
is based.
	   The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, or CPLP, which
brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday urged both sides to
restrain their forces, Lusa said.
	   The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner _ the Economic
Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently resume a joint
mediation effort'', Lusa reported.

Striking personnel close National Library
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On a day when striking high school students marched
through Paris, the capital's National Library was forced to close
because of striking workers fed up with glitches in the high-tech
computer system.
	   Two years after it opened on the banks of the Seine river, the
dlrs 1.7 billion library is struggling to iron out problems in the
state-of-the-art electronic system that lets people into reading
rooms, and regulates the delivery of books.
	   Readers gain access to reading rooms with personalized library
cards containing computer chips, but the library's electronic
turnstiles haven't been able to read them.
	   The new library, named for the late President Francois
Mitterrand, is expected to house 10 million volumes when transfers
are completed from the old national library.
	   A library spokeswoman didn't know whether the library would
reopen Wednesday.
	   Library workers were quoted as telling Le Monde they were ``sick
of getting yelled at by angry readers'' who weren't getting the
books they ordered.
	   The electronic system is supposed to ferry books from the stacks
to readers in about 15 minutes.
	   Daniel Renoult, the library's chief computer engineer, said he
never expected the system to be problem-free.
	   ``We knew there would glitches and the only way to solve them
was to get the system going,'' he told Le Monde.

Viagra press pack for Portugal holds some surprises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NOTE that D and E Shandwick uses ampersand in 3rd and 4th
grafs

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The press kit marking the launch in
Portugal of the anti-impotency drug Viagra didn't contain any of
the famous blue pills but it did have a few surprises: a miniature
bottle of rum, an anti-stress ball and a cigarette.
	   The boxed and sealed package was delivered by hand in personally
addressed packages with the Pfizer logo to male and female members
of news organizations.
	   D and E Shandwick, the Portuguese marketing company hired by
Pfizer Inc, the company that produces the drug, said Tuesday the
unusual marketing strategy was used only in Portugal.
	   ``It was our idea, approved in conjunction with Pfizer,'' D and
E Shandwick spokeswoman Joana Santos said.
	   She said the company did not intend to give the impression that
it recommended smoking or drinking.
	   ``The aim was to give examples of two everyday objects which
cause the stress that can lead to the need for Viagra,'' Santos
said by telephone.
	   Officials at Pfizer Portugal were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Viagra is to go on sale at Portuguese pharmacies Wednesday. Each
pill will cost about 1,920 escudos (dlrs 11).
	   Under rules issued by the National Institute for Pharmacy and
Medicines, the government's drug watchdog body, Viagra can be sold
only with a doctor's prescription.
	   Prescriptions may only be supplied to patients over 18 who have
undergone a medical exam.
	   The state will not subsidize the drug through government health
programs.
	   Health officials estimate that 500,000 Portuguese men suffer
from erectile dysfunction. The country has a population of almost
10 million.
	   The European Union, of which Portugal is a member, gave the
green light for Viagra on Sept. 15.

Two Milosevic allies voted new Serbian government ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's media magnate and another
ally of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic were voted as new
government ministers at a parliament session Tuesday.
	   Bogoljub Karic, the media business magnate _ considered by many
to be the richest man in the country _ was voted into the office as
a minister without portfolio. Socialist Zeljko Simic was voted
Serbia's new culture minister.
	   Karic and Simic replace two other officials - Milan Beko and
Nada Popovic-Perisic _ who were given new postings within the
state.
	   The 44-year-old Karic, a self-made businessman from the southern
Kosovo province, enjoyed close ties with Milosevic on his road to
success and prosperous deals in Serbia and abroad, mostly in
Russia.
	   Karic briefly fell out of his patron's favors in winter 1996-97
when his private television station, BK TV, broadcast extensively
from street protests against Milosevic's autocratic regime and an
election fraud.
	   Soon after, Karic switched back to the pro-Milosevic side and
was again accepted into Milosevic's closest circle.

Police seek American suspected of infecting Swedes with HIV

identity, arrest ordered by Stockholm court. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police on Tuesday hunted for an
American man suspected of infecting women with HIV after picking
them up in Stockholm nightspots.
	   The search was the top story on national radio news and in
afternoon newspapers, prompting calls from about 100 women to
authorities, Ulla Andersson, an assistant in the investigation,
told The Associated Press.
	   Andersson identified the man as James Patric Kimball, 40, but
said she did not know where he was from in the United States. She
said he had been living in Sweden since 1992.
	   A Stockholm court on Tuesday ordered him taken into custody on
suspicion of rape and assault.
	   He came to police attention two weeks ago after a woman said she
had gone home with him and was given what she believed to be a
drug-laced drink. Under police questioning, the man said he was
HIV-positive, according to newspaper reports.
	   Prosecutors said they did not have sufficient evidence to hold
him in custody at the time. But a subsequent investigation turned
up an address book in which the man reportedly had listed the names
of 190 women, with marks indicating he had sexual intercourse with
at least 16 of them.
	   Police are now trying to contact all of the women listed in the
address book.
	   The man reportedly met many women in bars and told them he was a
party-arranger.
	   In Finland last year, former New York resident Stephen Thomas, a
rap singer and nightclub doorman, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison on 17 counts of attempted manslaughter for having
unprotected sex with women without telling them he was
HIV-positive.

Swiss authorities order confiscation of dlrs 114 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs with further details. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ After a 2 1/2-year investigation into
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
Switzerland's federal prosecutor said Tuesday she has ordered the
confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts in Switzerland and
Britain.
	   Carla del Ponte said the investigation had concluded that funds
in the accounts, of which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner, came
partly from protection payoffs.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of trials
in Mexico in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment during his brother's 1988-1994 administration.
	   The Swiss have been investigating whether Raul Salinas helped
launder drug money during that period.
	   The investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and Cali
drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas at
least dlrs 500 million over 10 years in protection money for drug
shipments through Mexico, Valentin Roschacher, the chief of
Switzerland's anti-narcotics police, told a news conference.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but said
their findings ``inevitably suggest money laundering'' of drug
profits.
	   Del Ponte said Switzerland couldn't itself try Salinas as he is
imprisoned in Mexico. Mexican proceedings against Salinas and
others on money laundering charges made a Swiss criminal case
unnecessary, she added.
	   Most of the money seized _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered
confiscated is in Swiss bank accounts. But a further dlrs 24.5
million is in London, administered by a Swiss-based financial
institution.
	   Salinas' lawyers can appeal the decision, taken Monday, within
ten days. That would send the case to Switzerland's supreme court,
but Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' it would uphold the
seizure.
	   Both Del Ponte and Roschacher declined to say whether
investigations had shown Carlos Salinas to be involved with drug
money.
	   Denying links to drug traffickers, Raul Salinas has said the
money in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by
several wealthy friends.
	   But Del Ponte said ``the business dealings he claims are beyond
all economic logic.''
	   The investigation concluded Raul Salinas ``had close personal
and business relationships both with Colombian and Mexican drug
dealers and with Mexican justice and administration officials,''
Roschacher said.
	   Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, after
agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs
destined for the United States could be transported through Mexico
on certain routes.
	   ``With all his contacts and his power, he could guarantee
protection for those loads,'' Roschacher added. Salinas' contacts
with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and became more intense
under his brother's presidency in the early 1990s, he continued.
	   Seven countries including Mexico and the United States
collaborated with the Swiss inquiry. Six U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration analysts helped with the investigation in Bern at
various points, Roschacher said.
	   The investigators interviewed 78 witnesses, 31 of them bank
employees, and 16 of them had to testify anonymously for their own
safety, Roschacher said. Raul Salinas himself was questioned four
times.
	   A number of witnesses have been killed in Mexico in the course
of the investigation, he added.
	   Swiss authorities did not release the full 230-page police
report into Salinas.
	   Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995. Some dlrs
7.8 million have since been unblocked as the money was proved
unlinked to drugs or protection payments, Del Ponte said.
	   Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges
of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco
Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel
government post in his brother's administration.
	   No specifically drug-related charges have been brought against
Raul Salinas and he was acquitted of money laundering on a
technicality.
	   His brother, who moved to Ireland shortly after leaving office,
has been charged with no crime.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The roof is up, the cast for its splashy
performances is being auditioned and the big marketing push has
begun.
	   Like a giant insect, 758 million pound (dlrs 1.2 billion)
Millennium Dome rises next to the River Thames _ and with it the
government's hopes of showing that Britain is a happening place as
the third millennium strikes.
	   The idea for the world's largest dome was born in 1993, when
U.S. television networks began calling the Old Royal Observatory to
book locations astride the Greenwich Meridian, marker of longitude
zero degrees, for millennium broadcasts.
	   Skeptics initially ridiculed the idea of a millennium
spectacular, complete with permanent wide-ranging exhibits and
multimedia spectaculars on the theme of time, saying it was
unworkable.
	   But Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, the Dome's guru, insists
Britain is the only country that has shown the ambition and
boldness to create what he dubs ``the most famous building offered
to the world in the year 2000.''
	   While construction in southeast London is on schedule, a third
of the necessary sponsorship is still missing. Some exhibits had to
be redesigned. And critics doubt that the dome, tucked onto an
isolated finger of industrial land, will have the transportation
links to cope with a huge influx of visitors in the year 2000.
	   Work on a subway link has been delayed and will be finished only
just in time.
	   ``I am deep in disbelief that they can get 12 million people
down to Greenwich in a year'' as the English Tourist Board
predicts, historian Sir Roy Strong said recently.
	   Twice as big as the current record-holder, Atlanta's Georgia
Dome, the Millennium Dome covers 20 acres (eight hectares), has a
circumference of two-thirds of a mile (one kilometer) and is 165
feet (50 meters) high. Forty-four miles (70 kilometers) of cabling
support the Teflon-coated glass fiber roof.
	   Designed by British architect Sir Richard Rogers, it can
accommodate up to 37,000 people.
	   In the center stands a vast 12,500-seat arena, surrounded by 14
lifestyle zones that use hands-on technology to explore themes
including national identity, the mind, the spirit, rest, global,
play and work.
	   In the body zone, visitors will walk around inside a giant human
figure bigger than the Statue of Liberty. Rest will take the form
of a giant dreamscape with floating 16-seater boats designed to
look like beds.
	   The multi-faith spirit zone, which has had to be scaled down
because it was too heavy for its foundations, will include a
Christian monastic cloister and a Japanese Zen garden.
	   Britain's national lottery is providing 400 million pounds (dlrs
680 million); the rest will come from private sponsorship and
ticket sales, merchandising and media rights.
	   Many tour companies and local businesses can't wait for it to
open. Still, realtors say other locals are leaving, fearing traffic
jams and increased pollution. And environmentalists complain that
dome-inspired development is destroying rare bird habitats.
	   The government insists the dome will recycle wherever possible.
Cars will be limited to distant park-and-ride sites, and most
visitors will arrive by boat, train or the new subway extension.
	   ``Initially, I was skeptical _ it is costing a lot,'' said Jill
Vonberg from Stowmarket, eastern England, who toured Greenwich's
millennium visitor center recently for a preview.
	   ``Now,'' she said, ``I think it will be something to leave to
our children.''

Defector says Odai Hussein operates 50 vessels to smuggle oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's oldest son, Odai, operates
a fleet of 50 vessels to smuggle oil through Iran in defiance of
U.N. sanctions, a former aide to Odai was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   The vessels carry up to 10,000 tons of oil products, which are
eventually sold in the Gulf, Abbas al-Janabi, a former personal
secretary of Odai, was quoted as saying by the respected Al-Hayat
newspaper.
	   Al-Janabi said in an interview that Odai Hussein owns another
fleet of road tankers to smuggle fuel and oil to Turkey, the
London-based Arabic daily reported. The oil business earns Odai
hundreds of million of dollars, it quoted him as saying.
	   Al-Hayat did not say if al-Janabi provided any evidence to back
his claim, which adds to a plethora of similar reports of thriving
illegal oil trade from Iraq.
	   In May, the U.S. undersecretary of state, Thomas Pickering, said
Iraq sells more than 200,000 barrels of oil illegally each day.
	   Iranian and Turkish officials were not immediately available for
a comment.
	   Al-Janabi defected to the West last spring and lives in hiding
in Europe, fearing retribution by Iraqi authorities. Al-Hayat said
the interview was conducted in a European country.
	   Iraq is barred from freely selling oil. It can only export
limited quantities under U.N. supervision, and use the money to buy
food and humanitarian goods as an exception to the economic
sanctions imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Janabi did not say how the smuggling is done. But it is
believed that the vessels, sailing close to the shore, stop first
at Iranian ports where they obtain certification to show that the
oil is Iranian. This allows them to openly evade U.S.-led
multinational naval patrols hunting for Iraqi smugglers.
	   Al-Janabi said Odai is the prime beneficiary of the black
economy spawned by the sanctions, controlling the trade in whisky,
cigarettes, fuel oil and urea fertilizers.
	   Odai ``possesses a trade empire that extends to Turkey, Iran,
Jordan and Lebanon ... with a Paris-based coordination office,''
al-Janabi said.
	   He said Odai confiscated food and medical relief aid sent by the
United Arab Emirates and stored it in the warehouses of the
Olympics Committee which he heads.
	   The goods are being sold in Baghdad with labels identifying them
as UAE relief aid, he said.
	   Al-Janabi, 50, worked for the Iraqi national news agency and was
later appointed editor of Odai's daily newspaper, Babel. Odai, 34,
has no government post but is believed to be his father's political
heir.
	   Al-Hayat published another portion of the interview with
al-Janabi on Monday in which he said Odai stole more than 160 cars
and several boats as well as gold, jewelry and carpets from Kuwait
during Iraq's seven-month occupation of the emirate.

Taliban again seeking seat at UN, but decision appears unfavorable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Taliban have launched another effort
to try to win Afghanistan's U.N. seat away from President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, meeting with key U.N. ambassadors to stress
the importance of recognizing the group that controls most of
Afghanistan.
	   The U.N. committee that determines who gets to represent
Afghanistan at the United Nations for the next year was meeting
later Tuesday.
	   The Taliban have indicated they expect the seat will again be
given to Rabanni's representative, but they have nevertheless
intensified their efforts to gain the seat and the international
recognition it confers.
	   The Taliban tried and failed to win the seat last year. They
have since taken over the bulk of Afghanistan, leaving the Rabbani
government and its allies with about 10 percent of the country.
	   The Taliban's envoy, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, has been making the
rounds of the countries on the so-called credentials committee and
lobbying for the Taliban cause.
	   He outlined the Taliban position in a 10-page document that
lists the reasons why the Taliban should be recognized as the true
government of Afghanistan and explaining their position on human
rights, women's rights, drug proliferation and tensions with Iran
and other neighboring countries.
	   ``The time has come to give Afghanistan what the world owes it,
a chance to build on what works well for Afghans,'' he wrote.
	   ``Recognition of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan has no ill
consequences to any nation and will be great and good step for the
fiercely independent people of Afghanistan.''
	   The Taliban militia has imposed a strict brand of Islam that
bars women from work and girls from school in the 90 percent of
Afghanistan it has conquered. Taliban soldiers ousted Rabbani from
the capital Kabul in 1996 and are still fighting the opposition for
the remainder.
	   Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the only
countries that have recognized the Taliban militia as the
legitimate government in war-wracked Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia,
though, announced last month that it was expelling the Afghan
charge d'affaires and recalling its representative from Kabul.
	   The United Nations has had to deal directly with the Taliban
over humanitarian issues and efforts to gain peace in the central
Asian nation. But it too, has refused to recognize the militia as
the legitimate leadership.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt and Turkey signed an agreement on
Tuesday to increase trade and boost business and investment between
the two countries, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The agreement was signed by Supply Minister Ahmed Guweili and
Yavuz Ege, Turkey's undersecretary for foreign trade.
	   In addition to increasing trade, the two sides want to see
greater participation in promotional fairs and more exchange visits
by businessmen, Guweili said.
	   Ege said Turkey was eager to double its trade with Egypt, adding
that ``we are seeking to sign a free trade agreement'' with Cairo,
MENA said.
	   Trade between the two countries was valued at dlrs 750 million
last year, compared with dlrs 550 million a year earlier and is
expected to reach dlrs 1 billion within ``a short period,'' Ege
said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron last
month, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.

FBI team lays ground for possible extradition of terror suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An FBI team began a new round of investigation
Tuesday to see if there is enough evidence to extradite suspects
involved in the killing and wounding of Americans in terrorist
attacks.
	   The seven-member U.S. delegation, expected to stay until next
week, met Tuesday with the Israeli police investigative unit and
with prosecutors in the Israeli Justice Ministry, according to
police and Justice Ministry officials.
	   An Israeli police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the FBI team was laying the ground work for possible
extradition requests by lining up evidence and witnesses. The
suspects, however, are in areas controlled by Yasser Arafat's
self-rule government.
	   A Justice Ministry document obtained by The Associated Press
listed Palestinian suspects involved in a dozen bombing and
shooting attacks in the area in which 11 U.S. citizens were killed
and four others wounded.
	   The document said a U.S. delegation headed by Mark Richard,
deputy assistant attorney general, was given charge sheets,
synopses of crime scene reports and police statements during a
similar visit in March.
	   Israel has demanded the extradition of 36 Palestinians for trial
in Israel, but Palestinian officials refuse as a matter of
principle to give suspects to Israel.
	   Nine of the Palestinians involved in attacks on Americans are on
the list of 36 sought by Israel. If Palestinians would accept trial
in the United States instead of Israel, the overlap could provide
an avenue of possible compromise to resolve a key security issue
that is on the table at the Mideast summit at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland.
	   Some suspects have been sentenced by Palestinian courts after
quickie trials. But Israeli officials complain that, in reality,
the suspects serve only token sentences or are allowed to go free.
They say some have even been inducted into the Palestinian police.
	   Joyce Boim, whose 17-year-old son David was the victim of a
shooting attack near the West Bank settlement of Beit El on May 13,
1996, said she was trying to meet with the FBI delegation to press
her case for the extradition of Amjad Hinawi, involved in the
shooting of her son.
	   ``I will not rest until he and others are in custody, either
here in Israel or in the United States. Where there is a will,
there's a way,'' said Mrs. Boim, formerly of Manhattan.
	   Hinawi, who testified he drove the car involved in the drive-by
shooting at a bus stop, was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor by
a Palestinian court on Feb. 14.
	   Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security in
the West Bank, said he was unaware of the presence of any FBI team
and that the Palestinians had no extradition agreement with the
United States.
	   American officials were known to be concerned that premature
leaks about the investigation could prevent potential witnesses
from cooperating with FBI agents.
	   Asked about the presence of FBI agents, a U.S. embassy spokesman
said the U.S. government did not comment on ongoing criminal
investigations ``especially at this sensitive time.''

Police break up protest for ex-judge arrested in reporter's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a hail of stones, Haiti's
provincial police broke up a protest demanding the release of a
former judge arrested in the 1982 torture-murder of a journalist,
an official said Tuesday.
	   Monday's demonstration in coastal Port-de-Paix, about 155 miles
(260 kilometers) north of the capital, turned violent when
activists infiltrated a peaceful student-teacher demonstration and
stoned the police, said Simon Jean Wisly, a provincial
representative of the central government.
	   He said police retaliated with their batons and arrested several
demonstrators briefly. Wisly could not confirm a private Radio
Haiti-Inter report that at least 10 police and civilians were
injured.
	   About 400 students and teachers were demanding the release of
Luckner Pierre, a former judge and teacher who had been arrested
Friday for alleged complicity in the death of journalist Richard
Brisson.
	   Pierre was the investigating judge in the case of Brisson, who
was tortured to death at Port-de-Paix army barracks after
participating in a failed guerrilla attempt to overthrow dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier.
	   It was the second time police had detained Pierre this year. He
was first arrested Feb. 2, an hour after he was fired, but was
released the same day. There was no explanation for his release,
nor for the decision to rearrest him.
	   In 1996, Pierre was accused of having obstructed the
investigation into the July 1987 massacre of more than 100 peasants
in the outskirts of Jean Rabel, in northwestern Haiti.
	   Brisson worked for Radio Haiti-Inter until November 1981, when
Duvalier clamped down on free speech and the station stopped
broadcasting. It reopened after a 1986 popular uprising forced
Duvalier into exile.

Ukraine's National Bank comes under security service's attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian parliament appointed a
commission Tuesday to investigate the central bank's activities,
after Ukraine's Security Service accused it of risky and illegal
operations.
	   The National Bank deposited dlrs 75 million from its foreign
currency reserves in the Cyprus-registered Credit Suisse First
Boston Ltd. bank, deputy service chairman Oleksandr Belyaev told
parliament.
	   Belyaev said this deposit and other operations involving more
than dlrs 600 million were made despite the Cypriot bank's
responsibility being limited to its dlrs 1 million base capital.
	   Belyaev's remarks, citing intelligence information collected in
Ukraine, were carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   The Security Service ``has no doubts about the professionalism
of National Bank leaders ... Everyone can make mistakes,'' Belyaev
said. But he called on parliament to check all National Bank
operations involving its currency reserves and government bonds.
	   National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko denied the allegations,
saying the Cypriot bank was a subsidiary of the respected Credit
Suisse First Boston bank, part of the Credit Suisse Group, one of
the world's largest financial networks.
	   In London, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse First Boston
confirmed that the bank had a subsidiary in Cyprus, but refused to
discuss its operations.
	   Yushchenko told lawmakers that his bank deposited dlrs 166
million with Credit Suisse, which offered a 6 percent annual
interest, higher than the 5.5 percent market rate.
	   Yushchenko said Monday the bank was preparing for an audit and
would be conducting quarterly checks ``to show everything to the
International Monetary Fund and interested investors.''
	   Still, parliament voted 180-117 to set up a commission of
inquiry into the National Bank's activities.
	   Tuesday's attack was not the first against Yushchenko, who has
been facing criticism both from parliament and President Leonid
Kuchma.
	   The dominant leftist and centrist opposition is unhappy about
Yushchenko's policies, and some want Kuchma to fire him.
	   Kuchma, who has criticized Yushchenko for spending too much of
the bank's currency reserves to defend Ukraine's hryvna, has
refrained from such comments recently.
	   The bank's reserves, replenished through a recent IMF loan,
stand at about dlrs 1 billion, down from dlrs 2.3 billion at the
start of the year.
	   Yushchenko said the National Bank spent dlrs 3 billion so far in
1998, but that more than 85 percent of the sum went to service
Ukraine's huge foreign and domestic debts.

Government rejects guerrilla claim that army set deadly pipeline
</HEADLINE>
fire &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's defense minister on Tuesday
angrily rejected a suggestion by leftist rebels that the army set
off a weekend fire which killed 47 people in a rural hamlet.
	   ``They are trying to confuse the people with lies,'' Defense
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said in a radio interview Tuesday.
	   The guerrillas issued a statement late Monday admitting they had
dynamited a pipeline early Sunday outside Machuca, the town in
Antioquia state devastated by Sunday's conflagration.
	   But rebels of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN,
said the fire that consumed the village began more than an hour
later and may have been intentionally set by soldiers deployed in
the area.
	   The guerrilla version was ridiculed by Lloreda, who insisted the
bombing was sufficient to cause the deadly fireball.
	   ``The information from the oil company and the technicians is
that it was an an extremely volatile type of oil, and that the fire
started as a result of the explosion,'' he said.
	   Survivors have said the blaze that roared through Machuca
occurred just moments after the pipeline eruption.
	   The armed forces commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, said the only
soldiers in the area were rescue troops who arrived hours after the
fire.
	   There was no immediate comment from President Andres Pastrana,
who plans to begin peace talks Nov. 7 with the country's largest
rebel faction, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
	   Former foreign minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, one of a group
of civilians promoting peace talks with the ELN, called for an
independent investigation.
	   Health officials said the death toll could rise as burn victims
succumb to their injuries.
	   The majority of the dead were women and children who were asleep
in simple wooden houses when the flames sped through Machuca.

Toxic chemicals found in vacant lot in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 30 tons of toxic chemicals were found in a
vacant lot near a northern Paris train station, where they had been
for a week, police said Tuesday.
	   Containers filled with about 2.5 tons of cyanide, nitric acid,
sodium hydroxide and other chemicals were found by neighborhood
residents, who alerted police.
	   They came from Chemetall, a chemical company, which said it had
handed them over to a transport company for treatment and disposal
in Bordeaux.
	   ``The products were expired, and therefore we couldn't sell
them,'' said Chemetall spokesman Maxime Schrodt.
	   Police said the containers, labeled ``carcinogenic contents''
and ``expired,'' lay unprotected on the lot for about a week.
	   They said Chemetall had filed a complaint against the transport
company for parking the containers in an unauthorized location. It
didn't name the shipping company.
	   The lot near the Gare du Nord belongs to the SNCF, the national
railway company, which rents out space to private transporters.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Communists and other opposition groups
walked out of Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday to protest the
government's failure to submit a 1999 draft budget and other
economic data.
	   Communist leader Petro Symonenko, who controls more than
one-quarter of seats in the 450-member Verkhovna Rada, making his
the largest faction, threatened to boycott future sessions.
	   Symonenko said the Communists want a clear answer from Cabinet
as to when it plans to present the budget and specific measures to
combat the country's economic crisis. Several smaller leftist
factions and the centrist opposition Hromada movement joined the
protest.
	   Symonenko said the government was violating the constitution by
failing to present the required information.
	   Parliamentary speaker Oleksander Tkachenko condemned the
walkout, saying it would do no good for either parliament or the
Communist party.
	   ``When it's necessary to work together, they don't want to,''
Tkachenko said of the Communists, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Most protesters returned to the session hall after Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko pledged to submit an action plan and
a revised budget draft to parliament Friday and called on the Rada
to cooperate.
	   ``Only joint steps would allow us to start the year with a state
budget, a well-balanced action program and clear parameters of
economic development,'' Pustovoitenko told parliament.
	   The government had promised to submit a revised 1999 draft
budget draft by last Thursday, after parliament rejected an earlier
version last month, saying Ukraine's financial crisis made the
document's figures unrealistic.
	   Lawmakers ordered the Cabinet to draft a new budget that takes
into account the fall of the hryvna currency and increased
inflation, which have struck Ukraine following the economic turmoil
in Russia.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Pustovoitenko defended his government's
policies, saying the Cabinet was ``controlling the implementation
of the budget and the level of budget deficit and maintaining
control over the currency market.''
	   The Cabinet's anti-crisis measures have helped Ukraine avoid ``a
collapse of the financial and currency markets, prices and the
banking system and avoid consumer panic,'' Pustovoitenko said,
according to Interfax.
	   Meanwhile, Symonenko, the Communist leader, warned that
parliament might still reject the government's anti-crisis plan and
bring the Cabinet down.
	   A week ago, Symonenko's Communists and other opposition groups
failed to pass a vote of no-confidence in Pustovoitenko's
government over its handling of the economic crisis.

Two men reportedly negotiating financial settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (AP) _ Two men who accused Mike Tyson of
assaulting them after a minor traffic accident Aug. 31 in
Montgomery County are negotiating a financial settlement, according
to their attorneys.
	   They also want Tyson to get psychiatric help, not punishment,
The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
	   The heavyweight champion's defense attorney, Paul F. Kemp, has
said he has asked Montgomery County prosecutors to have Tyson's
second-degree assault charges dismissed if the alleged victims
agree to a ``compromise.''
	   Tyson's probation status for a rape conviction in the midwestern
state of Indiana could be affected by conviction in the Maryland
assault cases.
	   ``They didn't have as an objective to punish him or put him in
jail or strip him of his livelihood,'' said Roger W. Titus, an
attorney for one of the men, Richard Hardick, of Frederick County.
	   Titus said both men filed criminal complaints against Tyson to
achieve three goals: for Tyson to apologize, for the boxer to get
help for whatever made him allegedly attack them after the accident
and for him to compensate them financially, The Post reported.
	   ``The three objectives here were heavily linked together,''
Titus said. ``This was not just to get some money.''
	   Tyson is set to go on trial for the two misdemeanor assault
charges Dec. 1. If convicted, he faces a maximum 10 years in prison
on each charge. Tyson has pleaded not guilty.
	   During a hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission, which
voted Monday to return his boxing license, Tyson said he ``didn't
really hit anybody.''
	   ``If he said I did, I was unconscious and I'll say I'm sorry,''
Tyson said.
	   Titus and Glenn Culpepper, the attorney for complainant Abimelic
Saucedo, of Gaithersburg, declined to comment on the size of the
financial agreement being negotiated.
	   Titus said the men were seeking compensation for hospital bills,
pain and suffering, emotional loss and other out-of-pocket
expenses.
	   In a letter signed by their attorneys, the two men urged the
Nevada Athletic Commission to restore Tyson's boxing license, The
Post reported.
	   The men stated that Tyson has apologized to them and needs to
return to boxing to pay for the treatment recommended by doctors
who evaluated him, according to The Post.

New government wants to introduce abortion pill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's future government wants to allow
sale of the RU 486 abortion pill, blocked for years by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrat-led government.
	   Introduction of the pill was not included in the coalition
agreement signed Tuesday by the Social Democrats and the Greens
party. However, Rita Grieshabar, a Greens' expert on women's
politics, said the incoming government's intention to introduce the
pill was ``clear in all discussions.''
	   Newly appointed Family Minister Christine Bergmann, a Social
Democrat, promoted the pill's introduction during the election
campaign.
	   Government support for the abortion pill would be a first step
to making it available. It would also need approval by either
German or European Union medical authorities.
	   Social Democrat Marliese Dobberthein said the pill could be on
the market as early as next year. ``The chances for RU 486 have
never looked as good as they do today,'' she said.
	   The abortion pill, which can end a pregnancy several weeks after
it has begun, was introduced in France in 1988, and is available in
Europe only there, Sweden and Britain.

Turkmen president limits Russian TV broadcasts, replaces TV chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) _ Turkmenistan's autocratic
President Saparmurat Niyazov on Tuesday order sharp cuts in Russian
television broadcasts in his former Soviet republic because of a
dispute over costs.
	   Niyazov said the broadcasts of Russia's state-controlled ORT
television broadcast would be limited to five hours in the morning
and an evening news program.
	   In addition to the cost dispute, he said, some movies and
programs shown on ORT contradict Turkmenistan's moral norms. He did
not elaborate.
	   ORT is Russia's leading network, and the only one that
broadcasts throughout the former Soviet Union.
	   Also Tuesday, Niyazov also ousted the chief of Turkmenistan's
state TV and radio company, Klychmurad Kakabayev, over ``improper
behaviour and financial violations.'' Annageldy Nurgeldyev, the
editor of the government daily Vatan, was named as a replacement.
	   Niyazov has built a cult of personality reminiscent of Soviet
leaders, and statues and portraits of him fill his Central Asian
nation. He has built luxurious palaces for himself, while the rest
of the desert nation lives in poverty despite vast gas and oil
reserves.

Hoddle, under pressure to resign, likely to get pay increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England manger Glenn Hoddle is expected to get a
100,000-pound (dlrs 170,000) pay raise this week despite mounting
pressure on him to resign. Speculation increased, meanwhile, that
Frenchman Arsene Wenger is being lined up as Hoddle's successor.
	   Reported to be earning 250,000 pounds (dlrs 425,000), Hoddle was
to meet this week with English Football Association chief executive
Graham Kelly. Newspaper reports suggested the pay increase may
hinge on England qualifying for the 2000 European Championship.
	   Calls for Hoddle to step down have been mounting since England
was knocked out of the World Cup by Argentina.
	   They have increased in the last month after a loss to Sweden, a
0-0 home draw with Bulgaria and a lackluster 3-0 win over
Luxembourg in qualifying for the 2000 championship.
	   In addition, Hoddle has had run-ins with the British press and
has been widely criticized for backroom revelations about the team
in a recently published book.
	   Meanwhile, The Times reported Tuesday that Arsenal manager
Wenger is the choice of many within the FA to succeed Hoddle _
probably after the European finals.
	   Wenger, who would become the country's first non-English coach,
has turned down chances to head Japan and France but has said he
would consider talking about the England post.
	   Max Clifford, who has served as a publicist to Frank Sinatra and
Muhammad Ali, said Tuesday Wenger would be his choice.
	   ``He is a clever man with a calm personality and a mind perfect
for man management,'' Clifford said. ``He's made for the job.''
	   Wenger, who is reported to earn almost 1 million pounds (dlrs
1.7) at Arsenal, led the Gunners to last season's league and FA Cup
double.
	   He is soft-spoken, low-key and has been praised for his dealings
with the media and his serious approach to training and match
preperation.

Pinochest arrest could be bad news for others with checkered pasts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For an ailing fallen dictator or a high-rolling
Arab prince, London has long been the place to visit, with its
world-class private hospitals, five-star hotels, soul-of-discretion
doormen, and _ above all _ reputation as a safe home-from-home.
	   For some, the arrest of former Chilean dictator and longtime
Britain admirer Gen. Augusto Pinochet _ in his bed at an elite
London clinic, no less _ means things can never be the same again.
	   But others label the arrest a singular event _ a handy way for
leaders of the 18-month-old Labor Party government both to show off
to the world their ``ethical'' foreign policy and to take revenge
against the No. 1 target of street protests back in the '70s when
they were young.
	   ``It is not a question of the floodgates being opened here,''
said Michael Byers, an international law specialist at Oxford
University.
	   ``We have one of the most horrendous criminals of the 20th
century ... here in our country, we have an extradition treaty,
Spain has jurisdiction under international law. Quite frankly, I
don't see what the fuss is about,'' he said.
	   If Byers is right, the rest can relax, be they Chinese Communist
Party officials returning a recent fulsome visit by Prime Minister
Tony Blair, or supporters of deposed African dictators privately
spending some of the money they stashed in public life.
	   Pinochet, 82, a regular visitor when a Conservative Party
government was in power, evidently felt safe coming here again
despite several warning signs.
	   There were the investigations by Spanish magistrates who, once
he arrived, instigated the arrest seeking his extradition on
allegations of murder and torture. There was a new British
government talking ethics. And there was an increasing use of
national laws to cover dictators and alleged war criminals, such as
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   Pinochet, who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean armed
forces until March, seized power from a leftist administration in
1973. The Chilean government has said 4,299 political opponents
were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule.
	   ``Pinochet's arrest does have implications for others,'' said
Sandy Ghandhi, a specialist in international human rights law at
Reading University, west of London.
	   ``London is a mecca for a lot of very unpleasant people who come
here for medical treatment or other reasons,'' Ghandhi said. ``In
the past, they were confident of being utterly immune from any
further prosecution.''
	   Members of foreign governments on official visits always have
diplomatic immunity. But if the Pinochet arrest is a precedent,
they could be vulnerable out of office.
	   ``All those dictators who are considering that Europe is a safe
haven, well, they are going to learn that they are going to have to
answer for what they have done in the past, that the past is the
present,'' said Virginia Shoppee, a specialist on Chile at Amnesty
International.
	   Whether Pinochet's arrest sets a precedent or not does not worry
Cuba's Fidel Castro, a robust survivor while dictators to the right
and left have gone.
	   ``I'm not afraid to go anywhere,'' Castro told reporters Tuesday
in the southwestern Spanish city of Merida. ``I come from a stock
which it would be difficult to arrest anywhere, not just on a moral
basis but also because of my life's story.''
	   Of Pinochet's arrest, he said. ``From a moral point of view,
it's just. From a judicial stance, it's questionable, and from a
political point of view, it will create a complicated situation in
Chile.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian man arrested after throwing
hand grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron last
month, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sixty-four Israelis were wounded in Monday's attack in Beersheba
in Israel's southern Negev Desert. Sarsour was wrestled to the
ground and arrested immediately after the attack at Beersheba's
central bus station.
	   The army said Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand
grenades at Israeli soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured in that
attack.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement Tuesday that
Sarsour was a double agent who had provided information to the
Israeli security service Shin Bet. After being blackmailed by his
Shin Bet handlers who threatened to disclose his identity, Sarsour
carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement said.
	   Twenty-seven people injured in Monday's attack remained
hospitalized Tuesday, including a 45-year-old man who was in
intensive care, Beersheba's Sorokka Hospital reported.
	   In response to the grenade attack, Israeli negotiators at the
Mideast summit in Maryland said they would only discuss
security-related issues with the Palestinians.
	   Israel has been bracing for a major terror attack by Hamas in
recent weeks, following Hamas threats to avenge the killings of two
of the group's top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   However, Palestinian militants have so far mounted only small
operations, including drive-by shootings, stabbings and grenade
attacks.
	   An Israeli commentator said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Hamas apparently have an understanding that the group will, for the
time being, refrain from large-scale attacks that could dash all
hopes of another Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
Instead, Hamas will carry out only smaller operations, commentator
Ron Ben-Ishai said.
	   Arafat can claim that such attacks are spontaneous acts by
individuals that are impossible to predict and prevent, the
commentator wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   ``This is Hamas' way of hanging on to the terror stick at both
ends, and putting a spoke into the wheels of the negotiations,''
Ben-Ishai wrote.
	   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub acknowledged that
Sarsour had ties to Hamas, and was imprisoned twice by Israel
during the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising.
	   However, Rajoub said there was no sign that Sarsour acted on
behalf of Hamas on Monday. ``I believe he acted alone,'' Rajoub
said.
	   Sarsour, a father of five, lives in the Palestinian-controlled
part of the West Bank town of Hebron and works as a plasterer.
	   Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious
fervor. He wears a large white prayer cap; his wife, Khaloud, wears
a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm among
observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin hangs in their home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her five young children _ the
oldest is 9 _ crowded around her as she spoke.

<TEXT>
	   It was not immediately clear how the Israeli and Palestinian
claims and counterclaims would affect the Mideast summit at Wye
Plantation in Maryland.
	   Security is a central issue in the negotiations, with Israel
pointing to Sarsour's hand grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba on Monday as new proof that the Palestinians are
not doing enough to prevent terror attacks.
	   Sarsour is a resident of the Palestinian-controlled area of
Hebron. The army said that after the killing of the rabbi and the
Sept. 30 grenade attack, Sarsour escaped into the Palestinian-run
part of the city.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long complained
that Palestinian areas are launching pads for terror attacks
against Israelis and that the Palestinian security forces are doing
little to catch the assailants.
	   The army said that Sarsour started out on the fringes of Hamas,
organizing rallies and spraying graffiti on walls. He was jailed
twice by Israel in 1989 and 1996 for such activities, the army
said.
	   On Aug. 20, Sarsour wandered into the Israeli-run part of
Hebron, planning to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiers, the army
said. When he didn't find a target, he climbed the fence of the
tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers.
	   He spotted Rabbi Shlomo Raanan in one of the trailers, climbed
threw the window and stabbed the rabbi to death, the army said.
	   A few days later, Sarsour approached one of the Hamas leaders in
town and told him that he had killed the rabbi. He was recruited
into the Hamas military wing and was trained in throwing grenades.
	   On Sept. 30, Sarsour threw two hand grenades at Israeli soldiers
in a central square in the city and escaped.
	   Over the weekend, he twice traveled to Jerusalem, armed with
fragmentation grenades, but returned to Hebron after not finding a
target, the army said.
	   On Monday, Sarsour headed to Beersheba. Sarsour, a plasterer by
trade, hope to find a day's work in the city and on the way home
carry out a grenade attack, the army said.
	   When he didn't find work, he walked to the central bus station
and threw two grenades at a crowded bus stop. Among the 64 injured
were 24 soldiers, the army said.
	   The Palestinian Authority said that after Sarsour's identity
became know, Palestinian security forces arrested a friend of the
suspect who told them Sarsour was an Israeli agent.
	   The friend said Sarsour had received money from the Shin Bet in
exchange for information and that his handlers had given him a
mobile phone to make it easier for him to pass on information.
	   The friend said Sarsour carried out the attacks because he was
being blackmailed by the Shin Bet, the Palestinian statement said.
	   Sarsour is a father of five. Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem''
because of his religious fervor.
	   He sports a large white prayer cap and his wife, Khaloud, wears
a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm among
observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin hangs in the Sarsour home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas. Her children _ the oldest is
nine _ crowded around her as she spoke.
	   In 1982, Israel demolished the Sarsour family home and Sarsour
was jailed twice by Israel during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.

Guinea-Bissau's fighting spreads to interior but eases in capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross suspending operations; ADDS quotes and
details throughout, TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau government troops clashed
with rebels in the tiny west African nation Tuesday, raising the
prospect of a return to civil war, Portuguese officials said.
	   The fighting in the interior of the country prompted the
International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend relief
operations in the capital Bissau and the second-largest city
Bafata, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bissau, ICRC
spokesman Michael Kleiner said.
	   Rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo Vieira
exchanged mortar fire in Bafata and nearby Bambadinca, a spokesman
for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said.
	   Clashes were also reported in Quebu, near the former Portuguese
colony's southern border with Guinea, which has an airfield.
	   ``Our concern is that the fighting is spreading to the
interior,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Vasco Colares Pereira told
The Associated Press in Lisbon, adding that the extent of the
clashes was unclear.
	   Meanwhile, fighting in the capital subsided.
	   An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to
be identified, said there was sporadic fire in the capital during
the night, but everything was calm as morning broke.
	   Senegal and Guinea deployed troops in the neighboring country to
help Vieira contain the rebels, but it was not clear whether they
were involved in the renewed fighting.
	   Hundreds of residents gathered at Bissau's port, looking to
leave the battered capital for the Bissagos islands, some 50
kilometers (30 miles) off its western coast, Kleiner said by phone
from Geneva, where the ICRC is based.
	   Others chose southwestern and eastern land routes, adding to
some 300,000 already displaced by the conflict that began in early
June, he said.
	   He said he had no reliable information on the total number of
refugees.
	   Hostilities restarted Sunday in the capital as army dissidents
led by Brig. Ansumane Mane and government soldiers clashed near the
presidential palace, breaking a 13-week truce.
	   The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, or CPLP, which
brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday called on both sides to
restrain their forces, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner _ the Economic
Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently resume a joint
mediation effort'', Lusa reported.
	   Fighting erupted June 7 in this country of 1 million, when a
rebel military faction seized Bissau's main army garrison and
airport, demanding that Vieira step down for alleged corruption.

Hip minimalism, couture touches for summer 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Time is running out before the year 2000, but not
ideas for clothes. From hip minimalism to some romantic ideas and
couture touches, the summer of 1999 should not be dull, viewed from
last week's ready-to-wear shows.
	   It wasn't the greatest season ever, but there were plenty of
ideas.
	   Young doesn't mean a kind of vestal virgin anymore. It means
practical, wearable, rather sophisticated and expensive clothes, if
you are thinking beyond jeans and running shoes.
	   The younger designers, like Michael Kors at Celine and Peter
Speliopoulos at Cerruti _ both Americans _ definitely had the
high-tech, minimalist touch, along with other younger stylists like
Grit Seymour at Daniel Hechter.
	   Kors tore up lots of fabrics and wove them into rustic threads
for luxury turtleneck sweaters to wear over shiny short skirts. He
added beautiful real crystals and amethysts to simple, sleeveless
evening wear _ ``Why have jewelry when it's in the clothes?'' he
asked.
	   Speliopoulos for Cerruti showed sharp but easy lines and cuts.
Some soft drawstring touches, stitching on leather, and linear
silver embroidery gave the cachet here.
	   In the still young but more romantic group, Israeli-American
Alber Elbaz was admired by many for his couture-suave Guy Laroche
collection, though he's destined to design ready-to-wear for Yves
Saint Laurent next season.
	   At Vuitton, Marc Jacobs made a hit with his offhand, breezy
ponchos, shorts, little leather belts and backpacks, and wrapped
skirts, easy but chic styles for fashionable travelers.
	   John Galliano at Dior was noted for his great show of wearable,
chic clothes. They included wide, handsome olive-green pants, slick
couture-style jackets with touches of red, umbrella-skirted suits,
and some fabulous draped and backless dresses _ all marched out in
the Bolshevik or Chinese Red Guard theme, with linear touches of
1920s Constructivist art.
	   At Givenchy, Alexander McQueen straightened out his penchant for
freakish touches to show toned-down but handsome clothes with
plenty of bared skin, lean lines and good geometric touches, mostly
in black and white.
	   Though he's now ``establishment,'' Jean-Paul Gaultier went back
to rather crazy styles based on Japanese ideas. But there there was
exotic opulence in the kimonos, and ideas to choose from.
	   Also confusing was Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, who zipped into
high-tech after the total chic of long looks last season. Mixed
results included everything from skimpy bathing wear to pants with
flying panels _ and not enough classic Chanel jackets.
	   Valentino was admirable in his lighter clothes, like fluid beach
pants or luxury full skirts and exquisite gypsy-peasant blouses.
	   The biggest hit for sheer class of show and brilliant clothes
was Yohji Yamamoto, whose witty strip-tease of bridal clothes at
the Moulin Rouge nightclub had the fashion crowd on their feet with
joy.
	   To sum up the tendencies:
	   The general outline is feminine, with longer skirts, though
knee-lengths showed up among the modernists. Pants can be anything
from cropped to full palazzo style, straight or flared.
	   While designers brought out some transparency and stretch-
column styles, sexy was hardly the word for the mood of most of
these shows.
	   Tops may be easy, unstructured blazers, very beautiful at Ungaro
when worn with pants or light, lacy dresses. Jackets everywhere can
come out fitted, boxy, zipped or blouson style. The cache-coeur or
wraparound is also popular.
	   The clingy-fit tee-shirt or tank top is essential for summer.
That also goes for sleeveless sheaths, strapless tops, the
low-draped cowlbacks or other backless looks crossed by straps.
	   Fabrics practically make the clothes this season, and besides
the beautiful sheer linens and poplins, watch for the new
synthetics: sheer chiffon-like blends, evanescent crepes, some
stretch fabrics, glazed or waterproofed fabrics and taffeta-like
microfibers.
	   Colors to look for are all the whites, from sand and ecru or
cream to squeaky-clean new white linen. Black follows right along,
especially for evening. Grays edge into dusty pastels like parma
violet or sea green, with corals to pep things up.

Trial starts for retired naval officer accused of treason
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A retired Russian naval officer
accused of high treason pleaded innocent Tuesday at the opening of
his long-awaited trial, and the judge evicted most of the public
after a half-hour, human rights observers said.
	   Alexander Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a
Norwegian environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, which
compiled a 1996 report criticizing the handling of nuclear waste
and reactors in Russia's Northern Fleet.
	   Nikitin pleaded innocent, though he told the judge he did not
understand the charges against him, Diederik Lohmann, director of
the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch, said. He was in St.
Petersburg for the trial.
	   The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking
have never been published and were shown to his lawyers for the
first time Tuesday. They were revealed after the court was closed,
and no details were released.
	   Nikitin's lawyers have long argued that under Russia's
Constitution, criminal charges cannot be filed on the basis of
unpublished laws. Nikitin and Bellona also maintain that the
information used in compiling their report came from public
records.
	   Human rights groups criticized Judge Sergei Golets' decision to
close the court proceedings.
	   ``To close the trial at the outset ... is a tactical mistake
because it will guarantee increased public outrage,'' said
environmental lawyer Stephen Kass, a member of the board of
directors of Human Rights Watch.
	   Nikitin was not discouraged by the judge's decision.
	   ``The court was in a difficult position,'' he said after court
adjourned for the day. ``I think that everything will be all
right.''
	   His lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, was also positive. ``We are feeling
completely confident ... because we are speaking the truth, and as
one (author Mikhail) Bulgakov hero said, speaking the truth is a
pleasant and easy thing to do.''
	   The maximum penalty for high treason is 20 years in prison.
Prosecutors are asking for 12 to 20 years, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   A crowd of supporters greeted Nikitin outside the courtroom
Tuesday morning. Dressed in a gray suit, the 46-year-old former
navy captain looked tense as he answered preliminary questions from
the judge.
	   Golets then closed proceedings, although a handful of people
including Russian parliamentary deputy Alexander Shishlov, who is
observing the trial on behalf of the Council of Europe, were
allowed to remain.
	   Prosecutors then read the indictment, which ran over 30 pages.
	   Nikitin's lawyers said they will push for parts of the case to
be open later. Golets said proceedings will be closed at least
while Nikitin is questioned by the court.
	   Nikitin's trial comes at the same time as proceedings against
Capt. Grigory Pasko, a Russian military reporter accused of passing
secrets about the Russian Pacific Fleet onto Japanese media. Pasko
maintains that the documents simply detailed environmental problems
at several Russian Pacific Fleet bases.

Polish government approves draft law on NATO membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's government on Tuesday formally
recognized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a necessary step
toward membership in the military alliance.
	   Parliament now needs to ratify the treaty.
	   The move could allow Poland's entry to the Western military
alliance earlier than the planned April date.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has not ruled out Poland
might join NATO earlier, saying the timing depended on whether
Poland was ready for it.
	   Ever since toppling the communists in 1989, Solidarity has
pushed for integration with the West's security and economic
structures.
	   Joining NATO would make Poland ``more secure and stable than
ever in its modern history,'' said Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek, who heads the Solidarity-led coalition government.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, has been
invited to join NATO on the pact's 50th anniversary in April.

U.N. team arrives to assess compliance in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) _ A United Nations team sent to assess
Kosovo's progress toward peace began work in the province Tuesday
and relief convoys resumed after missing a day due to renewed
violence.
	   Most of Kosovo seemed calm after a weekend of shelling and
shooting incidents. But the Serbs accused the guerrillas of another
attack on police, leaving lingering doubt about the future of the
U.S.-brokered agreement to end the violence.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark arrived in Belgrade for a
meeting Tuesday evening with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
_ presumably to tell him what must still be done to meet an Oct. 27
deadline to comply with the accord or face airstrikes.
	   Yugoslav army troops backed by Serbian police maintained an
increased and visible presence in the area where most of the
weekend attacks occurred, and a new incident was reported there.
	   The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug claimed a Serb
policeman was wounded Tuesday morning when ``terrorists'' attacked
a police patrol near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina. The incident could not be verified.
	   The troops are normally stationed in the capital of the Serbian
province, and therefore are allowed to remain in the province under
the withdrawal plan.
	   Relief convoys rolled again, with Mercy Corps International and
other humanitarian groups sending 150 tons of food, clothing,
mattresses and other items to the southwestern Kosovo town of
Djinovce.
	   Three other convoys also went out, including two from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees that were postponed Monday due to
the Serb military buildup after the weekend violence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic launched a
crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if
the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting, thousands
still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   The 20-member U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden,
includes representatives of human rights, humanitarian, political
and peacekeeping offices who will serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' de Mistura said, referring to the Oct. 12
agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

Robin Cook arrives in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Calling for close cooperation among
Balkan countries in the Kosovo crisis, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook arrived Tuesday in Macedonia, the second stop on his
tour of the region.
	   Cook is scheduled to meet Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
later Tuesday. On Wednesday, he will meet a leader of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo and U.S. ambassador in Macedonia and Kosovo
envoy, Christopher Hill.
	   Macedonia borders Kosovo, a Yugoslav province whose ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence. Macedonia has its own
restive ethnic Albanian minority and there are fears that Kosovo
bloodshed could spill over.
	   Cook said earlier in Bulgaria that all Balkan countries must
work together in order to prevent the clashes from engulfing the
region.

WHO pushing for global anti-tobacco convention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. health agency on Tuesday announced plans
to develop a global strategy to fight tobacco, backing up scattered
national efforts.
	   World Health Organization experts want to create a new
international convention to set global standards on controversial
issues such as tobacco tax, smuggling, advertising and commercial
sponsorship.
	   ``Tobacco control cannot succeed solely through the efforts of
individual governments, national (organizations) and media
advocates,'' said WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland in a
press release. ``We need an international response to an
international problem.''
	   Brundtland, who made the fight against tobacco a mainstay of her
campaign for election to the post three months ago, was not present
at the announcement.
	   It's the first time the WHO has agreed to use its right as a
U.N. agency to draw up an international convention.
	   The WHO's anti-tobacco task force, known as the Tobacco Free
Initiative, will develop the convention's framework. The accord
will also tackle issues including international trade, package
labeling and encouraging alternatives to tobacco farming.
	   ``We're focusing on ways of addressing tobacco control, the
tried and true ways which have been steadfastly used in some
countries with success,'' said Derek Yach, the Tobacco Free
Initiative project manager.
	   ``There's nothing fancy about price and taxation increases, yet
most countries haven't done it. Nothing new about calling for
advertising bans, yet the vast majority haven't addressed it. We're
just not doing it as a world community.''
	   It isn't being done fast enough either, according to the WHO.
	   WHO statistics show one person dies every 10 seconds from a
tobacco-related illness. If nothing is done in 20 years, the rate
of death in Europe will climb 20 percent.
	   It is estimated 200-300 million smokers will die by 2025 if the
trend continues. However, just ratifying the convention may take
that long.
	   While some of the more scientific-based conventions have been
approved within 10 years, rubber-stamping others can take up to 40
years.
	   The WHO would like to see the actual framework agreed upon
perhaps within five years, Yach said.
	   Meanwhile, the Tobacco Free Initiative is seeking legal ways of
ensuring ``the tobacco industry meets its financial obligations for
death and disease caused by the use of its products.''
	   In the United States, 46 states are engaged in a multi
billion-dollar lawsuit with tobacco companies.
	   ``The industry has hidden information for 40 years,'' said Yach.
``When we hear they are scared of the WHO, we're thrilled because
what they're scared of in reality is the public and government
support that backs the WHO.''
	   Supported by the World Bank and other agencies such as UNICEF,
the U.N. children's agency, the WHO spends just dlrs 5-6 million a
year on its fight against tobacco. The United States alone spent
dlrs 1 billion this year.
	   Both efforts are just a tiny fraction of the lucrative dlrs 400
billion tobacco industry.

Cook says West will oppose separatist aspirations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cook in Macedonia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Western nations will continue opposing
the aspirations of ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo for full
independence from Yugoslavia, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Tuesday.
	   He said Britain is ``firmly committed to the territorial
integrity and security of the countries in this region.''
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters after
talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   ``The international community has never given its support to an
independent Kosovo. We believe that the way forward is for the
countries of the region to cooperate together to break down the
barriers between them rather than to try to create new
boundaries,'' Cook told a news conference.
	   He also said the people of Kosovo do not accept autonomy as a
sufficient statement of their aspirations and that it is the right
of the Kosovars to run their own affairs and to have control on
their own police.
	   ``That is why we have called for the self-government of
Kosovo,'' Cook said and added that there should be elections within
the next nine months and that those elections should be supervised
``not by Belgrade but by the OSCE.''
	   Cook arrived late Monday on the first stop on his Balkan tour,
then flew on to Macedonia for a meeting with President Kiro
Gligorov on Tuesday night. Before leaving for Romania, he was to
meet in Skopje on Wednesday with other Macedonian officials and
with Kosovo Albanian leader Fehmi Agani.
	   On Monday, Cook said in London that Britain will continue
pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure he
complies with agreements made to end civilian deaths and fighting
in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during more
than seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. Some 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been displaced from their homes in the province,
which is predominantly ethnic Albanian.

Guinea-Bissau's fighting spreads to interior but eases in capital

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops clashed Tuesday with
rebels in Guinea-Bissau, raising the prospect of a return to civil
war in the west African nation, Portuguese officials said.
	   The fighting in the interior of the country prompted the
International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend relief
operations in the capital Bissau, on the coast, and the
second-largest city Bafata, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Bissau, ICRC spokesman Michael Kleiner said.
	   Rebels and troops backing President Joao Bernardo Vieira
exchanged mortar fire in Bafata and nearby Bambadinca, a spokesman
for the Portuguese Defense Ministry said.
	   Clashes were also reported in Quebu, near the former Portuguese
colony's southern border with Guinea, which has an airfield.
	   ``Our concern is that the fighting is spreading to the
interior,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Vasco Colares Pereira told
The Associated Press in Lisbon, adding that the extent of the
clashes was unclear.
	   Meanwhile, fighting in the capital subsided.
	   An official at the Portuguese embassy in Bissau, who declined to
be identified, said there was sporadic fire during the night, but
everything was calm by morning.
	   Neighboring Senegal and Guinea deployed troops to help Vieira
contain the rebels, but it was not clear whether they were involved
in the renewed fighting.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds of residents gathered at Bissau's port,
looking to leave the battered capital for the Bissagos islands,
some 50 kilometers (30 miles) off its western coast, Kleiner said
by phone from Geneva, where the ICRC is based.
	   Others chose southwestern and eastern land routes, adding to
some 300,000 already displaced by the conflict that began in early
June, he said.
	   He said he had no reliable information on the total number of
refugees.
	   Hostilities restarted Sunday in the capital as army dissidents
led by Brig. Ansumane Mane and government soldiers clashed near the
presidential palace, breaking a 13-week truce.
	   The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, or CPLP, which
brokered the July 26 cease-fire, on Tuesday called on both sides to
restrain their forces, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The CPLP also asked their negotiating partner _ the Economic
Community of West African Countries _ to ``urgently resume a joint
mediation effort,'' Lusa reported.
	   Fighting erupted June 7 in this country of 1 million, when a
rebel military faction seized Bissau's main army garrison and
airport, demanding that Vieira step down for alleged corruption.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron this
summer, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and
Palestinian civilians were injured in that attack.
	   After an intial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed responsibility
for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli town of
Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a
double agent who had provided information to the Israeli security
service Shin Bet.
	   After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information,
Sarsour carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement
said.
	   The Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the
attacks, the statement said.
	   It was not immediately clear how the claims and counterclaims
would play out at he Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Security is a central issue in the negotiations, with Israel
pointing to Sarsour's attack in Beersheba as new proof that the
Palestinians are not doing enough to prevent terror attacks.
	   Sarsour is a resident of the Palestinian-controlled area of
Hebron. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long
complained that Palestinian areas are launching pads for terror
attacks against Israelis and that the Palestinians are doing little
to catch the assailants.
	   The army said that Sarsour started out as a low-ranking Hamas
activist, organizing rallies and spraying graffiti on walls. He was
jailed twice by Israel in 1989 and 1996, the army said.
	   On Aug. 20, Sarsour wandered into the Israeli-run part of
Hebron, planning to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiers, the army
said. When he didn't find a target, he climbed the fence of the
tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers.
	   He spotted Rabbi Shlomo Raanan in one of the trailers, climbed
through the window and stabbed the rabbi to death, the army said.
	   A few days later, Sarsour approached one of the Hamas leaders in
town and told him that he had killed the rabbi.
	   He was recruited into the Hamas military wing, was trained in
throwing grenades and carried out the Sept. 30 grenade attack in
Hebron, the army said.
	   On Monday, Sarsour headed to Beersheba.
	   Sarsour, a plasterer by trade, hoped to find a day's work in the
city and on the way home carry out a grenade attack, the army said.
	   When he didn't find work, he walked to the central bus station
and threw two grenades at a crowded bus stop.
	   The Palestinian Authority said that after Sarsour's identity
became know, Palestinian security forces arrested a friend of the
suspect who told them Sarsour was an Israeli agent.
	   The friend said Sarsour had received money from the Shin Bet in
exchange for information and that his handlers had given him a
mobile phone to make it easier for him to pass on information.
	   Sarsour is a father of five. Neighbors call him ``Sheik Salem''
because of his religious fervor.
	   He sports a large white prayer cap and his wife, Khaloud, wears
a face veil in addition to the headscarf that is the norm among
observant Palestinian women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin hangs in the Sarsour home.
	   In 1982, Israel demolished the Sarsour family home and Sarsour
was jailed twice by Israel during the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising.

Bloody Sunday inquiry faces delays because of too much testimony
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A commission investigating
what happened on ``Bloody Sunday'' 26 years ago, when British
soldiers killed 13 unarmed Catholic protesters, announced Tuesday
it would delay hearings indefinitely because of the huge backlog of
testimony to collect.
	   Lord Saville, a senior English judge heading the independent
investigation, said hundreds more people than expected had asked to
give statements to the commission's lawyers in Londonderry, where
the shootings occurred.
	   Saville said his hopes of launching oral hearings in February
had been further complicated by the difficulty of determining which
British soldiers the commission must try to track down.
	   Besides the 10 or so former soldiers who already had volunteered
to testify, the British army recently presented records identifying
all 3,000 soldiers stationed in Londonderry at the time, Saville
said.
	   The Bloody Sunday killings are considered a threshold event in
the Northern Ireland conflict.
	   A British judicial inquiry in 1972 concluded the soldiers fired
recklessly but with justification, a verdict that united the city's
Catholic majority in fury.
	   Officials from the United States and New Zealand also are
members of the independent commission.

16,000 evacuated as floods threaten parts of Indian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Floods threatened to inundate low-lying
areas along a river in the Indian capital, forcing authorities
Tuesday to evacuate more than 16,000 people to safer grounds, news
agencies reported.
	   The level of the Yamuna River, which flows through eastern New
Delhi, had risen one meter (three feet) over the danger mark
Tuesday after the adjacent Haryana state released large quantities
of water from a reservoir, the United News of India said.
	   But New Delhi Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj said there was
nothing to fear as all vulnerable points on the river bank had been
plugged to prevent any breaches.
	   The water level was expected to peak at 206 meters (680 feet)
Tuesday evening but would recede since no more water was expected
to enter the Yamuna from upstream, local officials said.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A retired Russian naval officer
accused of high treason pleaded innocent Tuesday at the opening of
his long-awaited trial, and the judge evicted most of the public
after a half-hour, a defense lawyer said.
	   Alexander Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a
Norwegian environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, which
compiled a 1996 report criticizing the handling of nuclear waste
and reactors in Russia's Northern Fleet.
	   Nikitin pleaded that he was ``not in any way guilty,'' though he
told the judge he did not understand the charges against him, said
Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer working in Nikitin's defense team.
	   The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking
have never been published and were shown to his lawyers for the
first time Tuesday.
	   Pavlov said that some parts of the decrees were old and not
valid under Russia's constitution, but provided no other details
about them.
	   Nikitin's lawyers have long argued that under the Constitution,
criminal charges cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws.
Nikitin and Bellona also maintain that the information used in
compiling their report came from public records.
	   Human rights groups criticized Judge Sergei Golets' decision to
close the court proceedings.
	   ``To close the trial at the outset ... is a tactical mistake
because it will guarantee increased public outrage,'' said
environmental lawyer Stephen Kass, a member of the board of
directors of Human Rights Watch.
	   Nikitin was not discouraged by the judge's decision.
	   ``The court was in a difficult position,'' he said after court
adjourned for the day. ``I think that everything will be all
right.''
	   His lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, was also positive. ``We are feeling
completely confident ... because we are speaking the truth, and as
one (author Mikhail) Bulgakov hero said, speaking the truth is a
pleasant and easy thing to do.''
	   The maximum penalty for high treason is 20 years in prison.
Prosecutors are asking for 12 to 20 years, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   A crowd of supporters greeted Nikitin outside the courtroom
Tuesday morning. Dressed in a gray suit, the 46-year-old former
navy captain looked tense as he answered preliminary questions from
the judge.
	   Golets then closed proceedings, although a handful of people
including Russian parliamentary deputy Alexander Shishlov, who is
observing the trial on behalf of the Council of Europe, were
allowed to remain.
	   Prosecutors then read the indictment, which ran over 30 pages.
	   Nikitin's lawyers said they will push for parts of the case to
be open later. Golets said proceedings will be closed at least
while Nikitin is questioned by the court.
	   Nikitin's trial comes at the same time as proceedings against
Capt. Grigory Pasko, a Russian military reporter accused of passing
secrets about the Russian Pacific Fleet onto Japanese media. Pasko
maintains that the documents simply detailed environmental problems
at several Russian Pacific Fleet bases.

Report: Israel willing to share Arrow missiles with Jordan, Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel denied a report Tuesday that it would be
willing to deploy Arrow missile batteries in Jordan and Turkey in
times of need, as long as the United States agrees.
	   David Ivri, a senior aide to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, told the Haaretz daily that nations in the Middle East
are in a race to deploy weapons of mass destruction and that the
West has failed to slow the proliferation of such weapons.
	   The defense ministry later issued a statement denying that Ivri
said anything about the possibility of deploying Arrow missile
batteries in Jordan or Turkey.
	   Israel's Arrow missile, expected to be operational by mid-1999,
is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles possessed by
Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies, such as Syria or Libya.
	   In the past, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
suggested sharing the Arrow technology with allies in the region.

Scuffles break out between students, vigilantes at rally

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Riot police broke up a pro-democracy rally
at a Tehran stadium on Tuesday after scuffles were provoked by
hard-line vigilantes.
	   ``Sticks, clubs and knives won't work anymore,'' shouted
hundreds of youths, referring to the weapons that members of the
Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilante group use in their fights with
moderates.
	   A few hundred from both sides shoved and pushed each other _ and
at least half a dozen were beaten _ before police intervened.
	   The scuffle broke out as Gholamhossein Karbaschi, the suspended
mayor of Tehran, was urging the 3,000 people at the stadium to take
part in Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, a body that
elects the country's supreme leader.
	   Tuesday's gathering was one in a series that moderates have been
holding in the runup to the elections.
	   The moderates accuse the hard-line Council of Guardians, which
screens applicants for elections, of being unfair in its selection
of candidates for the assembly. Most of the moderate applicants for
the assembly were disqualified.
	   Those attending the rally, mostly university students, used the
occasion to vent their anger at hard-liners for trying to curb
civil liberties by closing down liberal newspapers.
	   They shouted slogans calling for the resignation of Iran's
supreme judge, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi.
	   ``Bring back the people's paper,'' shouted the crowd, some
waving old copies of the Tous newspaper, which was closed down by
Yazdi. Tous was shut down last month and three of its editors are
in jail.
	   The youths also shouted slogans in support of President Mohammad
Khatami, whose election last year has brought about the more
relaxed atmosphere in which people can hold rallies such as
Tuesday's.
	   The crowd also called for the appeals court to overturn the
conviction of Karbaschi, who was sentenced in April to five years
in jail for corruption.
	   ``Acquittal, acquittal,'' the crowd shouted.
	   Karbaschi urged the students to vote in the assembly elections,
saying: ``If you don't vote, you will be depriving yourselves with
your own hands from your social and political rights.''
	   Many Iranians, angry that there will be few moderate candidates
on the ballot, have said they will not vote.
	   ``There's no point in voting. They have already selected the
members,'' complained Mahmoud Mir Bagheri, a 22-year-old
engineering student.
	   But Mohammad Rahmani, 17, said he had changed his mind after
hearing Karbaschi.
	   ``I'll vote so that I'm not left behind, '' he said.

Islamic militant group claims responsibility for grenade attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Islamic militant group Hamas on Tuesday
claimed responsibility for a hand grenade attack in the southern
Israeli town of Beersheba that injured 64 Israelis.
	   In a leaflet faxed to news agencies, Hamas said Monday's attack
was carried out by ``one of our heroes.''
	   The leaflet, signed by Hamas' military wing, the Izzedine al
Qassam Brigades, also suggested that more attacks against Israelis
would follow. ``The flag of our resistance will continue to be
raised,'' it said.
	   Monday's attack was carried out by Salem Rajab Sarsour, 29, a
father of five from the Palestinian-controlled part of the West
Bank town of Hebron. Sarsour was arrested immediately after
throwing two grenades near a bus stop during morning rush hour.
	   The Israeli army said Tuesday that Sarsour also confessed to
killing a rabbi in Hebron on Aug. 20 and throwing hand grenades at
Israeli troops in the city on Sept. 30.
	   Sarsour started out as a low-ranking Hamas activist, but was
recruited by the military wing after the killing of the rabbi, the
army said.

Some 300,000 march in French student protests marred by violence

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some 300,000 high school students took to the
streets of France Tuesday to protest school conditions in a second
round of nationwide marches that were again marred by hooligans
throwing bottles and smashing windows.
	   Despite intensive efforts by student leaders to attract support,
the protesters failed to build on the momentum of last week's
protests, which drew a half-million marchers.
	   In Paris, helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from aerosol
cans to disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a posh
Left Bank neighborhood and set fire to a metro car, temporarily
interrupting service on one line.
	   Many of the hooligans were older than the high school students,
who insist the troublemakers have no connection to their movement.
	   At least 45 young people were arrested nationwide, and dozens of
others were detained and then released.
	   Police said about 25,000 students marched in Paris _ far below
the hoped-for 45,000 demonstrators.
	   The students' frustration, however, has clearly not dissipated
despite government promises to hire more teachers, buy new
equipment and reduce the heavy courseload.
	   ``We're here because we've got 40 kids in one classroom that's
falling apart,'' said Ablo Tham, from the working class suburb of
Trappes. ``If the government doesn't listen, we'll make sure it
does.''
	   Many students wore yellow-and-black stickers calling on
Education Minister Claude Allegre to resign. Others waved banners
with colorful slogans reflecting their anger.
	   ``No promises. Action,'' read a banner in Bordeaux. ``No
teachers, no future,'' read one Paris banner. ``High schools must
change,'' read another.
	   Security was tight in Paris, where some 4,500 police were
mobilized. They used video cameras to try to spot troublemakers.
	   Shops, banks and cafes along the march route were shuttered up
and cars removed. Police checked identity papers of students who
streamed out of the subway to join the protest, making sure they
were of high school age.
	   Some teachers joined their students in protesting, saying they
fully understood their demands _ and their fears.
	   ``They're in the street because they're desperate,'' said
Veronique Heisserer, a history teacher. ``They're afraid of
unemployment. They think they have no future.''
	   Heisserer says she has 30 kids in her special education class in
Provins, south of Paris _ too many for her to handle alone.
	   ``The government pretends to listen, but it doesn't. Problems
are being papered over, but in the long run nothing changes,'' she
said.
	   Six weeks after the school year began, some students are still
without teachers. Many schools, especially in disadvantaged
neighborhoods, badly need modernizing.
	   Allegre is scheduled to meet Wednesday with students for the
second time, and new reform measures are expected to be announced.
	   The students were skeptical their demands would be satisfied.
	   ``I would be very surprised if the government can do anything,''
said Spresa Mamud, 15. ``It costs a lot of money. We won't see
anything, but we're fighting for those students who come after
us.''

	   PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) _ A United Nations team sent to assess
Kosovo's progress toward peace began work in the province Tuesday
and relief convoys resumed after missing a day due to renewed
violence.
	   Most of Kosovo seemed calm after a weekend of shelling and
shooting incidents. But the Serbs accused the guerrillas of another
attack on police, leaving lingering doubt about the future of the
U.S.-brokered agreement to end the violence.
	   NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark arrived in Belgrade for a
meeting Tuesday evening with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
_ presumably to tell him what must still be done to meet an Oct. 27
deadline to comply with the accord or face airstrikes.
	   Yugoslav army troops backed by Serbian police maintained an
increased and visible presence in the area where most of the
weekend attacks occurred, but a new incident was reported slightly
to the northwest.
	   The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug claimed a Serb
policeman was wounded Tuesday morning when ``terrorists'' attacked
a police patrol near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina. The incident could not be verified.
	   The troops are normally stationed in the capital of the Serbian
province, and therefore are allowed to remain in the province under
the withdrawal plan.
	   Relief convoys rolled again, with Mercy Corps International and
other humanitarian groups sending 150 tons of food, clothing,
mattresses and other items to the southwestern Kosovo town of
Djinovce.
	   Three other convoys also went out, including two from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees that were postponed Monday due to
the Serb military buildup after the weekend violence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic launched a
crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if
the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting, thousands
still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   The 20-member U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden,
includes representatives of human rights, humanitarian, political
and peacekeeping offices who will serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' de Mistura said, referring to the Oct. 12
agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder convinced cautious
Germans to elect his Social Democrats by promising not to change
much, just to do things better. Yet the plans unveiled Tuesday for
a new government promise fundamental shifts in German life, mainly
to the left.
	   From a loosening of Germany's blood-based citizenship law to a
commitment to end the use of nuclear energy, from a new effort to
compensate Holocaust victims to repeals of welfare state reforms,
the program defines a markedly different Germany than the one
Helmut Kohl led for 16 years.
	   ``This is the logical result of the election,'' said Schroeder,
who is to be confirmed as chancellor next Tuesday. ``The voters
gave the Social Democrats and Greens a clear mandate.''
	   Conservatives and even some in his own camp have charged
Schroeder with abandoning the business-friendly image he promoted
during his campaign in favor of a leftist agenda.
	   But Schroeder insisted the middle-of-the-road voters who put him
over the top would stick with him.
	   ``The `new center' ... they're not people who only think about
their own pocketbooks,'' he said, but are also interested in issues
like social equality and the environment.
	   Fulfilling a campaign promise, the program puts fighting
double-digit unemployment at the top of the government's priority
list. It proposes tax changes and cooperation with business and
labor to get Germans back to work.
	   But on its tax reform, the new government is accused of not
going far enough.
	   Germany's six leading economic institutes on Tuesday criticized
the tax reform plans _ stressing cuts for average wage-earners to
boost domestic demand _ as too limited to promote growth and job
creation.
	   Business groups called it a job-killer for raising the burden on
family-owned firms. Conservatives said repealing the limited
reforms Kohl pushed through _ to cut sick pay and pensions _ would
wreck the economic growth started under outgoing Chancellor Kohl.
	   Schroeder said he was sticking by his tax plans, while conceding
there was room for fine-tuning to help small businesses and
entrepreneurs, ``for example, possibilities for giving tax breaks
for investments.''
	   In another break from tradition, he indicated a desire for
greater political control over monetary policy by tacitly backing
calls by finance minister-designate Oskar Lafontaine, an old-style
leftist, for the German central bank to cut interest rates.
	   Kohl championed the independence of the Bundesbank and fought to
ensure the European Central Bank, which takes over when the new
single currency is introduced Jan. 1, would be just as free of
political meddling.
	   Other areas representing a change in direction include:
	   _planned energy tax hikes to promote conservation.
	   _adding ``sexual orientation'' to anti-discrimination laws and
extending eventual legal recognition to gay couples.
	   _letting parliament decide the future of a planned Holocaust
Memorial in Berlin. Kohl was its strongest backer, but Schroeder
has questioned the site and design.
	   _a reopening of government coffers to provide compensation to
``forgotten victims'' of the Holocaust, including gays, gypsies
deserters and others persecuted by the Nazis but not covered by
current law.
	   _another government foundation together with German firms to
compensate World War II-era slave laborers.
	   Schroeder and Greens leader Joschka Fischer, the designated
foreign minister and vice chancellor, said the speed with which the
parties were able to reach a coalition agreement showed the broad
support for the government's plans.
	   Both sides compromised, they said.
	   The Greens weren't able to liberalize asylum laws or get a
deadline for ending the use of nuclear energy, Fischer said.
	   The Social Democrats went further in loosening German
citizenship laws than they otherwise would have, Schroeder said.
	   The deal still must be approved at special party conventions
this weekend before Schroeder can be sworn in on Oct. 27 _ exactly
one month after the election.
	   But both sides said they expected to be able to keep to the
schedule, adding the ``spirit of fairness and cooperation'' that
characterized the dealings boded well for the government's future
functioning.

Army: grenade assailant also responsible for other attacks

CORRECTS in first graf that rabbi was slain in August sted
September. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian man arrested after throwing
hand grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron in
August, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained to use hand grenades, the army said.
	   After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed
responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The army said Sarsour confessed to the Beersheba attack and also
to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli soldiers in Hebron on
Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were
injured in that attack.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement Tuesday that
Sarsour was a double agent who had provided information to the
Israeli security service Shin Bet. After being blackmailed by his
Shin Bet handlers, who threatened to disclose his identity, Sarsour
carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement said.
	   In response to Monday's grenade attack, Israeli negotiators at
the Mideast summit in Maryland said they would only discuss
security-related issues with the Palestinians.
	   Israel has been bracing for a major terror attack by Hamas in
recent weeks, following Hamas threats to avenge the killings of two
of the group's top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   The army said Sarsour, a resident of Hebron, started out on the
fringes of Hamas, organizing rallies and spraying graffiti on
walls. He was jailed twice by Israel in 1989 and 1996 for such
activities, the army said.
	   On Aug. 20, Sarsour wandered into the Israeli-run part of
Hebron, planning to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiers, the army
said. When he didn't find a target, he climbed the fence of the
tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers.
	   He spotted Raanan in one of the trailers, climbed through the
window and stabbed him to death, the army said.
	   A few days later, Sarsour approached a Hamas leader and told him
he killed the rabbi. He then was recruited into the Hamas military
wing and was trained in throwing grenades.
	   On Sept. 30, Sarsour threw two hand grenades at Israeli soldiers
in Hebron, injuring both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians.
	   Over the weekend, he twice traveled to Jerusalem, armed with
fragmentation grenades, but returned to Hebron after not finding a
target, the army said.
	   On Monday, Sarsour headed to Beersheba. A plasterer by trade, he
hoped to find a day's work in the city and on the way home carry
out a grenade attack, the army said.
	   When Sarsour didn't find work, he walked to the central bus
station and threw two grenades at a bus stop. Among the 64 injured
were 24 soldiers, the army said.
	   The Palestinian Authority said that after Sarsour's identity
became known, Palestinian security forces arrested a friend of the
suspect who told them Sarsour was an Israeli agent.
	   The friend said Sarsour had received money from the Shin Bet in
exchange for information and that his handlers had given him a
mobile phone to make it easier for him to pass on information.
	   The friend said Sarsour carried out the attacks because he was
being blackmailed by the Shin Bet, the Palestinian statement said.
	   Sarsour, a father of five, is known to neighbors in Hebron as
``Sheik Salem'' because of his religious fervor. He wears a large
white prayer cap; his wife, Khaloud, wears a face veil in addition
to the headscarf that is the norm among observant Palestinian
women. A picture of Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin hangs in their
home.
	   Mrs. Sarsour said in an interview that she was not aware of her
husband being involved with Hamas.

Arbitration panel hands drug suspension to Italian cyclist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Italian cyclist Valentino Fois was
suspended until next April by an international arbitration panel
Tuesday for failing two drug tests.
	   The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeal of the
International Cycling Union against a ruling of the Italian Cycling
Federation.
	   The Italian federation had suspended Fois for eight months after
he tested positive for drugs during the Tour of Switzerland in June
1997 and the Tour of Poland in September 1997.
	   The Italian federation ruled that the two positive tests were
linked and constituted a single doping infraction.
	   But the UCI opposed the ruling, saying Fois should be punished
for two separate doping offenses. It appealed the case to the CAS.
	   A three-member CAS panel agreed with the UCI, saying that ``two
distinct infractions were committed by the rider.''
	   The CAS said it was imposing a 12-month suspension, with five
months suspended, starting Nov. 1. Since Fois has already served
two months, the CAS said he will be eligible to return to
competition on April 1, 1999.

Russia seeks foreign cash, not chickens and pork
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 14th graf with finance minister saying no more
than 20 billion rubles to be printed; ADDS in grafs 4 and 5 that
Russia has already received dlrs 4.8 billion from IMF and that
government plan expected this week. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government said Tuesday it wants cash
from an International Monetary Fund delegation in town for talks on
a frozen loan package, not handouts of chicken or pork.
	   ``The question of sending humanitarian aid to Russia ... will
not be discussed'' with the IMF officials who arrived Tuesday, said
Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin.
	   ``The IMF is not a charity institution,'' he said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, and has said it is counting on disbursement of a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package negotiated before the latest economic
crisis erupted in mid-August. Russia has already received dlrs 4.8
billion of the loan.
	   The IMF has said it won't hand over any more money until it sees
the government's plan to cope with the crisis, and signs that it is
being implemented. The Russian government has said it would release
the plan this week.
	   Russia is also suffering from one of the worst harvests in
decades. Coupled with a drop in imports caused by the crisis, that
has prompted the government to seek humanitarian aid from the
European Union and discuss grain sales with the United States.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said recently it was
necessary for the European Union to subsidize deliveries of chicken
and pork to prevent food shortages in Russia this winter and avert
social unrest.
	   The Russian government responded with a statement Monday
expressing gratitude and interest but reiterating its request for
new credits.
	   ``They offer pork and chicken instead of new loans,'' the
liberal daily Segodnya said in a front-page commentary on Tuesday.
``Food is a good thing, but Russian authorities expected to get
some money.''
	   The Kommersant business newspaper echoed that thought: ``A call
for humanitarian aid is merely a diplomatic way to soften the
refusal of loans.''
	   No serious food shortages are expected in Russia this winter,
although the government has set up a dlrs 600 million emergency
food reserve that could feed one-third of the population for two
weeks.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Tuesday the
government might print new money to pay its huge debts, but said
any boost in the money supply would be backed by an increase in
gold and foreign currency reserves.
	   Primakov insisted the amount would be ``very insignificant.'' A
return to the Soviet-era practice of paying bills by printing new
rubles would likely lead to high inflation.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said no more than 20 billion
new rubles (worth dlrs 1.16 billion) would be printed. He did not
say how the government would make up the rest of the 55 billion to
65 billion ruble (dlrs 3.2 billion to 3.8 billion) shortfall
between expected fourth-quarter revenues of 65 billion to 75
billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion to dlrs 4.4 billion) and
expenditures of 130 billion rubles (dlrs 7.6 billion).
	   Primakov said the government will pay all overdue wages to
government workers by the end of the year and to the military by
January. Pensioners will have to wait until the end of 1999 to
receive all their unpaid money.
	   Primakov blamed the economic policies of the previous government
for the current crisis and called for more state control over the
economy.
	   ``The state must assume regulatory functions and ensure order in
the country before real market relations take root,'' Primakov said
at a meeting with Russian industrialists.
	   He called for more government support to ailing Russian
industries and suggested cutting taxes to help them.

Milan prosecutor demands life sentence for Gucci's ex-wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A prosecutor here Tuesday demanded
conviction and life imprisonment for the ex-wife of fashion scion
Maurizio Gucci as well as for four co-defendants also charged with
his murder.
	   Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, was accused of
setting a murder plot in motion in order to gain control of his
multi-million-dollar estate.
	   Life imprisonment is the stiffest possible sentence in Italy,
which does not have the death penalty.
	   Gucci was gunned down on the steps to his Milan office on March
27, 1995.
	   Wrapping up his arguments to the jury of three judges and six
civilians, Prosecutor Carlo Nocerino also demanded convictions for
premeditated murder and life sentences for Reggiani Martinelli's
former confidente, Pina Auriemma; Ivano Savioni, a hotel porter;
pizzeria owner Orazio Cicala, and Benedetto Ceraulo, an auto
mechanic.
	   Reggiani Martinelli is accused of paying the equivalent of dlrs
375,000 to have her ex-spouse killed.
	   ``It is not without emotion that I ask for ... life
imprisonment,'' Nocerino, after two days of stitching together a
web of facts, emotions and relationships that has emerged in five
months of trial.
	   ``But then I thought about the absurd death of Maurizio Gucci,''
Nocerino said ``I called up in my mind his figure falling on the
steps, half turning as though to see who was gunning him down,''
Nocerino said.
	   ``Maurizio Gucci didn't deserve to die that way,'' said Nocerino
calling the murder a ``sad'' death that ended a dynasty.
	   Even though three of the five defendants confessed -- Pina
Auriemma, Ivano Savioni and Orazio Cicala -- Nocerino said they
didn't deserve softer sentences because they had all protected the
alleged killer, Benedetto Ceraulo, against whom the prosecutor has
the weakest case.
	   Ceraulo has declared himself innocent.
	   Nocerino dismissed out of hand Reggiani Martinelli's defense
that she wasn't fully in control of her senses following a brain
tumor operation in 1992. He contended that a year earlier she had
asked one of her servants to help find her a killer for her
ex-husband.
	   He also rejected the theory that her co-defendants plotted
without her knowledge and then blackmailed her for the murder.
	   ``Her determination to have her husband killed grew over time
and had nothing to do with a pathological condition,'' Nocerino
contended. ``It had to do with the wounded pride of a woman who was
abandoned by her husband, whose advice on his business affairs was
rejected, and who ultimately lost access to the empire that bore
his name.''
	   Closing arguments from the defense are expected to last into
next week.
	   The prosecutor highlighted what he described as petty
motivations.
	   For Nocerino, the driver of the getaway car had a bad gambling
habit; the alleged trigger-man needed cash to finish building a new
house; the hotel porter was mired in petty drug deals, and Auriemma
was living off the charity of Reggiani Martinelli.

Wisla Krakow draws with AC Parma 1-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ AC Parma squandered Enrico Chiesa's
second-minute strike as Wisla Krakow hit back for a 1-1 tie in a
UEFA Cup second round, first leg game Tuesday.
	   Parma took an early lead when Argentina midfielder Juan Veron
curled over a corner kick to Chiesa who headed past Wisla 'keeper
Artur Sarnat.
	   Although the goal spurred Wisla into action before 10,000 fans,
the home team had to wait until the 68th minute for an equalizer by
the team's captain, Tomasz Kulawik, after a well-placed pass from
Tomasz Frankowski.
	   The second leg in Parma is Nov. 3.

Bologna defeats Prague 2-1 in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Swedish midfielder Klas Ingesson headed in
the game winner with six minutes left Tuesday as Bologna downed
Slavia Prague 2-1 in a first leg second-round match of the UEFA
Cup.
	   Ingesson's goal, from a few meters on a long cross by defender
Carlo Nervo, gave the Italian first-division team a deserved
victory.
	   Bologna, playing at home at Dall'Ara stadium, wasted some clear
scoring chances with midfielder Giancarlo Marocchi and Swedish
centerforward Kennet Andersson during a goalless first half.
	   Italian striker Giuseppe Signori gave the home team a 1-0 lead
with a precise diagonal left shot in the 51st minute.
	   As the Italian team retreated to defend the narrow advantage,
defender Richard Dostalek kicked in from a few meters the equalizer
for the Czech team, in the 67th minute.
	   Ingesson's winner boosted Bologna chances to survive the Nov. 3
second-leg match on the road.
	   ``We defeated a strong opponent,'' said Bologna's coach Carlo
Mazzone, who suffered an upset elimination by the Czech team in the
UEFA Cup quarterfinals in 1996, when he led AS Roma.
	   ``We can expect a tough second leg. By then however we could
recover some of the injured players,'' Mazzone said.
	   The Italian coach was especially happy with the goal by Signori,
his first with Bologna this season.
	   Signori, the top league scorer with Lazio in 1993 and 1994,
joined Bologna in the offseason, after being sidelined for a long
period with a back injury.
	   About 12,000 watched the match.

Partial official results confirm opposition lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Initial official results confirmed
Tuesday an opposition coalition's lead over the incumbent
ex-Communists in Macedonia's weekend first-round parliamentary
elections.
	   But the partial data announced by the state electoral commission
suggested that the winner of Macedonia's third post-independence
balloting would be determined in the second round due on Nov.1.
	   Under a complicated voting system, only about one-third of the
parliament's 120 seats were up for grabs in voting last Sunday.
	   Ljiljana Ristova, who heads the electoral commission, said the
opposition coalition secured six seats in the first round, while
the ruling Social Democrats gained one.
	   An ethnic Albanian party won seven seats. Ethnic Albanians make
up about 23 percent of Macedonia's population, with most of them
living in western Macedonia.
	   According to Ristova, the partial results released Tuesday
showed no indication as to which of the rival parties would have a
strong enough lead to form a government. The remainder of results
for Sunday's balloting are expected Wednesday.
	   The former Communists led the country peacefully to independence
from Yugoslavia in 1992. But the predominately young opposition
coalition wants to see radical political and economic reforms.
	   On Monday the opposition declared victory, saying their vote
count showed 44 of their deputies had been elected in the first
round. The incumbents disputed the claim, citing another procedure
for vote count. Late Monday Ristova backed the incumbents.
	   The debate could lead to political tension in Macedonia, the
only former Yugoslav republic to gain independence without
bloodshed. Ljubco Georgievski, one of the opposition leaders, said
they would take the matter to the Macedonian courts.
	   ``We will prove our victory in the second round of elections,''
he said.
	   Branko Crvenkovski, the Prime Minister and the leader of the
Social Democrats, said the opposition leaders ``can only blame
themselves for not obtaining the right interpretation of the
counting procedure.''
	   Macedonia, with a population of about 2 million, was the poorest
of the six republics in the communist-era Yugoslav federation. Its
present economy remains feeble, with 30 percent unemployment and an
average salary of $210 a month.
	   Situated near the volatile Serbian province of Kosovo in
Yugoslavia, Macedonia has disputes with all its neighbors. It also
has a restive ethnic Albanian minority.

Two army officers killed in Indian helicopter crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian army helicopter flying to the
Indo-Tibetan border hit a cable Tuesday and crashed, killing two
officers, domestic news agencies reported.
	   The helicopter was on a mission to make contact with an army
patrol group and drop essential supplies at their camp in the
Himalayan mountains, the United News of India said.
	   The helicopter was flying at a height of 8,000 feet (2,400
meters) when it hit the cable and crashed near the Sangla Valley.
It was not clear from the report if there were any cable cars,
which are popular with tourists in the area, when the crash
occurred or if anyone else was hurt.
	   According to the UNI, witnesses said the helicopter took a few
flips before plunging to the ground.
	   Local officials have located the bodies of the two officers and
have handed them over to the army, UNI said.

Leftist rebels bomb house of government minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Leftist rebels Tuesday bombed the home
of a senior government minister in the southern Indian state of
Andhra Pradesh, police said.
	   Mandava Venkateshwara Rao, minister for excise and prohibition,
was not at home when 15 armed men attacked his house. The
attackers, members of the outlawed People's War Group, asked all
residents to come out and then blasted the house with dynamite and
gelatin sticks, police said. The building was completely destroyed.
	   Rao's family home is in Nizamabad, 1,100 kilometers (650 miles)
south of the Indian capital New Delhi.
	   The attackers left behind a note saying they had destroyed Rao's
house in retaliation for the killing of several of their comrades
in what they said were fake gunbattles engineered by the police.
Police deny the charge.
	   It was not clear why the attackers linked Rao to the police
gunbattles, but the Press Trust of India news agency reported that
Rao had earlier been kidnapped by the PWG in 1989 and released
after two days. Rao represents the Dichipalli constituency in
Andhra Pradesh which is known to be a hotbed of PGW activities.
	   The PWG rebels, who are called naxalites in India, are fighting
for the establishment of a Maoist-Leninist state. They mostly
target rich land owners, accusing them of exploiting landless farm
hands. The rebels also attack police and administration officials,
accusing them of colluding with the land owners to deny
agricultural workers their rights.
	   Tuesday's explosion followed a string of attacks by the PWG on
government and public property. On Saturday, they bombed a police
station killing two policemen and one civilian and stole 31
weapons.
	   On Sunday, members of the PWG bombed a court building in
Nizamabad injuring two people. On Monday, they set on fire two
state-owned buses.
	   More than 300 people have died in naxalite related violence this
year, 24 of them policemen.

Angolan court convicts South Africans, Belgian over illegal flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ An Angolan court Tuesday convicted seven
South Africans, a Belgian and a Congolese on charges that they
endangered state security by flying a cargo plane into off-limit
areas held by former rebels, news reports said.
	   A provincial court in Menongue, 800 kilometers (500 miles)
southeast of the capital Luanda, handed down jail terms of 11 years
for three of the South Africans and a Congolese who were tried in
their absence, state news agency Angop reported.
	   The three South African crew members _ identified as Mark
Jeffries, Peter Bitzker and Johannes Parreira _ and the co-pilot
from Democratic Republic of the Congo, named as Antonino Shungu,
escaped from a Luanda prison earlier this year while awaiting
trial.
	   Two other South Africans, Hans Vander and Martin Stinne, and
Belgian pilot Marc Winnen were given eight-year sentences, Angop
reported.
	   Two further South Africans, Rudi Johannes and Gert Steyn,
received two years, according to the report.
	   They are to serve their sentences in Menongue prison. It was not
immediately clear whether they would appeal.
	   The men were detained in January when their South
Africa-registered DC-4 plane was intercepted by an Angolan Air
Force MiG.
	   The court found that the plane was taking diamond-mining and
construction equipment to the former rebel movement UNITA's base in
the remote central highland town of Andulo, 480 kilometers (300
miles) southeast of the capital Luanda.
	   The prosecution said the flight was in violation of a U.N.
Security Council ban on air travel imposed last year on the UNITA
rebel movement. UNITA is a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   The aircraft's log book said it took off from Johannesburg's
Lanseria Airport and was headed to Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, which borders Angola in the north.
	   The U.N. sanctions were designed to push UNITA into complying
with the country's 1994 peace accord which ended a two-decade civil
war between the government and guerrillas.
	   Implementation of the deal is running far behind schedule.
	   UNITA earns over dlrs 300 million a year from its diamond
operations, mostly in northeastern Angola, and some of the revenue
is believed to have been spent on weaponry which is flown into
remote, makeshift airstrips.
	   The aircraft at the center of Tuesday's court verdict was the
first to be captured under the sanctions. The vast southwest
African nation's long borders and deficient radar have made
policing Angola's air space difficult.

	   PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) _ A U.N. team sent to assess Kosovo's
progress toward peace began work Tuesday in the province and relief
convoys resumed after missing a day due to renewed violence.

deadline to comply with the accord or face airstrikes.
	   Yugoslav army troops backed by Serbian police maintained an
increased and visible presence in the area where most of the
weekend attacks occurred, but a new incident was reported slightly
to the northwest.
	   The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug claimed a Serb
policeman was wounded Tuesday morning when ``terrorists'' attacked
a police patrol near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina. The incident could not be verified.
	   The troops are normally stationed in the capital of the Serbian
province, and therefore are allowed to remain in the province under
the withdrawal plan.
	   Relief convoys rolled again, with Mercy Corps International and
other humanitarian groups sending 150 tons of food, clothing,
mattresses and other items to the southwestern Kosovo town of
Djinovce.
	   Three other convoys also went out, including two from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees that were postponed Monday due to
the Serb military buildup after the weekend violence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic launched a
crackdown Feb. 28 on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   As winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if
the estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting, thousands
still living in the open, are not allowed to return home.
	   The 20-member U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden,
includes representatives of human rights, humanitarian, political
and peacekeeping offices who will serve as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' de Mistura said, referring to the Oct. 12
agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated Tuesday that
Western nations oppose independence for Kosovo for fear that a
border change in the volatile Balkans would lead to problems
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   As part of last week's agreement, a 2,000-member international
verification force is being organized by the 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to ensure that Yugoslavia
honors its promises. About 25 members of an advance team for the
monitors are in Kosovo.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) - A Latvian bomb squad destroyed a suspected
postal bomb at the Israeli embassy in Riga, according to a report
by the Baltic News Service.
	   The Israeli embassy called in the squad after coming across a
suspicious package during a routine check of incoming mail on
Monday, the report said.
	   As of Tuesday, police hadn't determined whether the package was
a bomb.
	   There have been several unexplained bombings in Latvia this
year, including one that went off outside the Riga synagogue in
April.

Ukraine's leaders pledge favorable conditions for foreign
</HEADLINE>
investors &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government is stepping up efforts
to attract more foreign investment, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko said Tuesday.
	   Ukraine plans to invite foreign companies to invest in its
energy and telecommunications sectors, agriculture and in
construction of oil pipelines, Pustovoitenko said at a round table
in Kiev organized by the Economist magazine.
	   He added that the government would remain ``absolutely committed
to the guarantees it gives foreign investors.''
	   Ukraine has failed to meet its privatization targets over the
past few years and foreign investors remain wary about putting
their money into this former Soviet republic, citing an unstable
tax and legal environment and absence of reforms needed to boost
economic activity.
	   The government has raised only 360 million hryvna (dlrs 99
million at the current rate) from privatization so far this year,
remaining far behind the 1998 target of 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 292
million), said Pustovoitenko.
	   The recent economic crisis in neighboring Russia dealt a new
blow to Ukraine, scaring most foreign investors away.
	   The Cabinet's privatization agency has already canceled dozens
of privatization tenders this year, failing to draw at least one
bidder, while the country's stock market became virtually
non-existent because there was no demand for shares in Ukrainian
enterprises.
	   However, Ukrainian leaders defended their slow reform policies
Tuesday, claiming they had helped to avoid a serious financial
crisis that has swept emerging markets worldwide.
	   ``Ukraine has been criticized for what some experts labeled as
slow pace of reforms, but it was the policy of reasonable
conservatism that saved us from dangerous cataclysms some countries
have endured,'' President Leonid Kuchma told the meeting.
	   He said the government would submit to parliament a draft law on
privatizating the telecommunications monopoly, widely considered
Ukraine's most attractive company.
	   Telecommunications enterprises are on the list of companies
banned from privatization in Ukraine, and parliament would have to
approve a special law to permit selling off Ukrtelecom.
	   Pustovoitenko has said the government could raise up to dlrs 2
billion by selling a 25 percent stake in the telecommunications
company.

Yeltsin issues decree limiting mass protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has set limits on when and
for how long protests can be held in Moscow, Russian news agencies
said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin signed a decree saying protests in the Russian capital
cannot last longer than five days and must be held between 7 a.m.
to 10 p.m.
	   The reports from the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies gave
no more information.
	   The decree appears aimed at preventing protests similar to one
coal miners held for four months outside the Russian government
headquarters to push their demands for overdue wages and Yeltsin's
resignation.
	   The last two dozen miners took down their tents and went home
earlier this month.

Bar-crossed killers walk free from Northern Ireland prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NIreland-Bloody Sunday &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In a prison full of hate, Billy
Corry and Anna Moore found love, culminating in a jailhouse
wedding.
	   Tuesday, they walked free together _ despite their life
sentences for bombings that killed a total of 20 people _ under the
terms of the Northern Ireland peace accord.
	   Mrs. Corry and her husband both killed for their cause _ on
opposite sides of Northern Ireland's long-running conflict.
	   She was convicted of killing 17 people by blowing up a
Protestant-owned disco on behalf of the Irish National Liberation
Army in 1982, though she later broke ties with the outlawed
anti-British group and tried to apologize to her victims.
	   He spent 12 years in prison after admitting he bombed a Catholic
pub in 1972, killing three people. He was acting on behalf of the
Ulster Volunteer Force as part of the pro-British gang's efforts to
defend Northern Ireland's links with Britain.
	   In Maghaberry prison, British authorities tried to mix
Protestant and Catholic prisoners, but Corry, 47, and the woman who
became his wife, 50, still couldn't meet eye to eye because the few
dozen female prisoners were kept completely separate from the men.
	   The couple instead befriended each other by letter _ bonding
partly over Mrs. Corry's decision to leave behind her childhood
Catholicism and be ``born again'' though the prison's Protestant
chaplains. They were allowed to wed inside the jail in 1993, though
they continued to be held in separate sections.
	   Also paroled Tuesday was William Bell, a Protestant extremist
who helped kill the father of Northern Ireland's best-known
stand-up comedian, Patrick Kielty, in 1988.
	   Tuesday's releases meant 142 out of more than 400 eligible
prisoners have been freed early as a reward for continuing
cease-fires.
	   In another development, a judge convicted three INLA inmates of
the anti-terrorist Maze prison of killing Northern Ireland's most
notorious Protestant militant inside the supposedly
maximum-security installation.
	   Christopher McWilliams, John Kennaway and John Glennon _ already
serving sentences for murder and arms possession _ smiled as they
each received concurrent life and 20-year sentences for murder and
for possessing two smuggled-in handguns used in the Dec. 27
slaying.
	   The trio's decision to kill Billy ``King Rat'' Wright _
commander of a ruthless gang called the Loyalist Volunteer Force
whose members were incarcerated nearby the INLA's own cells _
triggered weeks of retaliatory killings of Catholic civilians that
threatened the peace negotiations.
	   April's agreement among eight parties indicated that INLA
prisoners should be excluded from early paroles because, unlike
their bigger Irish Republican Army rivals, their group refused to
observe a truce during the negotiations.
	   Mrs. Corry was paroled because of her public decision to reject
the INLA.

Swiss authorities order confiscation of dlrs 114 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with further details from prosecutors. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's federal prosecutor on
Tuesday ordered the confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts
in Switzerland and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation into
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of trials
in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment
during his brother's 1988-1994 administration.
	   Carla del Ponte said the investigation had concluded that funds
in the accounts, of which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner, came
partly from protection payoffs from drug traffickers.
	   The Swiss discontinued their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but said
their findings ``inevitably suggest money laundering'' of drug
profits.
	   Del Ponte said Switzerland couldn't itself try Salinas as he is
imprisoned in Mexico. Mexican proceedings against Salinas and
others on money laundering charges made a Swiss criminal case
unnecessary, she added.
	   Most of the money seized _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered
confiscated is in Swiss bank accounts. But a further dlrs 24.5
million is in London, administered by a Swiss-based financial
institution.
	   Salinas' lawyers can appeal the decision, taken Monday, within
ten days. That would send the case to Switzerland's supreme court,
but Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' it would uphold the
seizure.
	   Both Del Ponte and Roschacher declined to say whether
investigations had shown that Mexico's former president was
involved with drug money. Carlos Salinas, who moved to Ireland
shortly after leaving office, has been charged with no crime.
	   Denying links to drug traffickers, Raul Salinas has said the
money in the Swiss accounts was an investment fund pooled by
several wealthy friends.
	   But Del Ponte said ``the business dealings he claims are beyond
all economic logic.''
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, after
agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs
destined for the United States could be transported through Mexico
on certain routes.
	   ``With all his contacts and his power, he could guarantee
protection for those loads,'' Roschacher added. Salinas' contacts
with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and became more intense
under his brother's presidency in the early 1990s, he continued.
	   Seven countries including Mexico and the United States
collaborated with the Swiss inquiry. Six U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration analysts helped with the investigation in Bern at
various points, Roschacher said.
	   The investigators interviewed 78 witnesses, 31 of them bank
employees, and 16 of them had to testify anonymously for their own
safety, Roschacher said. Raul Salinas himself was questioned four
times.
	   A number of witnesses have been killed in Mexico in the course
of the investigation, he added.
	   Swiss authorities did not release the full 230-page police
report on Salinas.
	   Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995. Some dlrs
7.8 million have since been unblocked as the money was proved
unlinked to drugs or protection payments, Del Ponte said.
	   Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges
of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco
Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel
government post in his brother's administration.
	   No drug-related charges have been brought against Salinas and he
was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.

Nigerian town, devastated by gasoline blast, struggles for hope

	   JESSE, Nigeria _ The hospitals are overwhelmed, the burn victims
are afraid of arrest, parts of this southern Nigeria town are a
charred ruin. For those devastated by a deadly fireball, there was
little hope to go around Tuesday.
	   ``See me now,'' said Dorcas Oboh, a farmer scarred with burns,
bandages running the length of both legs as she sat in a local
hospital. ``I am finished.''
	   Oboh denied that she was trying to scavenge gasoline spilling
from a pipeline _ which authorities say up to 1,000 other people
were doing when the explosion ripped through Jesse on Saturday,
killing at least 500 people.
	   ``I only wanted to see what they were doing. I went to look,''
she said. Now her wounds are oozing and pain wracks her body. She
worries about what will happen to her cassava field.
	   ``I am finished,'' she repeated.
	   But at least Oboh is getting treatment. Family and friends of
some other burn victims are pulling the injured out of hospitals,
fearing they may be arrested for theft, medical workers and
newspapers said.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
in the weekend incident in Jesse, some 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a local medical worker said
patients at a number of hospitals had been withdrawn, particularly
when people heard that Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigeria's head of
state, was coming to visit Monday.
	   Nigerian newspapers also reported heavy hospital discharges,
though no figures were available.
	   Abubakar said during his brief Monday visit that the government
would pay for medical care, but that no compensation would be paid
to the families of the dead, apparently because many were believed
to be scavenging fuel.
	   But even for those who remained hospitalized, believed to be
around 100 people, there was little hope.
	   The area's hospitals _ most with only a few doctors and nurses
and little for burn care _ were quickly overwhelmed. Medicine was
in short supply, doctors overworked and sterile surroundings all
but impossible. Hundreds of people were believed to be suffering at
home, without painkillers, from the agonies of burns.
	   ``We simply had to lock up our gate, we could not cope,'' said a
doctor at Okparavero Memorial Hospital in the nearby town of
Sapele, who also spoke on condition anonymity. ``Virtually
everybody coming into this hospital and other hospitals came with
100 percent burns. As they came in, they were dying.''
	   Eight burn victims were brought to the town hospital Saturday _
a small figure but still far too many for the hospital _ and six
have died.
	   ``The mortality rate is high, very very high,'' he said before
going back to work.
	   On Tuesday, black smoke still billowed into the sky and flames
occasionally shot into the air over Jesse.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the blaze and were waiting
for the fire to burn itself out. But thousands of gallons of fuel
remained in the Jesse section of the pipeline _ which runs a total
nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) from the southeastern city of
Warri to the northern city of Kaduna. There is no security for the
above-ground pipeline, not even coils of barbed wire.
	   Mass burials were continuing in the town, with construction
equipment ripping holes in the ground for the rapidly decaying
bodies. The stench of the corpses hung thickly in the town, and
workers had to continually leave the area to catch their breath.
	   When the conflagration occurred, many of the victims had
apparently been pressing against a concrete well where the fuel had
been pooling. Bodies were found still clutching plastic cans and
funnels they planned to use to take the fuel.
	   An official for Nigeria's state petroleum corporation, speaking
on condition of anonymity, has said authorities believed the
pipeline had purposely been punctured, and that scavengers' tools
sparked the explosion. Some newspaper reports said a cigarette may
have started the conflagration.
	   In the southeastern Niger River delta region, an oil-rich area
scarred by poverty, scooping up bucketfuls of gasoline from a
pipeline is not as improbable as it sounds.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, but its
petroleum industry, crippled by corruption and mismanagement,
barely functions.
	   Most of the nation's refineries don't work and much of Nigeria's
gasoline is imported. Lineups at gas pumps can last for days and
black market prices are often marked up 1,000 percent.
	   ``When you deny people of petrol, it creates a black market, it
creates illegal hawkers,'' said Ighotota Amori, a local politician.
``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the government is to
blame for this mess.''

Cook says West will oppose separatist aspirations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Western nations will continue opposing
the aspirations of ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo for full
independence from Yugoslavia, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Tuesday.
	   He said Britain is ``firmly committed to the territorial
integrity and security of the countries in this region.''
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters after
talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   ``The international community has never given its support to an
independent Kosovo. We believe that the way forward is for the
countries of the region to cooperate together to break down the
barriers between them rather than to try to create new
boundaries,'' Cook told a news conference.
	   He also said the people of Kosovo do not accept autonomy as a
sufficient statement of their aspirations and that it is the right
of the Kosovars to run their own affairs and to have control on
their own police.
	   ``That is why we have called for the self-government of
Kosovo,'' Cook said and added that there should be elections within
the next nine months and that those elections should be supervised
``not by Belgrade but by the OSCE.''
	   Cook arrived late Monday on the first stop on his Balkan tour,
then flew on to Macedonia for a meeting with President Kiro
Gligorov on Tuesday night. Before leaving for Romania, he was to
meet in Skopje on Wednesday with other Macedonian officials and
with Kosovo Albanian leader Fehmi Agani.
	   On Monday, Cook said in London that Britain will continue
pressuring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure he
complies with agreements made to end civilian deaths and fighting
in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people on both sides have been killed during more
than seven months of clashes between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. Some 300,000 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been displaced from their homes in the province,
which is predominantly ethnic Albanian.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Some 300,000 high school students took to the
streets of France Tuesday to protest school conditions in a second
round of nationwide marches that were again marred by hooligans
throwing bottles and smashing windows.
	   Despite intensive efforts by student leaders to attract support,
the protesters failed to build on the momentum of last week's
protests, which drew a half-million marchers.
	   In Paris, helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from aerosol
cans to disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a posh
Left Bank neighborhood and set fire to a metro car, temporarily
interrupting service on one line.
	   Many of the hooligans were older than the high school students,
who insist the troublemakers have no connection to their movement.
	   Police said 85 people were lightly injured in Paris. At least 45
young people were arrested nationwide, and dozens of others were
detained and then released.
	   About 25,000 students marched in Paris _ far below the hoped-for
45,000 demonstrators.

Palestinian lawmakers concessions not accepted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) - The Palestinian legislature on
Tuesday said any agreement signed at a critical Mideast summit must
satisfy a list of demands and indicated that it would not approve
further concessions to Israel.
	   In a statement after a weekly session, the 88-member Palestinian
Legislative Council said it would like to see a summit agreement
``that would put an end to the continuous deterioration in the
peace process.''
	   For an agreement to be ``accepted and vital,'', the council said
it must guarantee that Israel complete promised withdrawals from
West Bank areas and secures the prompt release of nearly 3,000
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
	   The statement increased pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to return home with solutions that would satisfy an
increasingly frustrated public.
	   ``Pressure must be exerted (on Israel) to reach an agreement
that will be fully implemented with no bargaining,'' said
Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi.
	   The summit on Maryland's eastern shore has yielded little
progress in the five days of meetings between Israeli and
Palestinian officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
insisting the Palestinians accept a tough program to fight terror
before he will agree to Palestinian demands.
	   The sides are trying to reach a deal to end months of deadlock
which has helped feed a renewed climate of violence.
	   The council blamed Israel for the absence of a deal thus far and
said violence could escalate without one.
	   On Monday, a Palestinian man hurled two hand grenades near a bus
stop crowded with Israeli soldiers and civilians, injuring at least
64 people.

	   SENAKI, Georgia (AP) _ Most of the soldiers who mutinied against
the Georgian government were back in their garrison by Tuesday, and
the tanks, trucks and machine guns they'd used to block roads were
returned to the army's arsenal.
	   However, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said the leader
of the one-day revolt and 15 to 20 of his supporters were believed
to be hiding in a forest. The leader, Akakiy Eliava, and some of
his men have been charged with treason.
	   ``This group will be found and tried,'' Shevardnadze told a news
conference in capital Tbilisi. The revolt ``was a move against the
country's independence and democracy.''
	   Initial reports put the number of mutineers at about 200, but
military officers in Senaki said Tuesday the number of troops
involved was closer to 50. Others were local residents who joined
in the revolt.
	   The soldiers, who are fiercely opposed to Shevardnadze, took
over their garrison in the western town of Senaki on Monday and
advanced toward the heart of Georgia.
	   Troops were sent to intercept rebels on the road to Georgia's
second-largest city, Kutaisi, some 230 kilometers (140 miles) west
of the Tbilisi. At least one soldier and four mutineers were killed
in clashes.
	   After talks with government negotiators, the rebel troops agreed
to return to their garrison at Senaki, about 50 kilometers (31
miles) west of Kutaisi. The majority were back in their barracks by
Tuesday, military officials said.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
over the violence and voiced support for Shevardnadze and ``the
stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.
	   He called on Georgia's opposition on Monday ``to resolve their
differences with the government through peaceful and democratic
means rather than by armed confrontation.''
	   Eliava, the leader of the revolt, is a military commander who is
also a supporter of the late Georgian president, Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in
1991, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in a bid to
return to power. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blames Gamsakhurdia's supporters for the Feb. 9 attack
on his motorcade that killed two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards. At
least eight suspects have been arrested.
	   Also Tuesday, an international Caspian Sea oil consortium
resumed construction of a pipeline through Georgia, Shevardnadze
said. The Azerbaijani International Operating Company had halted
construction Monday because of the revolt.

Nine ethnic Albanians face charges in Macedonia

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Nine ethnic Albanians in Macedonia face
charges for illegal possession of weapons, the interior ministry
said Tuesday.
	   The nine were arrested in the town of Kicevo, some 120
kilometers west of the capital Skopje. A number of weapons smuggled
in from neighboring Albania were found in their homes, police said.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 percent of Macedonia's population.
They live mostly in western Macedonia. Dozens have been arrested in
the past several months for arms smuggling and in connection with a
series of bomb attacks in Macedonia last year and earlier this
year.
	   There are fears that bloodshed between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province, in neighboring Yugoslavia, could
spill over to Macedonia.

German team members react angrily to doping claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German national team swimmers reacted angrily
Tuesday to claims by two teammates that performance-enhancing drugs
like EPO and testosterone are in heavy use.
	   But accusations by swimmers Chris-Carol Bremer and Mark Warnecke
drew guarded support from the chairman of the anti-doping
commission of FINA, the governing body of world swimming.
	   ``I wouldn't have said it like that since there is no proof, but
when you go through the swimming pools at the competitions, there
are too many hints that something is going on,'' Harm Beyer told
The Associated Press.
	   ``It's just a feeling I have, but you hear deep voices, you see
acne and you see sudden improvements in times. This is an
indication that something is used to improve the performance of
swimmers,'' added Beyer, a former president of the German Swim
Federation.
	   Bremer and Warnecke told Germany's ARD Television Sunday that
banned substances were systematically being used.
	   ``You'll find testosterone and EPO in the pockets of swimmers
everywhere in the world,'' said Warnecke, an Olympic bronze
medalist.
	   ``With the help of good sports doctor, you can regulate it so
that someone is doped the entire year. When it's done right, it
can't be detected at any testing.''
	   Bremer, who won bronze at the 1994 worlds in Rome, said all that
was needed to avoid detection was the ``expertise'' of a laboratory
and a doctor.
	   ``It's no secret that one can get around doping controls without
any problem,'' Bremer said. ``It's possible to swallow a pill at
night and mornings, when the controller comes, there's nothing that
can be proved. All that's picked up are the mistakes.''
	   Both the German Sports Federation and German Swim Federation
said Monday they would question the two swimmers this week.
	   But teammates of the two, in an interview with the Berlin daily
B.Z. published Tuesday, scoffed at the accusations.
	   ``Those two are crazy,'' said Ralf Braun, a silver medalist at
last year's world championships in Perth, Australia.
	   ``They're smearing the reputation of the entire team,'' said
Steffen Zesner, a member of Germany's 1996 Olympic team. ``I've
never seen pills in a swim hall. I've also never seen someone
handed tablets.''
	   EPO, or erythropoietin, is a banned drug that boosts oxygen
absorption in the bloodstream and is the substance that set off a
scandal on the recent Tour de France.
	   Testosterone is a male sex hormone also used by athletes to
boost performance.
	   Wilhelm Schaenzer, head of the highly-regarded drug testing
institution in Cologne, said he wasn't surprised at the two
swimmers' remarks.
	   ``We've assumed for several years that at the top sports levels
doping with testosterone takes place,'' Schaenzer said in a
television interview. ``But it's not just swimming, other sports
are also affected.''
	   In a related development, the U.S. Olympic Committee said Monday
it was preparing to ask for ``appropriate medal recognition'' for
the American women's 400-meter medley relay team from the 1976
Summer Games.
	   The USOC says a German court case has provided irrefutable
evidence that one of the Germans on the winning team was helped by
illegal performance-enhancing drugs. The Americans finished second.

Turkey says rebel Kurdish leader moved to Russia

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In a possible indication that Damascus was
meeting Ankara's demands to clamp down on a rebel Kurdish group,
Turkey's prime minister said Tuesday that the rebel's leader was no
longer in Syria but in Russia.
	   Tensions between neighbors Turkey and Syria had been running
high for the past few weeks after Ankara suggested it might resort
to military action to stop what it denounced as Syria's sheltering
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and members of his outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK.
	   Turkish Premier Mesut Yilmaz told reporters Ocalan had been
located in a Moscow suburb and had been in hiding in Russia for the
past week. He said Turkey had made a request for his extradition.
	   In Moscow, the foreign ministry said it had no information about
Ocalan entering Russia.
	   Ocalan in a statement made to a Kurdish news agency Monday
claimed he was somewhere in Kurdistan, a region which stretches
over parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984 in a war that has cost the lives of close to
37,000 people. Turkey says the PKK held several camps in Syria and
in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.
	   Yilmaz's claim that Ocalan was in Russia came as Turkish and
Syrian security officials met in the southern Turkish town of
Seyhan, near Adana, some 550 kilometers (344 miles) from Ankara,
for a second day running to discuss the latest crisis.
	   Turkey's defense minister Ismet Sezgin described the talks,
which were reported still continuing Tuesday evening, as
``positive'' but indicated he wanted to see concrete evidence that
Syria was cracking down on Ocalan's group.
	   ``Syria has understood the Turkish side's demands and is on the
verge of meeting them,'' Sezgin said.
	   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said Turkey wanted a way
to verify if Syria had halted alleged support for the rebels.
	   Despite signs of an ease in tensions, Ankara moved several tanks
and armored personnel carriers to the Turkish-Syrian border in
preparation for exercises planned for the first week of November,
private NTV news channel reported Tuesday.
	   Fears of a regional conflict have led to various mediation
attempts by Egypt and Iran.
	   Analysts believe that Turkey may resort to pinpoint attacks on
rebel targets in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon if the security
talks fail.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow
their president captured 16 Zimbabwean soldiers in eastern Congo,
state television reported Tuesday, in the first evidence of
Zimbabwean involvement in the region.
	   The defense ministry confirmed the soldiers were disarmed and
taken prisoner Monday after their troop carrier airplane landed
near the eastern town of Kabalo, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
	   The ministry said the airplane crew mistakenly believed the town
was controlled by President Laurent Kabila's troops, not by the
rebels fighting to topple him, the television said.
	   Later Tuesday, the Zimbabwe Foreign Ministry said a summit of
leaders from southern Africa who are backing Kabila with troops
would planned for Wednesday in Harare.
	   Kabila was expected to join Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe,
President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Namibia's Sam Nujoma in
the Zimbabwean capital, the foreign ministry said.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa met Tuesday with Mugabe, the
official state news agency said.
	   Tanzania's elder statesman, former President Julius Nyerere,
also spoke with Mugabe by telephone on Monday. Tanzania withdrew
military trainers from Congo in August.
	   Rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, have been making steady
gains in eastern Congo since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   Speaking from their eastern stronghold of Goma, the rebels said
the Zimbabweans were taken prisoner in recent fighting.
	   ``They are being treated as prisoners of war,'' rebel leader
Arthur Ngoma said by telephone.
	   Officials in Rwanda, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the prisoners were being held in Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles)
southwest of Goma, which fell to the rebels 10 days ago.
	   Zimbabwe has strike jets, helicopters and transporters
supporting its 3,000 troops deployed in the Congo.
	   Zimbabwean and allied southern African troops from Angola and
Namibia repulsed a rebel advance on the Congolese capital,
Kinshasa, in August.
	   Last week, Mugabe met with Kabila and said the allies were
considering advancing on rebel strongholds in the east.
	   Zimbabwe has admitted nine of its soldiers have died in the
fighting.
	   Until now, there have been no signs of Zimbabwe's involvement in
eastern Congo, where the rebels reportedly advanced towards
Mbuji-Mayi, capital of the diamond-rich Eastern Kasai Province,
after capturing Kindu and its airport.
	   In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has launched another
attempt to get Kabila and the rebels to negotiate directly.
	   He met on Monday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in
Pretoria and said on Tuesday he was satisfied with the talks.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. The two
countries say they have legitimate security interests in Congo and
accuse Kabila of failing to rid their common border of Rwandan and
Ugandan rebels.

Palestinian lawmakers concessions not accepted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian legislature said any
agreement signed at a critical Mideast summit must satisfy a list
of demands and indicated Tuesday that it would not approve further
concessions to Israel.
	   In a Tuesday statement after a weekly session, the 88-member
Palestinian Legislative Council said it would like to see a summit
agreement ``that would put an end to the continuous deterioration
in the peace process.''
	   For an agreement to be ``accepted and vital,'' the council said
it must guarantee that Israel complete promised withdrawals from
West Bank areas and secures the prompt release of nearly 3,000
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
	   The statement increased pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to return home with solutions that would satisfy an
increasingly frustrated public.
	   ``Pressure must be exerted (on Israel) to reach an agreement
that will be fully implemented with no bargaining,'' said
Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi.
	   The summit on Maryland's eastern shore has yielded little
progress in the five days of meetings between Israeli and
Palestinian officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
insisting the Palestinians accept a tough program to fight terror
before he will agree to Palestinian demands.
	   The sides are trying to reach a deal to end months of deadlock
which has helped feed a renewed climate of violence.
	   The council blamed Israel for the absence of a deal thus far and
said violence could escalate without one.
	   On Monday, a Palestinian man hurled two hand grenades near a bus
stop crowded with Israeli soldiers and civilians, injuring at least
64 people.

Milan prosecutor demands life sentence for Gucci's ex-wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS to CORRECT number of judges to two, not three &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A prosecutor here Tuesday demanded
conviction and life imprisonment for the ex-wife of fashion scion
Maurizio Gucci as well as for four co-defendants also charged with
his murder.
	   Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, was accused of
setting a murder plot in motion in order to gain control of his
multi-million-dollar estate.
	   Life imprisonment is the stiffest possible sentence in Italy,
which does not have the death penalty.
	   Gucci was gunned down on the steps to his Milan office on March
27, 1995.
	   Wrapping up his arguments to the jury of two judges and six
civilians, Prosecutor Carlo Nocerino also demanded convictions for
premeditated murder and life sentences for Reggiani Martinelli's
former confidente, Pina Auriemma; Ivano Savioni, a hotel porter;
pizzeria owner Orazio Cicala, and Benedetto Ceraulo, an auto
mechanic.

Attorney General says gambling in Jericho casino is illegal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's attorney general said it is illegal
for Israelis to gamble at a new casino in the
Palestinian-controlled city of Jericho, a justice ministry
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   But it was unclear whether Israelis would actually be prosecuted
for doing so.
	   Israelis are the main clientele at the highly successful Casino
Oasis in Jericho which opened in September, and their business has
the potential to generate millions of dollars for the fledgling
Palestinian economy.
	   On Sunday, attorney-general Elyakim Rubinstein said in a letter
to an Israeli lawmaker that according to the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords, an Israeli citizen in the Palestinian territory is
still subject to Israeli law.
	   Gambling is illegal in Israel but the unique status of the
Palestinian autonomy has brought casinos close to home.
	   ``We haven't received any specific complaints about what is
going on at the casino,'' Rubinstein said in the letter. ``However
. . . there is room to ask the police to deal with goings-on at the
casino in terms of law enforcement, and we are doing that,'' he
wrote.
	   A spokeswoman for the mostly Austrian-owned casino said the
owners understood from previous meetings with Rubinstein that
Israel would not prosecute their clients.
	   ``Our entrepreneurs were under the impression that it's not the
policy of the state of Israel to take any legal action against any
Israeli who goes gambling ... outside of Israel,'' said Orna
Gourell, a spokeswoman for Casinos Austria.
	   Gourell said that they had not received any official or
unofficial complaint from the Israeli government about Israelis
gambling in Jericho.
	   The casino has already come under criticism from religious
lawmakers who disapprove of gambling and the Israeli army has said
it may ban enlisted soldiers and reservists from entering the
casino.

Coffee association lowers ceiling for exports LONDON (AP) -- The
</HEADLINE>
Association of Coffee Producing Countries on Tuesday lowered the
ceiling for coffee exports as a result of Ecuador's withdrawal from
the 13-member coalition.

<TEXT>
	   The association reduced the ceiling to 51.03 million bags of
coffee from 52.13 million bags through June 1999, said Roberio
Silva, the association's secretary-general. One bag equals 60
kilos, or 132 pounds.
	   The association, which Ecuador withdrew from in September, was
set up in 1993 by Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Uganda and other
leading producers, following the collapse of negotiations with
importing countries on establishing an international price-support
regime for coffee.
	   Since October 1993, the agency _ which has its headquarters in
London _ has attempted to regulate supplies to the market through
operating its own voluntary export restrictions.

FBI team lays ground for possible extradition of terror suspects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-8 with report on emerging compromise over
suspects at Mideast summit &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An FBI team began a new round of investigation
Tuesday to see if there is enough evidence to extradite suspects
involved in the killing and wounding of Americans in terrorist
attacks.
	   The seven-member U.S. delegation, expected to stay until next
week, met Tuesday with the Israeli police investigative unit and
with prosecutors in the Israeli Justice Ministry, according to
police and Justice Ministry officials.
	   An Israeli police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the FBI team was laying the ground work for possible
extradition requests by lining up evidence and witnesses. The
suspects, however, are in areas controlled by Yasser Arafat's
self-rule government.
	   A Justice Ministry document obtained by The Associated Press
listed Palestinian suspects involved in a dozen bombing and
shooting attacks in the area in which 11 U.S. citizens were killed
and four others wounded.
	   The document said a U.S. delegation headed by Mark Richard,
deputy assistant attorney general, was given charge sheets,
synopses of crime scene reports and police statements during a
similar visit in March.
	   Israel has demanded the extradition of 36 Palestinians for trial
in Israel, but Palestinian officials refuse as a matter of
principle to give suspects to Israel.
	   Israel radio reported that the United States has offered a
compromise proposal to the sides at a Mideast summit at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland in which the suspects wanted by Israel would
be tried in Palestinian courts under American supervision.
	   The list of 36 includes nine Palestinians involved in attacks on
Americans. The extradition of those suspects to the U.S. might also
assuage Israel's concerns, while not forcing the Palestinians to
hand-over people to Israel, it former adversary.
	   Some suspects have been sentenced by Palestinian courts after
quickie trials. But Israeli officials complain that, in reality,
the suspects serve only token sentences or are allowed to go free.
They say some have even been inducted into the Palestinian police.
	   Joyce Boim, whose 17-year-old son David was the victim of a
shooting attack near the West Bank settlement of Beit El on May 13,
1996, said she was trying to meet with the FBI delegation to press
her case for the extradition of Amjad Hinawi, involved in the
shooting of her son.
	   ``I will not rest until he and others are in custody, either
here in Israel or in the United States. Where there is a will,
there's a way,'' said Mrs. Boim, formerly of Manhattan.
	   Hinawi, who testified he drove the car involved in the drive-by
shooting at a bus stop, was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor by
a Palestinian court on Feb. 14.
	   Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security in
the West Bank, said he was unaware of the presence of any FBI team
and that the Palestinians had no extradition agreement with the
United States.
	   American officials were known to be concerned that premature
leaks about the investigation could prevent potential witnesses
from cooperating with FBI agents.
	   Asked about the presence of FBI agents, a U.S. embassy spokesman
said the U.S. government did not comment on ongoing criminal
investigations ``especially at this sensitive time.''

Two dozen hostages freed in Chechnya in 10 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Interior Ministry's organized crime
unit has freed 24 hostages from breakaway Chechnya in the past 10
days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday.
	   Most of those freed were soldiers captured during Chechnya's
1994-96 war for independence, said Deputy Interior Minister Lt.
Gen. Vladimir Vasilyev.
	   The latest freed hostage was a 24-year-old Russian woman
released on Tuesday after 14 months, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Kidnappers have taken hundreds of people hostage in Chechnya and
surrounding areas, usually for ransom, since the war ended.
Interfax said 103 people are still held, including three Britons, a
New Zealander and a Turk.
	   The most prominent hostage is President Boris Yeltsin's personal
envoy, Valentin Vlasov, who has been missing since May 1.
	   Vasilyev said at a news conference that ``information on this
case is coming practically daily.'' He expressed hopes that Vlasov
will be freed soon.
	   Chechnya's government plans a large-scale effort to free
hostages on Saturday, said Security Minister Aslanbek Arsayev.
Relatives of the hostages will take part, he told Interfax.
	   ``Some families have expressed readiness to provide up to 100
and more armed people for the operation,'' he said.

U.S. Ambassador visits Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ U.S. ambassador to India Richard Celeste
arrived in the troubled Kashmir state Tuesday for a two-day visit
during which he will meet separatist leaders, politicians and
government officials.
	   Celeste held an hour-long meeting with representatives of the
All Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella group of more than two
dozen groups fighting for independence or for merger with
neighboring Pakistan. But both sides refused to say what they
discussed during the meeting.
	   This is Celeste's first visit to Kashmir after he became
ambassador.
	   Later Tuesday, he was scheduled to meet with G.C. Saxena,
Governor of Kashmir.
	   Celeste's visit to Kashmir follows foreign secretary-level
meetings between India and Pakistan in Islamabad last week. As
expected, the talks failed to soften New Delhi and Islamabad's
position on the disputed territory of Kashmir.
	   India accuses Pakistan of backing an Islamic-led insurgency in
Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies.
	   The United States would like the two countries to resolve the
contentious Kashmir issue through dialogue.
	   On Tuesday, militants shot dead two army soldiers who had
stopped at a shop to have their vehicle fixed, a spokesman for the
Indian army said. In other parts of the state, government troops
killed five militants in separate incidents.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Tussling over the fate of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, his supporters said Tuesday he is very ill
and that his controversial arrest in a London clinic is endangering
democracy in Chile.
	   But Amnesty International and two other human rights groups
sought to have Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on torture charges,
partly as a fallback position if the 82-year-old general defeats
attempts to extradite him to Spain to face allegations of murder,
torture and genocide.
	   In a letter to Scotland Yard police commissioner Sir Paul
Condon, the groups argued Pinochet could be brought before a
British court under a new anti-torture law, since Britons and
Chileans now living here were among the several thousand political
opponents who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.
	   The family of William Beausire, a Briton who disappeared in
Chile in 1975, endorsed the letter. Condon made no immediate
response.
	   Pinochet, arrested by British police Friday in his bed in a
private London clinic, has vowed to fight the extradition attempt.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing parties in Chile
said Tuesday that the general was too ill to be visited. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder.
	   ``He is really very, very sick,'' said Alberto Espina, a member
of the delegation from the Renovacion Nacional and Union
Democratica Independiente parties, after meeting Pinochet's wife,
Lucia. ``I think he is going to stay a lot of days in bed and he is
really in a bad condition.''
	   Referring to Chile's successful transition to a democratic
government, which included keeping Pinochet as army commander until
March, Espina added, ``What you (Britain) are doing in the end is a
danger for our democratic system.''
	   In Madrid, one of the two Spanish magistrates probing human
rights violations withdrew, hoping to strengthen the case for
extradition by handing his evidence to his colleague.
	   Magistrate Baltasar Garzon will now seek Pinochet's extradition
over the disappearance or death of up to 4,000 people in Chile, and
the disappearance of 94 people, most Chileans, in Argentina.
	   However, the chief prosecutor of Spain's National Court, Eduardo
Fungarino, challenged Garzon's extradition warrant, saying the
alleged crimes were not Spain's business.
	   The court's plenary is expected to meet next week. If they
decide the magistrates have no right to probe into events in Chile
and Argentina, the extradition warrant will fall away, Fungarino
said.
	   Earlier, Margaret Thatcher's office said the former Conservative
Party prime minister had her old ally Pinochet over for drinks at
her London home four days before he was hospitalized.
	   Chile has protested that Britain's Labor Party government has
violated Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. A regular visitor, he
arrived last month on a diplomatic passport.

Ex-Spice girl pledges to spread women's empowerment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ She may no longer be a Spice Girl, but
Geri Halliwell is still sending the group's message of ``Girl
Power!'' in her new role as goodwill ambassador for the U.N.
Population Fund in Britain.
	   Halliwell, the former Ginger Spice, pledged Tuesday to use all
her energy to raise awareness of women's health and reproductive
rights on behalf of the United Nations and two British
organizations.
	   ``The thing that inspires me most is empowerment of women,''
Halliwell told a crowded press conference at U.N. headquarters.
``The moment I entered the public arena in the pop world, I always
had that weight behind me saying `Let's inspire and give women
energy.' And this is just taking it one step further.''
	   Halliwell, 26, quit the Spice Girls, the hugely popular all-girl
British pop group, on May 31, citing ``differences between us.''
Since then, she has given up her ginger hair and opted for a new
blonde look and traded in her tight-fitting dresses: On Tuesday,
she sported a demure classic black dress with a long gray jacket.
	   Halliwell's new appointment was described as a perfect fit
Tuesday by U.N. officials and representatives of Marie Stopes
International and Population Concern, British voluntary
organizations which promote reproductive health, especially among
women.
	   ``We were looking for a powerful figure who has the attention of
the public _ of all of the public but perhaps young people in
particular,'' said Patricia Hindmarsh of Marie Stopes.
	   Both Marie Stopes and Population Concern are part of the U.N.
Population Fund's ``Face To Face Campaign,'' which is using
voluntary organizations to promote awareness of population issues
across Europe.
	   Halliwell acknowledged that she was only just beginning to learn
about her new job. She and the other officials deflected many
questions about what exactly she would be doing.
	   But she was adamant that she could make a difference.
	   ``I think at the end of the day I am famous. Lots of people know
who I am,'' Halliwell said.
	   ``If I save one person's life just by awareness, I'm ... going
to do it.''

German computer millionaire lashes out at finance
</HEADLINE>
minister-designate &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The computer entrepreneur who turned
down a post in Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet lashed
out Tuesday at the incoming finance minister for pushing the
government too far to the left.
	   Jost Stollmann warned in an interview with the Munich-based
Sueddeutsche Zeitung that Oskar Lafontaine's leftist influence
meant doom for Schroeder's goal of forging a ``new center'' in
German politics.
	   Stollmann said Lafontaine represents old-fashioned, statist view
of government at odds with Schroeder's modern, reform-oriented
wing.
	   ``I didn't fail. Those in the Social Democrats who wanted to
implement the idea of a new center, they failed,'' Stollmann was
quoted as saying in the interview to be published in Wednesday's
editions.
	   He accused Lafontaine of squeezing him out of a job to get rid
of a nonpartisan and ``inconvenient'' Stollmann.
	   Stollmann turned down the job of economics minister on Monday,
saying he was unhappy with plans to take European economic policy
from the Economics Ministry and give it to Lafontaine's Finance
Ministry. Stollmann was widely seen as representing a newer,
business-friendly leaning in the future government, and his
presence in the German government had been eagerly awaited by
industry leaders.
	   The criticism highlights a damaging, early disagreement in
Schroeder's government.
	   Lafontaine, who is also chairman of the victorious Social
Democratic Party, dominated coalition talks and monopolized
personnel appointments in the new government, Stollmann was quoted
as saying.
	   Stollmann said Lafontaine's move to place European economic
policy had nothing to do with making the ministry more like its
counterparts in other European countries, as Lafontaine has said.
	   ``It was plainly a question of power and the attempt to get rid
of an inconvenient Stollmann,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Nor would the businessman have considered taking office in a
Lafontaine-led government, Stollmann said: ``our views are too
different.''
	   The Social Democrats signed a coalition deal with the smaller
Greens party on Tuesday. The new parliament is expected to begin
work Oct. 27.

Students, vigilantes scuffle at pro-democracy rally in Iran
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Riot police broke up a pro-democracy rally
Tuesday at a Tehran stadium after hard-line vigilantes and
protesters began scuffling.
	   The fighting began as Gholamhossein Karbaschi, the suspended
mayor of Tehran, was urging the 3,000 people at the stadium to take
part in Friday's elections for the Assembly of Experts, a body that
elects the country's supreme leader.
	   A few hundred people from both sides shoved and pushed each
other _ and at least a half-dozen were beaten _ before police
intervened.
	   ``Sticks, clubs and knives won't work anymore!'' shouted
hundreds of youths, referring to the weapons that members of the
Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilante group use in fights with moderates.
	   The rally was one in a series that moderates have been holding
in the runup to the elections. They accuse the hard-line Council of
Guardians, which screens applicants for elections, of being unfair
in its selection of candidates for the assembly. Most of the
moderate applicants for the assembly were disqualified.
	   Those attending the rally, mostly university students, used the
occasion to vent their anger at hard-liners for trying to curb
civil liberties by closing down liberal newspapers.
	   The youths also shouted slogans in support of President Mohammad
Khatami, whose election last year has brought about the
more-relaxed atmosphere in which people can hold rallies.
	   The crowd called for the appeals court to overturn the
conviction of Karbaschi, who was sentenced in April to five years
in jail for corruption.
	   ``Acquittal, acquittal!'' they shouted.
	   Karbaschi urged the students to vote in the assembly elections,
saying: ``If you don't vote, you will be depriving yourselves with
your own hands from your social and political rights.''
	   Many Iranians, angry that there will be few moderate candidates
on the ballot, have said they will not vote.
	   ``There's no point in voting. They have already selected the
members,'' complained Mahmoud Mir Bagheri, an engineering student.
	   But Mohammad Rahmani said he had changed his mind after hearing
Karbaschi.
	   ``I'll vote so that I'm not left behind, '' he said.

Minister expected to leave hospital this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's interior minister, who fell into a coma
for more than a week following an anesthesia accident in September,
is expected to leave the hospital this week, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Jean-Pierre Chevenement is expected to resume his post sometime
before the end of the year, his temporary replacement, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, told French radio. A government official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the report.
	   Just before planned gallbladder surgery on Sept. 2, the
59-year-old Chevenement suffered an allergic reaction to anesthesia
containing curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients.
	   Chevenement, a key figure in the French Cabinet, has held
several ministry portfolios, including industry, education and
defense. He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest
France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   The Interior Ministry is responsible for the nation's police and
security forces.

Palestinians protest new army post in Hebron as violence grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinians trying to burn outpost &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Several dozen Palestinians staged a
sit-in protest Tuesday in the West Bank town of Hebron against a
new Israeli army outpost set up overnight on the roof of their
apartment building.
	   A group of Palestinian youths later tried to set the small metal
outpost on fire. The structure was vacant at the time and Israeli
army soldiers rushed back to put out the flames which only
blackened the outpost.
	   Earlier, Palestinians sitting on mattresses and chairs outside
their building in the Israeli-controlled part of the city said they
would not leave until the soldiers left.
	   The army set up its post near the Jewish enclave of Beit
Hadassah on the roof of a nearby Palestinian-owned building in the
night from Monday to Tuesday.
	   The army said that soon after soldiers moved into the new
outpost, several shots were fired toward it from the nearby
Palestinian-controlled area and several firebombs were thrown
nearby toward an army patrol.
	   The Israeli army withdrew to the center of Hebron in January
1997 to allow for the expansion of Palestinian autonomy in 85
percent of the city. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and some
130,000 Palestinians.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ In the most astonishing defeat in a day of
upsets, Women's Tennis Association 175th seed Nadezhda Petrova
overpowered No. 20 Eva Majoli in the first round of the Ladies
Kremlin Cup in Moscow on Tuesday.
	   Facing trouble at the start, Majoli just managed to take the
first set 7-6 (7-5). But the 21-year-old Croatian let go a chance
to wrap up the match in the second set, letting Petrova come back
from a 5-2 deficit and clinch the tie-breaker 7-6 (7-5).
	   Majoli looked completely deflated after that, with Petrova
dominating throughout the third set to take it 6-0.
	   The dlrs 1 million Kremlin Cup is only the second event for
Petrova, a 16-year-old Russian who qualified for the tournament
Monday on a wild card spot.
	   In another upset, 26th seed Barbara Schett of Austria downed No.
19 German Anke Huber in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.
	   And the Spanish 29th seed Magui Serni beat out 23rd seed Lisa
Raymond of the United States 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.
	   But Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, at No. 18, proved her ranking by
crushing 78th ranked Tatiana Panova of Russia, 6-3, 6-2.
	   And Russian Elena Likhovtseva, ranked 27th, beat No. 34 Ruxandra
Dragomir of Romania, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

Bosnia needs 37 years to repay foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia will need 37 years to
repay its debt of dlrs 3,400 billion if agreed repayment conditions
do not change, a Bosnian official said Tuesday.
	   Nikola Grabovac, deputy minister for foreign trade and economic
relations in the Bosnian joint government, said a recent study by
the government showed that Bosnia the current levels of export and
employment don't guarantee repayment of the debt, Onasa news agency
reported.
	   ``The current level of production, ranking from 15 to 16
percent, in addition to the current levels of export and
employment, don't guarantee repayment of the debt,'' Grabovac said.
``Production, export and employment must be increased,''
	   According to Grabovac, foreign debt accrued before 1992, amounts
to dlrs 2,470 billion, while debt accumulated after the Dayton
agreement amounts to approximately dlrs 950 million. Of the total
dlrs 3,400 billion _ dlrs 650 million alone go to the World Bank.
	   While Bosnia desperately lacks investors, unsuitable credit
conditions for companies looking to invest in production keep many
away, Grabovac said.
	   Bosnia is still recovering from the 1992-95 civil war which
severely damaged factories and infrastructure.

Snake causes commotion on New York-Duesseldorf flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A New York-Duesseldorf flight
arrived Tuesday with one more passenger than had checked in: a
30-centimeter snake.
	   A young woman spotted the snake slithering between her feet just
before take off. Still, the flight went on as scheduled.
	   Another passenger took control of the situation, wrapping the
the creature in two plastic bags and setting it in a bathroom for
the duration of the trip, Duesseldorf airport officials said.
	   Police were called to meet the plane to identify the snake,
which turned out to be harmless and was turned over to a zoo.
	   It was unclear how the snake got on board the plane.

	   LONDON (AP) _ For an ailing fallen dictator or a high-rolling
Arab prince, London has long been the place to visit, with its
world-class private hospitals, five-star hotels, soul-of-discretion
doormen, and _ above all _ reputation as a safe home-from-home.
	   For some, the arrest of former Chilean dictator and longtime
Britain admirer Gen. Augusto Pinochet _ in his bed at an elite
London clinic, no less _ means things can never be the same again.
	   But others label the arrest a singular event _ a handy way for
leaders of the 18-month-old Labor Party government both to show off
to the world their ``ethical'' foreign policy and to take revenge
against the No. 1 target of street protests back in the '70s when
they were young.
	   ``It is not a question of the floodgates being opened here,''
said Michael Byers, an international law specialist at Oxford
University.
	   ``We have one of the most horrendous criminals of the 20th
century ... here in our country, we have an extradition treaty,
Spain has jurisdiction under international law. Quite frankly, I
don't see what the fuss is about,'' he said.
	   If Byers is right, the rest can relax, be they deposed Mideast
officials with doubtful human rights records or supporters of
ousted African dictators privately spending some of the money they
stashed in public life.

Russian oil company receives German loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A major Russian oil company announced Tuesday it
has received a large loan from a German bank, despite Russia's
economic crisis, which has scared away other foreign lenders.
	   Tyumen Oil Company has received dlrs 105 million at a pre-crisis
interest rate from Westdeutsche Landesbank, oil company deputy
chief Yosif Bakaleinik said.
	   The money will allow Tyumen Oil to keep its exports from
shrinking, said company president Semyon Kukes. Tyumen Oil has
recently been exporting about 620,000 tons of crude and 420,000
tons of oil products a month _ a sharp increase since the start of
the year, he said.
	   Kukes said the loan was granted because his company ``hasn't
delayed a single payment'' on what it had borrowed earlier.
	   Tyumen Oil also plans to modernize production and expand its
retail network, Kukes told a news conference.
	   Russia's oil industry is the country's largest source of foreign
currency, and it has suffered major losses because of the crisis
and a worldwide slump in oil prices.
	   Russia's total oil production stood at 23.9 million tons in
September, down 2.4 percent from the same period in 1997, the
Interfax news agency reported Tuesday, siting the State Statistics
Committee.
	   Gasoline production was also down 4.1 percent, to 2.2 million
tons, and diesel fuel production was down 8.1 percent, totaling 4.3
million tons.
	   Russia produced nearly 41.5 billion cubic meters (1.4 trillion
cubic feet) of natural gas in September, up 7.5 percent from the
same period last year, Interfax reported.

Rafter, Santoro ease through to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ World No. 2 Patrick Rafter powered into the
second round of the dlrs 750,000 Lyon Grand Prix Tuesday with a
blistering 6-2, 6-2 victory over Steve Campbell of the United
States.
	   The two-time U.S. Open champion, seeded No. 2 here, never looked
in trouble after storming to a 4-0 first set lead against the
27-year-old American.
	   The Australian demonstrated typically powerful serving, which
reached more than 200 kph (111 mph) in the second set, and won in
just one hour, seven minutes.
	   Rafter had beaten Campbell in the players' two previous
meetings, both in 1995.
	   ``I have some bad memories at this tournament but I am
determined to get some good wins this time,'' said Rafter, who lost
in the first round at last year's Lyon event to unseeded Arnaud
Clement.
	   Seeded players fared much better on Tuesday than on the first
day of the tournament, when No. 5 seed Jan Siemerink of the
Netherlands and No. 6 seed Albert Costa of Spain both lost.
	   The defending champion and No. 8 seed, Fabrice Santoro of
France, swept past countryman Stephane Huet, 6-3, 6-3 in one hour,
17 minutes.
	   Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, France's Olivier Delaitre and
veteran American Richey Reneberg also qualified for the second
round.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Some 300,000 high school students took to the
streets of France Tuesday to protest school conditions in a second
round of nationwide marches again marred by hooligans throwing
bottles and smashing windows.
	   Despite intensive efforts by student leaders to attract support,
the protesters failed to build on the momentum of last week's
protests, which drew a half-million marchers.
	   In Paris, helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from aerosol
cans to disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a posh
Left Bank neighborhood and set fire to a metro car, temporarily
interrupting service on one line.
	   Many of the hooligans were older than the high school students,
who insist the troublemakers have no connection to their movement.
	   Police said 85 people were lightly injured in Paris. Some 110
young people were arrested nationwide, they said, and 90 of them
were taken into custody.

Parma player claims he was injured by knife during Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Parma's midfielder Dino Baggio told Italian
television interviewers Tuesday that he was injured in the head by
a knife hurled by a rival fan during a UEFA Cup match in Krakow.
	   ``I was hit by something in the head and then I saw a knife on
the field. I could not believe it,'' said Baggio, who completed the
match against Wisla after being treated by team doctors.
	   The Italian international displayed to television cameras a head
cut which required five stitches.
	   The Italian RAI-2 television channel reported that Parma
officials did not immediately file an official complaint. The case
will be considered by club officials on their return to Italy.
	   Parma and Wisla played to a 1-1 draw in their first-leg
second-round match of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Baggio was injured during the second half and stayed off the
field for treatment for about four minutes.
	   Baggio's teammates were quoted by the Italian television as
saying they also saw the knife on the field and that a Polish
player was quick to hurl it off before the referee could see it.

Report: Saddam Hussein suffering from cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A report on Israel's Channel 2 TV Tuesday said
that Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein is suffering from cancer.
	   Quoting unnamed Western and European sources, the report said
the Iraqi ruler has been undergoing chemotherapy treatment for
cancer for some time.
	   The report said the information had been relayed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton during a Mideast summit he is hosting in
eastern Maryland.
	   A Kuwaiti newspaper reported last week that Saddam is suffering
from colon cancer. However, there is no public indication that the
Iraqi ruler is seriously ill. In the past ten days he has chaired
three sessions of the Iraqi Cabinet, all shown on Iraqi television.
	   Saddam Hussein is considered one of Israel's bitterest enemies.
During the 1991 Gulf war, he fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Striker Darko Kovacevic scored a quick
goal in the third minute from a goal-mouth scramble after a corner
kick to give Real Sociedad a lead in the UEFA Cup second round,
first leg game Tuesday.
	   Eight minutes later, midfielder Francisco Jose de Pedro kicked
in the second goal.
	   After the second goal Dinamo substituted goalkeeper Dmitry
Tyapushkin for Dmitry Kramarenko, who fouled against Aitor Aldeondo
in the penalty area. Francisco Jose de Pedro scored his second goal
in the game from a penalty kick in the 33rd minute to push
Spaniards ahead 3-0.
	   Dinamo had only one scoring opportunity, in the 35th minute,
when Rolan Gusev fired from the corner of the penalty box _ but
Real's goalkeeper Alberto Lopez made a tremendous save.
	   Dinamo dominated in the second half and missed several scoring
opportunities in the first minutes. Russian defender Sergei
Nekrasov scored two goals for Dinamo. The first was in the 77th
minute from a perfect cross from the left and another just one
minute later.
	   About 8,000 fans cheered their team in non-stop rain at Moscow's
Dinamo Stadium.

Turkey and Syria end standoff, reach security agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turkey and Syria signing security agreement;
EDITS throughout to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Ending a weeks-long standoff that some
feared could have sparked a regional conflict, Damascus pledged
Tuesday to shut down Kurdish rebel camps in its territory and the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley, Turkey's foreign minister said.
	   Under the agreement signed by Turkish and Syrian officials,
Syria also agreed not to allow Kurdish guerrillas to stage
cross-border attacks on Turkey, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told
reporters.
	   He said Syria would brand the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK,
a ``terrorist organization'' and would deny PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan access into Syria.
	   ``An important foreign support to terrorism has thus been
eliminated,'' Cem said, adding that Turkey will watch closely to
see that Damascus lives up to its pledges.
	   Tensions between neighbors Turkey and Syria had been running
high for the past few weeks after Ankara suggested it might resort
to military action to stop what it denounced as Syria's sheltering
Kurdish rebels.
	   Cem's announcement came after security officials from both
countries ended two days of talks at the southern Turkish town of
Seyhan, some some 550 kilometers (344 miles) from Ankara, to
address Turkey's concerns.
	   The agreement was signed by Turkish foreign ministry official
Ugur Ziyal and Gen. Adnan Badr Al Hassan of Syria.
	   Earlier, in a possible indication that Damascus was meeting
Ankara's demands, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that the rebel's
leader was no longer in Syria but in Russia.
	   Yilmaz told reporters Ocalan had been located in a Moscow suburb
and had been in hiding in Russia for the past week. He said Turkey
had made a request for his extradition.
	   In Moscow, the foreign ministry said it had no information about
Ocalan entering Russia.
	   Ocalan in a statement made to a Kurdish news agency Monday
claimed he was somewhere in Kurdistan, a region which stretches
over parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984 in a war that has cost the lives of close to
37,000 people. Turkey says the PKK held several camps in Syria and
in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.
	   ``Syria has understood the Turkish side's demands and is on the
verge of meeting them,'' Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said
a few hours before the accord was announced.
	   Despite signs of an ease in tensions, Ankara moved several tanks
and armored personnel carriers to the Turkish-Syrian border in
preparation for exercises planned for the first week of November,
private NTV news channel reported Tuesday.
	   Fears of a regional conflict have led to various mediation
attempts by Egypt and Iran.
	   Analysts believed that Turkey might have resorted to pinpoint
attacks on rebel targets in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon had
the security talks failed.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An inspired goal by French Frederic
Kanoute lead Lyon 2-1 victory against Red Star Belgrade in its home
away match in UEFA Cup's second round, first leg.
	   The Yugoslavs made the first shot on goal in the 10th minute and
the French responded with swift counterattacks, but missed their
chance to score in the first half.
	   Red Star dominated the first half of the second round, with
Dalibor Skoric scoring their only goal from penalty, raising cheers
from the almost 1,500 Yugoslav supporters who traveled to Bucharest
to join the crowd of almost 10,000 people in Cotroceni stadium.
	   Swiss player Marco Grassi shot the ball into the Yugoslav goal
keeper's net after a strong cross from the left side of the field
in the 58th minute to bring the score to 1-1. Lyon clinched its
victory in 85th minute with great left foot volley from Kanoute.
	   Red Star Belgrade was forced to play its home game against Lyon
in Bucharest, due to security concerns related to the threat of
NATO air strikes on military targets in Yugoslavia.

Organizer of Auschwitz crosses invite pope to settle controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The man who rallied conservative Catholics
to erect over 200 small crosses at the edge of the former Auschwitz
death camp on Tuesday invited Polish-born Pope John Paul II to
settle the controversy.
	   Kazimierz Switon said in a letter to the pope that he is the
only person capable of easing tensions between Jews worldwide who
want the crosses removed and conservative Catholics who have put
them there. He appealed the John Paul to visit the site during a
scheduled trip to his homeland in June.
	   The invitation comes a day after a regional court in Oswiecim,
where the former Nazi death camp is located, rejected a plea by the
Polish government to evict conservative Catholics who have been
camping out there, and appoint a government trustee with authority
over the area.
	   The rejection of the government's plea is a ``disappointment and
surprise'' and is ``harmful to the international image of Poland,''
government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said. He said the government
would appeal.
	   Switon has organized conservative Catholics to put up the small
wooden crosses around a larger, 8-meter papal cross that has stood
since 1988 at a site adjacent to Auschwitz where Nazis murdered 152
Polish resisters.
	   Jews have long objected to the presence of the larger cross,
visible inside the camp, as an insult to the memory of Jews killed
at Auschwitz. Jewish organizations around the world renewed their
outrage after the smaller crosses began appearing this summer.
	   The Israeli government has urged Poland to solve the dispute.
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in Auschwitz gas
chambers or from forced labor, disease and starvation from 1940-45.

Iraq asks Security Council to stop `illegal' U.S. acts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Continuing its campaign against Washington,
Iraq has sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council listing what it
calls ``illegal American behavior'' and asking the international
body to put a stop to it.
	   The 18-page letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf was sent Monday to the council's current president,
Jeremy Greenstock of Britain. It was made public on Tuesday.
	   ``In this letter, we list for the Security Council some of the
illegal American behavior and actions that form a clear and
flagrant violation of the charter of the United Nations,'' the
letter said.
	   It called on the Security Council to ``take deterrent
measures.''
	   Iraq has long accused the United States of trying to prolong
punishing U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq to try to undercut
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil, were imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council has said they
will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with the inspectors on Aug. 5 and has
demanded that the inspection teams be reconstituted to include
fewer Britons and Americans, whom Iraq accuses of spying.
	   The letter outlines dozens of Iraqi grievances against the
United States, beginning with decision in June 1991 to impose a
``no-fly zone'' over northern Iraq to protect Kurds against attacks
by Saddam's forces.
	   The most recent item was the decision by the U.S. Congress
earlier this month to channel up to dlrs 97 million in aid to Iraqi
opposition groups seeking to overthrow Saddam.
	   ``As the republic of Iraq draws the attention of the Security
Council members to these illegal, illegitimate and dangerous
American acts, it asks the council ... to put an end to these
acts,'' the letter said.

Kyrgyzstan sending back to Iran train with ammunition for
</HEADLINE>
Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of Kyrgyzstan decided Tuesday to
send back to Iran a train carrying 700 tons of ammunition to the
anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan, a news agency said.
	   The ammunition was seized in the southern Kyrgyz town of Osh on
Oct. 9. Customs officials previously said it was hidden in a
shipment of humanitarian aid.
	   The Kyrgyz security service said the train left the Iranian city
of Meshed on Sept. 23 and passed through the Central Asian
countries of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan before reaching
Kyrgyzstan.
	   The Kyrgyz government had considered confiscating the ammunition
and giving it to its own army, the chairman of parliament's
constitutional law committee, Omurbek Tekebayev, told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and
possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked that country.

Most Russian reporters earn less than dlrs 50 a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 60 percent of Russian reporters earn
less than dlrs 50 a month and many aren't receiving salaries
because of the latest economic crisis, the head of the Journalists'
Union said Tuesday.
	   The paltry salaries are largely a result of the Aug. 17
devaluation of the ruble, which sent the currency's value against
the dollar plummeting. Most ruble-denominated salaries have not
been raised to keep up with the resulting inflation.
	   Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of Russia's Journalists' Union,
praised the country's journalists for ``working conscientiously and
fairly under the crisis conditions,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Like many Russian businesses, many newspapers and magazines have
cut back staff and coverage in the past two months because of
plunging advertising revenue and high newsprint costs. Television
and radio stations have made similar cutbacks in employees and
programming.
	   On Monday the government said nearly one in three of Russia's
148 million people are now living below the poverty line, which is
defined here as less than dlrs 32 a month.

Germany's Social Democrats name two to top posts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's victorious Social Democrats
on Tuesday chose Wolfgang Thierse as president of the Bundestag, or
lower house of parliament, the first time the post has been filled
by a politician from the former East Germany.
	   Thierse, 54, narrowly defeated Christel Hanewinckel, also from
eastern Germany, whose candidacy was supported by many female
members of parliament.
	   The Bundestag president becomes a de facto leader of the country
in the event anything happens to the chancellor.
	   The Social Democrats also voted in lawyer Peter Starck to lead
the party in the Bundestag. Starck, 55, was elected by a wide
margin to replace Rudolf Scharping.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he had also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron
this summer, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and
Palestinian civilians were injured in that attack.
	   After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed
responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a
double agent who had provided information to the Israeli security
service Shin Bet.
	   After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information,
Sarsour carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement
said.
	   The Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the
attacks, the statement said.
	   It was not immediately clear how the claims and counterclaims
would play out at the Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Security is a central issue in the negotiations, with Israel
pointing to Sarsour's attack in Beersheba as new proof that the
Palestinians are not doing enough to prevent attacks.
	   Sarsour is a resident of the Palestinian-controlled area of
Hebron. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long
complained that Palestinian areas are launching pads for terror
attacks against Israelis and that the Palestinians are doing little
to catch the assailants.
	   The army said that Sarsour started out as a low-ranking Hamas
activist, organizing rallies and spraying graffiti on walls. He was
jailed twice by Israel in 1989 and 1996, the army said.
	   On Aug. 20, Sarsour wandered into the Israeli-run part of
Hebron, planning to throw firebombs at Israeli soldiers, the army
said. When he didn't find a target, he climbed the fence of the
tiny Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers.
	   He spotted Rabbi Shlomo Raanan in one of the trailers, climbed
through the window and stabbed the rabbi to death, the army said.
	   A few days later, Sarsour approached one of the Hamas leaders in
town and told him that he had killed the rabbi.
	   He was recruited into the Hamas military wing, was trained in
throwing grenades and carried out the Sept. 30 grenade attack in
Hebron, the army said.
	   On Monday, Sarsour headed to Beersheba.
	   Sarsour, a plasterer by trade, hoped to find a day's work in the
city and on the way home carry out a grenade attack, the army said.
	   When he didn't find work, he walked to the central bus station
and threw two grenades at a crowded bus stop.
	   David Wilder, a resident and spokesman for the Hebron Jewish
settler community said if Israeli troops still had access to all of
Hebron, they could have caught Sarsour before he carried out
additional acts of violence.
	   ``If the army had taken a bit more initiative, the other two
attacks would have not taken place,'' Wilder said, adding that he
hoped Netanyahu would not agree to a key Palestinian demand at the
summit, to release Palestinians in Israeli jails.

Bosnia needs 37 years to repay foreign debt

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia will need 37 years to
repay its debt of dlrs 3.4 billion if agreed repayment conditions
do not change, a Bosnian official said Tuesday.
	   Nikola Grabovac, deputy minister for foreign trade and economic
relations in the Bosnian joint government, said a recent study by
the government showed that Bosnia the current levels of export and
employment don't guarantee repayment of the debt, Onasa news agency
reported.
	   ``The current level of production, ranking from 15 to 16
percent, in addition to the current levels of export and
employment, don't guarantee repayment of the debt,'' Grabovac said.
``Production, export and employment must be increased,''
	   According to Grabovac, foreign debt accrued before 1992, amounts
to almost dlrs 2.47 billion, while debt accumulated after the
Dayton agreement amounts to approximately dlrs 950 million. Of the
total dlrs 3.4 billion _ dlrs 650 million alone are owed to the
World Bank.
	   While Bosnia desperately lacks investors, unsuitable credit
conditions for companies looking to invest in production keep many
away, Grabovac said.
	   Bosnia is still recovering from the 1992-95 civil war which
severely damaged factories and infrastructure.

Serbian parliament passes restrictive media law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with the law passed, Seselj branding independent
reporters NATO spies, independent journalist union to file slander
charges. Other details.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Serbian Parliament adopted
Tuesday a new information law which critics say further restricts
independent media and leads the country back to dictatorship.
	   The draft of the law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media and calls for huge fines against media
editors and owners who disobey the decree.
	   It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine which
report is against the law, and places further restrictions on
working permits for media organizations.
	   Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic, of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, claimed during the session that
the new media law is ``highly liberal.''
	   He explained that the envisaged huge fines - ranging from the
equivalent of dlrs 41,000 to 82,000 - ``must be an adequate
punishment for the possible harmful consequences'' of ``the
anti-state information'' or foreign ``psychological propaganda''
programs.
	   Independent legal experts and journalists said the law is highly
restrictive and again introduces censorship which was formally
abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s.
	   ``This law represents the basis for a permanent rule of the
black-red coalition,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former Serbian
information minister and a columnist of the recently banned Dnevni
Telegraf daily. He was referring to the Serbian ruling
ultra-nationalist, neo-Communist coalition.
	   ``The repressive law brings us back to the period of the
single-party Communist state,'' said lawyer Rajko Danilovic. ``It
represents the return to the monopoly on information.''
	   The government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
has used NATO threats of strikes on military targets in Serb-led
Yugoslavia to clamp down on its opponents. It has issued a series
of decrees tightening state control in the country.
	   One such decree imposed a ban on broadcasts of Serbian-language
programs by foreign media -- such as the Voice of America, Radio
Free Europe and BBC -- and demanded ``patriotic'' reporting from
the Serbian independent media critical of Milosevic's policies.
	   The decree does not say if foreign reports translated into
Serbian within Serbia are also banned.
	   Throughout the eight-month Kosovo crisis, state officials have
accused the media of betraying Serbia's national interests by
reporting ethnic Albanian stands in the conflict or carrying
foreign news reports about the fighting.
	   Last week, the government shut down prominent Nasa Borba, Danas
and Dnevni Telegraf dailies, following eviction of the popular
Index radio from its premises. Since coming to power in 1987,
Milosevic has used virtual monopoly over electronic media to
consolidate his hard-line rule.
	   The bans have triggered a wave of domestic and international
protests but to no effect.
	   At the parliament session, ultra-nationalist leader Vojislav
Seselj listed several independent media editors as NATO's
``collaborators'' and ``traitors'' because of their meeting with
the alliance's Secretary General, Javier Solana, during his visit
to Belgrade last week.
	   Milos Vasic, the head of an independent media union, said he
will file slender charges against Seselj. ``We'll let him prove how
come we have not been arrested by Yugoslavia's secret service if we
really are NATO spies,'' Vasic told independent B-92 radio.
	   ``Solana didn't care about media freedom in Serbia when he was
deciding whether to bomb Serb women and children,'' Seselj said.
	   The secretary-general of Milosevic's Socialist party, Gorica
Gajevic, accused the foreign ``media industry of inventing news,''
and said ``this law will protect the freedom of media from its
abuse.'
	   She praised the state-run media for their ``highly professional,
ethical and objective informing which defends dignity and patriotic
morale'' of the Serbs.
	   Other leftist and ultra-nationalist deputies labeled the
independent media as ``subservient and vassal'' to the West.
	   Some 40 deputies of the Serbian Renewal Movement, former staunch
opponents of Milosevic, left the 250-seat Serbian parliament before
the vote in protest of the law. Out of the 179 deputies who
remained, 170 voted for the law, 5 were against while four
abstained.
	   Average monthly salary in Yugoslavia amounts to no more that
dlrs 100, and private owners of the fledgling independent media say
they would not be able to cope with the proposed fines.
	   ``I would simply have to close my paper,'' said Slavko Curuvija,
the owner and chief editor of Dnevni Telegraf. ``The regime wants
to destroy independent media.''
	   He and other media owners indicated they would evade the Serbian
law by publishing in Montenegro, the small republic which with
Serbia forms Yugoslavia and is ruled by a pro-Western coalition.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The rebel Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army set their own list of conditions for peace in Kosovo Tuesday,
and threatened to continue fighting Serb government forces if their
demands are not met.
	   In a statement distributed to the ethnic Albanian media in
Kosovo, the rebels demanded all Serb forces be withdrawn from
Kosovo. The KLA also said all arrests must stop, political
prisoners must be released and experts from the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands, be allow to examine alleged
crimes against humanity.
	   ``Failure to fulfill those demands will impose on KLA the
continuation of the war for freedom, independence and democracy,''
the rebels said.
	   They also denied the killing of three Serb policemen earlier
this week, saying they were ``framed.'' The rebels said they would
respect a cease fire demanded by the United Nations, but accused
the Serb forces of provoking them.

Police seek American suspected of infecting Swedes with HIV

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Police on Tuesday hunted for an
American man suspected of assault for allegedly having unprotected
sex with women he picked up at Stockholm nightspots, despite
knowing he was HIV-positive.
	   The search was the top story on national radio news and in
afternoon newspapers, prompting calls from about 100 women to
authorities, Ulla Andersson, an assistant in the investigation,
told The Associated Press.
	   The Stockholm District Court identified the suspect as James
Patric Kimball, 40. A statement from the court said he is
originally from california, but did not give the city.
	   Andersson said the man has been living in Sweden since 1992.
	   ``This is a lethal man on the loose in society,'' prosecutor Jan
Frykman said on Swedish TV. ``To spread a deadly sickness in this
way shows a murderer's instinct.''
	   The court on Tuesday ordered him taken into custody on suspicion
of rape and assault. At least eight people in Sweden have been
convicted on assault charges for engaging in unprotected sex while
knowingly being HIV-positive, including one man who infected his
own wife.
	   Kimball came to police attention two weeks ago after a woman
said she had gone home with him and was given what she believed to
be a drug-laced drink. Under police questioning, the man said he
was HIV-positive, according to newspaper reports.
	   Prosecutors said they did not have sufficient evidence to hold
him in custody at the time. But a subsequent investigation turned
up an address book in which the man reportedly had listed the names
of 190 women, with marks indicating he had sexual intercourse with
at least 16 of them.
	   Police are now trying to contact all of the women listed in the
address book.
	   The man reportedly met many women in bars and told them he was a
party-arranger.
	   In Finland last year, former New York resident Stephen Thomas, a
rap singer and nightclub doorman, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison on 17 counts of attempted manslaughter for having
unprotected sex with women without telling them he was
HIV-positive.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in two new grafs at end with another researcher
denying human bones were found. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Archaeologists may have found the remains of Czar
Nicholas II's two missing children, solving one of the lingering
mysteries of the Russian Revolution, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The czar, his family and their servants were executed on July
17, 1918, in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and their
bodies dumped in an unmarked pit until they were unearthed in 1991.
	   After seven years of investigation and genetic tests, they were
buried in St. Petersburg in July.
	   But the remains of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne,
and one of his sisters _ either Maria or Anastasia _ were missing.
Anastasia's name was on one of the coffins this summer and
investigators say forensic tests led them to believe the missing
remains are those of Maria.
	   An independent archaeological expedition has spent two months
searching for the two children's remains at the site where the
bodies were burned by the Bolsheviks after the executions,
Moskovsky Komsomolets reported Tuesday.
	   Researchers have found four topaz beads of the kind that had
been presented each year to Maria on her birthday, and some bones
believed to be remains of Alexei and Maria, said forensic expert
Sergei Nikitin, who took part in the expedition.
	   The archaeologists have also found several bullets, which had
apparently gotten stuck in the jewelry sewn into the girl's corset,
he said, according to the newspaper.
	   The Bolsheviks had to use bayonets to finish killing the women
because the jewelry caused some of the bullets to ricochet or get
stuck.
	   But the researcher who initially found the bodies in 1991 denied
that the expedition had found any human bones. Alexander Avdonin,
who also took part in the latest dig, said only animal bones were
unearthed along with the beads and other items, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Avdonin said the search would resume in the spring.

Wiltord strike gives Bordeaux 1-0 lead over Vitesse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Girondins de Bordeaux had less
possession and fewer chances Tuesday, but came away with a 1-0 lead
from the first leg of its UEFA Cup second round tie at Vitesse
Arnhem.
	   With just seconds left in the first half Ali Benarbia's looping
cross found French striker Sylvain Wiltord totally unmarked, and
his scissor-kick volley slipped through Greek keeper Kostas
Chaniotakis's hands.
	   On 34 minutes the Dutch side's Dejan Curovic had a close-range
goal disallowed after Louis Laros was adjudged to have kicked the
ball out of sprawling Bordeaux keeper Ulrich Rame's hands.
	   The game caught light after the break as Vitesse shifted up a
gear and forced a series of clear chances.
	   Vitesse's star Greek striker Nikos Machlas, who had been
double-marked out of the game in the first half, finally broke free
seven minutes into the second period but lobbed over the bar.
	   Then Laros's thumping drive rattled the crossbar and minutes
later Bordeaux defender Lassine Diabate's sliding goalline
clearance foiled a close-range drive from Yugoslav Curovic.
	   The defeat was Vitesse's first in its new Gelredome stadium.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Fiorentina put its weekend's shock
defeat in the Italian league behind it Tuesday as it breezed to a
2-0 away victory over Grasshoppers of Switzerland.
	   In a display of the form that has made him the Italian league's
top scorer, Argentinian star forward Gabriel Batistuta netted a
pass from Edmundo in the 21st minute.
	   Anselmo Robbiati took advantage of sloppy defense to power in a
fine header just three minutes into the second half.
	   Fiorentina, the Italian Serie A leaders, occasionally came under
pressure from the Zurich underdogs. But the hosts' lack of
international quality scorers clearly showed.
	   The poor quality of the Hardturm stadium pitch _ which was a
national embarrassment in last week's European Championship
qualifier against Denmark _ slowed the pace and frustrated most
efforts at inspiring play.
	   Fiorentina was humbled 1-2 by a nine-man AS Roma at the weekend.
Despite UEFA's ban on the Fiorentina stadium for the Nov. 3 return
leg, the Italian side looks set to advance without problem to the
next round of the UEFA Cup.
	   ``We played well on the heavy pitch, scored two fine goals and
deserved to win,'' said Fiorentina trainer Giovanni Trapattoni.
``Above all, we concentrated much better than the league match
against Roma.''
	   Grasshoppers, traditionally the strongest team in the Swiss
league, dropped back to the UEFA Cup after being eliminated from
the more prestigious Champions' tournament.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron this
summer, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and
Palestinian civilians were injured in that attack.
	   After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed
responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a
double agent who had provided information to the Israeli security
service Shin Bet.
	   After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information,
Sarsour carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement
said.
	   The Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the
attacks, the statement said.
	   Israel TV reported that Shin Bet agents had met with Sarsour
about two weeks ago in an effort to hire him as an informant. At
the time, Shin Bet thought Sarsour was a minor Hamas activist and
did not know his involvement in previous attacks. After a friendly
discussion Sarsour reportedly agreed to help the Israeli agency and
only after Monday's attack did the Shin Bet realize who Sarsour
was.

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Bob Bradley, who led the expansion
Chicago Fire to the third-best record in the league and the MLS Cup
title game, was announced as Major League Soccer's Coach of the
Year Award winner on Tuesday.
	   Bradley left as the top assistant to Bruce Arena at D.C. United
the past two seasons to take over as the Fire's head coach and,
after a 2-5 start, finished with a 20-12 record.
	   His Fire has swept both the Dallas Burn and favored Los Angeles
Galaxy 2-0 in the Western Conference playoffs and will face either
Washington or Columbus on Sunday in the Rose Bowl in MLS Cup '98.
	   Bradley is the third member of the Fire to win a post-season
award. On Monday, Czech Lubos Kubik was announced as Defender of
the Year and Zach Thornton took Goalkeeper of the Year honors.
	   Also on Tuesday, Project-40 forward Ben Olsen of D.C. United was
announced as the Rookie of the Year. Olsen, who left the University
of Virginia after his junior year to join the MLS' and U.S. Soccer
Federation's joint development program, played in 31 games, started
24 and scored four goals for the two-time defending champion.
	   Also on Tuesday, Columbus Crew defender and U.S. national team
captain Thomas Dooley was announced as the MLS' Fair Play Award
winner.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's victorious Social Democrats
on Tuesday chose Wolfgang Thierse as president of the Bundestag, or
lower house of parliament, the first time the post has been filled
by a politician from the former East Germany.
	   Thierse, 54, narrowly defeated Christel Hanewinckel, also from
eastern Germany, whose candidacy was supported by many female
members of parliament.
	   The Bundestag president becomes a de facto leader of the country
in the event anything happens to the chancellor.
	   The Social Democrats also voted in lawyer Peter Struck to lead
the party in the Bundestag. Struck, 55, was elected by a wide
margin to replace Rudolf Scharping.

Brain implant allows paralyzed man to control computer
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ A Star Trek-type implant that enables direct
communication between the brain and a computer is allowing a
paralyzed, mute stroke victim to use his brainpower to move a
cursor across a screen and convey simple messages such as hello and
goodbye.
	   Researchers believe the tiny implant the size of the tip of a
ballpoint pen is the first device that allows direct communication
between the brain and a computer.
	   ``Of all things people lose, the ability to communicate is the
most frightening thing _ to know what you want to say and not to be
able to say it,'' said Dr. Warren Selman, a neurosurgeon at
University Hospitals of Cleveland not involved in the research.
``This is the first step to unlocking that.''
	   Doctors implanted a device into the 53-year-old man's brain that
amplifies his brain signals. Those signals are then transmitted to
a laptop computer through an antenna-like coil placed on his head.
	   Like a computer mouse, the brain signals can move a cursor
across the computer screen and point at icons with messages such as
``See you later. Nice talking with you.'' The man can also use the
cursor to tell others that he is hungry or thirsty.
	   ``It's like we're making the mouse the patient's brain,'' said
Dr. Roy Bakay, one of two Emory University doctors who developed
the technology.
	   Eventually, researchers hope to use the technology to teach
patients to write letters, send e-mail and turn lights off and on
via computer.
	   ``It opens up a very exciting new chapter in rehabilitation for
such patients,'' said Dr. William Friedman, program director and
associate chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Florida.
	   The patient, identified only as J.R., suffered a brain stem
stroke and is dependent on a ventilator at the Atlanta Veterans
Affairs Medical Center. His brain functions normally, but its
signals do not reach their intended destination.
	   Six months ago, Bakay and Dr. Phillip Kennedy implanted a tiny
glass cone into the man's brain. A substance that encourages nerves
to grow prompted the brain's nerves to link up to electrodes in the
cone, forming what Bakay calls ``a little brain'' inside the cone.
	   The electrodes can transmit electrical impulses produced by the
brain to a computer.
	   To train J.R.'s brain, researchers told him to think about
grabbing a glass. The cone is implanted in an area of the brain
that can produce signals designed to cause movement.
	   Bakay and Kennedy have been testing the technology on animals
for 12 years. Kennedy has patented the technology.
	   The first human patient, a woman suffering from Lou Gehrig's
disease, was able to control computer signals for 76 days before
she died. J.R. is their second patient. The National Institutes of
Health have awarded funding to continue research on at least one
more patient.
	   For more than a decade, some paralyzed people have communicated
with a computer program that translates their coded blinking into
letters on a screen. J.R. can blink, but ``I think he enjoys doing
this,'' Bakay said.
	   Selman expressed caution about using the technology on anybody
except patients with long-term paralysis. ``You'd hate to put
something in somebody in an area they're going to recover,'' he
said.

No Yankee Stadium referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALBANY, New York (AP) _ New York City voters apparently lost
their last chance to vote on whether to replace Yankee Stadium when
the state's highest court on Tuesday refused to hear a last-shot
appeal to place a referendum on the Nov. 3 ballot.
	   The 5-0 decision by the state Court of Appeals handed New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a victory in his fight to keep the
measure off the ballot.
	   New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, a Democrat running
for governor, had proposed giving voters a chance to decide whether
a dlrs 1 billion stadium should be built for the Yankees on
Manhattan's West Side, about a mile from Times Square.
	   Yankee Stadium, one of the most famous ballparks in America, was
built in the Bronx 75 years ago, and since completely renovated.
	   Vallone has no more avenues for judicial appeal.
	   However, he said he would ask the U.S. Justice Department to
intervene. He contended that New York City residents are
effectively being deprived of the right to vote by the Giuliani
administration.

Three South African peacekeeping troops guilty of misconduct in

Lesotho &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A military court on Tuesday
ordered three South African soldiers to be discharged for
misconduct during peacekeeping activities in Lesotho.
	   The charges included negligent firing of weapons, losing weapons
and being absent without leave, said Lt. Col. Laverne Machine, a
spokeswoman for the South African National Defense Force.
	   The soldiers were among 1,000 South African and Botswanan troops
who entered Lesotho last month to quell an army mutiny and protest
by opposition parties that nearly shut down the capital of Maseru
through August and September.
	   The government asked the troops for help.
	   Another six soldiers face charges to be heard by the military
court on Wednesday.
	   Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million people, is
surrounded by South Africa.

Russian artificial heart almost ready, but needs a bit more cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian researchers have almost completed a new
artificial heart and can start implanting it next year _ if they
can find the money for the last stage of its development, a news
agency said Tuesday.
	   ``The artificial heart is practically ready and its fine-tuning
doesn't require very big spending,'' top Russian heart surgeon
Valery Shumakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The heart is being developed by the Russian Health Ministry's
Institute for Transplants and Artificial Organs.
	   The institute isn't counting on any more government money for
the artificial heart because ``even the medics' salaries are paid
in fits and starts,'' largely because of the latest economic
crisis, Shumakov said.
	   Instead, the institute is looking for a Russian business
sponsor, Interfax said.
	   Shumakov was the first doctor in the Soviet Union to conduct a
successful heart transplant, in 1987. Since then about 100 heart
transplants have been performed in Russia, Interfax said.

Real Betis goalkeeper shines as Willem II is held to 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Real Betis took the lead with five
minutes to play but Willem II Tilburg equalized a minute later as
the sides drew 1-1 Tuesday in their UEFA Cup second round first leg
tie.
	   Humberto Alexis scored with a delicate chip five minutes from
time to give Betis a 1-0 lead but almost immediately from the
restart substitute Mariano Bombarda held off defender Topmas Olias,
turned and fired a left-foot shot low past Betis goalkeeper Antonio
Prats from the edge of the penalty area.
	   Prats was Betis' hero, pulling off three good saves to keep his
team in the match.
	   In the 51st minute Marcel Valk let loose a curling 25-yard
(meter) shot that forced a good diving save from Prats.
	   The athletic 'keeper again kept his team in contention in the
56th minute when he dived to his right to brilliantly parry a
powerful close-range shot by Adil Ramiz. Prats was on hand once
more to save a strong header by Delano Hill from a 68th-minute
corner.
	   Apart from the late goal, Betis' best chance fell in the 28th
minute when Finidi George broke down the left flank and crossed to
Juan Merino who slipped as he attempted to sidefoot the ball past
Jim van Fessem in the Tilburg goal.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron this
summer, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and
Palestinian civilians were injured in that attack.
	   After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed
responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a
double agent who had provided information to the Israeli security
service Shin Bet.
	   After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information,
Sarsour carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement
said.
	   The Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the
attacks, the statement said.
	   Israel TV reported that Shin Bet agents had met with Sarsour
about two weeks ago in an effort to hire him as an informant. At
the time, Shin Bet thought Sarsour was a minor Hamas activist and
did not know his involvement in previous attacks. After a friendly
discussion Sarsour reportedly agreed to help the Israeli agency and
only after Monday's attack did the Shin Bet realize who Sarsour
was.

Parma player claims he was injured by knife during Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Parma's midfielder Dino Baggio told Italian
television interviewers Tuesday that he was injured in the head by
a knife hurled by a rival fan during a UEFA Cup match in Krakow.
	   ``I was hit by something in the head and then I saw a knife on
the field. I could not believe it,'' said Baggio, who completed the
match against Wisla after being treated by team doctors.
	   The Italian international displayed to television cameras a head
cut which required five stitches.
	   The Italian RAI-2 television channel reported that Parma
officials did not immediately file an official complaint. The case
will be considered by club officials on their return to Italy.
	   Parma and Wisla played to a 1-1 draw in their first-leg
second-round match of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   Baggio was injured during the second half and stayed off the
field for treatment for about four minutes.
	   Baggio's teammates were quoted by the Italian television as
saying they also saw the knife on the field and that a Polish
player was quick to hurl it off before the referee could see it.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina recovered from
its dramatic Serie A loss to Roma by cruising to a 2-0 victory at
Swiss club Grasshoppers in the second round of the UEFA Cup
Tuesday.
	   Fiorentina, which lost a one-goal lead against 9-man Roma to
tumble 2-1 in Serie A on Saturday, takes a big advantage to the
home leg in two weeks time as it chases a place in the last 16.
	   Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta netted a pass from Brazilian
star Edmundo in the 21st minute and Anselmo Robbiati took advantage
of sloppy defense to power in a fine header just three minutes into
the second half.
	   ``We played well on the heavy pitch, scored two fine goals and
deserved to win,'' said Fiorentina trainer Giovanni Trapattoni.
``Above all, we concentrated much better than the league match
against Roma.''
	   Parma's Italian international midfielder Dino Baggio suffered a
head injury which he said was caused by a knife hurled by a fan
during the game in Krakow.
	   Baggio showed the wound, which needed five stitches, to Italian
TV after the game, which ended 1-1.
	   Enrico Chiesa fired the Italians ahead in third minute but
Tomasz Kulawik salvaged a tie for the Poles in the 68th.
	   Another Italian club in action Tuesday, Bologna gained a 2-1
first leg lead over Slavia Prague with Swedish midfielder Klas
Ingesson heading the game winner with six minutes left.
	   Giuseppe Signori gave the home team a 1-0 lead in the 51st
minute but Richard Dostalek equalized in the 67th.
	   Forced by UEFA to play its home game away from Belgrade because
of the continuing threat of NATO military strikes in the light of
the Kosovo crisis, Red Star lost 2-1 to Lyon.
	   Some 1,500 Red Star supporters traveled to Bucharest for the
``home'' game and saw Dalibor Skoric fire their team ahead from the
penalty spot.
	   But Swiss international Marco Grassi leveled in the 58th minute
and Frederic Kanoute volleyed the winner five minutes from the end.
	   VfB Stuttgart, which gained the second round by winning 3-0 at
Feyenoord in an amazing comeback from 3-1 down after the first leg,
was held 1-1 at home by Brugges.
	   Nigerian striker Jonathan Akrobopie celebrated his 30th birthday
by firing Stuttgart ahead after only eight minutes but injury-hit
Brugges came back with an equalizer by Sven Vermant 20 minutes from
the end.

	   ROME (AP) _ Lazio's Chilean striker Marcelo Salas, who limped
out with an injured left ankle during last Sunday''s league match
with Inter Milan, is recovering quickly and may be started against
Partizan Belgrade in the Cup Winners Cup first-leg second-round
Thursday.
	   Sven Goran Eriksson, the Swedish coach of the Roman team, said
Salas will undergo a final test Wednesday.
	   ``If he proves fit Salas will lead the attack along with Roberto
Mancini against Partizan,'' Eriksson said Tuesday.
	   Salas was injured shortly after scoring a quick goal in Lazio's
5-3 rout of Inter at San Siro stadium.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Francisco Narvaez Machon Kiko scored
twice for Atletico Madrid's 4-2 victory Tuesday over local CSKA in
the first leg of the second round UEFA cup tournament.
	   Atletico's defender Stefano Torrisi opened the scoring in the
41st minute with a high shot that found the CSKA goalie Ivailo
Ivanov unprepared.
	   A minute and a half later Osvaldo Giroldo Junior Juninho sneaked
through the CSKA defense and passed the ball to Kiko, who scored
from a short distance.
	   In the 53rd minute CSKA forward Boncho Genchev used a mistake by
Atletico's goalie Pedro Luis Jaro to up the score 2-1.
	   Bolstered by Genchev's goal, CSKA launched a series of attacks,
but in 75th minute Atletico's Roberto Fresnedoso Pietro scored with
a header.
	   In the 87th minute, Kiko eliminated CSKA defense with a solo
action that sealed Atletico's victory with a goal from a small
angle.
	   The match, played at the Balgarska Armia stadium, was attended
by some 25,000 people.

Four new legal challenges in Germany may slow Daimler-Chrysler
</HEADLINE>
merger &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Four more Daimler shareholders have
filed lawsuits challenging the planned merger with Chrysler, a
Stuttgart court said Tuesday.
	   After two were filed last week, Daimler said the suits could
delay the deal, expected to be finalized by the end of the year.
	   A regional court, meanwhile, ruled that the company's offices
could not be searched to produce the minutes of Daimler's
extraordinary Sept. 18 shareholders meeting approving the merger
demanded by one of the plaintiffs.
	   Shareholder Karsten Trippel received only his own questions and
answers from Daimler officials when he asked for the full
transcript.
	   Daimler argues it is not obliged to produce the records. Another
Stuttgart court is due to rule on the company's position later this
week.
	   Board member Manfred Gentz said the legal challenges may delay
the deal, but would not weaken the new company. The deal is at a
critical stage, as Daimler shares must be swapped by Friday for
shares in the new company.
	   ``If, as expected, the necessary exchange of shares is reached,
then the merger will happen,'' Gentz said.
	   Seventy-five percent of Daimler shares on an undiluted basis
must be exchanged for shares in the new company for the deal to go
through. But the two automakers want an exchange of at least 90
percent, which will allow them to use the more favorable ``pooling
of interests'' accounting method

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French court on Tuesday freed the jailed
doctor of the Festina cycling team, which became the center of a
doping scandal during the Tour de France.
	   Eric Ryckaert, a Belgian, was released on 100,000 francs (dlrs
18,350) bail and was to remain under judicial surveillance. He had
been jailed since July 17.
	   Ryckaert has admitted the use of banned doping products at
Festina, though the team's star rider, Richard Virenque, continues
to deny he knowingly took such substances.
	   Leaving a prison in Douai late Tuesday afternoon, Ryckaert said
he was relieved, and hoped he wouldn't be ``a scapegoat in this
doping affair.''

Brazil, IMF near agreement on rescue package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Brazil and the International Monetary Fund
moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion
rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy.
	   A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said
the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit
from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by
2000.
	   The statement was issued after weekend talks between IMF
officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente,
executive secretary of the Finance Ministry.
	   Representatives of the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank took part in the talks. Both organizations as well
as private banks are expected to contribute to the rescue package.
	   Brazil is the latest country to be hit by the financial crisis
that began 15 months ago in Asia and then spread to Russia. Brazil
has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserves since
August when Russia defaulted on its debts and sparked a new crisis
of confidence in emerging market countries.
	   If instability continues in Brazil it could affect Argentina,
its main trading partner, and other Latin American economies.
	   Despite the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a
second term as president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil
and the IMF had agreed on the broad outlines of a financial
assistance package, investors continued to withdraw large sums of
money from Brazil.
	   Cardoso is preparing an emergency program of budget cuts to
restore investor confidence and prevent a devaluation of the
country's currency. Investors want Cardoso to outline the plans
this week but he is expected to wait until after Sunday's second
round of elections for state governors, whose support he needs for
his budget cuts.
	   The joint statement said the Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed
at preparing the ground for prompt support by the international
community, including the IMF, for the multi-year fiscal program to
be announced soon by the Brazilian authorities, which will include
new policy initiatives.''
	   The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary
budget surplus of 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in
1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would ''
fulfill the government target of stabilizing the ratio of net
consolidated public sector debt to GDP by the year 2000.''
	   The two sides are to continue their talks ``with the objective
of reaching early agreement,'' the statement said.

Libyan leader says he wants improved relationship with United
</HEADLINE>
States

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing are ''very happy'' to be tried in the
Netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better
relationship with the United States.
	   ''We can solve this problem very easily,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in an interview released Tuesday. ''Then the
families of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of this
anxious problem.''
	   ''When peace comes between the two countries, they will shake
hands and there will be peace. After that such acts will
automatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am
jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposed
sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over. He
argued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in either
Britain or the United States.
	   But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Council
approved a U.S.-British plan in August for a trial of the two
Libyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges following
Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi has
demanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects. He also
wants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya or
the Netherlands. Britain and the United States have refused to
negotiate.
	   Gadhafi did not discuss that obstacle in the BBC interview. But
he did seek to distance himself from the two men, who the United
States and Britain say are Libyan agents.
	   ''They may be guilty or not guilty,'' Gadhafi told the BBC.
''That is the job of the court to decide. If they are guilty, it is
because there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.
Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America.''
	   Gadhafi also claimed to have evidence backing up allegations by
a former British spy that Britain plotted to kill the Libyan
leader.
	   The British government has denied using its foreign intelligence
service in any part of an assassination attempt, but Gadhafi told
the BBC, ''Yes, yes, it happened.''
	   ''Britain was behind this campaign of assassination. There is
evidence and when the time comes we will bring this evidence
forward,'' he said.
	   Last month, an Arab television company broadcast a video of what
it said was a 1996 assassination attempt against Gadhafi by British
intelligence agents.
	   The footage showed an object flying through the crowd at a rally
and landing at Gadhafi's feet. Gadhafi and his bodyguards looked
down at the object, and moved calmly away. In some of the images,
the object appeared to be a superimposed grenade.
	   David Shayler, the renegade spy who made the claim about the
assassination attempt, is currently being held in prison in Paris.
He is due in court Wednesday for an extradition hearing. If
returned to Britain, Shayler faces the prospect of being charged
under the Official Secrets Act because of his revelations about the
intelligence agency.

Sosa back in Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Greeted by a
crowd of thousands that included his country's president and
baseball Hall of Famer Juan Marichal, Sammy Sosa finally returned
home Tuesday.
	   ``I feel very happy and honored that my people are on their
feet, waiting for me,'' said Sosa, in the Dominican Republic for
the first time since his 66-homer season.
	   ``To see that in the United States they applauded a Dominican
makes me happy and proud to be Dominican.''
	   On a day of national celebration, President Leonel Fernandez was
among the throng to cheer the Chicago Cubs slugger as he emerged
from a private jet at Santo Domingo's international airport.
	   ``After suffering the effects of Hurricane Georges, we know what
it felt like for the teams facing Sammy Sosa to feel the force of
Hurricane Sosa,'' Fernandez said.
	   Also in the receiving line on a rainy day was Marichal, the
great San Francisco Giants pitcher who is now the Dominican sports
minister.
	   Before Sosa arrived, cars with windshields painted ``Welcome
Sammy'' and ``Go Sammy!'' jammed the two-lane highway from the
capital to the airport. Thousands more fans took free bus rides to
welcome Sosa, who has become an idol like none this Caribbean
nation has known.
	   ``He scrapes, he gives his all, it's the Dominican style!''
gushed Maximo Sosa, a fan who is no relation to Sammy.
	   Since the season ended, Sosa received the keys to New York City,
threw a ceremonial first pitch in the World Series and raised money
for hurricane victims. In his homeland, he had a winter league
season named for him and will receive the nation's top medal.
	   After his stopover in Santo Domingo, Sosa headed for San Pedro
de Macoris, his hometown 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the
capital, where a victory procession and merengue party awaited.
	   In San Pedro, the seaside boulevard was lined with palm trees
before Georges smashed them Sept. 22. Thousands lost their homes,
and many are still waiting for electricity and water.
	   Nationwide, the storm killed at least 283 people and left
100,000 homeless.
	   Sosa's final home runs became Dominicans' only cause for
celebration after the storm, even though Mark McGwire took the
crown with 70 homers.
	   San Pedro provincial Mayor Sergio Cedeno said Tuesday that Sosa
sent home three planeloads of food and medical supplies.
	   ``For being a humble person who has reached the hearts of many
people ... he's the best ambassador we could have to show the
disaster that has stricken us,'' Cedeno said.
	   The government also has diplomatic plans for Sosa. Fernandez
planned to name him a ``Roving Ambassador to the Glory of Sport''
when he presents him with the nation's highest honor, the Grand
Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella, at a National
Palace ceremony Friday.
	   But Sosa's most precious gift to Dominicans was one that
couldn't be quantified.
	   ``Sammy is not someone for what he gives anyway,'' said
motorcycle taxi driver Luis Alex, who wears black batting gloves on
both hands, just as Sosa does.
	   ``He's someone we hold here inside,'' Alex signaled to his
heart, ``for what he gives as pride.''

Testaverde passing all the tests

<TEXT>
	   HEMPSTEAD, New York (AP) _ Could this be the same Vinny
Testaverde that American football fans have belittled for more than
a decade? The guy who won the Heisman Trophy, then had his career
turn sour when he turned pro?
	   Testaverde's 12th National Football League season has taken a
somewhat unexpected turn. He's started half of the New York Jets'
three games, and won them all. Glenn Foley, the incumbent
quarterback, is 0-3 and injury-prone.
	   So what's up with Vinny?
	   For one thing, his confidence is soaring. For another, his
coach, Bill Parcells, has faith in him. For yet another, he's
surrounded by good offensive talent in running backs Curtis Martin
and Leon Johnson and receivers Wayne Chrebet, Keyshawn Johnson and
Dedric Ward.
	   ``It's a little early to tell,'' Parcells said after Testaverde
threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns in Monday night's 24-14
victory at New England. ``I think that he likes the system and it's
not a real big adjustment from the systems he's been in. There
aren't many guys in the league who can throw the ball like him.
	   ``He manages a game well and he works diligently.''
	   Testaverde is working extra hard to erase the image of being the
kind of quarterback who makes the key mistake. In his career, he's
made the playoffs only once, with the 1994 Browns, who were coached
by current Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.
	   Otherwise, it's been lots of losses in Tampa Bay, Cleveland and
Baltimore.
	   But there haven't been any defeats with the Jets. He went 2-0
when Foley was injured earlier this season. He's 1-0 after Foley
was benched.
	   ``I'm comfortable with what we're doing,'' Testaverde said.
``I'm real proud of our guys, because they fought hard on the road
against a division opponent on a Monday night.
	   ``A lot of teams have been talking about New England. When we
played Miami two weeks ago, a lot of people were talking about
them.''
	   It will be hard to ignore Testaverde and the Jets if they can
win some more critical games like Monday's. A loss probably would
have doomed them to mediocrity _ not that 3-3 is anything special.
The win, however, makes them believers again.
	   Most significantly for Testaverde, there doesn't figure to be
any question on who will be the quarterback for the foreseeable
future. It's Vinny's job.
	   ``Obviously, he's been around,'' said Ward, who caught a 43-yard
TD pass to clinch the victory at Foxboro, Mass. ``He's a seasoned
vet who has seen a lot of things and played in a lot of big games
in that span. He knows how to handle it.''

Police seek American suspected of infecting Swedes with HIV

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish police on Tuesday hunted for an
American man suspected of assault for allegedly having unprotected
sex with women he picked up at Stockholm nightspots, despite
knowing he was HIV-positive.
	   The search was the top story on national radio news and in
afternoon newspapers, prompting calls from about 100 women to
authorities, Ulla Andersson, an assistant in the investigation,
told The Associated Press.
	   The Stockholm District Court identified the suspect as James
Patric Kimball, 40. A statement from the court said he is
originally from california, but did not give the city.
	   Andersson said the man has been living in Sweden since 1992.
	   ``This is a lethal man on the loose in society,'' prosecutor Jan
Frykman said on Swedish TV. ``To spread a deadly sickness in this
way shows a murderer's instinct.''
	   The court on Tuesday ordered him taken into custody on suspicion
of rape and assault. At least eight people in Sweden have been
convicted on assault charges for engaging in unprotected sex while
knowingly being HIV-positive, including one man who infected his
own wife.
	   Kimball came to police attention two weeks ago after a woman
said she had gone home with him and was given what she believed to
be a drug-laced drink. Under police questioning, the man said he
was HIV-positive, according to newspaper reports.
	   Prosecutors said they did not have sufficient evidence to hold
him in custody at the time. But a subsequent investigation turned
up an address book in which the man reportedly had listed the names
of 190 women, with marks indicating he had sexual intercourse with
at least 16 of them.
	   Police are now trying to contact all of the women listed in the
address book.
	   The man reportedly met many women in bars and told them he was a
party-arranger.
	   In Finland last year, former New York resident Stephen Thomas, a
rap singer and nightclub doorman, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison on 17 counts of attempted manslaughter for having
unprotected sex with women without telling them he was
HIV-positive.

UEFA Cup: Liverpool 0, Valencia 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Valencia missed two second half
chances and Liverpool was thankful to hold on for a 0-0 tie in the
second round of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   A four-time Champions Cup winner, Liverpool looked a pale shadow
of the team that dominated Europe in the 1970s and early 80s
although it had chances in the first half. It hopes to do better in
the second leg in Spain is Nov. 3.
	   Liverpool decided to rest 18-year-old England World Cup forward
Michael Owen who has been showing signs of weariness after playing
80 games in 17 months. The striker entered the game 17 minutes from
the game but made little impact.
	   After defender Vegard Heggem had blocked a goalbound shot from
Valencia's Miguel Angulo, Liverpool twice went close to going
ahead.
	   A header by German international striker KarlHeinz Riedle was
kicked off the line by Gica Popescu in the 15th minute and then
Paul Ince fired over the top from 12 meters after Valencia again
failed to deal with a Liverpool corner.
	   Czech forward Patrik Berger fired a 25-meter left footer in the
26th minute only for Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares to keep
it out with an acrobatic fingertip save over the top.
	   Popescu squandered a great chance when Argentinian striker
Claudio Lopez shrugged off and turned a Liverpool defender and
turned the ball back to the Romanian who fired into the crowd from
no more than 16 meters.
	   Liverpool sent Owen on for Robbie Fowler with 17 minutes to go
and Oyvind Leonardsen for Berger but the home team still struggled
to create openings.
	   Romanian forward Adrian Ilie got clear of the Liverpool defense
with 10 minutes to go but fired wide.
	   Then Liverpool goalkeeper David James, keeping American
international Brad Friedel out of the team, made a spectacular
diving save to keep out a free kick from Valencia captain Gaizka
Mendieta with six minutes to go.

Roma defeats Leeds 1-0 in Uefa Cup second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Leeds United hit the posts twice. Marco Del Vecchio
scored once as Roma downed the British team 1-0 in their first leg
second-round match of the UEFA Cup Tuesday night.
	   Del Vecchio, an agile Italian forward, scored the game winner in
the 18th minute at Rome's Olympic stadium.
	   As Leeds' South African defender Lucas Radebe failed to clear a
precise long pass by Francesco Totti, Del Vecchio rushed unmarked
into the penalty area and put the ball between the post and goalie
Nigel Martyn.
	   One minute later Totti, who gave Roma a thrilling 2-1
injury-time victory against Fiorentina in a league match last
Saturday, had the chance to make it 2-0 but his shot went past the
post by a few inches.
	   Leeds, masterminded by young Australian Harry Kewell, pressed on
the attack after allowing the goal and had consecutive
opportunities for an equalizer.
	   Portuguese Bruno Ribeiro, left unmarked on a failed offside trap
by the Roman defense, hit the post in the 23rd minute.
	   Ten minutes later it was up up Norwegian Gunnar Halle to hit the
post of the Roman net with a powerful diagonal shot.
	   Leeds definitely gave up offense and control of the game when
Ribeiro was sent off the field in the 55th minute after receiving
his second caution.
	   One player down, the British team suffered Roma's growing
pressure in the last 35 minutes but the home team did not produce
impressive chances although fielding two forwards, Argentine
Gustavo Bartlet and Russian Dmitri Alenichev, as substitutes for
two midfielders.
	   About 43,000 fans, including a few hundreds of vocal Leeds
supporters, watched the match which marked AS Roma's 12th straight
home victory in European Cup play.
	   Roma's midfielder Luigi Di Biagio, who received his second
caution in the tournament, will miss the next game, the Nov. 3
second leg in England.
	   ``We were unable to take advantage from Ribeiro's expulsion,''
said Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman. ``Leeds proved strong, as expected.
The second leg will be difficult.''

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's federal prosecutor on
Tuesday ordered the confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts
in Switzerland and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation into
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of trials
in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment
during his brother's 1988-1994 administration.
	   Carla del Ponte said the investigation had concluded that funds
in the accounts, of which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner, came
partly from protection payoffs from drug traffickers.
	   The Swiss halted their own proceedings on charges of money
laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants, but said
their findings ``inevitably suggest money laundering'' of drug
profits.
	   Del Ponte said Switzerland couldn't try Salinas because he is
imprisoned in Mexico. Mexican proceedings against Salinas and
others on money laundering charges made a Swiss criminal case
unnecessary, she added.
	   Most of the money seized _ dlrs 89.9 million _ ordered
confiscated is in Swiss bank accounts. But a further dlrs 24.5
million is in London, administered by a Swiss-based financial
institution.
	   Salinas' lawyers can appeal the decision, taken Monday, within
ten days. That would send the case to Switzerland's supreme court,
but Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' it would uphold the
seizure.
	   At a Mexico City news conference, Raul Salinas' lawyer, Eduardo
Luengo Creel, said he would appeal.
	   In a letter written from his prison cell in central Mexico, Raul
Salinas accused the Swiss prosecutors of illegally trying to grab
his money. He said they relied on questionable witnesses,
exaggerated the size of his accounts and falsely accused him of
taking bribes from drug smugglers.
	   Salinas has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the
money was an investment fund pooled by several wealthy friends. In
his letter, Salinas said the ``sole purpose of the Swiss
authorities is to illegally take control of the money.''
	   Despite Raul Salinas' claims of innocence, Del Ponte said ``the
business dealings he claims are beyond all economic logic.''
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   Witnesses spoke of ``green light days'' on which, after
agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials, drugs
destined for the United States could be transported through Mexico
on certain routes.
	   ``With all his contacts and his power, he could guarantee
protection for those loads,'' Roschacher added. Salinas' contacts
with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and became more intense
under his brother's presidency in the early 1990s, he continued.
	   Seven countries including Mexico and the United States
collaborated with the Swiss inquiry. Six U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration analysts helped with the investigation in Bern at
various points, Roschacher said.
	   The investigators interviewed 78 witnesses, 31 of them bank
employees, and 16 of them had to testify anonymously for their own
safety, Roschacher said. Raul Salinas himself was questioned four
times.
	   A number of witnesses have been killed in Mexico in the course
of the investigation, he added.
	   Swiss authorities did not release the full 230-page police
report on Salinas.
	   Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995. Some dlrs
7.8 million have since been unblocked as the money was proved
unlinked to drugs or protection payments, Del Ponte said.
	   Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges
of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco
Ruiz Masseiu, and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel
government post in his brother's administration.
	   No drug-related charges have been brought against Salinas and he
was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality.

Island caretaker acquitted of attempted murder in Antigua

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ The caretaker of a tiny Antiguan
island has been acquitted of trying to kill the prime minister's
brother during a fight over construction of a resort.
	   A jury on Monday found Cyril Thomas ``Taffy'' Bufton, a
73-year-old Welshman who tended Guiana Island with his wife for 32
years, innocent of charges he meant to wound or kill. Bufton had
been charged with shooting Vere Bird Jr., the brother of Prime
Minister Lester Bird, on Dec. 16.
	   Bird, 61, claimed Bufton came into his law office in St. John's
and pulled a gun on him minutes after Parliament passed a bill to
evict Bufton and his wife, Lorna Eleen ``Bonny'' Bufton, from the
island.
	   There was a scuffle, and Bufton was injured in the hand. Bird
was shot in the mouth and underwent reconstructive surgery in New
York.
	   During the trial, Bufton's defense lawyers argued there was
confusion as to what happened in the office and that the bullet may
have ricocheted off a wall before striking Bird.
	   Bird, who is a member of the Caribbean country's Parliament,
voted in favor of the eviction bill, but argued for more leniency
for the Buftons, the island's only residents.
	   The measured cleared the way for a dlrs 300 million luxury
resort to be built on the 460-acre (184-hectare) isle.
	   The Buftons arrived on Guiana Island in the 1960s to farm the
land for the London lawyer who owned the island, then stayed on
after the owner's 1972 death in an informal caretaking agreement
with the government. They tended the island's animals, including a
colony of rare West Indian whistling ducks.
	   The Buftons were offered dlrs 500,000 in exchange for leaving
the island, but they asked the government for four times that
amount.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Salem Rajab Sarsour doesn't fit the
typical profile of a Palestinian likely to stage attacks against
Israel. Too old, too settled, too stable _ not like the young
firebrands who'd walk into crowded cafes and marketplaces and blow
themselves up.
	   But the wave of attacks to which Israeli authorities said
Tuesday he has confessed _ hurling grenades at a bus stop and an
Israeli military jeep, stabbing an elderly rabbi to death in a
Jewish settlement _ could be part of a new pattern of violence by
Islamic militants against Israel.
	   It's been more than a year since the radical group Hamas has
staged a suicide-bombing in the heart of an Israeli city. Since
then, sophisticated large-scale attacks by tightly organized cells
of fighters have given way to a different kind of operation,
smaller in scope but deadly in intent.
	   Such attacks _ stabbings, shootings, grenade-throwing _ are
relatively easy to stage and extremely difficult to prevent. That
could bode ill for peace hopes at a time when Israel is demanding
almost airtight security guarantees from the Palestinians.
	   The Israeli army said Sarsour's rampage came at Hamas' behest,
even though he goes against type as one of its foot soldiers.
	   He is married, about to turn 30, the father of five small
children. He had steady work. His family lives in a relatively
well-off neighborhood in the West Bank town of Hebron, not a
squalid refugee camp.
	   Like so many Palestinians of his generation, though, he has
battle scars and baggage: the family home was demolished by Israeli
troops when he was 12; he went to jail while a teen-ager, during
the intefadeh, and again in his early 20s.
	   Neighbors described Sarsour as more devout than most, dubbing
him ``Sheik Salem'' for the large white prayer cap he always wore.
His family denied knowledge of any Hamas links, but his brother
Jamal said if he indeed carried out attacks against Israel, ``we
would be proud of him.''
	   The attacks attributed to Sarsour, like others blamed on Islamic
militants this year, made use of either common implements _ knives,
nails for bombs _ or of items freely available on the weapons black
market like guns and grenades.
	   They tended to target either the Israeli military or Jewish
settlers, rather than the random urban passers-by hurt and killed
in Hamas suicide-bombings in the mid-1990s.
	   Under past norms, someone Sarsour's age was more likely to be a
behind-the-scenes mastermind than a field operative. His active
role as an attacker could raise fears in Israel, where many
security measures are based on profiling meant to pinpoint those
who pose the greatest risk.
	   For example, it is almost impossible for an unmarried
Palestinian man in his early 20s to get a permit to work in Israel,
because suicide-bombers were almost always young, single and
jobless.
	   Another change: some of Sarsour's actions were opportunistic and
impulsive, as opposed to the clockwork planning that has generally
characterized Hamas attacks before. Authorities said he approached
a Jewish settlement in Hebron in August intending to throw
firebombs at soldiers but seized the opportunity to stab an
elderly, unarmed rabbi.
	   When attackers in such hit-and-run episodes escape, as they
often do, it is difficult for investigators to determine whether
they acted under orders from Hamas or were inspired by its
hard-line ideology. The group opposes any peace with Israel.
	   Sarsour told Israeli authorities that Hamas had trained him in
use of grenades, and the group's military arm claimed
responsibility for his attack on a bus stop frequented by soldiers
in the desert town of Beersheba.
	   Sarsour's attacks, and others like it, are harder for Israeli
intelligence or Palestinian police to anticipate than a major
bombing, but that doesn't fully explain the apparent shift in
tactics.
	   Hamas may not have renounced suicide attacks or car bombings; it
may simply be having trouble pulling them off. For the past five
weeks _ ever since Israeli troops gunned down two top Hamas
fugitives _ Israel has been on high alert for a large-scale Hamas
action, and authorities have reported a number of foiled attempts
to make and transport explosives.
	   Army radio quoted the head of army intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amos
Malka, as saying Tuesday that recent action against Hamas by both
Israeli and Palestinian security forces had hampered its ability to
carry out mass attacks. But he told lawmakers the group's
infrastructure still exists and its motives are unchanged.
	   Some observers, though, see signs of a tacit deal between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Hamas.
	   ``Hamas is operating low-level field men, to carry out
relatively primitive attacks, and Arafat can claim that these are
'local initiatives' which the Palestinian Authority security
apparatus ... is helpless to prevent,'' commentator Ron Ben-Yishai
wrote Tuesday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   Palestinian leaders call it a no-win situation, saying Israel is
using violence they can neither predict nor prevent as an excuse
for refusing to cede more territory.

UEFA Cup: Celtic 1, FC Zurich 1

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Urs Fischer floated a 40-meter cross
into the net for a freak equalizer 14 minutes from the end as FC
Zurich gained a 1-1 tie against Glasgow Celtic in the UEFA Cup
second round Tuesday.
	   Norwegian forward Harald Brattbakk gave the Scottish champion a
24th minute lead from Jackie McNamara's cross with the Zurich
defense appealing for offside.
	   McNamara rescued Celtic by clearing a shot from South African
striker Shaun Bartlett off the line.
	   In the closing minute of the first-half, Tommy Boyd handled a
Shaun Bartlett shot heading for an empty net. It meant a red card
and a penalty, but goalkeeper Jonathan Gould, whose error had
created the chance, made up for it by saving Cesar Santanna's spot
kick. Santanna also missed the rebound.
	   But Zurich gained its leveler in the 76th minute when Fischer's
speculative long range cross from wide on the left beat Gould and
curled under the bar to give the Swiss club a great chance of
advancing when the second leg is played Nov. 3.

	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ Werder Bremen salvaged a 1-1 draw Tuesday
against Olympique Marseille in a first-round UEFA Cup match on
Andreas Herzog's long-distance blast.
	   Herzog, an Austrian international, shot the evener in the
first-leg match just seconds after Florian Maurice had put the
French club up 1-0 in the 68th minute.
	   After a slow first half for both sides, the struggling
last-place Bundesliga club surprisingly battled Olympique Marseille
even and earned most of the scoring chances against a French squad
placed second in its league.
	   Herzog, coming back from a toe injury, forced a leaping goalie
Andreas Koepke to bat away his free kick headed into the net's left
corner to open the second half.
	   Maurice's goal, which put the French club in good position for
the second leg, came when the midfielder directed Christophe
Dugarry's cross into the net's left corner.
	   Herzog's equalized seconds later when a French defender, trying
to clear, headed directly out to him in the center of the field and
he immediately fired straight-ahead.
	   But the German club, lacking a home win and off to its worst
Bundesliga start in history, had no trouble penetrating Marseille's
defense.
	   Their players, especially striker Marco Bode, lacked the finesse
to convert numerous scoring chances and claim a surprising victory.
	   ``The way we've played recently, you would have to be crazy to
think we could win,'' said Herzog before the match.
	   The match could save the job of embattled coach Bremen coach
Wolfgang Sidka, whose future will be decided by team management in
the next two days.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's military chief told
President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday he has still not met terms
of the agreement to avert airstrikes, and Kosovo's rebels said they
would continue their independence struggle until government troops
leave the province.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark delivered the message to the Yugoslav
president late Tuesday in the capital Belgrade as a new violence
raises fears about the Oct. 12 agreement with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told reporters
Clark would provide ``very specific information'' to the Yugoslav
leader ``about his failure to comply fully with the requirements of
the international community.''
	   ``And he will be making very clear that NATO will use military
force against the Serbs if he doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic has still
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in
February when he launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   They have been fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province
of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90
percent of the province's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Under an agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic pledged to meet a
series of U.N. demands, including a withdrawal of special police
and army units, halt the crackdown, allow international agencies to
aid thousands of refugees and resume talks with ethnic Albanians on
the future of the province.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that some of the special
units sent to the province remain in Kosovo despite the agreement.
	   Meanwhile, a recent upsurge of violence has prompted Yugoslav
army troops backed by Serbian police to maintain an increased and
visible presence in areas of tension.
	   On Tuesday, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said a Serb
policeman was wounded when ``terrorists'' attacked a police patrol
near Klina, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   U.S. officials have also warned the KLA to halt such attacks.
	   In Kosovo's capital Pristina, the rebels issued a statement
detailing a series of their own demands, chief among them the
withdrawal of all government forces from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and investigations of ``crimes against
humanity'' by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands.
	   ``Failure to fulfill those demands will impose on KLA the
continuation of the war for freedom, independence and democracy,''
the rebels said.
	   Meanwhile, international efforts to aid refugees continued. As
winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if the
estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting _ including
thousands living in the open _ are not allowed to return home.
	   Relief convoys suspended following weekend attacks rolled again,
with Mercy Corps International and other humanitarian groups
sending 150 tons of food, clothing, mattresses and other items to
the southwestern Kosovo town of Djinovce.
	   Three other convoys also went out, including two from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees that were postponed Monday due to
the Serb military buildup.
	   A 20-member U.N. team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden,
arrived in Kosovo on Tuesday as the ``eyes and ears'' of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``We are here to assess the situation on the ground after the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, and to report to the
secretary-general,'' de Mistura said.
	   Many Kosovo Albanians who support secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, were distressed about the
Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement. They wanted NATO airstrikes to
cripple the Yugoslav military machine and promote their goal of
independence, which the United States and the Europeans oppose.
	   Western nations fear an independent Kosovo would trigger similar
demands by ethnic Albanian communities in Macedonia and elsewhere
in the southern Balkans.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reiterated that position
Tuesday.
	   ``One of the reasons why it is so important that we resolve the
instability in Kosovo is to make sure that it doesn't spread over
into wider insecurity in the region,'' Cook told reporters in Sofia
after talks with Bulgarian Premier Ivan Kostov.

Libyan leader says he wants improved relationship with United

States

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing are ''very happy'' to be tried in the
Netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better
relationship with the United States.
	   ''We can solve this problem very easily,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in an interview aired Tuesday. ''Then the
families of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of this
anxious problem.''
	   ''When peace comes between the two countries, they will shake
hands and there will be peace. After that such acts will
automatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said. ''I am very sorry
about the confrontation.''
	   The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am
jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposed
sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over. He
argued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in either
Britain or the United States.
	   But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Council
approved a U.S.-British plan in August for a trial of the two
Libyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges following
Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi has
demanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects. He also
wants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya or
the Netherlands. Britain and the United States have refused to
negotiate.
	   Gadhafi told the BBC that he still needs ''guarantees.'' But he
did seek to distance himself from the suspects, who the United
States and Britain say are Libyan agents.
	   ''They may be guilty or not guilty,'' Gadhafi told the BBC.
''That is the job of the court to decide. If they are guilty, it is
because there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.
Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America.''
	   Gadhafi said the suspects may have wanted revenge for the U.S.
bombing of Libya in 1986 that killed 37 people. The air raid was in
retaliation for a bomb blast at a Berlin discotheque that killed
two American servicemen.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's military chief warned
President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday he has still not met terms
of the agreement to avert airstrikes, and Kosovo's rebels demanded
all government troops leave the province or they will continue
their independence struggle.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark delivered the message to the Yugoslav
president late Tuesday in the capital Belgrade as a new upsurge of
violence has raised fears about the agreement reached Oct. 12 with
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told reporters
Clark would provide ``very specific information'' to the Yugoslav
leader ``about his failure to comply fully with the requirements of
the international community.''
	   ``And he will be making very clear that NATO will use military
force against the Serbs if he doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic has still
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in
February when he launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   They have been fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province
of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90
percent of the province's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Under an agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic pledged to meet a
series of U.N. demands, including a withdrawal of special police
and army units, halt the crackdown, allow international agencies to
aid thousands of refugees and resume talks with ethnic Albanians on
the future of the province.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that some of the special
units sent to the province remain in Kosovo despite the agreement.
	   Despite a lack of total compliance, Defense Department spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said in Washington that the humanitarian situation
was improving for tens of thousands of refugees who fled into the
hills and forests to escape the fighting.
	   Bacon said of the estimated 50,000 to 70,000 who had been living
out in the open, ``we believe now that as many as half these people
...have returned to some sort of shelter.''
	   ``They may have returned to a partially bombed house that has
only half a roof, but they're returning to places with some
shelter,'' he said. ``And more importantly, they're returning to
communities where they can receive humanitarian aid and medical
supplies much more easily than they could when they were in the
mountaintops or in the woods.''
	   Nevertheless, a recent upsurge of violence has prompted Yugoslav
army troops backed by Serbian police to maintain an increased and
visible presence in areas of tension.

Lazio official suggests fines against rough play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The owner of Lazio of Rome, whose star-forwards are
sidelined with play injuries, on Tuesday launched a campaign
against rough play calling for clubs to fine their own players
misbehaving on the field.
	   ``I am ready to fine Lazio players who should carry out rough
tackles, putting at risk the opponents,'' industrialist-financier
Sergio Cragnotti told the Italian television news TG-1.
	   ``We must protect (from rough play) top class players who are
the fundamental patrimony of the clubs ... we must help referees to
safeguard them,'' he added.
	   Cragnotti is the owner of Lazio, which has become the first
Italian soccer club to be officially listed on the Milan stock
market.
	   The Lazio owner took a strong stand two days after the
hard-fought Inter Milan-Lazio league match, which was marred by
several rough tackles and two expulsions.
	   Lazio's Chilean striker Marcelo Salas and Italian veteran
Roberto Mancini limped off the field during the match which Lazio
won 5-3.
	   Another top star of Lazio, striker Christian Vieri, was injured
in an Italian Cup match three weeks ago.
	   Cragnotti, who invested dozens of millions of dollars to bring
such stars as Vieri, Salas, Ivan De La Pena and Dejan Stankovic to
Lazio, is not new to sensational and controversial demands.
	   Last month he shocked the Italian soccer Federation by asking
several millions of dollars as compensation for the severe knee
injury suffered by young Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta during the
World Cup in France.
	   Nesta still is recovering from the injury suffered in a World
Cup match against Austria and is likely to miss about four months
of the Serie A campaign.
	   There was no immediate reaction by other clubs to Cragnotti's
suggestion.

Basque separatists disappeared, Dominican police say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Two Basque separatists
living in the Dominican Republic have disappeared amid increasing
pressure to extradite them to Spain, police said Tuesday.
	   Angel Iturbe Avasolo and Maria Belen Gonzalez Penalba, alias
Carmen Maria, were last seen leaving their home in suburban Santo
Domingo on Sunday. The pair told neighbors they were going to the
beach.
	   Iturbe and Gonzalez belong to ETA, which has killed more than
800 people since 1968 in its attempt to win independence for the
Basque Country, a region that straddles the Spain-France border.
	   ``We are taking all the measures in our reach to find'' the
pair, said Sigfrido Pared Perez, head of the national police
investigations department.
	   Iturbe and Gonzalez are the last of six ETA members granted
political asylum in the Dominican Republic in 1989 following the
failure of peace talks in Algeria. Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar has requested their extradition.
	   Separatist Juan Manuel Soares Gamboa returned to Spain in 1995
to serve a reduced prison term negotiated with prosecutors.
President Leonel Fernandez extradited three others in 1997.
	   The separatists' movements in the Dominican Republic were
restricted and they were forbidden to leave the country.
	   ETA stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language.

Report: Saddam Hussein suffering from cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A report on Israel's Channel 2 TV Tuesday said
that Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein is suffering from cancer.
	   Quoting unnamed Western and European sources, the report said
the Iraqi ruler has been undergoing chemotherapy treatment for
cancer for some time.
	   The report said the information had been relayed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton during a Mideast summit he is hosting in
eastern Maryland.
	   A Kuwaiti newspaper reported last week that Saddam is suffering
from colon cancer. However, there is no public indication that the
Iraqi ruler is seriously ill. In the past ten days he has chaired
three sessions of the Iraqi Cabinet, all shown on Iraqi television.

16,000 evacuated as floods threaten parts of Indian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Floods threatened to inundate low-lying
areas along a river in the Indian capital, forcing authorities
Tuesday to evacuate more than 16,000 people to safer grounds, news
agencies reported.
	   The level of the Yamuna River, which flows through eastern New
Delhi, had risen one meter (three feet) over the danger mark
Tuesday after the adjacent Haryana state released large quantities
of water from a reservoir, the United News of India said.
	   But New Delhi Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj said there was
nothing to fear as all vulnerable points on the river bank had been
plugged to prevent any breaches.
	   The water level was expected to peak at 206 meters (680 feet)
Tuesday evening but would recede since no more water was expected
to enter the Yamuna from upstream, local officials said.

agreement fails &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - The Pentagon warned the Kosovo Liberation
Army on Tuesday that ethnic Albanians would be the big losers if
rebel attacks undermine the agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo.
	   ``I think at some point the Albanian rebels.. have to realize
that the people who pay the biggest price for their attacks are
other Kosovar Albanians,'' spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in
Washington. A copy of his remarks was made available in Vienna.
	   ``They're the people who end up getting killed, they're the
people who have ended up getting attacked,'' Bacon added. ``The
goal of this agreement is to stop the killing of Kosovar Albanians
and to rebuild their communities and to allow them to live in peace
and some modicum of prosperity.''
	   He also said the agreement, worked out Oct. 12 between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
``provides for a political settlement.''
	   ``This is a huge step forward,'' he said. ``This reverses nine
years of repression within Kosovo. So this is something that has to
be developed, but the start is there.''
	   ``That is the message that I think that the Kosovar leaders
should be getting out to their people.'' he added. ``But more
importantly, it's the message that the Kosovar people should be
getting to their leaders.''

Stunned by Roma loss, Fiorentina hits back with win at
</HEADLINE>
Grasshoppers; Dino Baggio in knife attack; Red Star loses at
``home''
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later matches
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina recovered from
its dramatic Serie A loss to Roma by cruising to a 2-0 victory at
Swiss club Grasshoppers in the second round of the UEFA Cup
Tuesday.
	   Fiorentina, which lost a one-goal lead against 9-man Roma to
tumble 2-1 in Serie A on Saturday, takes a big advantage to the
home leg in two weeks time as it chases a place in the last 16.
	   Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta netted a pass from Brazilian
star Edmundo in the 21st minute and Anselmo Robbiati took advantage
of sloppy defense to power in a fine header just three minutes into
the second half.
	   ``We played well on the heavy pitch, scored two fine goals and
deserved to win,'' said Fiorentina trainer Giovanni Trapattoni.
``Above all, we concentrated much better than the league match
against Roma.''
	   Roma followed up its domestic win with a 1-0 result against
Leeds.
	   Mario Del Vecchio scored the Roma goal in the 18th minute and
Leeds, who hit the post twice, had Portuguese midfielder Bruno
Ribeira sent off before half time for a second yellow card.
	   Parma's Italian international midfielder Dino Baggio suffered a
head injury which he said was caused by a knife hurled by a fan
during the game in Krakow.
	   Baggio showed the wound, which needed five stitches, to Italian
TV after the game, which ended 1-1.
	   Enrico Chiesa fired the Italians ahead in third minute but
Tomasz Kulawik salvaged a tie for the Poles in the 68th.
	   Aston Villa, which conceded only two goals in nine domestic
games and opened up a four-point lead in the Premier League,
produced another impressive with a 1-0 victory at Celta Vigo.
	   Julian Joachim scored the only goal from Stan Collymore's run
and pass as Villa, fielding an entirely English starting 11 in the
absence through injury of Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich,
looked solid at the back and yielded few chances to the Spaniards.
	   By contrast, Liverpool struggled in a disappointing 0-0 tie with
Valencia at Anfield, resting teen-age England striker Michael Owen
and using him only as a substitute for the last 17 minutes.
	   Although KarlHeinz Riedle and Paul Ince twice went close,
Liverpool, whose domestic form also has been poor, was thankful to
hang on for a tie after Adrian Ilie and Gica Popescu both wasted
second half chances.
	   Atletico Madrid scored a spectacular 4-2 win at CSKA Sofia with
two goals by Francisco ``Kiko'' Narvaez. Stefano Torrisi and
Roberto Fresnedoso Pietro added the others.
	   Another Italian club in action Tuesday, Bologna gained a 2-1
first leg lead over Slavia Prague with Swedish midfielder Klas
Ingesson heading the game winner with six minutes left.
	   Giuseppe Signori gave the home team a 1-0 lead in the 51st
minute but Richard Dostalek equalized in the 67th.
	   Forced by UEFA to play its home game away from Belgrade because
of the continuing threat of NATO military strikes in the light of
the Kosovo crisis, Red Star lost 2-1 to Lyon.
	   Some 1,500 Red Star supporters traveled to Bucharest for the
``home'' game and saw Dalibor Skoric fire their team ahead from the
penalty spot.
	   But Swiss international Marco Grassi leveled in the 58th minute
and Frederic Kanoute volleyed the winner five minutes from the end.
	   VfB Stuttgart, which gained the second round by winning 3-0 at
Feyenoord in an amazing comeback from 3-1 down after the first leg,
was held 1-1 at home by Brugges.
	   Nigerian striker Jonathan Akrobopie celebrated his 30th birthday
by firing Stuttgart ahead after only eight minutes but injury-hit
Brugges came back with an equalizer by Sven Vermant 20 minutes from
the end.
	   Urs Fischer's freak 40-meter cross from the left floated into
the net for a late FC Zurich equalizer in a 1-1 tie at Glasgow
Celtic after Norway's Harald Brattbakk had fired the Scottish
champion ahead.
	   Elsewhere, it was Willem II 1, Real Betis 1; Werder Bremen 1,
Olympique Marseille 1; Vitesse Arnhem 0, Bordeaux 1; Grazer AK 3
Monaco 3; Dynamo Moscow 2 Real Sociedad 3.

Grazer AK ties Monaco 3-3

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Hometeam Grazer AK fought back in the
second round to tie Monaco 3-3 in the UEFA Cup second round, first
leg game Tuesday.
	   Graz, down two players including goalkeeper Franz Almer, rallied
on the heels of Monaco's opening goal, by Robert Spehar in the 18th
minute, when Ben Akwuegbu scored in the 28th minute.
	   Akwuegbu set Graz ahead 2-1 in the 57th minute, with a shot that
zinged straight between the legs of Monaco's World Cup goalkeeper,
Fabien Barthez.
	   The joy lasted only three minutes, before Spehar evened out the
score 2-2.
	   In the 78th minute, Ludovic Giuly slipped through the Grazer
defense to put Monaco in the lead.
	   With the second corner kick of the night, Anton Ehmann headed
the ball into the net to tie the match 3-3, securing a vain hope
that the Austrians might still advance to the next round.
	   The teams played to a soldout crowd of 15,400 fans at
Schwarzenegger Stadium in Graz. They will meet for a deciding match
in Monaco in two weeks.

Researchers find herpes in brains of multiple sclerosis patients
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM CHILSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Researchers have found a form of the herpes
virus in people with multiple sclerosis, circumstantial evidence
that it may cause the debilitating disease.
	   Human herpes virus-6 was found in the brains of eight of 11 MS
patients studied by scientists at the Institute for Viral
Pathogenesis in Milwaukee. The virus was also found in the blood of
14 of 25 patients.
	   The findings confirm a study published last December.
	   Scientists have long suspected a virus triggers MS, which
prompts the immune system to attack nerve fibers, causing paralysis
and death.
	   If further study confirms the virus as the cause, the finding
could lead to new treatments for a disease that affects more than
300,000 people in the United States.
	   The study was presented Tuesday at conference of the American
Neurological Association in Montreal.
	   Dr. Robert Lisak, co-director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical
and Research Center at the Detroit Medical Center, said the study
doesn't convince him that the virus is solely to blame for MS. Past
studies have been unable to confirm that, he said.
	   ``It would be nice if this were true. I'm not saying it can't
be,'' Lisak said. ``More study needs to be done.''
	   People often carry the herpes virus-6 and many other types of
viruses and bacteria, and MS may have multiple causes, he said.
	   Donald Carrigan, a co-author of the study, acknowledged that
further research is needed but noted that the virus was present
only in brain areas actively damaged by MS.

Guatemalan Church demands release of priest held in bishop's
</HEADLINE>
killing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's Roman Catholic church on
Tuesday criticized the official investigation of an archbishop's
murder and called for the release of a priest jailed in the case.
	   Archbishop Victor Hugo Martinez, speaking on behalf of the
national Episcopal Conference, said prosecutors ``have left
untouched the hidden forces who were behind this crime.''
	   Archbishop Juan Gerardi Conedera was bludgeoned to death at a
church on April 26, two days after releasing a major human rights
report that blamed the military for most of the deaths in
Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   The new church statement comes two days before a deadline for
Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina to rule on whether to free the main
suspect in the case, priest Mario Orantes Najera, who lived at
Gerardi's parish.
	   ``The church has come to the sad conclusion that there have been
too many distractions, that only one path has been followed and
that one is false,'' Martinez said.
	   Monsignor Mario Rios Montt, who succeeded Gerardi as head of the
church human rights office, on Tuesday repeated his assertion that
``the killing of Gerardi was political.''
	   Orantes was arrested July 22, apparently because Spanish
investigators said the archbishop's corpse showed evidence of
having been bitten by Orantes' dog.
	   A second autopsy was ordered and at least some of the experts
involved said there was no evidence of dog bites.
	   Some local human rights groups have claimed that officials are
ignoring evidence that current or former soldiers were involved in
the killing. The army has denied that.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's military chief warned
President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday he has still not met terms
of the agreement to avert airstrikes, and Kosovo's rebels demanded
all government troops leave the province or they will continue
their independence struggle.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark delivered the message to the Yugoslav
president late Tuesday in the capital Belgrade as a new upsurge of
violence has raised fears about the agreement reached Oct. 12 with
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told reporters
Clark would provide ``very specific information'' to the Yugoslav
leader ``about his failure to comply fully with the requirements of
the international community.''
	   ``And he will be making very clear that NATO will use military
force against the Serbs if he doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic has still
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in
February when he launched his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   They have been fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province
of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90
percent of the province's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Under an agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic pledged to meet a
series of U.N. demands, including a withdrawal of special police
and army units, halt the crackdown, allow international agencies to
aid thousands of refugees and resume talks with ethnic Albanians on
the future of the province.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that some of the special
units sent to the province remain in Kosovo despite the agreement.
	   Despite incomplete compliance, Defense Department spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said in Washington that the humanitarian situation
was improving for tens of thousands of refugees who fled into the
hills and forests to escape the fighting.
	   Bacon said of the estimated 50,000 to 70,000 who had been living
out in the open, ``we believe now that as many as half these people
...have returned to some sort of shelter.''
	   ``They may have returned to a partially bombed house that has
only half a roof, but they're returning to places with some
shelter,'' he said. ``And more importantly, they're returning to
communities where they can receive humanitarian aid and medical
supplies much more easily than they could when they were in the
mountaintops or in the woods.''
	   Nevertheless, a recent upsurge of violence has prompted Yugoslav
army troops backed by Serbian police to maintain an increased and
visible presence in areas of tension.

Lazio official suggests fines against rough play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The owner of Lazio of Rome, whose star-forwards are
sidelined with play injuries, on Tuesday launched a campaign
against rough play calling for clubs to fine their own players
misbehaving on the field.
	   ``I am ready to fine Lazio players who should carry out rough
tackles, putting at risk the opponents,'' industrialist-financier
Sergio Cragnotti told the Italian television news TG-1.
	   ``We must protect (from rough play) top class players who are
the fundamental patrimony of the clubs ... we must help referees to
safeguard them,'' he added.
	   Cragnotti is the owner of Lazio, which has become the first
Italian soccer club to be officially listed on the Milan stock
market.
	   The Lazio owner took a strong stand two days after the
hard-fought Inter Milan-Lazio league match, which was marred by
several rough tackles and two expulsions.
	   Lazio's Chilean striker Marcelo Salas and Italian veteran
Roberto Mancini limped off the field during the match which Lazio
won 5-3.
	   Another top star of Lazio, striker Christian Vieri, was injured
in an Italian Cup match three weeks ago.
	   Cragnotti, who invested dozens of millions of dollars to bring
such stars as Vieri, Salas, Ivan De La Pena and Dejan Stankovic to
Lazio, is not new to sensational and controversial demands.
	   Last month he shocked the Italian soccer Federation by asking
several millions of dollars as compensation for the severe knee
injury suffered by young Lazio defender Alessandro Nesta during the
World Cup in France.
	   Nesta still is recovering from the injury suffered in a World
Cup match against Austria and is likely to miss about four months
of the Serie A campaign.
	   There was no immediate reaction by other clubs to Cragnotti's
suggestion.

	   VIGO, Spain (AP) _ Julian Joachim scored early and the rest of
Aston Villa hung on for dear life Tuesday to eke out a 1-0 victory
over Celta de Vigo in a UEFA Cup first-leg, second round match.
	   Aston Villa scored in the 15th minute on an error by the
Spaniards as Celta defenders swarming around Stan Collymore left
Joachim free for a pass and breakaway. Joachim scored with a Vigo
defender grabbing his jersey from behind.
	   After a lackluster first half on both offense and defense, Celta
came out fighting in the second period, keeping Aston Villa pinned
down in its own territory much of the time.
	   The Spaniards had a good half-dozen chances to equalize but
failed. In the 49th minute Russian Alexandre Mostovoi was in prime
position, unguarded 10 yards out, but the ball sailed wide left.
	   Celta pressed all out in the final minutes, with Tomas Alberto
Hervas missing with a blazing left-footed shot in the 88th minute.
	   In the 90th minute Claude Makelele fired a steadily rising
rocket from 25 yards out, only to see Villa goalkeeper Michael
Oakes tip it just enough for the ball to graze the crossbar and
bounce high.
	   Some 32,000 people watched the game at Vigo's Balaidos stadium.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana said Tuesday
that leftist rebels were the only ones to blame for a weekend
pipeline explosion and fire which killed 47 people and severely
burned 60 in a rural village.
	   The president rejected a suggestion by leftist rebels that the
army had intentionally sparked the fire which engulfed the Machuca,
a riverside hamlet in central Antioquia state, about 180 miles from
Bogota.
	   ``The National Liberation Army is responsable,'' said Pastrana,
referring to the country's second-largest rebel group, which goes
by the Spanish initials ELN. ``I reject the accusations against the
army.''
	   The guerrillas issued a statement late Monday admitting they had
dynamited a pipeline early Sunday outside Machuca, the town in
Antioquia state devastated by Sunday's conflagration.
	   But rebels of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN,
said the fire that consumed the village began more than an hour
later and may have been intentionally set by soldiers deployed in
the area.
	   Defense officials insisted they had no troops in the area until
several hours after the tragedy occurred.
	   The majority of the dead in Machuca were women and children, and
health officials said the death toll could still rise as burn
victims succumb to their injuries.
	   The village is located on a bend about a mile downriver from
where rebels dynamited the pipeline. It appeared that flames shot
down the river and torched wooden houses by its edge. Many of the
villagers died in their sleep.

DiMaggio to remain hospitalized a few more days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio will remain in the
hospital for at least a few more days after having his left lung
drained again, a longtime friend said Tuesday.
	   ``He'll eventually be out ... maybe three or four days,''
attorney Morris Engelberg said. ``If he were 48, he'd be out last
week. He has six doctors. They aren't going to discharge this guy
unless he's perfect.''
	   Officials at Hollywood Memorial Regional Hospital refused
comment on the condition of the New York Yankees' Hall of Fame
center-fielder.
	   DiMaggio, who will be 84 next month, was admitted Oct. 12 for
treatment of a lingering case of pneumonia. DiMaggio also had fluid
drained from his lungs last week, Engelberg said.
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called on Tuesday to offer his
encouragement, Engelberg said.
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio has been watching the World Series
telecasts and was not surprised the Yankees were ahead of the
Padres.
	   ``He knew when the season started they were the best team in
baseball,'' Engelberg said of the Yankees. ``They're tough to
beat.''

 &UR; Report: Comprehensive package agreement emerging at summit &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Negotiators have completed the framework of an
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians at the Mideast summit
talks in Maryland, and many of the issues have been agreed on,
Israel TV reported Tuesday.
	   Israel will carry out a gradual staged withdrawal from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank over a three-month period, as the
Palestinians fulfill a security plan to dismantle what the Israelis
call ``terrorist infrastructure'' in the West Bank. The United
States would oversee Palestinian measures against militants.
	   The Israeli TV report indicated that some of the points of
disagreement that have held up progress in Middle East peacemaking
for a year and a half are to be finessed with language, while some
are still subject to compromise by one side or the other.
	   Israel has been asked to drop its demands that the Palestinians
hand over Palestinians suspects in terror attacks. Instead, the 36
suspects it wants extradited would be tried and imprisoned in
Palestinian-controlled territory, under American supervision.
	   The Israelis would also have to bend on their demand that the
Palestine National Council, the largest governing Palestinian body,
reconvene to abrogate parts of the Palestinian Covenant that call
for destruction of the Jewish state. Instead, a smaller and
lower-level PLO body would remove the clauses, with a pledge for a
PNC meeting later.
	   Israel radio, quoting a senior member of the Israeli delagation
to the talks, said that Clinton was prepared to give Israel a
guarantee that the PNS would convene within 12 weeks of the deal
signing.
	   Issues to be finessed without agreement include the U.S. concept
of a ``time out'' on unilateral Israeli actions, such as expansion
of Jewish settlements, demolition of Palestinian homes and land
confiscation.
	   Major sticking points still unresolved include the size and
timing of the third Israeli redeployment in the West Bank and the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   But the agreement would satisfy an Israeli request to move the
talks directly to final status issues covering the most serious
disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict including permanent
borders, the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
	   In order to skirt a looming deadline for the completion of peace
accords, which the sides would not be able to meet, the agreement
suggests that the parties hold another summit on May 4, 1999.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he could unilaterally
declare a state then, something which Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu rejects and has sought to prevent.
	   Both leaders have been in eastern Maryland with their
negotiating teams since Thursday in an effort to complete a deal
which would end months of stalemate and get a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal off the ground.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man arrested after throwing hand
grenades near a bus stop in southern Israel told his interrogators
that he also killed a rabbi in the West Bank town of Hebron this
summer, the army said Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 29-year-old Salem Rajab Sarsour, started out as an
activist on the fringes of the Islamic militant group Hamas, but
after killing Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was admitted into Hamas' military
wing and was trained in the use of hand grenades, the army said.
	   Sarsour also confessed to throwing two hand grenades at Israeli
soldiers in Hebron on Sept. 30. Two dozen Israeli troops and
Palestinian civilians were injured in that attack.
	   After an initial silence, Hamas on Tuesday claimed
responsibility for Sarsour's grenade attack in the southern Israeli
town of Beersheba a day before. The attack wounded 64 Israelis.
	   The Palestinian Authority said in a statement that Sarsour was a
double agent who had provided information to the Israeli security
service Shin Bet.
	   After being blackmailed by his Shin Bet handlers who threatened
to reveal his identity if he did not provide more information,
Sarsour carried out the attacks to clear his name, the statement
said.
	   The Palestinian Authority ``holds Israel responsible'' for the
attacks, the statement said.
	   Israel TV reported that Shin Bet agents had met with Sarsour
about two weeks ago in an effort to hire him as an informant. At
the time, Shin Bet thought Sarsour was a minor Hamas activist and
did not know his involvement in previous attacks. After a friendly
discussion Sarsour reportedly agreed to help the Israeli agency and
only after Monday's attack did the Shin Bet realize who Sarsour
was.
	   It was not immediately clear how the claims and counterclaims
would play out at he Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
	   Security is a central issue in the negotiations, with Israel
pointing to Sarsour's attack in Beersheba as new proof that the
Palestinians are not doing enough to prevent terror attacks.
	   But the Palestinian Authority seemed eager to demonstrate it was
willing to crackdown on militants. Israeli radios reported that
Palestinian police had arrested at least 15 members of Hamas since
the attack and more arrests were planned.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Tussling over the fate of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, his supporters said Tuesday he is very ill
and that his controversial arrest in a London clinic is endangering
democracy in Chile.
	   But Amnesty International and two other human rights groups
sought to have Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on torture charges,
partly as a fallback position if the 82-year-old general defeats
attempts to extradite him to Spain to face allegations of murder,
torture and genocide.
	   In a letter to Scotland Yard police commissioner Sir Paul
Condon, the groups argued Pinochet could be brought before a
British court under a new anti-torture law, since Britons and
Chileans now living here were among the several thousand political
opponents who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.
	   The family of William Beausire, a Briton who disappeared in
Chile in 1975, endorsed the letter. Condon made no immediate
response.
	   Pinochet, arrested by British police Friday in his bed in a
private London clinic, has vowed to fight the extradition attempt.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing parties in Chile
said Tuesday that the general was too ill to be visited. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder.
	   ``He is really very, very sick,'' said Alberto Espina, a member
of the delegation from the Renovacion Nacional and Union
Democratica Independiente parties, after meeting Pinochet's wife,
Lucia. ``I think he is going to stay a lot of days in bed and he is
really in a bad condition.''
	   Referring to Chile's successful transition to a democratic
government, which included keeping Pinochet as army commander until
March, Espina added, ``What you (Britain) are doing in the end is a
danger for our democratic system.''
	   In Chile, opposition conservative congressmen of the Independent
Democratic Union protested Pinochet's arrest by boycotting
congressional sessions, while businessmen called for a boycott of
Spanish and British products.
	   The protesting congressmen held up posters that said ``Freedom
now- no to the official kidnapping.'' Some of the senators included
former high ranking officers who served under Pinochet.
	   Opposition congressional members Evelyn Matthei and Pia Guzman
gathered an estimated one hundred women in a subway station near
the British and Spanish Embassies to protest Pinochet's arrest.
	   Protesters hurled eggs, sticks and garbage at the two embassies,
despite police efforts to keep them away.
	   Mayor Christian Labbe of Providencia, a Santiago suburb,
withdrew parking privileges for British and Spanish diplomats and
said the municipality would no longer collect their garbage. Labbe
is a retired army colonel.

 &UR; Report: Comprehensive package agreement emerging at summit &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Negotiators have completed the framework of an
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians at the Mideast summit
talks in Maryland, and many of the issues have been agreed on,
Israel TV reported Tuesday.
	   Israel will carry out a gradual staged withdrawal from an
additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank over a three-month period,
as the Palestinians fulfill a security plan to dismantle what the
Israelis call ``terrorist infrastructure'' in the West Bank. The
United States would oversee Palestinian measures against militants.
	   The Israeli TV report indicated that some of the points of
disagreement that have stalled Mideast peacemaking for a year and a
half are to be finessed with language, while some are still subject
to compromise.
	   Israel has been asked to drop its demands that the Palestinians
hand over Palestinians suspects in terror attacks. Instead, the 36
suspects it wants extradited would be tried and imprisoned in
Palestinian-controlled territory, under American supervision.
	   The Israelis would also have to relax their demand that the
Palestine National Council, the largest governing Palestinian body,
reconvene to remove parts of the Palestinian Covenant that call for
destruction of the Jewish state. Instead, a smaller and lower-level
PLO body would remove the clauses, with a pledge for a full council
meeting later.
	   Israel radio, quoting a senior member of the Israeli delegation
to the talks, said that Clinton was prepared to give Israel a
guarantee that the council would convene within 12 weeks of the
deal signing.
	   Issues to be finessed without agreement include the U.S. concept
of a ``time out'' on unilateral Israeli actions, such as expansion
of Jewish settlements, demolition of Palestinian homes and land
confiscation.
	   Unresolved sticking points include Israel's release of
Palestinian prisoners and the size and timing of an additional
Israeli West Bank withdrawal. The Palestinians already control
about one-quarter of the West Bank.
	   But the agreement would satisfy an Israeli request to move the
talks directly to final status issues covering the most serious
disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including permanent
borders, the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
	   In order to skirt the May 4, 1999, deadline for completing peace
accords, which the sides would not be able to meet, the agreement
suggests that the parties hold another summit on that date.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he could
singlehandedly declare independence on May 4, something which
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects and has sought to
prevent.
	   Both leaders have been in eastern Maryland with their
negotiating teams since Thursday, hoping to revive a stalled peace
process and complete a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal.

Some agents push for decertification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rather than returning to the bargaining table,
the National Basketball Association players' union spent Tuesday
pondering its latest loss and debating its next move _ perhaps
decertification.
	   ``It's very seriously being explored. Some people feel it's the
answer because it's our best piece of leverage remaining,'' said
one agent close to the union.
	   One day after the union lost its guaranteed contracts in a
ruling by arbitrator John Feerick, the union pondered a course of
action but remained upbeat.
	   ``The players will not back down,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``The sooner the owners realize this and end the lockout, the
quicker we can avoid enormous damage to the sport of basketball.''
	   Some thought the wisest move would be to maintain a unified
front and resist accepting an unfavorable labor agreement _ even if
the lockout lasts into January.
	   Others, including a vocal minority of the agents' council, were
pushing for decertification, a move that could lead to a multiyear
fight with the owners.
	   By decertifying, the union would remove itself as the official
bargaining agent for the players. A court injunction would then be
sought to end the lockout.
	   If an injunction were granted, the owners would lift the
lockout, open camps and impose new work rules. And if the new rules
were more restrictive than the old ones, the players would be
expected to file an antitrust suit against the league seeking
treble damages.
	   On Wednesday, the agents' advisory council meets in Las Vegas.
The next day, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone are
among those expected to attend a union meeting open to all players.
	   Players earlier this summer gave the union's executive council
the go-ahead to decertify, so a vote among the rank-and-file would
not be necessary.
	   NFL players chose to decertify after their strike failed in
1987. Their court fight with NFL owners dragged on five years
before a settlement was reached.
	   NBA players who currently have long-term contracts might benefit
from decertification, since they would soon start drawing salaries.
But free agents and players who have been in the league fewer than
three years would be hurt because they would be forced to sign
under the rules of a new system and then would have to wait several
years to find out if they would win damages.
	   Commissioner David Stern and the owners are well aware the union
has been considering decertification, and some agents believe the
league fears being taken to court on antitrust charges.
	   ``Unfair labor practice charges, arbitration, decertification,
antitrust suits don't get it done,'' Stern said. ``This (Monday's
arbitration ruling) should have been a signal that we return to the
table today. Instead, the players are being told by their union to
miss another week of work.''
	   Stern sent a letter to Hunter on Monday outlining the league's
proposals and asking that Hunter pass it along to the players.
	   There is nothing in the letter, a union official said, that
would spur bargaining talks to resume until next week at the
earliest. The owners' negotiating committee will be New York next
Tuesday for an update.

Former co-manager John Horne files suit against Finkel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ The former co-manager of Mike Tyson has filed
suit against the boxer's new adviser, seeking a 10 percent share in
any money Tyson makes from his next five fights.
	   The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in state District Court here, a
day after the Nevada State Athletic Commission gave Tyson the green
light to return to the ring.
	   The lawsuit was filed by John K. Horne and names Shelly Finkel
as defendant. The lawsuit includes a provision allowing other
defendants to be named later. It claims interference with
contractural relations between Tyson and Horne.
	   ``I'm not aware of it,'' Finkel said Tuesday when asked about
the lawsuit.
	   Horne, who is now a movie producer in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
said in a statement he believes he is entitled to a
multimillion-dollar award.
	   The lawsuit seeks in excess of dlrs 10,000, a standard plea
under Nevada law.
	   Horne's Los Angeles lawyer, Bernard LeSage, said Horne,
co-manager Rory Holloway, and boxing promoter Don King entered into
a series of contracts with Tyson dating back to 1994 in which the
three, known as Team Tyson, were to handle his first 10 fights
after Tyson was freed from an Indiana prison on rape charges.
	   It was during the fifth fight that Tyson bit the ears of
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, a move that prompted a dlrs
3 million fine and a ban from boxing by the Nevada commission. That
ban was lifted Monday and Tyson is expected to fight in the next
two or three months.
	   LeSage said Team Tyson made dlrs 200 million on the first five
fights. Of that money, 30 percent went to King, 10 percent each to
Horne and Holloway, and the remaining 50 percent to Tyson, the
lawyer said.
	   Tyson broke from Horne, Holloway and King in March, filing
lawsuits against each. He accused King of cheating him out of tens
of millions of dollars, and his co-managers of betraying him by
arranging a deal that made King the former champion's exclusive
promoter.
	   Horne and Holloway have counter-sued Tyson, with that trial
scheduled for May, LeSage said.
	   LeSage said Tyson had five more fights under the contract with
Horne and Holloway, and that the former co-managers have rights to
the 20 percent share of his earnings from those fights.
	   The lawyer said the lawsuit was filed against Finkel and others
yet to be named because of ``efforts of the new team to interfere
with those rights, and to encourage Mike Tyson not to complete the
contract.''
	   ``He became the wealthiest, best-paid boxer in the game,''
LeSage said. ``He was paid more money than any other boxer in the
game ... more than dlrs 100 million in less than 18 months. We just
want him to fill out his contract, and then he's free to go on his
way.''

Red Wings have latest motivation: Bowman's back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM SUHR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ From futility to tragedy to thoughts of a
dynasty, the Detroit Red Wings haven't lacked motivation in seeking
the Stanley Cup.
	   Now, with eyes on a third straight championship, the team has
another inspiration if needed: coach Scotty Bowman's farewell tour.
	   ``That'll be in the back of our minds,'' Detroit forward Darren
McCarty said Tuesday, a day after the Wings announced that Bowman
will return this week with a clean bill of health and his sights on
an NHL-record ninth Stanley Cup.
	   ``This is what he knows, what he loves,'' McCarty said. ``He's
got to break the record.''
	   Detroit returned this season virtually intact as they seek a
third straight Cup, a feat accomplished just five times in National
Hockey League history, last when the New York Islanders' won four
straight (1980-83).
	   But absent was Bowman, who had a blocked artery cleared in July,
then knee replacement surgery a month later. At 65, the Hall of
Fame coach insisted his health would dictate whether he returned to
the Wings this season to close out his four-year contract.
	   Bowman passed his health tests last Friday, hours before
fighting back tears when introduced during an hourlong ceremony
celebrating the raising of the latest championship banner at Joe
Louis Arena.
	   Bowman will return to run practice Thursday, then be behind the
bench for the Red Wings' home game Friday against Toronto _ a
return that fans will certainly greet warmly and loudly.
	   To the team, it's well deserved.
	   ``We're the most successful organization in hockey,'' said Barry
Smith, who along with fellow associate coach Dave Lewis was in
charge in Bowman's absence. ``Why wouldn't you want everyone
back?''
	   Said captain Steve Yzerman: ``He demands that the guys play
hard. That's motivation right there.''
	   Other motivations haven't been in short supply for Detroit.
	   The team suffered through a 42-year Stanley Cup drought, which
it ended in 1997. But just days later, defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakonov were seriously
injured in a limo wreck.
	   The two injured men remained on the minds of the players, who
dedicated last season to them and had their names etched on the Cup
as part of the 1998 team.
	   All the while, the Red Wings considered themselves the team that
Bowman built.
	   ``Everyone in this dressing room is here because Scotty wanted
him to be,'' center Kris Draper said. ``It's only right that he's
back behind the ship.''

O'Meara fits the bill as world champion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ It wasn't on the same scale of winning
the Masters or the British Open, but Mark O'Meara won't treat his
victory in the World Match Play Championship in England lightly.
	   In three 36-hole matches, O'Meara beat the No. 1 player on
Europe's money list, the PGA champion and the top-ranked player in
the world.
	   ``I would rank it pretty high, not with a major championship,
but it's up there with the quality of players,'' he said Tuesday.
	   Because of his ranking, O'Meara only had to play three matches.
He beat Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, then turned in perhaps the most
impressive round of the year with an 11 and 10 win over Vijay
Singh.
	   In the final match against Tiger Woods, he holed a putt from
just on the fringe for a 1-up victory.
	   ``To play against the No. 1 player in the world and beat him in
such a dramatic match made it special,'' O'Meara said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EL NINO FORECAST: &LR;  How about El Tigre vs. El Nino in the Ryder
Cup next year?
	   Seve Ballesteros says he wouldn't be surprised if Sergio Garcia,
the 18-year-old Spanish amateur known as ``El Nino,'' winds up on
Europe's team next year. Garcia, who won the British Amateur and
beat Matt Kuchar in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur, plans to
turn pro after the Masters, leaving him only 20 events to earn
enough points.
	   ``There is no question I think Sergio could make the Ryder Cup
team next year,'' Ballesteros said. ``It will be difficult because
he misses half of the season before he turns professional, but he
is such a great prospect. Even if he does not collect enough
points, (captain) Mark James might pick him.''
	   Even if Garcia doesn't make the European team, he may get a
chance to go toe-to-toe with Tiger Woods at Augusta.
	   Mark O'Meara said he's trying to arrange a Tuesday practice
round that would pit him and Woods against Garcia and U.S. Amateur
champion Hank Kuehne.
	   ``Two amateurs can play with an old pro and a young pro and see
if they can give us a whipping,'' O'Meara said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NEW NAME, SAME COURSE? &LR;  The PGA Tour is worried that the TPC at
Deere Run might not be ready in time for the inaugural John Deere
Classic, scheduled for the week after the British Open.
	   Heavy spring rains have delayed construction on the dlrs 10
million course, and tournament director Kym Hougham said the
fairways don't appear to be up to PGA standards. Officials will
decide at the end of the month whether it will be suitable to play.
	   ``What the workers are trying to do now is get in all of the sod
and seeding before the tour people arrive. Right now we are looking
at places where our suites will be and where we will move crowds,
and we're looking at mud,'' Hougham said.
	   The dlrs 2 million John Deere Classic, which replaced the
Quad-City Classic on the schedule, might have to return to the old
Quad-City site _ Oakwood Country Club in Coal Valley, Ill. _ if the
TPC at Deere Run is not ready.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CHANGES AT THE TOP: &LR;  Ely Callaway is approaching 80 and showing
no signs of slowing down.
	   After a year marked by tussles with Spalding (over the marketing
of its System C golf ball), Orlimar (over its ads that ``oversized
is overrated'') and Taylor Made (over its backing of the USGA in
the spring-like effect squabble), the founder and chairman of
Callaway Golf Co. has reassumed the roles of president and chief
executive officer.
	   He'll replace Donald Dye, who agreed to step aside.
	   ``With lots of confidence, I am looking forward to meeting the
challenges that we face as a company,'' Callaway said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FIT FOR A PING: &LR;  The newest piece of technology from PING
putters is a gadget that looks like it belongs in wood shop.
	   The putter fitting system from Karsten Manufacturing is a small,
level-type gauge that attaches to a putter and measures the lie and
loft of a putter while a player is standing over his ball. Karsten
is distributing the devices to 1,000 of its top accounts around the
country.
	   ``There's no question that the average golfer is going to make
more putts with a properly fitted putter,'' said John Solheim,
president of Karsten.
	   Once the specifications are measured, the putter can be shipped
to Karsten's headquarters and returned in one week.

Security Council turns to plight of refugees in former Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With winter fast approaching, the U.N.
Security Council turned Tuesday to the plight of refugees in former
Yugoslavia as it worked behind the scenes to cement the
U.S.-brokered accord on Kosovo.
	   The council's top priority is to avert a humanitarian crisis in
Kosovo, where more than 270,000 people have fled their homes and
thousands are still hiding in the woods, with little cover from the
rain and chilly nights.
	   But the council also remains ``deeply concerned'' over the slow
return of refugees to Bosnia and the eastern Slavonia region of
Croatia, said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the current
council president.
	   After receiving a briefing from a top official of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, the council asked for a more detailed
report from the agency this week, Greenstock said.
	   A British official said there had been some confusion about the
number and location of refugees, and the council wanted a
comprehensive picture.
	   The United Nations has not yet announced how it plans to cope
with the refugees, particularly in Kosovo. The UNHCR said Tuesday
it was sending four aid convoys to different parts of the southern
Serb province, two of which had been held up Monday by reported
fighting.
	   ``Obviously the issue at the top of the pile at the moment is
Kosovo. It doesn't diminish the importance of refugees elsewhere.
But all efforts at the moment are aimed at resolving the potential
for humanitarian disaster for Kosovo,'' the British official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Under last week's agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke which averted NATO air strikes, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is required to help refugees return to their
homes in Kosovo. But many refugees remain in hiding, still fearing
reprisals from Serb special police who have torched their villages
and been accused of atrocities against civilians.
	   Serbs launched a crackdown in February on ethnic Albanians who
have been fighting for independence from Serbia, the largest of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   The return of thousands of refugees who fled Bosnia during the 3
1/2 year war there is a key provision of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement that ended the fighting _ but continued ethnic violence
has kept many from going back to areas where they would now be in
the minority.
	   The council has repeatedly expressed concern about Croatia's
commitment to granting full rights and protections to ethnic Serbs
in eastern Slavonia, which was seized by Serb rebels during the
ethnic conflict in former Yugoslavia. The region returned to
Croatian control Jan. 15 after two years under U.N. administration,
causing thousands of Serbs to flee.
	   While trying to cope with the refugees, Security Council members
were also working on a resolution to turn the Kosovo accord into
international law.
	   Greenstock said he expected a draft to come before the council
within a day. Still unclear, however, is whether the resolution
will threaten Milosevic with military force.
	   The Council wants to give its blessing to a 2,000-member team
that will roam Kosovo and verify that the offensive has stopped.
	   ``We want to get Milosevic to stick to his word,'' the British
official said.
	   The United States and Britain maintain that the Security Council
has already sanctioned air strikes if Milosevic fails to honor the
accord. But Russia and China, who as permanent members have vetoes
in the council, remain opposed to any military intervention in
Kosovo.

Burying its dead, Nigerian town reels from pipeline blast

<TEXT>
	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ While flames still occasionally billowed
from the charred site of a deadly pipeline explosion and smoke
filled the air, this south Nigeria town was burying its dead in
mass graves and looking for hope among the living.
	   Construction equipment ripped holes in the ground for the
rapidly decaying bodies from Saturday's fireball in Jesse, where
authorities said up to 1,000 people had been trying to scavenge
gasoline from the pipeline when it ignited, killing at least 500
people.
	   The stench of the corpses hung thickly in the town, and workers
had to continually leave the area to catch their breath.
	   Hospitals _ most with few doctors and nurses and little for burn
care _ were overwhelmed by burn victims who trickled in after the
inferno, although some of the casualties were being pulled out of
hospitals by family members, fearing they may be arrested for
theft, medical workers and newspapers said.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
in the weekend incident in Jesse, some 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a local medical worker said
patients at a number of hospitals had been withdrawn, particularly
when people heard that Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigeria's head of
state, was coming to visit Monday.
	   One woman who was getting hospital treatment had little to
celebrate. Her cassava farm was untended, and pain from her oozing
wounds wracked her body.
	   ``See me now,'' said Dorcas Oboh, a farmer scarred with burns,
bandages running the length of both legs as she sat in a local
hospital. ``I am finished.''
	   Oboh denied that she was trying to scavenge gas spilling from
the pipeline.
	   ``I only wanted to see what they were doing. I went to look,''
she said. ``I am finished,'' she repeated.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the blaze and were waiting
for the fire to burn itself out. But thousands of gallons of fuel
remained in the Jesse section of the pipeline _ which runs a total
nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) from the southeastern city of
Warri to the northern city of Kaduna. There is no security for the
aboveground pipeline, not even coils of barbed wire.
	   Abubakar said during his brief Monday visit that the government
would pay for medical care, but that no compensation would be paid
to the families of the dead, apparently because many were believed
to be scavenging fuel.
	   In the hospitals, medicine is in short supply, doctors
overworked and sterile surroundings all but impossible. Hundreds of
people were believed to be suffering at home, without painkillers,
from the agonies of burns.
	   ``We simply had to lock up our gate, we could not cope,'' said a
doctor at Okparavero Memorial Hospital in the nearby town of
Sapele, who also spoke on condition anonymity. ``Virtually
everybody coming into this hospital and other hospitals came with
100 percent burns. As they came in, they were dying.''
	   In the southeastern Niger River delta region, an oil-rich area
scarred by poverty, scooping up buckets of gasoline from a spilling
pipeline could offer quick gains.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, but its
petroleum industry, crippled by corruption and mismanagement,
barely functions.
	   Most of the nation's refineries don't work and much of Nigeria's
gasoline is imported. Lineups at gas pumps can last for days and
black market prices are often marked up 1,000 percent.
	   ``When you deny people of petrol, it creates a black market, it
creates illegal hawkers,'' said Ighotota Amori, a local politician.
``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the government is to
blame for this mess.''

Warren, Niccum lead qualifying series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Track records toppled as lugers, lead by
1994 and 1998 Olympian Erin Warren and Christian Niccum, took
advantage of clear weather and perfect race conditions Tuesday in
the first of a two-event series to finalize the American World Cup
team.
	   Warren, sixth in the Nagano Olympics, set a women's singles mark
with a first-run time of 45.558 seconds down the Utah Winter Sports
Park track that will be used for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.
	   The Somerville, Massachusetts resident had a second heat of
45.648 for an aggregate of 1 minute, 31.206 seconds.
	   Brenna Margol of Sawyer, Michigan, was second in 1:31.605 and
Courtney Zablocki of Highlands Ranch, Colorado third in 1:31.816.
	   Niccum, a four-time world junior doubles champion from
Woodinville, Washington, set course marks in men's singles and
doubles.
	   He teamed with Matt McClain of Lake Placid, New York in doubles
for a run of 44.768 the first time down the trail. A second run of
44.825 produced an aggregate of 1:29.593 that gave them the top
time over the Olympic silver and bronze medalists.
	   Mark Grimmette of Muskegon, Michigan and Brian Martin of Palo
Alto, California, 1998 bronze medal winners, were second in
1:29.939.
	   Olympic silver medalists Chris Thorpe of Marquette, Michigan and
Gordy Sheer of Croton, New York wound up third in 1:30.158.
	   Niccum opened the men's singles competition by clocking a record
46.806 for the halfway lead. But his second leg time of 47.378
dropped him to fifth overall in 1:34.184 and handed the
qualification event to Nick Sullivan of Oakdale, Minnesota.
	   Sullivan, a bronze medal winner in the 1998 world junior
championships, had times of 46.877 and 47.016 for a cumulative time
of 1:33.893.
	   Olympic alternate Tony Benshoof of White Bear Lake, Minnesota
was second in 1:33.981 and Clay Ives of Bancroft, Ontario, was
third in 1:34.019. Ives received dual citizenship last month and is
trying to race his way onto the American team.
	   Team qualification continues Wednesday before U.S. team coaches
complete their roster.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Few sporting delegations are happy
about Canada's decision to use several athletes' villages at the
1999 Pan Am Games and to require visas of athletes, Puerto Rico's
Olympics chief said Tuesday.
	   ``Nobody likes the idea of using five villages for the Pan
American games,'' Pedro Cordova, secretary general of the Puerto
Rico Olympic Committee, said after returning from a Pan American
Sports Organization general assembly in Mexico City.
	   Assembly delegates declined to approve a report presented by
Canada's Olympics Committee and decided instead to send a
commission to Canada to review plans for the games in Winnipeg,
Cordova said.
	   ``I believe that in the end, everything will be normal in
Winnipeg, but it will be cumbersome to have five distinct villas,''
he said.
	   ``There is ill feeling because they are going to require visas
to enter Canada'' instead of Olympics credentials, he added.
	   PASO decided to limit the games to about 5,000 athletes to limit
costs and domination by larger countries, Cordova noted. He also
predicted that Guadalajara, Mexico, will win the 2003 Pan Am Games
over Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and Medellin, Colombia. The
site will be chosen in December.
	   ``I'm going to vote for the Dominican but I believe that country
won't win,'' Cordova said. ``The problem is that the damages caused
by Hurricane Georges will affect the voting.''

Taliban again loses chance for seat at UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with committee keeping status quo &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations refused again Tuesday
to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and
kept the U.N. seat with the representative of President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
	   As it did last year, the U.N. credentials committee deferred a
decision on the two sets of credentials it received from
representatives of the Taliban and Rabbani, meaning the seat will
stay with Rabbani's envoy for another year, diplomats said.
	   Russia proposed the deferral, and was supported by Zimbabwe,
China, Fiji and the United States, a diplomat who attended the
15-minute-long meeting said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Other members of the committee include New Zealand, Jamaica,
Venezuela and Mali.
	   The 185-member General Assembly will have the final decision but
generally follows the recommendation of the committee.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, had said it expected the seat would again be given to
Rabanni's representative, but nevertheless intensified efforts to
gain the seat and the international recognition it confers.
	   The Taliban's envoy in New York, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, had made
the rounds of the countries on the committee and lobbied for the
Taliban cause. He was to meet Wednesday with Karl R. Inderfurth,
U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs.
	   Mujahid outlined the Taliban position in a 10-page document that
lists the reasons why the Taliban should be recognized as the true
government of Afghanistan and explaining their position on human
rights, women's rights, drug proliferation and tensions with Iran
and other neighboring countries.
	   ``The time has come to give Afghanistan what the world owes it,
a chance to build on what works well for Afghans,'' he wrote.
	   ``Recognition of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan has no ill
consequences to any nation and will be great and good step for the
fiercely independent people of Afghanistan.''
	   The Taliban militia has imposed a strict brand of Islam that
bars women from work and girls from school in the 90 percent of
Afghanistan it has conquered. Taliban soldiers ousted Rabbani from
the capital Kabul in 1996 and are still fighting the opposition for
the remainder.
	   Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the only
countries that have recognized the Taliban militia as the
legitimate government in war-wracked Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia,
though, announced last month that it was expelling the Afghan
charge d'affaires and recalling its representative from Kabul.
	   The United Nations has had to deal directly with the Taliban
over humanitarian issues and efforts to gain peace in the central
Asian nation. But based on the credentials committee decision, it
too, has refused to recognize the militia as the legitimate
leadership.

San Diego fans keep the faith with Swinging Friar
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ He's a cute, pudgy man of God who cracks a mean
bat. He's the Swinging Friar, a Padres mascot and a man of mystery.
	   In fact, the mascot goes back so far nobody really knows when
the little guy was born. In a town crazed by baseball, though, fans
are just glad the short, balding holy man still supplies the
blessings.
	   ``I like the friar because he's always smiling and hitting it
over the fence,'' said fan Susan Baird. ``He represents San Diego:
Nice people, but we can kick butt when we have to.''
	   The cartoon figure has been associated with the team at least
since 1958, when the Padres were in the minor leagues. And while it
seems a natural choice for a mascot _ San Diego was built around
Spanish missions settled by Franciscan friars to convert Indians to
Christianity _ no one is sure who had the idea.
	   ``I went back to 1939 and looked at programs and didn't see
him,'' said Glenn Turgeon, assistant historian at the San Diego
Hall of Champions, where the city's sports history is preserved.
``Unless someone from back then remembers him, we have no other way
of tracing his origin other than through paper documents.''
	   Padres spokesman John Schlegel believes the mascot was named and
designed as part of a contest.
	   ``But I'm not really sure about that,'' he said. ``We were going
to have an intern research that this summer, but we've been a
little busy.''
	   What is certain is that at least for the past 40 years the friar
has always worn the garb of a medieval beggar _ sandals, dark
hooded habit, rope around the waist. And, of course, a grin.
	   He lost his halo as he grew up during the 1960s. He swung to the
left for a few years, then to the right, and he even wore a glove
for a season.
	   When baseball expanded in 1969 and a National League franchise
was started in San Diego, the team kept the minor league name of
the Padres and the friendly friar.
	   But he disappeared in 1984 after the Padres made their only
other appearance in the World Series. Then-owner Joan Kroc, an
heiress to the McDonald's fast food fortune, thought the mascot
didn't look professional.
	   The cuddly clergyman was replaced with a corporate,
baseball-shaped logo with pinstripes and the Padres name stretched
across, but fans continued to wear their Swinging Friars T-shirts.
	   The friar was reborn in 1996 as part of the Padres' 60th
anniversary and a marketing plan by the team's new management,
majority owner John Moores and president Larry Lucchino.
	   He was given a more rounded head, a bigger smile and the color
of his robe was changed from brown to plum. A costume was designed
to bring the Swinging Friar to life at games, a fuzzy character who
wanders the stands and inspires the crowd. Padres merchandise
bearing his likeness are among the franchise's top sellers.
	   He's so popular, the Friar was added to the team's uniforms last
year and he's prominently featured on the team's Web site and
publications.
	   ``He was there in 1984 and two years after he's brought back,
we're in the Series again,'' Schlegel said. ``I wouldn't call him a
good-luck charm, but there may be something there.''
	   Maybe it's the Friar's slogan, ``Keep the Faith'' or the Gospel
message on which the lives of Franciscan Friars are based, ``I come
to serve.''
	   Whatever it is, Padres fan Michael Harmon hopes for a little
divine intervention as the Padres try to win a couple of games at
home after starting the Series in New York with two losses.
	   ``We don't need a miracle just yet,'' he said. ``But prayer
can't hurt.''

Report: Major Japanese bank to ask for injection of public funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of a major Japanese bank encouraged other
lenders to join his bank in accepting public funds under a
government rescue plan to prevent Japan's economic problems from
triggering a worldwide financial meltdown, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. President Masao Nishimura told the
Nihon Keizai newspaper that his bank plans to apply for the public
funds, making it the first major bank to publicly indicate its
readiness to accept a capital infusion from the government.
	   Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer money into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   Nishimura said that banks should think beyond their own
interests and consider the impact on the global economy, noting
that governments around the world have urged Japan to use public
funds to bail out its banks.
	   Other bank chiefs, including Satoru Kishi of Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, have been reluctant to seek public money, the
Nihon Keizai said.
	   On Tuesday, public broadcaster NHK reported that troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan would seek public funds through a
temporary nationalization on Friday when the newly passed
legislation goes into effect.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Tussling over the fate of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, his supporters said Tuesday he is very ill
and that his controversial arrest in a London clinic is endangering
democracy in Chile.
	   But Amnesty International and two other human rights groups
sought to have Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on torture charges,
partly as a fallback position if the 82-year-old general defeats
attempts to extradite him to Spain to face allegations of murder,
torture and genocide.
	   In a letter to Scotland Yard police commissioner Sir Paul
Condon, the groups argued Pinochet could be brought before a
British court under a new anti-torture law, since Britons and
Chileans now living here were among the several thousand political
opponents who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year rule.
	   The family of William Beausire, a Briton who disappeared in
Chile in 1975, endorsed the letter. Condon made no immediate
response.
	   Pinochet, arrested by British police Friday in his bed in a
private London clinic, has vowed to fight the extradition attempt.
	   An 11-member delegation from two right-wing parties in Chile
said Tuesday that the general was too ill to be visited. He
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder.
	   ``He is really very, very sick,'' said Alberto Espina, a member
of the delegation from the Renovacion Nacional and Union
Democratica Independiente parties, after meeting Pinochet's wife,
Lucia. ``I think he is going to stay a lot of days in bed and he is
really in a bad condition.''
	   Referring to Chile's successful transition to a democratic
government, which included keeping Pinochet as army commander until
March, Espina added, ``What you (Britain) are doing in the end is a
danger for our democratic system.''
	   In Chile, opposition conservative congressmen of the Independent
Democratic Union protested Pinochet's arrest by boycotting
congressional sessions, while businessmen called for a boycott of
Spanish and British products.
	   The protesting congressmen held up posters that said ``Freedom
now- no to the official kidnapping.'' Some of the senators included
former high ranking officers who served under Pinochet.
	   Opposition congressional members Evelyn Matthei and Pia Guzman
gathered an estimated one hundred women in a subway station near
the British and Spanish Embassies to protest Pinochet's arrest.
	   Protesters hurled eggs, sticks and garbage at the two embassies,
despite police efforts to keep them away.
	   Mayor Christian Labbe of Providencia, a Santiago suburb,
withdrew parking privileges for British and Spanish diplomats and
said the municipality would no longer collect their garbage. Labbe
is a retired army colonel.
	   On Wednesday evening, police used water cannons to break up a
rally of at least five thousand Chileans supporting Pinochet's
arrest who shouted anti-Pinochet slogans.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUEENSTOWN, Massachusetts, (AP) _ Under President Clinton's
prodding, Israel and the Palestinians neared a West Bank agreement
on Tuesday that calls for the jailing of suspected terrorists under
CIA supervision, two parties to the Middle East talks said.Clinton
finalized the arrangement during dinner Monday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
the sources said. The suspects wanted in Israel would not be
extradited to Israel for trial, as Israel initially demanded. But
the presence of the CIA to verify punishment would be meted out
evidently satisfies Israel's concerns, said the sources, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity. (US-MIDEAST-TALKS)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder convinced cautious
Germans to elect his Social Democrats by promising not to change
much, just to do things better. Yet the plans unveiled Tuesday for
a new government promise fundamental shifts in German life, mainly
to the left. From a loosening of Germany's blood-based citizenship
law to a commitment to end the use of nuclear energy, from a new
effort to compensate Holocaust victims to repeals of welfare state
reforms, the program defines a markedly different Germany than the
one Helmut Kohl led for 16 years. (GERMANY-POLITICS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some 300,000 high school students took to the
streets of France on Tuesday to protest school conditions in a
second round of nationwide marches again marred by hooligans
throwing bottles and smashing windows. Despite intensive efforts by
student leaders to attract support, the protesters failed to build
on the momentum of last week's protests, which drew a half-million
marchers. In Paris, helmeted riot police sprayed tear gas from
aerosol cans to disperse unruly youths, who shattered windows in a
posh Left Bank neighborhood and set fire to a metro car,
temporarily interrupting service on one line. Many of the hooligans
were older than the high school students, who insist the
troublemakers have no connection to their movement. (FRANCE-STUDENT
STRIKE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tussling over the fate of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, his supporters said Tuesday he is very ill
and that his controversial arrest in a London clinic is endangering
democracy in Chile. But Amnesty International and two other human
rights groups sought to have Pinochet prosecuted in Britain on
torture charges, partly as a fallback position if the 82-year-old
general defeats attempts to extradite him to Spain to face
allegations of murder, torture and genocide. In a letter to
Scotland Yard police commissioner Sir Paul Condon, the groups
argued Pinochet could be brought before a British court under a new
anti-torture law, since Britons and Chileans now living here were
among the several thousand political opponents who were killed or
disappeared during his 17-year rule. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's federal prosecutor on
Tuesday ordered the confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts
in Switzerland and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation into
the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of trials in
a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment
during his brother's 1988-1994 administration. Carla del Ponte said
the investigation had concluded that funds in the accounts, of
which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner, came partly from
protection payoffs from drug traffickers. The Swiss halted their
own proceedings on charges of money laundering against Raul Salinas
and three co-defendants, but said their findings ``inevitably
suggest money laundering'' of drug profits. (SWITZERLAND-SALINAS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street's rally faded Tuesday as
profit-taking set in, but the Dow Jones industrial average still
managed its first close over 8,500 since late August. The Dow, up
528 points over the past four sessions, closed at 8,505.85, up
39.40 or about 0.5 percent. The last time the blue chips closed
above that milestone was Aug. 26, before the market's precipitous
late-summer drop. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record dlrs
16.8 billion in August as the Asian economic crisis pushed exports
down for a fifth straight month. Overseas sales of American farm
products hit their lowest point in more than four years. The
Commerce Department said Tuesday the August deficit was 15.3
percent higher than a revised dlrs 14.5 billion gap in July as
exports of U.S. goods and services dipped 0.3 percent while imports
rose by 2.2 percent. The deficit with China hit an all-time high of
dlrs 5.9 billion. The new report dramatically underscored the
impact the Asian crisis is having on the U.S. economy. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government said Tuesday it wants cash
_ not handouts of chicken or pork _ from an International Monetary
Fund delegation in Moscow for talks on a halted loan package.
Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for the rest of the
year, and has said it is counting on disbursement of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package negotiated before the latest economic
crisis erupted in mid-August. Russia has already received dlrs 4.8
billion of the loan. The IMF has said it won't hand over any more
money until it sees the government's plan to cope with the crisis,
and signs that it is being implemented. The Russian government has
said it would release the plan this week. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq confirmed reports Tuesday it had
lowered the quality of its crude oil exports in order to boost
sales and revenue. Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid told
a news conference that Iraqi crude now had a lower API gravity and
higher sulfur content. Local oil experts said this was caused by
the decision to pump about 150,000 barrels of highly sulfurous oil
into the giant fields of Kirkuk, from where Iraq currently extracts
up to half its daily exports. The government had decided to mix the
Kirkuk oil, which is of superior quality, with the low grade
product as it no longer had the ability to define the 150,000
barrels to a marketable standard, the experts said. Under U.N.
sanctions, Iraq is allowed to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
humanitarian supplies. (IRAQ-OIL)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Brazil and the International Monetary Fund
moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion
rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy. A joint
statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two
sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an
expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000.
The statement was issued after weekend talks between IMF officials
and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, executive
secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the
talks. Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to
contribute to the rescue package. (IMF-BRAZIL, BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Texas Instruments Inc., hit hard by a global slump
in computer chip prices, on Tuesday reported its third-quarter
profit plunged from the inflated results of a year ago. But the
company's results easily beat Wall Street predictions. Texas
Instruments said it earned dlrs 164 million, or 41 cents a share on
a diluted basis. That was down sharply from a profit of dlrs 1.71
billion, or dlrs 4.28 a diluted share, reported in the year-ago
quarter, when the company gained dlrs 1.47 billion from the sale of
its defense business. Without the one-time gain, TI's profits would
have dropped by about one-third. Revenue fell 16 percent to dlrs
2.11 billion from dlrs 2.50 billion. (US-EARNS-TEXAS INSTRUMENTS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Association of Coffee Producing Countries on
Tuesday lowered the ceiling for coffee exports as a result of
Ecuador's withdrawal from the 13-member coalition. The association
reduced the ceiling to 51.03 million bags of coffee from 52.13
million bags through June 1999, said Roberio Silva, the
association's secretary-general. One bag equals 60 kilos, or 132
pounds. The association, which Ecuador withdrew from in September,
was set up in 1993 by Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Uganda and other
leading producers, following the collapse of negotiations with
importing countries on establishing an international price-support
regime for coffee. (BRITAIN-COFFEE)

Martin, German and Australian snakes and flying rabbis. Some items
may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jerry Seinfeld has a new girlfriend, and Jerry
Seinfeld's new girlfriend has an angry husband.
	   Seinfeld took up with 26-year-old Jessica Sklar soon after she
married Broadway theater scion Eric Nederlander four months ago,
the New York Post and the Daily News reported this week.
	   Nederlander, whose father owns six theaters and a piece of
baseball's Yankees, is filing for divorce. A furious Nederlander
called his bride a ``gold-digger'' who ``won't get a cent,'' the
Post said Tuesday, quoting an unidentified close friend.
	   The Post said Seinfeld began seeing Sklar after she returned
from her honeymoon in Italy last summer. But friends of the couple
said the marriage was doomed from the start and the breakup has
nothing to do with Seinfeld.
	   Seinfeld's spokeswoman did not immediately return calls Tuesday.
The Post said he is mortified by the mess.
	   Dan Klores, a spokesman for Nederlander, said: ``The family is
appalled by the behavior of Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Flatley, who hung up his ``Lord of the
Dance'' shoes last summer, agreed Tuesday to pay his former manager
a ``substantial sum'' to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit.
	   The terms were not disclosed.
	   John Reid claimed he was summarily dismissed in a letter in
1997, seven months after the management contract was signed. The
contract was not due to expire until this month.
	   Reid, who sought dlrs 17 million, said Flatley fired him just as
the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged.
	   ``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind me,'' Reid said.
``It is a real shame that so much time and money and effort has
been wasted in the process of getting to the point which we could
have reached two years ago.''
	   Flatley said Reid was abusive and preoccupied with other
clients.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Martin's score for Elton John's ``Candle in
the Wind '97'' _ the best-selling single of all time _ will be
auctioned off for charity.
	   The arrangement, written in a hurry by the legendary Beatles
producer last year for the tribute to Princess Diana, is expected
to fetch about dlrs 100,000 when Sotheby's holds the sale in New
York in December, the auction house said.
	   A special award from the British Phonographic Industry marking
33 million copies of the single sold will be auctioned with the
score.

	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A New York-Duesseldorf flight
arrived Tuesday with one more passenger than had checked in: a
30-centimeter (12- inch) snake.
	   A young woman spotted the snake slithering between her feet just
before take off. Still, the flight went on as scheduled.
	   Another passenger took control of the situation, wrapping the
the creature in two plastic bags and setting it in a bathroom for
the duration of the trip, Duesseldorf airport officials said.
	   Police were called to meet the plane to identify the snake,
which turned out to be harmless and was turned over to a zoo.
	   It was unclear how the snake got on board the plane.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A woman awoke in bed Tuesday to find
a carpet snake wrapped around her arm and its teeth embedded in her
leg.
	   Katherine Bell, 34, said she was sleeping alongside her
6-year-old daughter Carla when she felt a pain in her leg at about
4 a.m.
	   ``I thought it was my cat playing on my bed,'' said Bell, of
Brisbane.
	   ``I went to move my arm to turn on the bedside light but it (the
snake) was wrapped around my arm and its mouth was biting my
knee.''
	   Bell staggered out of bed, flailing wildly to free herself from
the snake.
	   Loosing herself from the two-meter (two-yard)-long reptile, she
threw it to the floor before fleeing the room.
	   The snake escaped into nearby woodlands through a sliding door.
	   Ambulance officers took Bell to nearby Redland Bay Hospital for
treatment to puncture wounds on her leg, knee and finger while
police called in a snake handler, who found the reptile.
	   Carpet snakes are not poisonous, but can inflict a painful bite.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit.
	   A plane chartered by a prominent rabbi to encircle Israel seven
times and deliver prayers for the successful conclusion of the
Mideast peace talks was forced to make an emergency landing.
	   A little more than an hour into Monday's flight, the small
plane's electrical system malfunctioned.
	   ``We changed the subject of the prayers from the plight of the
Israeli people to our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of
Rabbi David Batsri and one of four passengers aboard.
	   ``My father ... called out the names of chapters in Psalms,
chapters named after angels, and then he asked them to come and
help,'' the younger Batsri said.
	   The pilot eventually brought the plane down safely in northern
Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri said the passengers' deliverance was
proof that a similar miracle could happen at the Wye, Maryland,
talks.

UN warns that arrears issue will again threaten US vote, future
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Washington's continued failure to pay its
bills will again threaten its vote in the General Assembly next
year and will lead to a backlash against enacting U.S.-demanded
reforms, the United Nations warned Tuesday.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been outspoken in the past
week in criticizing the United States, said in a statement that the
U.S. Congress and administration had reneged on personal promises
to pay its bills this budget season.
	   ``Despite the extensive reforms we have undertaken ... the
Congress and the administration once again failed to honor
America's legal commitment and moral obligation to the United
Nations and its 184 other member states,'' Annan said.
	   The United States is expected to pay the United Nations just
enough this year to reach the minimum it needs to preserve its vote
in the 185-member General Assembly. Congress is expected to vote on
a budget bill Tuesday and Wednesday that would authorize a dlrs 197
million payment that would bring the United States just over the
threshold.
	   But Congress failed to act on a separate spending bill
concerning the dlrs 1.3 million the United Nations says the United
States owes in back payments. Lawmakers have made payment
conditional on sweeping U.N. reforms that the United Nations says
have largely been implemented.
	   President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the arrears bill
because it contains a provision denying U.S. contributions to
international family-planning organizations that advocate abortion
rights.
	   A senior U.N. official warned that the United States will have
to pay some of its arrears next year if it wants to retain its vote
in the General Assembly. U.N. bills for 1999 alone won't cover the
minimum payment the United States will have to make to keep the
vote, meaning it will have to pay off some of the arrears, the
official said.
	   A greater threat, though, was the deteriorating will among U.N.
member states to carry out the remainder of Congress-demanded
reforms without any assurances that the money will ever come
through, the official said. The member states had enacted widescale
reforms based on the assumption that Congress would pay the cash.
	   ``At this point, the continued failure to resolve this issue is
hurting the reform effort,'' the official said.
	   ``Further threats by Congress, if they were to emanate at this
point, would be entirely counterproductive and would produce a
backlash that would make the situation worse rather than better,''
the official said, speaking on condition he not be named.
	   The United States now accounts for two-thirds of the outstanding
U.N. arrears. The United Nations has managed to keep its operations
going by borrowing money from a separate peacekeeping fund once the
regular budget runs out, usually in September.
	   Money taken from the fund, however, has to be repaid to member
states. Those states, frustrated that Washington hasn't stood by
its end of the deal, could refuse to allow the United Nations to
continue borrowing money from the peacekeeping fund.
	   ``Where we stand today is that a large number of other member
states are underwriting the United States' dues in the United
Nations by agreeing to permit us to borrow from peacekeeping funds
that are really owed to them,'' the official said.
	   Annan has suggested asking the General Assembly to decide
whether it wants to continue the practice, but the issue hasn't
been placed on the assembly's agenda yet.

The other refugees: Serbs cast off by previous Yugoslav wars

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The kerchiefed old woman sits
absorbed in her knitting for hours at a time, the click-click of
the needles an escape from the reality of life as a minority Serb
refugee in Kosovo.
	   Djuja Zekovic says she doesn't even know what she's making _ and
it doesn't matter. She is fashioning her own world with the yarn.
	   ``Look around you,'' she says, eyes reddening as she gestures at
the half-dozen cots in a dirty room strewn with clothing, pots and
piles of donated food _ her universe for the past year.
	   ``When I'm not crying, I'm knitting.''
	   On the move for seven years in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia
since fleeing her home in Bosnia, Mrs. Zekovic, 75, shares refugee
status with hundreds of thousands of others in Kosovo.
	   The needs of Albanians driven from homes by the Serbs during the
Kosovo conflict have shifted the world's focus away from the plight
of Serbs like her _ victims of previous Yugoslav wars.
	   Many of the 500,000 such people remaining in Serbia have
assimilated, moving into new homes and finding jobs. Others have
returned home, to Croatia or Bosnia.
	   Still others are trying to emigrate, including more and more
Serb refugees in Serbia's Kosovo province who are afraid of being
caught up in another ethnic conflict in the southern region where
Serbs are outnumbered 9-to-1 by ethnic Albanians.
	   U.N. figures show an increase in the number of refugees from
Croatia now in Serbia _ most of them Serbs who fled the Croatian
army onslaught in 1995. A total of 1,069 were resettled in the
first seven months of this year, slightly more than the figure for
all of 1997. Many went to the United States.
	   Veton Orana, who works in Pristina for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, says Serb refugees who want to go abroad
are being processed first among all would-be emigres.
	   ``They're afraid. They don't want to face another war,'' says
Orana. ``They say everything that is happening here is a replay of
what they've already fled from.''
	   But about 7,000 of those with nowhere to go remain in Kosovo,
most of them scattered in 200 collection centers, such as
Pristina's indoor sports stadium, where Mrs. Zekovic lives.
	   Like her, many live off handouts and pensions of no more than
dlrs 30 a month. Others work when they can, but still cannot break
away from the dingy refugee camps they've called home since running
from Croatia or Bosnia in the early- to mid- 1990s.
	   Some have already been made refugees again, fleeing camps
outside Pristina for the safety of the Kosovo capital because of
feared attacks from Albanian guerrillas.
	   Judith Kumin, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva, calls them ``the forgotten refugees.''
	   ``Those who are in Kosovo are double victims because they have
been victimized by two wars,'' she says. ``They are the most
vulnerable _ the elderly and people who have nowhere else to go.''
	   Milos Rodic expresses the same sentiment, more simply.
	   ``We are the last string on the fiddle,'' says the unshaven
30-year-old laborer as he sits at a rickety card table set up in an
untidy section of one of the sports complex's makeshift
dormitories. Boxes, cans, pots and pans are everywhere, and socks
of dubious cleanliness hang on a line.
	   Rodic fled his hometown of Knin in 1995, when the Croatian army
retook it from the Serb rebels who captured it in 1991.
	   He says he can't go back because he would face punishment for
volunteering to fight against the Croats. So, he whiles away his
days ``sometimes working, sometimes drinking.''
	   ``I have no plans, no future,'' he says.
	   In another room, Mrs. Zekovic says she's trying to get her life
in order.
	   She's even ready to return to Bihac, the Bosnian town she fled
in 1992 after a Muslim assault, despite fears for her safety. But,
she says, her applications to have her apartment returned have gone
unanswered.
	   ``I dream about home,'' she says of her thoughts while knitting.
``I have no home.''
	   She shrugs when asked whether she feels a sense of shared fate
with the hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees made homeless
by the Serbs.
	   ``I have my own suffering,'' she says. ``I'm not interested in
anyone else's.''

In recession, Japanese couples tying the knot cheap and simple

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Growing up, Emi Shinozaki dreamed of a wedding with
the works. There would be vows before a Shinto altar, a dramatic
lightshow as she entered the reception, two or three different
gowns and kimonos for her to model.
	   Then the economy intervened.
	   Japanese wedding ceremonies have long been among the most lavish
and expensive to be found anywhere in the world _ averaging tens of
thousands of dollars.
	   But as a measure of just how deeply Japan is feeling the pinch
of nearly a decade in the economic dumps, this bastion of
conspicuous spending is taking a major hit.
	   Industry analysts say young couples and parents who usually foot
part of the bill are now opting for simpler nuptials. Originality
is replacing gaudiness as the wedding buzzword, and some venerable
but expensive traditions are falling by the wayside.
	   Shinozaki and her husband, for instance, chose to skip the cash
gift from his family to hers, didn't hire a traditional go-between
and left off a ceremony at a Shinto shrine.
	   Instead, they held the wedding at a less expensive
non-denominational site and put on the reception at a hotel.
	   ``Couples are spending less and bringing more ideas of their own
into their wedding,'' said Rika Hoshina, spokeswoman for Staff
Promotion Co. Ltd., a bridal consulting company in Tokyo.
	   Hoshina said the average spent on weddings has declined the past
five years. ``Because of the bad economy people prefer to save
their money for future,'' she said.
	   Weddings still aren't cheap, though.
	   According to a survey by the bridal magazine Zeksi, the average
newlyweds in the Tokyo area spent nearly 11 percent less to tie the
knot in 1997 than they did the year before. But the tab for the
average 1997 wedding ran 5.9 million yen, or about dlrs 44,400.
	   Included in this figure are engagement gifts, the wedding
ceremony itself, the honeymoon and furnishings for a new home.
	   During the go-go 1980s, when Japan's economy was awash in easy
credit, the already gaudy bent of weddings reached new highs.
	   It was almost de rigeur for couples to be brought into a banquet
hall filled with fog from dry ice machines and for the bride to
change gowns several times before the reception was over.
	   But the tighter economy is changing that.
	   According to the Zeksi survey, nearly one in every 10 couples
had their weddings overseas last year as a way of cutting costs by
combining ceremony with honeymoon.
	   The honeymoon itself is also becoming less of a given. Couples
forgoing it last year represented 15 percent of all surveyed by
Zeksi, twice as many as in 1996.
	   Bridal watchers say the plethora of magazines like Zeksi helps
couples become more cost-conscious by giving them information on
their options.
	   One beneficiary has been restaurants, where more and more
receptions are being held rather than in more expensive hotels.
	   Hideyuki Yoda, manager of Ramages, a French restaurant in Tokyo,
puts on about 150 weddings a year. He sees such weddings becoming
more acceptable and shedding their former social stigma as cheap.
	   Yoda said a typical wedding at his restaurant costs less than 2
million yen (dlrs 15,000) for 80 guests, while hotels average 3 to
4 million yen (dlrs 22,600 to 30,000).
	   But amid all the cost-consciousness, Nagoya, a city in central
Japan famous for its expensive weddings, is a glaring holdout.
	   Nagoya couples still spend an average of 7 million yen (dlrs
52,600) on their weddings.
	   Trucks specially built with big windows or open sides to show
off furniture _ a required gift from bride to groom _ ply the
streets.
	   Neighbors are invited to inspect the furniture and wedding gown,
and four to five gifts are given to each guest attending the
wedding itself, though one is the norm in the rest of Japan.
	   ``People in Nagoya care what other people, especially relatives,
say about them. People here tend to show off,'' said Misaki
Fukumochi, who heads Birth Co., a Nagoya-based bridal consultant.
	   ``But it's true that if you've got three daughters, the
household will go bankrupt marrying them off,'' she said.

Pessimism despite official China's very public attack on Y2K bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has organized its war on the Year 2000
software glitch with a central planning flair worthy of one of
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's mass political campaigns.
	   But a dearth of technical know-how, reliance on a mishmash of
software and dubious financial commitment are raising serious
questions about whether it will be anywhere near ready.
	   Desperate for uninterrupted economic growth, the government is
trying to browbeat industries into fixing their computer systems.
Yet uncertainty and considerable pessimism prevail among government
and industry experts.
	   The millennium bug is a formidable foe. Back in computer
software's infancy, thrifty engineers expressed years with just the
final two digits. When 1999 draws to a close, unfixed computers and
embedded circuits in all kinds of machines won't know if the new
year is 2000 or 1900. They could crash, halt factory operations,
scramble critical data.
	   The outside world could feel the effects of a Chinese computer
crisis in foreign trade, most likely through hiccups in billing and
shipping. Air travel could be disrupted and ripple effects from
chaos in China's economy could affect much of the region.
	   But there are saving graces.
	   China's financial system is still mostly insulated, so any
bug-generated failures within it would likely not have an outside
domino effect, Zhang Qi, the Information Ministry official in
charge of the problem, was quoted by the official Xinhua News
Agency as saying. China, with just 10 million computers, is also
less computerized than many industrialized nations.
	   To tackle the ``Y2K'' problem, China has set up a central
command body and ordered ministries to draft plans for industries
under their supervision.
	   The central bank is to provide loans for reprogramming and
testing must be completed by October 1999, with officials wielding
vague threats to hold organizations that fail ``criminally
responsible'' for any failures when Jan. 1, 2000, rolls around.
	   Vice Premier Wu Bangguo and other leaders ordered the technology
troops into action during a series of meetings in late 1997 and
early 1998.
	   ``They are on a very tight schedule, but the awareness is there
at the very top,'' said I-Lin Chow, head of IBM's Y2K task force
for China.
	   The state and private sectors, however, are badly hampered by a
lack of expertise and cash to hire expensive outside help. If those
deficiencies aren't corrected soon ``this task cannot be
completed,'' Zhang was quoted as telling Xinhua.
	   She said, China's banks, railways and airlines are tackling the
problem, but overall China is hopelessly unprepared.
	   A ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
industries are still being surveyed about Y2K bugs. With less than
500 days to go, it may be too late for much of the Chinese economy.
Effective fixes require that computer code be reviewed line by
line.
	   China's Y2K woes are compounded by the widespread use of pirated
and specially designed software that defy off-the-shelf corrective
programs. Hardware varies widely, and most companies or government
bodies have no backup equipment to use while their computers are
being fixed.
	   The bigger challenge, though, may be getting businesses to place
priority on Y2K when formerly cosseted state industries are failing
and China's exports are being walloped by the Asian economic
crisis.
	   ``For a lot of companies, the Y2K problem is still not in the
picture. More pressing economic problems are pushing the problem
way down on their list of priorities,'' said Peng Yali, an analyst
with the Arthur Anderson consulting firm.
	   IBM's Chow said China may be able to lessen the damage by
dealing with the most crucial systems first.
	   Aviation remains a major area of uncertainty. The Civil Aviation
Administration of China says it licked the bug in its ticket
bookings system in July and work is on schedule to deal with
departure and cargo-handling systems.
	   Many of China's airlines share computer systems for their
ticketing, cargo business and maintenance scheduling with flag
carrier Air China, whose systems are ``mostly fixed,'' said Shi
Lei, head of computer operations for China International Airways.
	   However, Hong Kong consultants studying the industry say efforts
seem to have receded because the airlines have run into financial
trouble.
	   China's two stock exchanges will likely meet the deadline with
the help of foreign consultants, the investment company Merrill
Lynch says.
	   The China Securities Regulatory Commission is threatening to
suspend any company that doesn't pass muster. But few other
industries are taking the initiative in dealing with the bug,
Merrill Lynch said.
	   ``At some levels the problem is being taken seriously,
especially at the central bank. But in many industries there is
still little awareness or concern,'' said John Pinchel, head of
Merrill Lynch's Asian Y2K operations in Hong Kong.

Japan's trade surplus rises in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 45.6
percent in September for the 18th straight month of increase, the
government said Wednesday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.548 trillion yen (dlrs 13.3 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus is measured as goods pass customs but before
adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
also continued to climb, rising 41.4 percent to 731.05 billion yen
(dlrs 6.30 billion). It was the 24th straight month of increase.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   The ministry also announced that Japan's unadjusted trade
surplus for the first six months of the fiscal year stood at 7.411
trillion yen (dlrs 63.9 billion), up 44.7 percent from the year
earlier period.
	   The fiscal first half surplus with the United States rose 41.3
percent to 3.424 trillion yen (dlrs 29.5 billion).
	   Japan's fiscal year begins April 1.

<TEXT>

Aid workers say half a million Rwandans displaced by violence

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Nearly half a million people have been
displaced in northwestern Rwanda, where government forces have
apparently stepped up attacks against Hutu rebels, aid workers
said.
	   The number of displaced people has doubled since August, after
authorities gathered people scattered on the hillsides into
makeshift camps to avoid civilian casualties and isolate the rebels
from the largely Hutu population, aid workers said Tuesday.
	   A third of the total population in the most densely populated
region of Rwanda _ 478,637 people _ has been displaced, according
to the latest figures, compiled by local authorities, the United
Nations and the Irish relief agency Concern.
	   Steve Brown, the U.N. resident coordinator, said the United
Nations would appeal to donors for an emergency relief package
later in the week.
	   The northwestern corner of Rwanda is a traditional Hutu
stronghold. Rebels _ former Hutu soldiers and militiamen _ have
been relying on their families, friends and neighbors for food,
money and shelter.
	   The rebels are responsible for the 1994 Hutu
government-orchestrated genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. The genocide ended when
Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
	   But violence has increased since 1996, when Hutu fighters mixed
in with more than a million Hutu civilians who returned from exile
in neighboring Congo.
	   Aid workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
seemingly organized, large-scale displacement during the planting
season could cause serious food shortages.
	   The northwest is the most fertile region, but since 1996 the
area has been dependent on food aid for survival. The U.N. World
Food Program says it has been supplying food for 364,000 people
displaced since January.

Hundreds of high school students protest in Martinique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Hundreds of high school
students protested in the streets of Fort-de-France Tuesday in
solidarity with striking students in Guadeloupe and mainland
France.
	   French students began a second round of protests Tuesday to
demand the hiring of more teachers, a lighter courseload and
repairs to schools.
	   Some Martinique students said they wanted more computers.
	   The protests emptied all of Fort-de-France's high schools.
Students from neighboring Lamentin marched along a highway towards
Fort-de-France Tuesday morning, freezing traffic.
	   There were no reports of violence or injuries.

Researchers find herpes in brains of multiple sclerosis patients
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf `The blood..' to CLARIFY that findings were
blood finding &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM CHILSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Researchers have found a form of the herpes
virus in people with multiple sclerosis, circumstantial evidence
that it may cause the debilitating disease.
	   Human herpes virus-6 was found in the brains of eight of 11 MS
patients studied by scientists at the Institute for Viral
Pathogenesis in Milwaukee. The virus was also found in the blood of
14 of 25 patients.
	   The blood findings confirm a study published last December.
	   Scientists have long suspected a virus triggers MS, which
prompts the immune system to attack nerve fibers, causing paralysis
and death.
	   If further study confirms the virus as the cause, the finding
could lead to new treatments for a disease that affects more than
300,000 people in the United States.
	   The study was presented Tuesday at conference of the American
Neurological Association in Montreal.
	   Dr. Robert Lisak, co-director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical
and Research Center at the Detroit Medical Center, said the study
doesn't convince him that the virus is solely to blame for MS. Past
studies have been unable to confirm that, he said.
	   ``It would be nice if this were true. I'm not saying it can't
be,'' Lisak said. ``More study needs to be done.''
	   People often carry the herpes virus-6 and many other types of
viruses and bacteria, and MS may have multiple causes, he said.
	   Donald Carrigan, a co-author of the study, acknowledged that
further research is needed but noted that the virus was present
only in brain areas actively damaged by MS.

Morale low as Nigerian town buries the dead from pipeline blast

	   JESSE, Nigeria (AP) _ Construction equipment ripped holes in the
ground for mass burials of victims of Saturday's pipeline inferno
in this south Nigeria town, as flames occasionally shot through
smoke wafting around the charred site.
	   The people of Jesse were looking for hope among the living, but
finding little. Hospitals were overwhelmed by injured people from
the blast, which authorities said was sparked while up to 1,000
people tried to collect gasoline from the pipeline, killing at
least 500 people.
	   The stench from decaying corpses hung thickly about town, and
workers had to continually leave the area to catch their breath.
	   Hospitals _ most with few doctors and nurses and little for burn
care _ were overwhelmed by burn victims, although some casualties
were being pulled out of hospitals by their families who feared
they may be arrested for theft, medical workers and newspapers
said.
	   Authorities have not said whether they intend to press charges
in the weekend incident in Jesse, some 300 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Lagos.
	   One woman who was getting hospital treatment had little to
celebrate. Her cassava farm was untended, and pain from oozing
wounds wracked her body.
	   ``See me now,'' said Dorcas Oboh, a farmer scarred with burns,
bandages running the length of both legs as she sat in the
hospital. ``I am finished.''
	   Oboh denied that she was trying to collect gasoline spilling
from the pipeline.
	   ``I only wanted to see what they were doing. I went to look,''
she said. ``I am finished,'' she repeated.
	   Firefighters have stopped battling the blaze and were waiting
for the fire to burn itself out. But thousands of gallons of fuel
remained in the Jesse section of the pipeline _ which runs nearly
600 kilometers (380 miles) from the southeastern city of Warri to
the northern city of Kaduna. The surface pipeline is not protected,
not even with coils of barbed wire.
	   Abubakar said during his brief Monday visit that the government
would pay for medical care, but that no compensation would be paid
to the families of the dead, apparently because many were believed
to be scavenging fuel.
	   In the hospitals, medicine is scarce, doctors overworked and
sterile surroundings all but impossible. Hundreds of people were
believed to be suffering at home, without painkillers, from the
agonies of burns.
	   ``We simply had to lock up our gate, we could not cope,'' said a
doctor at Okparavero Memorial Hospital in the nearby town of
Sapele, who spoke on condition anonymity. ``Virtually everybody
coming into this hospital and other hospitals came with 100 percent
burns. As they came in, they were dying.''
	   In the southeastern Niger River delta region, an oil-rich area
scarred by poverty, scooping up buckets of gasoline from a spilling
pipeline could offer quick gains.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, but its
petroleum industry, crippled by corruption and mismanagement,
barely functions.
	   Most Nigerian refineries don't work and much of the country's
gasoline is imported. Lines at gas pumps can last for days and
black market prices are often marked up 1,000 percent.
	   ``When you deny people of petrol, it creates a black market, it
creates illegal hawkers,'' said Ighotota Amori, a local politician.
``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the government is to
blame for this mess.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police suspect paramilitary gunmen
killed a mayor, the town manager and their driver in the northern
state of Antioquia, police reported.
	   The bodies of Hector Emilio Piedrahita, town manager Adriana
Maria Casas and their driver were found early Tuesday in a village
near Anori, where Piedrahita was mayor, police spokesman Haten
Dasuki said from Medellin, the state capital.
	   ``The suspects are paramilitary members,'' Dasuki said, without
elaborating.
	   The three victims set out Monday evening from Anori, 180 miles
(289 kilometers) from Bogota, after Piedrahita received an
unexpected phone call at his home, the mayor's wife told police.
	   Antioquia is heavily contested by leftist rebels and
landowner-backed militias. The groups rarely confront one another
directly, but they often kill civilians they suspect of
collaborating with the other side.
	   Piedrahita was released last month after 45 days as a captive of
leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's defense minister Tuesday
angrily rejected a suggestion by leftist rebels that the army
detonated a weekend fire that killed 47 people in a rural hamlet.
	   ``They are trying to confuse the people with lies,'' Defense
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said in a radio interview.
	   The guerrillas issued a statement late Monday admitting they
dynamited a pipeline early Sunday outside Machuca, the town in
Antioquia state devastated in Sunday's fire.
	   But rebels of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army said the
fire that consumed the village began more than an hour later and
may have been intentionally set by soldiers sent to the area.
	   The rebel account was ridiculed by Lloreda, who insisted the
bombing was sufficient to cause the deadly fireball.
	   Survivors have said the blaze that roared through Machuca
occurred just moments after the pipeline eruption.
	   There was no immediate comment from President Andres Pastrana,
who plans to begin peace talks Nov. 7 with the country's largest
rebel faction, the Revolutionary Armed
	   Forces of Colombia.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori would be defeated
by either of his two major challengers if a presidential election
was held today, a poll showed Tuesday.
	   Fujimori has not said if he will run for a third consecutive
term in the 2000 election, but the Fujimori-controlled Congress has
passed a series of controversial laws paving the way for such a
bid.
	   If Fujimori faced popular Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade, considered
his strongest possible challenger, Andrade would win by 59 percent
to 30 percent, with the remainder undecided, the poll by the
private company Apoyo showed.
	   If Fujimori faced Luis Castaneda, the former head of Peru's
public health system, Castaneda would win 44 percent to 35 percent,
the poll showed.
	   Fujimori gained popularity for capturing top rebel leaders in
the early 1990s and for taming hyperinflation. But his approval
rating has fallen sharply in recent months due to discontent over
deepening poverty and his authoritarian leadership.
	   The Apoyo polled 500 Lima residents Oct. 16-17 with a margin of
error of plus or minus four percent.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Two Basque separatists
living in the Dominican Republic have disappeared amid increasing
pressure to extradite them to Spain, police said Tuesday.
	   Angel Iturbe Avasolo and Maria Belen Gonzalez Penalba, alias
Carmen Maria, were last seen leaving their home Sunday in suburban
Santo Domingo. The two told neighbors they were going to the beach.
	   Iturbe and Gonzalez belong to ETA, which has killed more than
800 people since 1968 in its attempt to win independence for the
Basque Country, a region that straddles the Spain-France border.
	   Iturbe and Gonzalez are the last of six ETA members granted
political asylum in the Dominican Republic in 1989 following the
failure of peace talks in Algeria.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has requested their
extradition.
	   The separatists' movements in the Dominican Republic were
restricted and they were forbidden to leave the country.
	   ETA stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language.

Mideast talks help Clinton, whatever the outcome,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ No matter what the outcome of the Mideast
peace summit may be, President Bill Clinton already is benefiting
from the talks.
	   Investing time and prestige, Clinton has polished his
credentials as a world statesman willing to tackle the dispute
between the Palestinians and Israelis. Newspaper and television
pictures show him wrapping his arms around Mideast adversaries in
the Rose Garden and intervening in difficult negotiations. Whatever
happens, at least he tried.
	   It's a far cry from headlines screaming about sexual
improprieties and impeachment.
	   ``At least he changes the subject and it looks as if he is doing
the people's business. That is good for him,'' said Michael
Mandelbaum, director of American foreign policy at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
	   ``They will claim a diplomatic triumph no matter what happens,''
Mandelbaum said. ``Of course this is calibrated politically. Of
course Bill Clinton wants to get something out of this. The
presidency is a political office.''
	   When presidents get in trouble at home, and particularly in
their second terms, they often turn to foreign affairs to make
their mark. As the leader of the world's only superpower, Clinton
commands plenty of respect overseas even if his reputation is
tarnished at home.
	   Prime ministers and presidents of other countries look to the
United States for leadership on difficult issues. They are not
concerned with Clinton's extramarital relationship. ``They want
this to be over without the president being damaged,'' said Thomas
Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution.
	   Clinton was back at the talks Tuesday, joined by Jordan's King
Hussein in pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat toward a settlement. At the start
of the day, he had spent 44 hours on Maryland's Eastern Shore at
the Wye Conference Center, an extraordinary amount of presidential
time.
	   With Congress rushing to the campaign trail and with impeachment
hearings on hold until after November congressional elections,
Clinton has been basking in favorable headlines, winning big
concessions from Republicans in the budget fight and threatening
America's military might in Kosovo.
	   His job approval ratings are strong in the mid- to high 60s, as
they have throughout the Monica Lewinsky controversy.
	   Still, the experts don't expect the Middle East _ or any foreign
policy issue _ to have much impact on Clinton's poll numbers. And
the impeachment inquiry will return with a vengeance after the
elections.
	   Jimmy Carter's Middle East triumph _ the Camp David accords _
was a genuine breakthrough but didn't help him a lot. He lost his
bid for re-election to Ronald Reagan.

Elections for key assembly latest battle in Iran's power struggle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TEH103-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The latest battle defining Iran's future
comes in elections Friday for a key assembly that moderates hope
can be used to curb the absolute power of the country's spiritual
leader.
	   The vote is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, which has the
duty under Iran's constitution to elect and supervise the supreme
leader, who for two decades has had the last word in setting the
country's direction.
	   Until now, the only real challenge to that authority has come
from President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric whose huge 1997
election victory has allowed him to ease some Islamic strictures
controlling the lives of Iran's 60 million people.
	   But it has also set up a battle between the entrenched
hard-liners under spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and
moderates who want to erase Iran's image as a rogue state and move
it back into the international mainstream.
	   The campaign is emotional. On Tuesday, a rally attended by about
3,000 people, mostly moderate students, briefly erupted into
pushing, shoving and fist-swinging when a group of several dozen
hard-liners began chanting ``Death to America.''
	   The moderates replied with shouts of ``fascists'' and
``Taliban,'' a reference to Afghanistan's fanatical ruling faction,
but riot police appeared before the crowd got out of hand.
	   Even before the campaign began, the hard-liners _ mindful of the
danger that the Assembly of Experts can pose _ acted to undercut
the moderates.
	   Two weeks ago, an ultra-conservative council responsible for
judging candidates' worthiness dumped 214 of the 396 assembly
hopefuls, about 80 percent of them backers of Khatami.
	   But even if the moderates don't get a majority on the assembly,
which their leaders concede will likely happen, they still hope to
use it as a vehicle to chip away at the supreme leader's authority.
	   ``What we want is that all the points in the constitution be
respected,'' said Saeid Leilaz, leader of a centrist political
group.
	   ``Contrary to all beliefs, our constitution is very
anti-dictatorial,'' he said. ``If you read it carefully, you will
find that no one has the last word.''
	   But until now, critics say, the Assembly of Experts has failed
to control the ever-growing powers of the spiritual leader.
	   Khamenei exercises absolute control, as did Iran's first
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, father of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   One example moderates give of Khamenei's dangerous power is that
he blocked an expected meeting between Iran's Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at
the U.N. General Assembly earlier this month.
	   Khatami has called for a dialogue with the United States, while
the hard-liners want to keep Washington in its old role as the
``Great Satan.''
	   Key to Friday's election may be turnout. Estimates are that
fewer than 10 million people will take part, a sharp contrast to
presidential elections last year when 30 million voted, 20 million
of them for Khatami. The hard-liners are seen as more likely to
turn out this time.
	   The moderates blame the Council of Guardians, the body that vets
the candidates, for dampening interest by its unfair screening
process.
	   Some moderates want a boycott of the vote to protest the
elimination of their candidates. But ex-Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi, a leading moderate, urged those at Tuesday's rally to
cast ballots.
	   ``Vote for those closest to your opinions and liking so that
there will be a variety of ideas in the Assembly of Experts,'' he
said. ``If you don't vote, you will be depriving yourselves of your
social and political rights.''
	   Hard-liners maintain it is unrealistic to expect a turnout in
Friday's vote as big as in a presidential election and point out
that the candidate-vetting council is not obligated to explain its
decisions.
	   ``Even if the Council of Guardians did make some mistakes, it
does not mean that people should not take part in the elections,''
council member Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in Iranian newspapers.
	   The centrist Leilaz said the hard-liners must finally recognize
the constitution's limit on the supreme leader or face the wrath of
the millions of Iranians _ particularly the young _ who voted for
Khatami.
	   ``The new generation of people will not easily let go of their
legal rights or surrender it to anyone else _ including the
spiritual leader,'' said Leilaz.

Japanese stocks soar, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rose sharply early Wednesday on
optimism that Japan's troubled banks were moving closer to seeking
public money to boost their depleted capital. The U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues jumped
456.28 points, or 3.30 percent, to 14,264.33 in the first half hour
of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei had gained 240.85 points, or 1.78
percent, its highest level since Oct. 7.
	   It was the first time the Nikkei had traded above 14,000 points
since Sept. 28.
	   The rise was set off by a reported comment by Industrial Bank of
Japan President Masao Nishimura, who was quoted by the Nihon Keizai
newspaper as saying that his bank would apply for public funds
under a government plan. IBJ is the first bank to say it will seek
public money.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer money into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 32.45 points, or 3.11 percent, to 1,075.47. It
had risen 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
39.40 points, or about 0.5 percent, to close at 8,505.85. It was
the Dow's first close above 8,500 since late August.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 116.04 yen in
early trading, up 0.90 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its
level of 116.83 yen in late New York trading overnight.
	   Traders said that steady dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors was preventing a further drop in the U.S. currency.
	   The dollar rose against most major currencies in New York on
fears of an interest rate cut in Germany and the report that IBJ
was prepared to ask for public funds.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.845 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.52 from 108.82 yen.

Australia names squad for northern tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Argentine prop Patricio Noriega
is a step closer to playing for his new country after being named
in Australia's squad to tour France and England next month.
	   Noriega has served a three-year wait to be eligible for the
Wallabies and is considered a strong candidate to make the team for
next year's World Cup.
	   Noriega must pass a fitness test to take his place in a squad
which has already had several frontline stars ruled out.
	   Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Richard Harry, Damian Smith and
Stirling Mortlock were not considered because of injuries while Tim
Horan and Willie Ofahengaue will also face pre-tour fitness tests.
	   The Wallabies will leave on Nov. 11 with a warm-up match against
France A in Lille on Nov. 15 before tests against France in Paris
on Nov. 21 and England at Twickenham on Nov. 28.
	   Squad:
	   Joe Roff, Chris Latham, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Nathan
Grey, Stephen Larkham, Manuel Edmonds, George Gregan, Chris

Australia to reopen investigation of journalist deaths in East
</HEADLINE>
Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will reopen an
investigation into the killings of five Western journalists during
Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   Downer said he would refer new evidence from an eyewitness to
the killings to former government lawyer Tom Sherman, who reported
in 1996 that there was no deliberate attempt by Indonesian forces
to eliminate the men.
	   The alleged eyewitness to the shootings told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. TV's Foreign Correspondent program that the
journalists had been shot by the Indonesian military under the
orders of the present Indonesian information minister, Yunus
Yosfiah, then a military officer.
	   Contradicting the Indonesian claim to date that the men were cut
down in crossfire, the witness, Olandino Maia Guterres, said there
had been no gunfire from East Timorese resistance fighters at the
time of the shootings.
	   Guterres said four of the journalists were shot dead and one
stabbed before their bodies were dressed in military uniforms and
photographed by Indonesian troops, including Yunus.
	   Yunus on Tuesday denied any involvement in the killings and said
the case was closed.
	   Downer, however, said the account could not be lightly dismissed
and had to be examined.
	   ``What I have decided to do is to refer any of these additional
materials to Tom Sherman, ask him to review it, to speak to the
witness, (and) to speak also to another witness who he has spoken
to already who now presents a rather different piece of evidence
from the evidence he presented to Mr. Sherman some time ago,''
Downer told Australian broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Sherman would report to Downer before a decision was made to
take the investigation further.
	   Nobel Peace Prize laureate and East Timor activist Jose Ramos
Horta on Tuesday accused successive Australian and British
governments of ``cowardice and hypocrisy'' for what he said was a
cover-up of the deaths of the five journalists.
	   He called for a fresh inquiry involving independent
international investigators.
	   ``All these years, one thing that disgusts me most is the
cowardice, the hypocrisy of the government in Australia and the
United Kingdom, that are prepared to lie, to cover up, to betray
their own people,'' Ramos Horta told a news conference in London.
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens, reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and soundman
Tony Stewart, 21, both Australians, and cameraman Gary Cunningham,
27, a New Zealander, were killed in an attack on Balibo village on
Oct. 16, 1975.
	   Downer said his government had no motive to cover up the events
surrounding the deaths.
	   He said the Indonesian government had not responded to an
Australian request for further information on the issue, and any
Indonesian inquiry would be welcomed.

Sharp jolt shakes central, lower South Island of New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Much of New Zealand's South
Island south of the city of Christchurch was rocked by an
earthquake of magnitude 6.1 Wednesday morning, authorities said.
	   Police and emergency services reported minor property damage
caused by the earthquake in the Canterbury, West Coast and Otago
regions.
	   The quake's epicenter was 27 miles (44 kms) out to sea north of
Haast on the West Coast and 8 miles (12 kms) below the seabed.
	   Local residents in Mount Cook said ornaments and foodstuffs were
knocked from shelves when the earthquake struck at 9.02 a.m. local
time (2002 GMT).
	   Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences seismologist Terry
Webb said the damage caused was minor.
	   ``This is the largest shallow event for a couple of years,''
Webb said.
	   Haast police constable Robin Manera said he felt the shaking,
but that it was ``pretty mild.''
	   He had received no reports of damage.
	   Webb also confirmed that a magnitude 4.2 quake centered near
Woodville in the south of the North Island and some 46 miles (74
kms) deep, shook the regional centers of Tararua, Palmerston North,
Horowhenua and Manawatu shortly before midnight local time (1100
GMT).
	   Damage was unlikely due to its depth, he said.
	   A magnitude 6.1 quake in a city area can cause widespread damage
and death, he said.

Controversy surrounds book-at-a-time Bible project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LMN109 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Individual books of the Bible, accompanied by
sometimes skeptical introductions by well-known writers, have
quickly become among the most talked-about volumes in Britain _
even touching off a threat of blasphemy prosecution.
	   The Pocket Canons, 12 books of the King James translation of the
Bible selling for 1 pound (dlrs 1.70) each, were published this
month to swirls of controversy.
	   Predictably, press attention gravitated to the most provocative
introduction _ novelist Will Self denounced Revelation as ``a sick
text'' that fascinated a mentally ill college friend.
	   ``In its vile obscurantism is its baneful effect; the original
language may have welded the metaphoric with the signified, the
'logos' with the flesh, but in the King James version, the text is
a guignol of tedium, a portentous horror film,'' Self wrote.
	   Close behind in attention _ and the hottest seller of the lot _
was the book of Job.
	   Louis de Bernieres, author of ``Corelli's Mandolin,'' says in
his introduction that Job depicts God as ``a frivolous trickster.''
	   That especially offended Paul Slennet of SCB Services, a
religious book distributor, who also took exception to Self's essay
and to Blake Morrison's introduction to John.
	   Slennet pulled out of a deal to distribute the pocket books to
650 religious bookshops in Britain, after first trying to persuade
their Edinburgh-based publisher, Canongate Books Ltd., to withdraw
some of the volumes.
	   ``I'm sad, I suppose, because I thought it was a wonderful
opportunity'' to get more people to read the Bible, Slennet said.
	   He has written to 18,500 churches in Britain, urging members to
write to Canongate demanding the withdrawal of some of the books,
and says he is seeking legal advice about a possible blasphemy
action.
	   Some of the introductions were reprinted in national newspapers,
and the issue has been debated on radio and television.
	   Claire Paterson, commissioning editor for the series, said she
did not seek controversy: Her only direction to the writers was to
produce 2,000 to 3,000 words.
	   But she didn't shy from controversy either, most notably in
retaining an attention-getting expletive in Self's introduction.
	   ``I just wanted a new, fresh angle on the Bible,'' she
explained. ``It's the text, after all, that's important, not the
introduction.''
	   Canongate, which plans to publish 12 more books in the series
next year, has sold rights for reprints in a number of countries,
including the United States.
	   ``The whole idea is that they are single books,'' Ms. Paterson
said. ``We are publishing the Bible as it was originally
conceived.''
	   In contrast to Self's hostility to Revelation, some writers were
enthusiastic about their texts.
	   Australian rock musician Nick Cave raved about Mark, saying its
depiction of Jesus ``had a ringing intensity about Him that I could
not resist. Christ spoke to me through His isolation, through the
burden of His death, through His rage at the mundane, through His
sorrow.''
	   Novelist A.N. Wilson tells readers of Matthew: ``You are holding
in your hands a tiny book which has changed more human lives than
'The Communist Manifesto' or Freud's 'Interpretation of Dreams': a
book which has shaped whole civilizations.''
	   The series was inspired by Dublin property developer Matthew
Darby, who wanted to give a copy of the Song of Solomon to a
girlfriend for Valentine's Day but couldn't find a copy of that
richly erotic work outside of a full Bible.
	   He approached Canongate's publisher, Stephen Byng, who seized on
the idea.
	   The Song of Solomon, introduced by A.S. Byatt, was published as
part of the first series _ though perhaps not as quickly as Darby
hoped.
	   ``I don't think the girlfriend is still around,'' Ms. Paterson
said.

Australian lawyers express concern at Malaysian detention law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Law Council of Australia on
Wednesday wrote to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to
express ``great concern'' at the detention of former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was fired on Sept. 2 as deputy premier and finance
minister and was subsequently arrested after launching a campaign
to reform the government.
	   ``The law council has observed the recent detention of Anwar
Ibrahim with great concern,'' council president Fabian Dixon said.
	   ``While we understand from media reports that his detention
under the ISA (Internal Security Act) has been lifted, we also
understand that he remains in custody due to him being remanded
without bail at a recent High Court hearing.
	   ``We have written to Dr. Mahathir to seek his assurance that
Anwar Ibrahim's forthcoming trial will proceed under the highest
principles relating to the rule of law, the federal constitution of
Malaysia and principles of natural justice.''
	   Dixon said the law council also sought assurances that Anwar's
trial will proceed with due regard to judicial independence and the
separation of powers doctrine and that he would not be subjected to
any brutality while in custody.
	   Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption,
but has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. He
has appeared in court with a black eye and a neck brace, accusing
police of beating him.
	   Dixon said the council was greatly concerned that members of the
Malaysian legal profession and others had been detained under the
ISA and called for it to be repealed.
	   ``It does not meet international standards on the right to a
fair trial and the right to peacefully express opinion free from
the threat of arbitrary arrest and detention,'' Dixon said.
	   The law council sent copies of its letter to Australian Prime
Minister John Howard, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer,
Attorney-General Daryl Williams and Malaysian High Commissioner
Dato Adnan Othman.

Life for Kosovo refugees better, but Milosevic holds back on full

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Life for refugees in the hills of Kosovo
is improving, Western officials say, though they'll probably live
in the outdoors for some time while Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic holds back on parts of a deal that would avert
airstrikes.
	   NATO's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark warned Milosevic in
Belgrade late Tuesday that full compliance with an Oct. 12
agreement reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, was necessary
to avert the strikes.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic has still
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in
February when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Yet Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in
Washington that conditions were improving for tens of thousands of
refugees who fled into the hills and forests to escape the
fighting.
	   Bacon said about half the 50,000 to 70,000 refugees living
outdoors now have some sort of shelter.
	   Fighting between ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of
the 2 million inhabitants of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's
main republic, Serbia _ has forced around 300,000 people from their
homes.
	   A recent increase in violence has raised fears about the
agreement, under which Milosevic pledged to meet U.N. demands,
including to withdraw special police and army units, halt the
crackdown, allow international agencies to help refugees and resume
talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the province.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told reporters that
Clark would provide ``very specific information'' to the Yugoslav
leader about his failure to comply fully with the requirements of
the international community.
	   ``And he will be making very clear that NATO will use military
force against the Serbs if he doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.
	   Milosevic has also promised to allow a 2,000-member
international verification mission into Kosovo and allow NATO
surveillance flights.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the rebels issued a list of their
own demands, chief among them the withdrawal of government forces
from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and an investigation by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands of ``crimes against humanity.''
.
	   Meanwhile, international efforts to aid refugees continues. As
winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if the
estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting _ including
thousands still living outdoors _ are not allowed to return home.
	   Many fear they will be attacked if they return, while the houses
of others have been destroyed.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ The American space odyssey that
began with humble little rockets barely nicking the ionosphere now
reaches, through Hubble's beady eye, almost to the beginning of
time.
	   Its human face across the decades is that of John Glenn.
	   Rewind to 1962: John Glenn becomes the first American to orbit
the Earth. There are no communication satellites, no Mission
Control in Houston, no touchdowns _ only splashdowns.
	   Pause at 1998: Thirty-six years later, hundreds of satellites
circle the globe, ordinary laptop computers help fly the space
shuttle. Voyager 1, which has been racing through space for 21
years, is about to depart the solar system. And John Glenn, at age
77, is back for an astonishing encore.
	   A septuagenarian in space is one example of science fiction
creeping ever closer to science fact. Another is NASA's launch this
weekend of the ion-propulsion engine on a test cruise. Such an
engine could cut at least two years _ perhaps five _ off the
10-year journey to Pluto, the outermost planet in the solar system,
nearly 4,000,000,000 miles (6,400,000,000 kilometers) from Earth.
	   Rocketing back to the future with Glenn on Oct. 29 aboard space
shuttle Discovery provides a peek at what might lie ahead.
	   The world's oldest astronaut hopes his return to orbit will
usher in a new area of geriatric research, and that more seniors
will fly as test subjects.
	   ``Being able to start out for the second time in my life on a
brand new area of research _ wow,'' Glenn says. ``We've got 83
different science and research projects. Eighty-three on one
blooming flight! It's just great.''
	   Others have loftier expectations: that it will give space
exploration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
a new lease on life and demonstrate to the public that space
tourism is no longer a fantasy.
	   ``You can tell them a million times that in flying these things
just like airplanes, they'll be going to the moon on vacations,''
says Apollo 12 moonwalker Alan Bean. ``You can tell them all that,
and they don't hear it or believe it. But I believe that John Glenn
will change all that in one flight.''
	   Glenn has changed things before. He could change things again.
	   The odyssey began, in 1961, with a pair of 15-minute suborbital
hops. But it took Marine Lt. Col. John H. Glenn Jr.'s three orbits
of Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962, to put the United States in the same
league as the Soviet Union, which already had lifted two men into
orbit. The moon suddenly seemed within grasp, as President Kennedy
had promised. Within seven years, it was.
	   Glenn's 140-plus orbits aboard Discovery will be victory laps, a
sentimental nod to the past that points out just how boring the
space program has become since the Apollo moon landings, says Alex
Roland, a former NASA historian who teaches history at Duke
University.
	   ``In the late 20th century, the only thing that will get public
interest in the space program is sort of the celebrity politics
that Hollywood plays and everybody plays,'' says Roland.
	   ``That trivializes whatever the hell it is that is going on on
shuttle flights.''
	   Homer Hickam Jr., a retired NASA engineer turned author, finds
it ``kind of a telling comment that all we can do for John Glenn is
carry him back into low-Earth orbit as we did in 1962. That's still
all we can do.''
	   Still, ``all we can do'' seems plenty. Apart from landing on the
moon and sending space probes to the edge of the solar system,
America has launched 91 shuttle flights over 17 years. These have
delivered satellites, captured satellites and repaired satellites.
Today so many countries are putting so many satellites aloft that
space is running out of parking slots. And remarkably, only once
have American lives been lost in flight_ on shuttle Challenger in
1986.
	   All this hardware in space has transformed Earth life at every
level, from the mundane (weather forecasts, phone links, global
television) to the cosmic (the Hubble Space Telescope, peering into
the dawn of the universe 12 billion light years away).
	   Even Kurt Vonnegut is impressed. He loves Hubble.
	   Back in 1969, three days before Apollo 11 blasted off to the
moon, the novelist wrote a New York Times Magazine article
complaining that the billions spent on space should have gone on
``cleaning up our filthy colonies here on Earth.''
	   ``That was a long time ago,'' Vonnegut chuckles when reminded of
that. ``It seemed like show business to me at the time. What the
space program has done since has been quite wonderful, so no, I'm
all for it.''
	   Early next year, the first shuttle crew led by a woman will
dispatch an X-ray version of Hubble, called the Advanced X-ray
Astrophysics Facility.
	   American astronauts have teamed up with Russian cosmonauts and
visited the Mir space station_ an unthinkable prospect in the Cold
War years.
	   They have grown crystals, analyzed bubbles, melted metals,
raised wheat. They have baby-sat monkeys, rats, fish and other
space critters and endured all sorts of medical tests.

CAPE CANAVERAL: medical tests.

<TEXT>
	   Expect more of the latter _ ``flagpole sitting'' as Roland calls
it _ aboard the international space station. The first component is
supposed to be launched in November after a year's delay caused by
the cash-strapped Russians.
	   Story Musgrave, who led the courageous 1993 spacewalking mission
to fix Hubble, is upset that up to dlrs 80 billion is being
committed to operate the space station for 15 years.
	   ``We have committed those future resources to Earth orbit. To
Earth orbit,'' Musgrave repeats. ``Not to reach and not to quest,
not to the big telescopes, not to the big planetary missions, not
to planetary exploration.''
	   ``It is really that kind of stuff that really touches to the
core ... you know, the cosmic story.''
	   Glenn, however, is characteristically cautious. ``I'm not one of
those who just think we ought to just drop everything and try to go
to Mars. It would be enormously expensive,'' he says.
	   ``Just trying to run a program on nothing but seeing how far and
fast and high we can go as an objective in itself, that doesn't
benefit you and me and other people right here on Earth. ... The
space station is the way we should be going. It's a very logical
next step.''
	   Roland argues NASA should use more rocket-launched robots
because too much is spent on human space flight _ dlrs 500 million
per shuttle mission _ and not enough on communications and weather
satellites and science probes.
	   If shuttles have become ho-hum, to many earthlubbers, other
space exploration continues to enthrall.
	   Witness Cassini winging its way toward Saturn. Or Galileo
orbiting Jupiter and scrutinizing its icy moon, Europa. Or Mars
Global Surveyor and Lunar Prospector circling their respective
globes. Or Ulysses looping around for yet another look at the sun's
poles.
	   The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft, NEAR, will catch
up with asteroid Eros in January and swing around it.
	   And this weekend, Deep Space 1, the first spacecraft in NASA's
New Millennium program, is to be launched to asteroid 1992 KD to
test the solar-electric-powered ion-propulsion engine and the
promise it holds for beating space travel's great enemies _ time
and distance.
	   ``We can't keep firing big rockets and just coasting to Mars, or
coasting to Jupiter, or coasting someplace. You have to get there
faster,'' says Curtis Cleven, deputy spacecraft systems manager for
Deep Space 1.
	   Diminutive Pluto is the last unexplored planet in the solar
system. NASA hopes to get there by about 2015, using conventional
technology.
	   Those who prefer machines to men in space point to little
Sojourner, the poster robot for NASA's faster-cheaper-better
campaign.
	   Pathfinder's July 4, 1997, landing on Mars, and Sojourner's
subsequent encounters with rocks named Yogi, Barnacle Bill and
Scooby Doo, captivated the home planet. Millions worldwide tuned in
on TV and the Internet (courtesy of those boring old satellites) as
the toylike rover rolled from stone to stone before losing steam.
	   NASA plans to launch more Mars orbiters and landers between
December and 2003. The Big Mission, the one to bring back Martian
soil and rocks, is targeted to lift off in 2005. The samples,
enough to fill at least one soda can, would arrive at Earth in 2008
and perhaps settle the question of whether life ever existed on
Mars.
	   That answer likely won't come from the potato-sized Martian
meteorite that NASA researchers still claim contains fossilized
remains of bacterialike animals. The evidence just isn't there,
many scientists contend.
	   It's enough, though, for author Ray Bradbury to dust off his
1950 classic, ``The Martian Chronicles'' and write a screenplay for
Universal.
	   ``We get excited about what we think is a Martian rock but we're
not sure. Well then, let's use this curiosity and put it into
building a team to actually go to Mars,'' Bradbury says.
	   His ``The Martian Chronicles'' put astronauts on Mars in
February 1999. Now he laments: ``I get depressed when I think of
the lack of real action.''
	   NASA figures the earliest anyone could go to Mars is 2012, given
sufficient government funding, which is extremely unlikely at
present.
	   A trip to Mars would take six to eight months each way.
	   Bradbury thinks a space station is needed on the moon, and that
the space program is focused too much on the shuttles.

	   ``We're doing the same things over and over again, and that
doesn't guarantee us a position in the universe,'' he says. ``The
universe is huge. We should be reaching out, and we're just not
doing it at this time.''
	   The 23,000-member National Space Society also prefers the moon
to low-Earth orbit. It longs for the day ``when we can truly claim
we're a spacefaring civilization,'' says the society's executive
director, Pat Dasch.
	   Just wait, urges NASA's boss, Daniel Goldin.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s experimental X-33 rocketship is supposed
to take off next year from California and land in Utah in less than
15 minutes and in Montana in less than 25 minutes _ flying entirely
by remote control. NASA hopes it will lead to a fully reusable
spaceship, called VentureStar, that could replace the costly,
outdated shuttles.
	   Goldin says his goal is ``to erase the distinction between air
and space travel.''
	   Within 30 to 40 years, he predicts, two-hour commercial flights
will link Cape Canaveral and Tokyo, with planes that ``see''
through fog, snow and dust, and fly by tapping into the pilots'
brain waves.
	   Astronauts of various nationalities, meanwhile, will be living
on or near Mars and launching interstellar probes with miniature
robots to search for extraterrestrial life.
	   All this ``is less science fiction than the notion of sending a
human to the moon back on NASA's first day of operation in 1958,''
Goldin told employees on the agency's 40th birthday, Oct. 1.
	   Roland contends that NASA talks big but doesn't deliver. ``The
program is always manana,'' he says.
	   Robert Zubrin, founder of Pioneer Astronautics and author of the
1996 book ``The Case for Mars,'' isn't willing to wait.
	   In August, he and 700 others gathered at the University of
Colorado at Boulder to launch the Mars Society, an international
organization committed to getting humans to Mars by public or
private means.
	   ``Mars is, you might say, the New World,'' says Zubrin, drawing
analogies to Columbus and 1492. ``It's a planet that has on it all
the resources needed to support life and civilization, and we have
the capability of opening it up, and by so doing, opening up the
potential for a new chapter in human history.''
	   Retired NASA engineer Hickam says unless politicians and the
space agency set forth a plan and ante up the money, humans likely
will remain stuck in low-Earth orbit throughout the 21st century.
	   The best bet, he says, may be with commercial enterprises, the
``little Lindberghs'' aspiring to soar.
	   The X Prize Foundation looked to the late aviator Charles
Lindbergh for inspiration when in 1996 it offered a dlrs 10 million
reward to the first to build a three-seat rocketship and fly it
with at least one human on board to an altitude of 62 miles (100
kilometers) twice within two weeks.
	   Lindbergh started out as a barnstormer, after all. He also
understood that the dramatic feat of flying solo across the
Atlantic would drive home to Americans the commercial potential of
flight. And that's how the St. Louis-based, nonprofit foundation
views its 16 competing rocketeers.
	   Executive director Gregg Maryniak, who expects a winner in about
three years, says he hears again and again, ``The dlrs 10 million
is nice, but we'll make our real money when we hang our shingle out
and start giving rides.''
	   Figure to pay between dlrs 10,000 and dlrs 50,000 for five
minutes' worth of weightlessness, at least for the initial
suborbital flights, says Maryniak.
	   ``We have met the payload of the future,'' he says, ``and he is
us _ people.''
	   Fast forward now to 2034: Tourists flit in and out of space,
astronauts inhabit an outpost on or near Mars. Robots prowl for
planets around nearby stars.
	   Meanwhile, back on Earth, medicine's breakneck pace of progress
has continued undiminished into the new millennium. So it's not
science fiction to imagine that John Glenn is now 113 years old,
and itching to blast off again.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Washington's continued failure to pay its
bills will again threaten its vote in the General Assembly next
year and will lead to a backlash against enacting U.S.-demanded
reforms, the United Nations warned.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been outspoken in the past
week in criticizing the United States, said in a statement that the
U.S. Congress and administration had reneged on personal promises
to pay its bills this budget season.
	   ``Despite the extensive reforms we have undertaken ... the
Congress and the administration once again failed to honor
America's legal commitment and moral obligation to the United
Nations and its 184 other member states,'' Annan said Tuesday.
	   The United States is expected to pay the United Nations just
enough this year to reach the minimum it needs to preserve its vote
in the 185-member General Assembly. Congress is expected to vote on
a budget bill Tuesday and Wednesday that would authorize a dlrs 197
million payment that would bring the United States just over the
threshold.
	   But Congress failed to act on a separate spending bill
concerning the dlrs 1.3 million the United Nations says the United
States owes in back payments. Lawmakers have made payment
conditional on sweeping U.N. reforms that the United Nations says
have largely been implemented.
	   President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the arrears bill
because it contains a provision denying U.S. contributions to
international family-planning organizations that advocate abortion
rights.
	   In a related issue, Congress failed to allot any funding for the
U.N. Population Fund _ a decision that will mean ``the unnecessary
death and suffering of women who are deprived of the information
and means to plan their families,'' the agency's executive
director, Nafis Sadik said in a statement.
	   A senior U.N. official warned that the United States will have
to pay some of its arrears next year if it wants to retain its vote
in the General Assembly. U.N. bills for 1999 alone won't cover the
minimum payment the United States will have to make to keep the
vote, meaning it will have to pay off some of the arrears, the
official said.
	   A greater threat, though, was the deteriorating will among U.N.
member states to carry out the remainder of Congress-demanded
reforms without any assurances that the money will ever come
through, the official said. The member states had enacted widescale
reforms based on the assumption that Congress would pay the cash.
	   ``At this point, the continued failure to resolve this issue is
hurting the reform effort,'' the official said.
	   ``Further threats by Congress, if they were to emanate at this
point, would be entirely counterproductive and would produce a
backlash that would make the situation worse rather than better,''
the official said, speaking on condition he not be named.
	   The United States now accounts for two-thirds of the outstanding
U.N. arrears. The United Nations has managed to keep its operations
going by borrowing money from a separate peacekeeping fund once the
regular budget runs out, usually in September.
	   Money taken from the fund, however, has to be repaid to member
states. Those states, frustrated that Washington hasn't stood by
its end of the deal, could refuse to allow the United Nations to
continue borrowing money from the peacekeeping fund.
	   ``Where we stand today is that a large number of other member
states are underwriting the United States' dues in the United
Nations by agreeing to permit us to borrow from peacekeeping funds
that are really owed to them,'' the official said.
	   Annan has suggested asking the General Assembly to decide
whether it wants to continue the practice, but the issue hasn't
been placed on the assembly's agenda yet.

Cambodia slips further into crisis as political deadlock continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's July election was
anticipated as a turning point for the troubled country. But three
months later bickering parties have still not formed a government,
and the country is slipping deeper into crisis.
	   Aid donors' hands have been tied and investors have watched in
frustration as round after round of negotiations between Cambodian
leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition end in
stalemate, the head of a local think tank said.
	   With no compromise in sight, Kao Kim Hourn of the Cambodian
Institute for Cooperation and Peace worries the deadlock could drag
on into next year.
	   ``It would be lucky for Cambodia to have a government in place
by the end of November, but the situation right now doesn't read
like that. There are too many differences. It's going to be some
time before things work out,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen's party won a narrow majority in the election, and needs
the support of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party for the
two-thirds vote in parliament necessary to approve the next
government.
	   But Ranariddh and junior opposition party leader Sam Rainsy have
been reluctant to cooperate with Hun Sen. The two parties claim the
ruling party's victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation
and have demanded investigations of their allegations.
	   In the meantime, Cambodia's seat at the U.N. General Assembly
remains vacant and the country's admission into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations has been put on hold.
	   No government also means no new aid as donor countries further
delay the next meeting of the Consultative Group for Cambodia,
which provides hundreds of millions of dollars of much-needed
budgetary support to the government.
	   The last donor meeting was held in July 1997, a few days before
fighting broke out in Phnom Penh as Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a coup d'etat.
	   Cambodia's U.N. seat was declared vacant after the violent
government split and most aid donors delayed new programs or
suspended assistance altogether pending elections and a new
government.
	   Kao Kim Hourn said hopes for a Consultative Group meeting by the
end of the year are fading.
	   ``At the moment donors don't know who to deal with. Any
questions on aid must be put on hold for now,'' he said.
	   The effect of the deadlock on common Cambodians was highlighted
Monday by the chief of U.N. Development Program in Cambodia, who
warned that the continuing political instability combined with the
regional economic slowdown was eroding gains made in the battle
against poverty.
	   The combination of local political problems and a sputtering
regional economy has also stifled investment prospects in Cambodia,
according to Siam City Bank manager Chiraporn Sumetheeprasit, who
is supervising the closure of the Thai bank's branch in Phnom Penh.
	   Siam City's business volume decreased by two-thirds over the
past year, and with no turnaround in sight the bank decided to pull
the plug in Cambodia. Badly affected by Thailand's financial
crisis, it can ill afford to keep a marginal operation.
	   ``I hoped the amount of customers and investment confidence
would improve after the election, but our Thai customers are still
waiting for the new cabinet. Nobody knows what will happen,''
Sumetheeprasit said.
	   Kao Kim Hourn stressed that a stable political environment must
exist to attract investment, but because the next government is
expected to pair Hun Sen and Ranariddh in another coalition,
investors may wait a little longer to see if the bitter rivals can
work together peacefully.
	   ``No one is sure how stable that coalition can be,'' he said.

Life for Kosovo refugees better, but Milosevic holds back on full

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Life for refugees in the hills of
Kosovo is improving, Western officials say, though they'll probably
live in the outdoors for some time while Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic holds back on parts of a deal that would avert
airstrikes.
	   NATO's military chief, Gen. Wesley Clark warned Milosevic in
Belgrade late Tuesday that full compliance with an Oct. 12
agreement reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, was necessary
to avert the strikes.
	   U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic has still
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in
February when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Yet Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in
Washington that conditions were improving for tens of thousands of
refugees who fled into the hills and forests to escape the
fighting.
	   Bacon said about half the 50,000 to 70,000 refugees living
outdoors now have some sort of shelter.
	   Fighting between ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of
the 2 million inhabitants of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's
main republic, Serbia _ has forced around 300,000 people from their
homes.
	   A recent increase in violence has raised fears about the
agreement, under which Milosevic pledged to meet U.N. demands,
including to withdraw special police and army units, halt the
crackdown, allow international agencies to help refugees and resume
talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the province.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told reporters that
Clark would provide ``very specific information'' to the Yugoslav
leader about his failure to comply fully with the requirements of
the international community.
	   ``And he will be making very clear that NATO will use military
force against the Serbs if he doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.
	   Milosevic has also promised to allow a 2,000-member
international verification mission into Kosovo and allow NATO
surveillance flights.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the rebels issued a list of their
own demands, chief among them the withdrawal of government forces
from the province.
	   The rebels, in a statement to Albanian language media, also
demanded a halt to arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of
``political prisoners'' and an investigation by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands of ``crimes against humanity.''
.
	   Meanwhile, international efforts to aid refugees continues. As
winter approaches, officials fear a humanitarian disaster if the
estimated 300,000 people displaced by the fighting _ including
thousands still living outdoors _ are not allowed to return home.
	   Many fear they will be attacked if they return, while the houses
of others have been destroyed.

Return of the native: Sosa back in Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Greeted by a
crowd of thousands that included his country's president and Hall
of Famer Juan Marichal, Sammy Sosa finally returned home.
	   ``I feel very happy and honored that my people are on their
feet, waiting for me,'' said Sosa, in the Dominican Republic on
Tuesday for the first time since his 66-homer season.
	   ``To see that in the United States they applauded a Dominican
makes me happy and proud to be Dominican.''
	   On a day of national celebration, President Leonel Fernandez was
among the throng to cheer the Chicago Cubs slugger as he emerged
from a private jet at Santo Domingo's international airport.
	   ``After suffering the effects of Hurricane Georges, we know what
it felt like for the teams facing Sammy Sosa to feel the force of
Hurricane Sosa,'' Fernandez said.
	   Also in the receiving line on a rainy day was Marichal, the
great San Francisco Giants pitcher who is now the Dominican sports
minister.
	   Before Sosa arrived, cars with windshields painted ``Welcome
Sammy'' and ``Go Sammy!'' jammed the two-lane highway from the
capital to the airport. Thousands more fans took free bus rides to
welcome Sosa, who has become an idol like none this Caribbean
nation has known.
	   ``He scrapes, he gives his all, it's the Dominican style!''
gushed Maximo Sosa, a fan who is no relation to Sammy.
	   Since the season ended, Sosa received the keys to New York City,
threw a ceremonial first pitch in the World Series and raised money
for hurricane victims. In his homeland, he had a winter league
season named for him and will receive the nation's top medal.
	   At San Pedro de Macoris, Sosa's hometown, dozens of scooters
swarmed around the procession and Sosa stood through a sunroof,
ignoring a rain shower that soaked his shirt.
	   The decibel level rose when Sosa stopped outside his old barrio,
called the Jarro Sucio, or Dirty Jar, to make his trademark salute:
a thump of the chest and the two-fingered victory sign.
	   San Pedro's seaside boulevard was lined with palm trees before
Georges smashed them Sept. 22. Thousands lost their homes, and many
are still waiting for electricity and water.
	   Nationwide, the storm killed at least 283 people and left
100,000 homeless.
	   Sosa's final home runs became Dominicans' only cause for
celebration after the storm, even though Mark McGwire took the
crown with 70 homers.
	   San Pedro provincial Mayor Sergio Cedeno said Tuesday that Sosa
sent home three planeloads of food and medical supplies.
	   ``For being a humble person who has reached the hearts of many
people ... he's the best ambassador we could have to show the
disaster that has stricken us,'' Cedeno said.
	   The government also has diplomatic plans for Sosa. Fernandez
planned to name him a ``Roving Ambassador to the Glory of Sport''
when he presents him with the nation's highest honor, the Grand
Cross of the Order of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella, at a National
Palace ceremony Friday.
	   But Sosa's most precious gift to Dominicans was one that
couldn't be quantified.
	   ``Sammy is not someone for what he gives anyway,'' said
motorcycle taxi driver Luis Alex, who wears black batting gloves on
both hands, just as Sosa does.
	   ``He's someone we hold here inside,'' Alex signaled to his
heart, ``for what he gives as pride.''

Dye job for Qualcomm Stadium field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The grounds crew at Qualcomm Stadium spread
10,000 gallons (38,000 liters) of a vegetable dye called
``Wintergreen'' mixed with fertilizer on the field in an effort to
make it presentable for Game 3 Tuesday night.
	   It's the second time the field needed treatment during the
postseason.
	   Even with the cosmetic assist, the grass looked less than
suitable for a World Series. Right-center field had bare spots from
tractors dragged over it to move stands while converting the
stadium from baseball to football and back to baseball.
	   The Padres share the stadium with the National Football League's
San Diego Chargers, who had a home game last Sunday that chewed up
the field and created divots in the outfield.
	   ``It's not bad,'' San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``It's
going to be quick. It looks green. The dirt is green.''
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner wasn't impressed.
	   ``That thing is like a cow pasture,'' he said after walking the
field and complaining about divots.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FIRST PITCH: &LR;  Baseball honored the memory of the late Anaheim
Angels owner Gene Autry by having his widow, Jackie, throw out the
ceremonial first pitch for Game 3.
	   Autry died Oct. 2, three days after turning 91. He founded the
California Angels as an American League franchise in 1961. He sold
25 percent of the team, now renamed, to the Walt Disney Co. in
1996.
	   The Angels never won a pennant, a major disappointment for one
of the sport's biggest fans. Autry died one week after the Angels
were eliminated from the American League West playoff race by the
Texas Rangers.
	   Hall of Fame outfielder and San Diego native Ted Williams was
scheduled to throw out the first pitch, but plans fell through at
the last minute. Baseball officials did not immediately say what
the problem was.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LOCAL HERO: &LR;  The last time Shane Spencer was at a World Series
game in San Diego he sat in the upper deck in right field.
	   ``You couldn't even see the scoreboard,'' he said, recalling
Game 2 of the 1984 Series between the Padres and Detroit Tigers.
	   Spencer's view was much better Tuesday _ he started in left
field.
	   The rookie outfielder, who grew up in San Diego, was New York
manager Joe Torre's last-second selection to start for the Yankees.
Torre decided to use Spencer, a right-handed hitter, over Chad
Curtis, Chili Davis, Tim Raines and Ricky Ledee against lefty
Sterling Hitchcock.
	   Ledee, another rookie, is 4-for-6 in the Series so far.
	   ``I'm totally excited,'' Spencer said. ``I'm going to be a
little nervous during introductions, but after that I'll be fine.
I've already seen guys (in the stands) that I grew up with.''
	   Spencer became an instant celebrity in New York after hitting 10
home runs in just 27 games during the regular season, and then
homering twice as the Yankees swept Texas in the division series.
	   Spencer's a pretty popular guy here this week, but Torre
insisted before the game that didn't factor into his decision.
	   ``If you wouldn't have told me that yesterday I wouldn't have
known anything about it,'' said Torre, who on Monday told both
Raines and Spencer to be prepared to start. ``No, I did it strictly
on hopefully the ability of putting the right guy in left field.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IRABOOOOOO: &LR;  Hideki Irabu got to hear how disliked he is in San
Diego.
	   Irabu's refusal to sign with the Padres last year after they had
purchased his rights from a Japanese League team never sat well
with local fans, who didn't appreciate the Yankee pitcher's snub of
their team and city.
	   Introduced as a reserve before Game 3, Irabu was roundly booed
by the Qualcomm Stadium crowd. He doffed his cap as he jogged to
take his place on the third base line.
	   ``He was so adamant about that he didn't want to be a Padre,
that he didn't want anything to do with the Padres,'' San Diego
general manager Kevin Towers said.

Businessmen and conservatives reject Pinochet's arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By EVA VERGARA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, CHILE (AP) _Conservative lawmakers on Tuesday
protested the arrest in London of former dictator Augusto Pinochet
by boycotting congressional sessions while businessmen called for a
boycott of Spanish and British products.
	   The Production and Commerce Confederation, which is made up of
Chilean business leaders, issued a statement expressing a
``categorical and worrisome concern'' over Pinochet's arrest.
``This event is a clear violation of international law and affects
our national sovereignty.''
	   Confederation President Walter Riesco expressed his support for
Pinochet and the Chilean Army that the retired general commanded
for 25 years and backed the government protests against Great
Britain for violating Pinochet's diplomatic immunity.
	   At the same time, the conservative opposition increased its
protests on the streets and in Congress.
	   Opposition congressional members Evelyn Matthei and Pia Guzman
led an estimated 100 women at a protest near the British and
Spanish Embassies. They also called for a boycott of Spanish and
British consumer products.
	   Protesters hurled eggs, sticks and garbage at the two embassies,
despite police efforts to keep them away. Later Tuesday, police
used water cannons to break up a rally of at least 5,000 people
supporting Pinochet's arrest who shouted anti-Pinochet slogans.
	   Mayor Christian Labbe of Providencia, a Santiago suburb,
withdrew parking privileges for British and Spanish diplomats and
said the municipality would no longer collect their garbage. Labbe
is a retired army colonel. The municipality of Las Condes adopted
similar measures.
	   The conservative members of the Independent Democratic Union
decided Wednesday to boycott congressional sessions. Some of the
senators included former high ranking officers who served under
Pinochet. The party controls 50 out of 120 congressmen.
	   The protesting congressman held up posters that said ``Freedom
now- no to the official kidnapping.''

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Washington's continued failure to pay its
bills will again threaten its vote in the General Assembly next
year and will lead to a backlash against enacting U.S.-demanded
reforms, the United Nations warned.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been outspoken in the past
week in criticizing the United States, said in a statement that the
U.S. Congress and administration had reneged on personal promises
to pay its bills this budget season.
	   ``Despite the extensive reforms we have undertaken ... the
Congress and the administration once again failed to honor
America's legal commitment and moral obligation to the United
Nations and its 184 other member states,'' Annan said Tuesday.
	   The United States is expected to pay the United Nations just
enough this year to reach the minimum it needs to preserve its vote
in the 185-member General Assembly. Congress is expected to vote on
a budget bill Tuesday and Wednesday that would authorize a dlrs 197
million payment that would bring the United States just over the
threshold.
	   But Congress failed to act on a separate spending bill
concerning the dlrs 1.3 billion the United Nations says the United
States owes in back payments. Lawmakers have made payment
conditional on sweeping U.N. reforms that the United Nations says
have largely been implemented.
	   President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the arrears bill
because it contains a provision denying U.S. contributions to
international family-planning organizations that advocate abortion
rights.
	   In a related issue, Congress failed to allot any funding for the
U.N. Population Fund _ a decision that will mean ``the unnecessary
death and suffering of women who are deprived of the information
and means to plan their families,'' the agency's executive
director, Nafis Sadik said in a statement.
	   A senior U.N. official warned that the United States will have
to pay some of its arrears next year if it wants to retain its vote
in the General Assembly. U.N. bills for 1999 alone won't cover the
minimum payment the United States will have to make to keep the
vote, meaning it will have to pay off some of the arrears, the
official said.
	   A greater threat, though, was the deteriorating will among U.N.
member states to carry out the remainder of Congress-demanded
reforms without any assurances that the money will ever come
through, the official said. The member states had enacted widescale
reforms based on the assumption that Congress would pay the cash.
	   ``At this point, the continued failure to resolve this issue is
hurting the reform effort,'' the official said.
	   ``Further threats by Congress, if they were to emanate at this
point, would be entirely counterproductive and would produce a
backlash that would make the situation worse rather than better,''
the official said, speaking on condition he not be named.
	   The United States now accounts for two-thirds of the outstanding
U.N. arrears. The United Nations has managed to keep its operations
going by borrowing money from a separate peacekeeping fund once the
regular budget runs out, usually in September.
	   Money taken from the fund, however, has to be repaid to member
states. Those states, frustrated that Washington hasn't stood by
its end of the deal, could refuse to allow the United Nations to
continue borrowing money from the peacekeeping fund.
	   ``Where we stand today is that a large number of other member
states are underwriting the United States' dues in the United
Nations by agreeing to permit us to borrow from peacekeeping funds
that are really owed to them,'' the official said.
	   Annan has suggested asking the General Assembly to decide
whether it wants to continue the practice, but the issue hasn't
been placed on the assembly's agenda yet.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby chief John O'Neill
defended the Wallabies against a potential English backlash
Wednesday when he announced a touring team which will be missing up
to six test stars.
	   O'Neill angered his English counterparts earlier this year when
he slammed them for sending a weakened squad Down Under for their
Cook Cup match in Brisbane. His criticism seemed justified as
Australia ran in a then-world record 76-0 scoreline against the
understrength tourists. England then suffered further humiliation
in two tests against New Zealand and one against South Africa.
	   O'Neill admitted he expected some comment to be made about the
loss of many front-line players. Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Richard
Harry, Damian Smith and fringe player Stirling Mortlock were not
considered because of injuries while Tim Horan and Willie
Ofahengaue will also face pre-tour fitness tests.
	   Former Argentina prop Patricio Noriega was called up for his
first Wallaby tour after a three-year wait for a clearance, but he
too must overcome a fitness test on an elbow injury next week.
	   But O'Neill shrugged off comparisons to England's problems
earlier in the year, when it had several players injured and others
who needed a rest, saying, ``the circumstances are entirely
different.''
	   ``The England team that was here in June left behind 19 test
players, many of whom were left behind for reasons other than
injury reasons,'' O'Neill said Wednesday. ``What we're sending away
are our best 26 players _ the only players who are out are players
who have genuine injuries.
	   ``I'm sure England will be putting their best team on the field
at Twickenham, looking for revenge, but this is the best Australian
team available barring injury.''
	   The Wallabies leave on Nov. 11 with a warm-up match against
France A in Lille on Nov. 15 before tests against France in Paris
on Nov. 21 and England at Twickenham on Nov. 28.
	   Captain John Eales expects both tests to be difficult against
teams he expects to challenge for next year's World Cup trophy.
	   ``On form over the past few years I think France will be the
harder one, but England on their home soil will be very
difficult,'' Eales said.
	   ``England will have been very embarrassed by their tour here and
they'll send out a totally different team. It'll be totally
different _ unfortunately.''
	   Noriega got his chance to press early claims for the World Cup
when Harry succumbed to injury.
	   Coach Rod Macqueen, who used to coach Noriega at the ACT
Brumbies, said it gave the versatile prop a chance to learn about
the Wallaby setup.
	   ``He would admit that he hasn't had the best of seasons,'' said
Macqueen. ``But he has a very good work ethic and I'm sure he's
going to put every effort into remaining with the Wallabies.''
	   Australian squad: Andrew Blades, Tom Bowman, Matt Cockbain, Dan
Crowley, John Eales (captain), Manuel Edmonds, Owen Finegan,
Michael Foley, George Gregan, Nathan Grey, Mitch Hardy, Daniel
Herbert, Tim Horan (or Scott Staniforth), Phil Kearns, Toutai Kefu,
Stephen Larkham, Chris Latham, Jason Little, Patricio Noriega (or
Cameron Blades), Willie Ofahengaue (or Daniel Manu), Glenn Panoho,
Brett Robinson, Joe Roff, Chris Whitaker, John Welborn, David
Wilson.

British minister sees hope for solution to Mexican conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A senior British
diplomat says rebel willingness to meet with Mexican legislators
has created hope for efforts to solve the conflict in Chiapas
state.
	   The announcement ``opens hope for better conditions of
dialogue,'' Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd told reporters
Tuesday after a day of meetings in this city seized briefly by the
Zapatista National Liberation Army on Jan. 1, 1994.
	   But Lloyd said the conflict, stalled by a tense cease-fire since
mid-January 1994, is highly complicated.
	   The leader of leftist Zapatistas, Subcomandante Marcos, said in
a communique this month that he is willing to re-establish talks
with a congressional mediation commission after avoiding any such
contact for more than a year.
	   Peace talks with the government itself broke down more than two
years ago, and each side has accused the other of bad faith.
Repeated clashes between pro-government and pro-rebel groups have
aggravated the situation.
	   Lloyd said Britain's experience in moving toward peace in
Northern Ireland shows ``that the only path to a solution of
conflicts is that there is a true will by the parties.''
	   He said Britain was willing to play a role in a solution in
Chiapas, but _ perhaps mindful of Mexico's rejection of foreign
involvement _ added, ``We do not come to impose nor to propose a
solution in Chiapas.''
	   ``We know that a solution cannot be imposed from outside. The
responses to the conflict must come from the situation of Mexico
itself.''
	   Meanwhile, another European visitor took a stance more critical
of the government.
	   Willy Meyer, a deputy of Spain's Communist-led United Left
coalition, complained that neither the government nor Mexico's
legislature had given figures on the number of troops in the
conflict zone.
	   Rebels have demanded a pullback of troops in the area.
	   Meyer is part of a Spanish observer delegation visiting
Zapatista communities.

Japanese stocks surge, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar
and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices surged Wednesday morning on
optimism that Japan's troubled banks were moving closer to seeking
public money to boost their depleted capital. The U.S. dollar was
higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues jumped
470.70 points, or 3.41 percent, to finish the morning session at
14,278.75. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had gained 240.85 points, or 1.78
percent, its highest level since Oct. 7.
	   It was the first time the Nikkei had traded above 14,000 points
since Sept. 28.
	   The rise came on the heels of reported comments by Industrial
Bank of Japan President Masao Nishimura, who was quoted by the
Nihon Keizai newspaper as saying that his bank would apply for
public funds under a government plan. IBJ is the first bank to say
it will seek public money.
	   ``The move will lead to more financial stability and is raising
hopes that banks will ease their restrictive lending policies,
alleviating the credit crunch,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Earlier this month, Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing the
government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in
taxpayer money into the cash-strapped financial system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section added 33.30 points, or 3.19 percent, to 1,076.32. It
had risen 20.10 points, or 1.97 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
39.40 points, or about 0.5 percent, to close at 8,505.85. It was
the Dow's first close above 8,500 since late August.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 116.00 yen in
midday trading, up 0.86 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but lower
than its level of 116.83 yen in late New York trading overnight.
	   Traders said that steady dollar-buying by Japanese institutional
investors was preventing a further drop in the U.S. currency.
	   The yen, meanwhile, was supported by the IBJ president's
comments on public funds, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.860 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.815 percent,
driving its price down to 108.37 from 108.82 yen.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nations attending a conference on African
development adopted a resolution Wednesday promising to try to
halve the number of Africans living in poverty by 2015 through
increased foreign investment, better education and democratic
governments.
	   The Tokyo Agenda for Action was passed on the closing day of the
three-day conference here, which gathered 82 countries and 40
organizations. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi were among the participants.
	   ``Democracy and good governance, as well as peace and security,
are essential to socioeconomic development in Africa,'' the
agreement said. ``Violent conflicts in a number of countries
constitute a major obstacle to sustainable development in Africa.''
	   The Agenda for Action also stressed a commitment to integrating
Africa into the global economy and encouraging market-driven
economics there.
	   It reaffirmed the need for development in Africa, whose share of
world trade totals less than 2 percent. Africa only gets 2 percent
of the total foreign direct investment to developing countries.
	   Those taking part in the conference agreed that African nations
should increase spending on education, so that by 2005, at least 80
percent of children complete primary education.
	   Better health care is also needed, with ``the burden of
disease'' heavy from malaria, polio and AIDS, the agreement said.
Of the 31 million adults and children living with HIV or AIDS
worldwide, 21 million live in Africa, it said.
	   The conference, which follows one held five years ago in Tokyo,
also discussed the need for agricultural development, regional
cooperation and equality for African women.
	   At the opening of the conference Monday, Obuchi promised
continued aid to Africa, despite Japan's lagging economy.
	   The event, jointly sponsored by the Japanese government, the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries, closes
with a ceremony later in the day.

Rangers edge Oilers for first win

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mathieu Schneider's power-play goal 8:38 into
the third period gave New York a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton
Oilers Tuesday night as the Rangers avoided matching their worst
start in 40 years.
	   Schneider's tiebreaking goal helped the Rangers stop a five-game
winless streak (0-4-1), one shy of their six-game spin (0-2-4) to
start the 1958-59 National Hockey League season.
	   Manny Malhotra and Brian Leetch also scored for the Rangers. The
Oilers got goals from Bill Guerin and Josef Beranek.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Canucks 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Keith Primeau scored his third
goal in four games and Arturs Irbe beat his former team as the
Carolina Hurricanes downed Vancouver to run their home unbeaten
streak to four straight, including three ties.
	   Irbe, who faced 18 shots by the Canucks, lost his shutout 3:02
into the final period on a deflection by rookie Bill Muckalt, who
scored his first NHL goal.
	   Primeau, who also assisted on Ray Sheppard's goal to open the
scoring, tallied his third goal of the season 1:56 into the second
period on the power play. Sami Kapanen also scored in the second
period as the Hurricanes built a 3-0 lead.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Sharks 1
	   In Philadelphia, Eric Lindros and Rod Brind'Amour each had a
goal and an assist as unbeaten Philadelphia defeated the winless
San Jose Sharks.
	   A goal by the Flyers' Colin Forbes broke a 1-1 tie at 3:20 of
the third period. Lindros put the game away with a wrist shot from
the right circle at 15:48.
	   Brind'Amour and the Sharks' Jeff Friesen traded power-play goals
in the second period of a game dominated for the most part by
excellent goaltending and tenacious defense.

Five survive small plane crash in Australia's remote north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Five people staggered ashore
unscathed Wednesday after their small aircraft plunged into the sea
off Horn Island in Torres Strait, north of Australia.
	   Police said the twin-engined aircraft with a pilot and four
passengers aboard was on a flight between Boigu and Saibai islands
north of Cape York.
	   It appeared that both engines failed shortly before reaching
Horn Island, a police spokesman said, on condition of anonymity.
	   All on board managed to escape with only minor injuries and made
it ashore on Horn Island, he said.
	   Police and a rescue helicopter were called to the accident
shortly before 10 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).

Japan's trade surplus rises in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with analyst and ministry official comment,
details, other background; no pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 45.6
percent in September for the 18th straight month of increase, the
government said Wednesday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 1.548 trillion yen (dlrs 13.3 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus is measured as goods pass customs but before
adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
also continued to climb, rising 41.4 percent to 731.05 billion yen
(dlrs 6.30 billion). It was the 24th straight month of increase.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan increasingly relies
on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The weak
domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.
	   Analysts said the recent fall of the dollar against the yen,
which tends to make Japanese exports more expensive overseas, will
prevent a further surge in exports in the long run.
	   The dollar has been trading at about 115 yen recently, down from
about 135 yen a month ago.
	   ``The trend in September was exactly the same as it has been:
tumbling imports widened the surplus,'' said Akio Yoshino, director
of Credit Suisse Asset Management.
	   Yoshino said the stronger yen and the U.S. economic slowdown may
put an end to that trend next year.
	   The ministry said that overall exports were boosted by a 9.6
percent rise in automobile exports, a 49.1 percent jump in ship
exports and a 16.4 percent increase in engine exports.
	   Imports were hurt by a 27.8 percent decline in oil imports, a
32.5 percent plunge in wood imports and a 37.1 percent tumble in
oil products, it said.
	   A ministry official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said Japan's surplus was likely to grow in the short
run. But he said the pace would likely slow as government efforts
to stimulate the economy gradually take effect.
	   Also Wednesday, the ministry announced that Japan's unadjusted
trade surplus for the first six months of the fiscal year stood at
7.411 trillion yen (dlrs 63.9 billion), up 44.7 percent from a year
earlier.
	   It was the third straight year the surplus grew in the
April-September period. Japan's fiscal year begins April 1.
	   The official said that Asia's economic turmoil tended to push
exports down but that continued strength in the U.S. and European
economies boosted overall exports.
	   The fiscal first half surplus with the United States rose 41.3
percent to 3.424 trillion yen (dlrs 29.5 billion).

Religions must use moral force to protect planet from disaster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ For three years, more than 1,000 scholars,
believers and activists explored what 10 of the world's major
religions can do to help save the world from environmental
destruction.
	   Their conclusion announced Tuesday: Religions must use their
moral force to end mankind's unrestrained exploitation of nature's
resources and instill a collective responsibility toward
environmental preservation. Religious leaders must work with
scientists, economists, educators and public policy makers toward
these goals.
	   ``We are in a moment of crisis _ recognizing the environment is
in danger and we as humans may even be endangered,'' said Mary
Evelyn Tucker, a professor of religion at Bucknell University in
Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, who helped conceive and coordinate the
Harvard Project on Religion and Ecology.
	   The project, a wide-ranging series of conferences which started
in 1996, explored the relationship between the environment and 10
major religious traditions _ Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism,
Hinduism, indigenous traditions, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Shinto
and Taoism.
	   ``I believe we can call this project the first geological survey
of the world's religions, taking geology in its root meaning to
understand what religions are saying about the earth,'' said
Lawrence Sullivan, director of the Harvard University Center for
the Study of World Religions which hosted the project.
	   At a news conference at the United Nations, organizers said many
religions already draw on nature's resources to meet environmental
challenges. Indigenous peoples still transmit sophisticated
environmental knowledge of local ecosystems, and other religious
groups are involved in reforestation projects, river clean-ups and
recycling programs.
	   However, it was the underlying religious values that the project
saw as crucial in helping to solve environmental problems.
	   ``What distinguishes human beings from the rest of nature at
least as we know it is that we do have a spiritual, moral and
ethical dimension,'' said Maurice Strong, a senior advisor on
environmental issues to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   But as the millennium approaches, he said the world is driven by
selfish economic ambitions.
	   ``I do not believe that our civilization will in fact make it
through the next century unless ... our economic and security and
political life is driven by, motivated by, and in the service of
our highest moral and spiritual instincts and values,'' Strong
said.
	   Tim Wirth, president of the U.N. Foundation and former U.S.
undersecretary of state for global affairs, lamented that since the
Earth Summit in 1992, ``the world's interest in the environment has
regressed, and been overtaken by economics-only goals.''
	   ``People in the world know that something is profoundly wrong.
The way in which we have exercised our responsibility as stewards
of God's creation ... has not been very profound,'' he said.
``We're heading for the cliffs. We're heading right off the edge.''
	   Michael McElroy, an expert on global warming who heads Harvard's
Committee on the Environment, noted that the earth is almost 5
billion years old _ and the human species is only 150,000 years old
but it has developed the capability to change the environment
globally.
	   ``We're doing it without any really sense of what the
consequences are,'' he said. ``We need to appreciate the fact that
the changes that are taking place on earth are changes that are the
result of our consumer habits.''
	   He called for a switch in focus from individual rights to
communal responsibility and ``a more global view of our
responsibility.''
	   Conference organizers announced the creation of an ongoing Forum
on Religion and Ecology to foster a religious voice in developing
public policy, educational curricula, economic planning and
scientific and social research related to the environment.
	   Professor Tu Weiming, director of the Harvard-Yenching
Institute, which will help organize the new forum, said the primary
concern is future generations.
	   ``We want, especially in America, to encourage our young people
not to be obsessed with the kind of narcissistic, hedonistic,
individualistic mind-set, but to become concerned about the public
sphere, to have a sense of hope,'' he said.
	   Tu quoted an African proverb, which he said eloquently captures
the forum's spirit: ``The earth is not ours. It is a treasure we
hold in trust for future generations.''

Kia's former head sentenced to seven years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A former head of bankrupt Kia Motors
Co. was sentenced to seven years in prison Wednesday for embezzling
52.3 billion won (dlrs 37 million) in company funds.
	   Kim Sun-hong, 66, who headed Kia until last October, was found
guilty of using the money to bribe government officials,
politicians and bankers to get preferential bank loans to keep his
company afloat.
	   Kim also was convicted of illegally arranging for Kia to lend
1.1 trillion won (dlrs 814 million) to several troubled
subsidiaries and guaranteeing 2.8 trillion won (dlrs 2 billion) in
debt incurred by other units.
	   Prosecutors had sought a 12-year sentence for Kim.
	   Two other former Kia executives were given prison terms of up to
3 1/2 years for their part in the scandal. Two more were given
suspended terms.
	   ``The defendants ... deceived stockholders and weakened
financial institutions,'' judge Sohn Ji-yeol of the Seoul Criminal
Court said.
	   Kia collapsed under 11.7 trillion won (dlrs 8.4 billion) in debt
in the summer of last year. Its failure eroded foreign investor
confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.
	   South Korea was forced to accept dlrs 58 billion from the
International Monetary Fund in December to bail out its faltering
economy.
	   Kia, once the nation's second largest automaker, was sold to
industry leader Hyundai Motors Co. in an auction on Monday.

Thousands evacuated, electricity cut as typhoon nears Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials cut electrical supplies and
evacuated thousands of people from coastal villages Wednesday as
Typhoon Babs began battering the central Philippines.
	   Disaster official Jason Aragon said maximum storm warnings were
issued in eastern Bicol province, where residents of low-lying
villages were ordered to evacuate.
	   Power officials cut electricity to Catanduanes island and
portions of Albay province to prevent accidental electrocutions, he
said.
	   Babs continued to intensify as it approached Catanduanes,
packing winds of up to 235 kph (147 mph), weather forecaster Susan
Dampog said.
	   Dampog said Babs, the ninth storm to hit the country this
season, was expected to hit near Catanduanes either late Wednesday
or early Thursday.
	   In Manila, military rescue units, including air force
helicopters and navy vessels, were on standby.
	   Another typhoon, Zeb, struck the northern Philippines last week,
leaving at least 74 people dead, 129 injured and 37 missing. About
415,000 people fled their homes at the height of the typhoon.
	   Zeb also destroyed 10,113 houses, damaged 33,235 others and
damaged at least 3.4 billion pesos (U.S. dollars 80 million) worth
of crops and infrastructure, disaster officials said.
	   After hitting the Philippines, Zeb skirted Taiwan, killing 31
people and injuring 19. It then cut across Japan, where it killed
at least 12 people.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ A change of scenery didn't change a thing for
the San Diego Padres.
	   Scott Brosius made sure of it.
	   Brosius hit his second homer of the game, a stunning three-run
shot off relief ace Trevor Hoffman in the eighth inning, and the
New York Yankees moved within one win of a World Series sweep with
a 5-4 victory in Game 3 Tuesday night.
	   Out of the Bronx and inside a ballpark that serves up fish
tacos, palm trees and beach balls, the Yankees are looking for
their first sweep since 1950.
	   No team in baseball history has overcome an 0-3 deficit in the
postseason, and now the Padres must try to do it against a club
trying to cement its place as the best ever. Andy Pettitte will
start for the Yankees in Game 4 Wednesday night, most likely
against Kevin Brown.
	   On a night when everything seemed to be going right for San
Diego _ great plays, clutch pitching by Sterling Hitchcock and key
hits from Tony Gwynn _ Brosius and the Yankees ruined it.
	   Hitless for five innings against David Cone, the Padres took a
3-0 lead in the sixth on a burst started by Hitchcock's unlikely
single.
	   Yet with 64,667 crazed fans roaring and the cranked-up rock
music blaring, these Yankees would not break.
	   Brosius led off the seventh with a home run against Hitchcock,
Most Valuable Player of the National League championship and a
member of the Yankees' rotation with Cone in 1995. New York closed
to 3-2, but shortstop Chris Gomez made an eye-popping catch to
start an inning-ending double play.
	   But in the eighth, there was no one left to save the Padres.
	   Slumping Paul O'Neill drew a leadoff walk from Randy Myers _
once again, the Yankees' patience at the plate paid off _ and then
manager Bruce Bochy made an early call to the bullpen.
	   It was Trevor Time, and Hoffman walked in as AC/DC's ``Hell's
Bells'' sent the crowd into a frenzy. Hoffman had been successful
on 53 of 54 save chances during the regular season, though a blown
chance in the NLCS against Atlanta perhaps was a bad omen.
	   Hoffman wound up with the loss while Ramiro Mendoza won in
relief. Mariano Rivera held on for a save, working around a pair of
two-out singles by Carlos Hernandez and pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney
by striking out Andy Sheets with runners at the corners for the
last out.
	   After O'Neal's walk in the eighth, Bernie Williams came close to
putting the Yankees ahead, hitting a fly ball that Gwynn caught on
the warning track in right. Tino Martinez followed with a walk and
then Brosius, moved up to sixth in the batting order because the
Yankees played without a Designated Hitter, homered to center for a
5-3 lead.
	   Hoffman had not worked in five days, his longest idle period of
the season, and clearly was not effective. He gave up another hit
in the eighth before ending the inning.
	   The Padres tried to rally in the bottom half, with a double by
Quilvio Veras, a single by Gwynn and a sacrifice fly by Ken
Caminiti closing the gap to a run.
	   Rivera made it interesting in the ninth before holding on, doing
the job that Hoffman could not.
	   Twilight seemed to take its toll on the hitters. With the game
starting early, neither team had a hit through three innings, the
first time that had happened in the Series since 1965, when Sandy
Koufax of Los Angeles and Mudcat Grant of Minnesota did it in Game
2.
	   Cone became the first pitcher to take a no-hit bid into the
sixth since Atlanta's Tom Glavine in Game 6 of 1995. Hitchcock, a
career .120 hitter, broke it up with a single.
	   After a walk to Veras, Gwynn singled hard to right field.
O'Neill retrieved the ball but made a wild throw across the diamond
that went into the Yankees dugout for a two-base error that allowed
another run to score. Ken Caminiti's sacrifice fly made it 3-0.
	   Caminiti gave it back in the seventh, though, when his error
gave the Yankees a run.
