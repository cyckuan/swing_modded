<HEADLINE> Genetic Variation Speeds AIDS Progression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from U.S.
National Institutes of Health have discovered that some variations
of genes said to be able to slow the progression of AIDS, actually
accelerate the disease, says a study published in the latest issue
of Science.
</P>
<P>
Researchers previously found four genes--CCR5, SDF, CCR5P and
CCR2-- could slow the progression of HIV by preventing the virus
from invading cells. But further study suggests that each of these
genes has variations that actually accelerate the disease.
</P>
<P>
They found that about 10 percent to 15 percent of all HIV
patients progress rapidly to AIDS, an advanced stage of HIV
infection. Of these people, 10 percent to 17 percent have two
copies of the CCR5P1 gene variation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. researchers hope to discover all the gene variations
involved in both the rapid acceleration of HIV and in the slow
progress of the disease, because this will help in the design
and testing of vaccines.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Want More Private Elements in Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Most Canadians believe their
country's medicare system needs substantial changes to allow for
more private elements, shows a survey by Toronto-based Pollara.
</P>
<P>
The survey interviewed more than 3,000 people, including 1,000
medicare workers and patient right advocates.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of those surveyed felt that they should be
permitted by law to dip into their own pocket for "upgraded"
treatment while 61 percent hold that the medicare's universality
should not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
Supports for larger private elements in the medicare system are
coming mainly from young adults under the age of 34, the survey
shows.
</P>
<P>
Canadians still think Canada's medicare system is the country's
defining character.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that Canadians, while supporting the current
system, understand that they can no longer rely completely on the
government to meet all their medical needs, said Jim Saunders,
president of the Health Resources Group Inc..

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said Saturday that college education in the country calls for
reform to solve the shortage of funds, a problem faced by most
government-funded universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Students should pay for their college education and this is not
in contradiction with the principle of social fairness, Kuchma
said in his speech at a university in southeast Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma promised that the government will continue to provide
funds for college education even if the country's high-level
education completes the transition from a government monopoly to a
multi-channel funding frame.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for examing the teaching quality of
private universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine now has 660 universities and colleges with 520,000
students enrolled, among whom are 400,000 full-time students.
</P>
<P>
Some universities have already started to collect tuition fees
from students.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Cabinet Works on Policy Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The newly formed Lebanese
cabinet Saturday convened its first meeting to draft a policy
statement on the basis of which the cabinet is expected to obtain
a vote of confidence in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government under the newly-elected President Emile Lahoud
was formally announced by Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member cabinet was made up of politicians and
technocrats, only two of whom worked in the previous government
headed by Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hoss told a news conference that the policy his government
will adopt should be in line with Lahoud's speech at his
oath-taking ceremony in parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
The speech promised a campaign to eliminate corruption and
waste of public funds, charges faced by the former Hariri
government.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud also called for an economic austerity and
belt-tightening policy to gradually trim the ballooning budget
deficit, targeted at 42 percent of expenditures by the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The statement will be drafted as soon as possible and be
submitted to the parliament for a confidence vote next week.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's Constitution, a new government can not take
office until the parliament approves its policy statement.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say the new team is most likely to win the
vote, and so to take office, as 95 lawmakers told the
president this week that they will support the Hoss-led
government.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the statement ready before next Saturday,
a ministerial committee charged with formulating the statement
was set up and held its first meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, 69, a veteran politician and economist, was designated
as prime minister Wednesday to replace Hariri who refused to
remain in office after his six-year term under the previous
President Elias Hrawi.

<HEADLINE> Local Government Election Ends in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) --Poll in Nigeria's local
government election, the first of a series of elections under
the military government's transition to civil rule program, ended
peacefully Saturday Afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Investigation by Xinhua reporters show that there was a much
larger turn-out of voters in Lagos than in previous elections
held under the scraped transition program of late leader General
Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
In the densely-populated Lagos Island, long queues were seen
in virtually all the polling stations with many of them being
more than 100 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Fewer stations and voters were seen in high-browed communities
on the Ikoyi and Victoria islands, but the atmosphere was
generally peaceful and orderly everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar Saturday
joined milllions of Nigerians to vote in the local government
election in capital Abuja, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly before his voting, Abubakar said: "The
turnout is impressive and from what I have seen so far, the
elections will be successful."
</P>
<P>
The head of state reiterated his appeal to politicians to make
a success of the teransition program by playing the game
according to the rules.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar had earlier gone round some polling centers in the
capital and expressed happiness at the turnout in all the areas
visited.
</P>
<P>
Observers blieve that the high turn-out is a reflection of
confidence in the new democratization program of General
Abubakar, who has won wide support both at home and abroad for
his bold national reconciliation efforts
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged businessman said that Abubakar has done more in
his six months in power than what the previous leaders had done
in a 10 years time.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos City has been very quiet during the voting time from
early morning to 2:30 pm, as the authorities have imposed a
traffic ban.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election will produce 774 local government chairmen
from 6,996 chairmanship candidates and 8,870 councilors from
79,830 councillorship candidates.
</P>
<P>
According to the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), a
total of 355,077 officials were employed to work at the 111,430
polling stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
INEC also said that it distributed 60 million voters' cards
during the voters' registration exercise in October.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election will determine the fate of the country's
nine temporarily registered political parties, as the INEC said
only those securing five percent of the total votes cast in each
of at least 24 out of the 36 states and Federal Capital Territy
will be finally registered.
</P>
<P>
Only those parties qualified to be finally registered in the
local government election will be allowed to contend for the
state governors legislators' elections in next January and the
presidential election in February.
</P>
<P>
A civilian goverment, the first since 1983, will take over
from the military government on May 29, 1999, according to
Nigeria's transition program.

live on Saturday, Yakushkin said that he had seen the president at
the Central Clinical Hospital where he is undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is receiving a lot of documents and monitoring the
press for reports about the situation in the country and abroad.
He studies "a whole file of newspapers" daily, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
The president does not think about his early resignation, the
spokesman said, adding that the head of state "is watching very
closely sharp or insulting statements concerning his actions made
by some politicians."
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin noted that Yeltsin is in full control of Russia's
nuclear policy. The small nuclear device is in his hands.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there is no question of lifting the
moratorium on death penalty in Russia, citing that many countries
are now considering banning or introducing death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Mission Accused of Not Being Neutral in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Somali main faction leaders
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid Saturday accused an
international mission of not being neutral in Somalia's political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference in south Mogadishu late Saturday
afternoon, the two co-chairmen of the disputed Mogadishu
Administration ordered the international fact finding mission not
to come to Somali capital after they failed to meet the security
arrangements of the administration.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has been touring Somalia in the past five days.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of 23 members from the regional and
international organizations including the Arab League and the
United Nations, and Egyptian and Italian ambassadors to Somalia
Saturday landed at El-Ahmed airstrip of Merca town, 100
kilometers south of Mogadishu, instead of landing in the capital
as previously scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the faction leaders have ordered the
delegation to leave Merca town as soon as possible, claiming that
it has humiliated the Mogadishu administration by refusing the
reception arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi Mohamed accused the head of the delegation, an Ethiopian
national called Immanuel (only first name available), of
misguiding his team allegedly for the sole purpose of creating
mistrust among the Mogadishu's administration and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was reportedly seeking the possible ways of
ending the long-standing political crisis in Somalia by
consulting the rival politicians, businessmen and the rival
traditional leaders in the war-torn African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Lady Janet
Museveni has called on the government to put up more specialized
schools for the deaf and urged parents with deaf children to let
them go to school like all other children.
</P>
<P>
She made the call when speaking at a function here Saturday to
mark the silver jubilee celebrations of the Uganda National
Association for the Deaf (UNAD), according to a press release
from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the presidential office said the
first lady was glad that deaf people have registered for
Universal Primary Education and commended the UNAD for this
achievement. She said Uganda is the first country in the world
to have sign language in its national constitution.
</P>
<P>
The UNAD has become a crucial voice for the hitherto voiceless
section of the society and this has enabled government and other
associations to help deaf people more effectively, she asserted.
</P>
<P>
The UNAD was also hailed for uiting its members and their
families by forming branches in all regions of Uganda as well as
playing the significant role of changing the attitude of society
at large towards the deaf through various programs.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ndeezi, the UNAD chairman, said the his organization has
gone a long way to ensure the rights of people with disabilities
and that there is still need for more cooperation from the
society so that people with disabilities get total recognition
and respect.
</P>
<P>
The function was attended by ministers, MPs and a delegation
from the Danish Deaf Association.

<HEADLINE> Western Desert Key to Egypt's Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi
el-Banbi said on Saturday that the oil and gas fields in Egypt's
Western Desert are playing a key role in the country's energy
production.
</P>
<P>
Oil production in the Western Desert stands at 130,000 barrels
a day, accounting for about 16 percent of Egypt's total oil
production a day, el-Banbi said at the end of a visit to the area.
</P>
<P>
The gas fields in the area produce 400 million cubic meters a
day, an amount which accounts for 30 percent of the total gas
production each day in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the high production of oil and gas in
the Western Desert to intensified prospection. He said oil
prospection has so far covered 50 percent of the Western Desert,
which accounts for about half of Egypt's area of 1 million square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a proven oil reserve of 2.9 billion barrels and
produces 830,000 barrels a day. Its oil prospection and production
is mainly carried out in the Western Desert, the Gulf of Suez, the
Nile Delta and the Mediterranean Sea.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Comprehensive Nuclear Disarmament Is  No Easy Task  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly session Friday adopted 49 resolutions on international
disarmament, first of its kind okayed by the current Assembly
session after the world was shocked to see mushroom clouds in
South Asia last May.
</P>
<P>
There are four resolutions on nuclear disarmament and a fifth
one especially targeted at the nuclear tests in South Asia,
U.N.-based diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that these resolutions, brought into being
following the five-week general debate in the First Committee, are
expected to have most direct impact on the upcoming session of the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the single multilateral
disarmament negotiating forum, and preparations for the review of
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly decided in 1995 to indefinitely extend the
NPT, and the treaty will be reviewed every five years.
</P>
<P>
During the general debate at the First Committee, a major
General Assembly body in charge of disarmament and international
security matters, delegations from various countries have been
focusing their discussion on the nuclear disarmament, described by
authoritative U.N. sources as the most concerned and divisive
issue.
</P>
<P>
Complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons is the common aspiration of mankind. However, it is really
no easy task to achieve the much-cherished dream.
</P>
<P>
First, the Cold War mentality dies hard although the Cold War
is over. The nuclear tests in South Asia is just a case in point.
People are concerned that instead of dissolving with the end of
the Cold War, some military blocs and alliances established in
that era are constantly expanding and gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
A few countries, backed up by their economic and technological
superiority, are intensifying their efforts to develop
sophisticated weapons which undermine global strategic balance and
stability, and they are frequently resorting to the use or threat
of use of force in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Such practice, seen as seeking one's own security at the cost
of that of others, is detrimental to the further relaxation of
international situation, will have negative influence on
international arms control and disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the United States and Russia, the two nuclear
superpowers in the world, are tending to have more reliance on
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Washington, in a bid to maintain its so-called
leadership in the world and safeguard its overseas interests,
prefer negative security assurance to non-nuclear-weapon
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Russian Duma, out of concerns over
NATO's eastward expansion, are yet to ratify the 1993 Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START II).
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, Washington and Moscow have long failed
to implement their existing bilateral agreements on nuclear
disarmament at an early date, and further drastically reduce their
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it will not only impose positive impact on
international peace and security, but also create favorable
conditions for other nuclear-weapon states to participate in the
nuclear disarmament process as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, some country, in disregard of the strong opposition of
the international community, used the slow progress in nuclear
disarmament as an excuse to conduct nuclear tests in an attempt to
gain regional hegemony and the so-called big power status.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests by India in May this year were nothing but an
outrageous contempt for and a heavy blow to the widely supported
international nuclear non-proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, there is a wide gap between the developing
world and Western nuclear-weapon countries in the field of nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Non-aligned Movement (NAM) countries called for full and
thorough nuclear disarmament and the early convocation of the
Fourth Special Session on Disarmament (SSOD IV). Due to strong
opposition from the United States, the SSOD IV now turns out to be
a remote thing.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report to the 54rd General Assembly session in
last September, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that
disarmament comes between peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Now that the international situation is moving toward
relaxation, a country should channel its limited resources to
economic and social development, so as to benefit its own people
and at the same time, provide guarantee for national security and
that of the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Apart from formulating treaties, the work of international arms
control and disarmament also includes pains-taking efforts to
carry out treaties. In short, implementation is not only part and
parcel of this work, but also its ultimate objective.
</P>
<P>
It is noted with regret that some treaties are still far from
being universal, and that while having acceded to the treaties,
certain big powers are using various excuses to evade their treaty
obligations. This, in reality, has seriously compromised the
effect of the treaties.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the international community should attach great
importance to and strive to overcome difficulties and facilitate
the implementation of existing international arms control and
disarmament treaties so that they will be able to play their due
role in promoting the process of international arms control and
disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Fisherman Wounded by Israeli Warship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese fisherman was
wounded Saturday in an attack by an Israeli warship off Lebanon's
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Sukmani, 26, received an injury in his right hand when
his fishing boat "Faatima" was hit by heavy shots fired from an
Israeli warship near the coastal city of Tyre, about 70 kilometers
south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Sukmani was rushed to a hospital in
the city for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attack was believed to be a retaliation for an
earlier Hezbollah attack against an Israeli post inside its
occupied border zone in south Lebanon. One Israeli soldier was
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 23 Israeli soldiers
have been killed inside the enclave, which Israel declared in 1985
as a security zone to protect its north from cross-border attacks
by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In another development in the day, Israeli warplanes blasted
villages and moutainous areas in the western and central sector
of the security zone. The Israel side believed the areas are
hideouts for Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of casualties, but the air raids
have caused damages on several Lebanese civilians houses and
cars.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, reportedly backed by Iran and
Syria, has been waging a guerrilla war to dislodge
1,000 Israeli occupying troops and its proxy South Lebanon
Army from the country.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Calls for Isolating Savimbi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos said here Saturday that the only way to achieve
lasting peace in the country is to isolate Jonas Savimbi and his
UNITA military group.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 4th National Congress of the
ruling People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), Dos Santos
who is also MPLA Chairman said that Savimbi, leader of the
opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) should be isolated politically and militarily because he
is a man bending to kill, sabotage and split.
</P>
<P>
He noted that even the patriotic UNITA members agree to the
decision to isolate Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi and his followers have become agents of foreign
interests and "have been used in ruling the Angolan people and
continuing to exploit the wealth there," said Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president called upon the MPLA to mobilize all the
Angolans to fight the enemies against the peace and those agents
of foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the congress, MPLA General Secretary
Lopo do Nascimento complained that the United Nations has not
done enough in Angola peace process.
</P>
<P>
Do Nascimento pointed out that as the UNITA repeatedly
contravened the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, the U.N., ignoring
the will of the Angolan people, put pressure on the Angolan
government to resume dialog with the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the stance of the Angolan government is firm:
abandoning "war criminal" Savimbi and seeking for peace with the
sole lawful dialogist UNITA Renovation Commission.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA national congress is scheduled to end on December 10.
At the meeting, 1,275 delegates form 18 provinces across the
country will discuss about the current situation and economic
reform program in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The MPLA has been ruling the country since Angola won its
independence in 1975. Now, the party has nearly one million
members under its banner.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The fertility rate in Zambia
declined from 6.5 children per woman in late 1980s to 6.1 in
1996, according to a report released Saturday by the Central
Statistical Office of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The report says that despite the decline, the fertility rate
of Zambian women remains one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa
as surveys in its neighboring countries show very low fertility
rates in comparison with Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate is 4.9 in Botswana, 5.4 in Namibia, 5.8 in
Tanzania and 4.3 in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The fertility of urban Zambian women is much lower than their
counterpart in the rural areas with a urban woman giving birth to
5.1 children and a rural woman 6.9 ones on average, says the
report.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the women who have received secondary education
have the lowest level of fertility at 4.5 compared with a rate of
6.8 children per woman with no education.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, over one third of the Zambian women
become mothers by the time they reach 18 years old and about
two-thirds having a child when they are 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Iraq on Saturday
called for reviving the tripartite Syrian-Iraqi-Turkish committee
on water.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Minister of Irrigation Abdul-Rahman Madani and his Iraqi
counterpart Mahmoud Thiab Al-Ahmed made the call in a statement
released following their four-day talks.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers urged the Turkish concerned minister to hold
with them a three-way meeting with a view to reviving the
tripartite committee set up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
During the Syrian-Iraqi talks, the two ministers underlined the
necessity of coordination between Syria and Iraq in all
international arenas concerned with water.
</P>
<P>
They also highlighted the importance of probing a tripartite
agreement with Turkey on sharing the waters of the Euphrates
Tigris rivers in accordance with the international law and
neighborliness as well as the historical ties between the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Water should constitute bridges of peace, communication and
interaction among the three countries, the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey confines the water quotas to Syrian and Iraq at just 500
cubic meters a second while the two latter countries seek to raise
the figure to 700 cubic meters. Talks on the question have been
frozen since 1991.

<P>
MAPUTO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A international conference on
Mozambican external debt ended here Saturday, calling for total
and unconditional cancellation of Mozambique's debt which stands
at some 5.6 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Mozambican government, the World
Bank, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and some
European countries participated in the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the conference called upon the
Mozambican parliament to coordinate among the parliaments of the
SADC member states so as to take joint actions to seek for debt
exemption for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique also urged coordination between the Mozambican
parliament and those of the debtees so that they can influence
their respective governments and the Bretton Woods Institutions
for the cancellation of the debts.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Mozambique was listed as one of the
candidates for the Heavily-indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt
relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, 80 percent of Mozambique's foreign debt would be
canceled by mid-1999. But the Mozambican government demands that
all its external debt should be exempted.

<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- About 12 species of primates in
Nigeria are under threats of extinction as a result of habitat
loss.
</P>
<P>
The species include the white-throated guenon species and
drill monkeys, the News Agency of Nigeria Saturday quoted
environmental scientist Adeboke Adegoroye as saying at the
just-concluded Obafemi Awalowo Foundation Dialog.
</P>
<P>
Adegoroye, Acting Director-General of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, alerted the Nigerians that the
country's wildlife is rapidly declining due to habitat loss and
increased pressure from hunters, poachers and bush burning.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some animals such as ceihan, pygmy
hippopotamus, giraffe and the black rhinoceros have already
disappeared from the Nigerian environment.
</P>
<P>
The environment in this most populous African country is being
affected negatively by what he called uncontrolled logging, tree
felling and gas flaring.
</P>
<P>
The gas flaring is a major threat to the Nigerian environment
as it results in acid rain which destroys fresh water fishes and
forests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the flaring of petroleum-associated gas
in Nigeria alone accounts for 28 percent of total gas flared in
the world.
</P>
<P>
On challenges to Nigeria's environmental management,
Adegoroye said that there are inadequate legal and administrative
instruments for the enforcement of laws on the protection of the
environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak delivered a message from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel on
Turkey-Syria ties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived here Saturday noon for a two-day official
visit to Turkey, said at a joint press conference with Demirel
that "Assad is happy with the defusing of the crisis between
Syria and Turkey" over the Kurdish rebel issue.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said, "Assad explained to me about his views on the
Turkish-Syrian ties and on his wish that Syria and Turkey will
develop a productive cooperation in the direction of joint
interests."
</P>
<P>
However, Mubarak did not bring any concrete proposal on
improving the Turkish-Syrian ties to the Turkish president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Demirel expressed his gratitude to Mubarak for his
mediation in defusing the crisis between Ankara and Damascus over
the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), outlawed in Turkey. .
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president shuttled between Ankara and Damascus in
early October to ease tension heightened after Turkey threatened
to launch military strikes against Syria if Damascus continues to
support the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria signed a security cooperation deal following
Egyptian mediation, which resulted in Syria's expulsion of the
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by the Italian police upon his arrival
in Rome by a Russian Airlines passenger plane on November 12.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war for
self rule in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000
lives in conflicts since August 1984.

BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Asian Games opened in
the Thai capital here on Sunday with an extravaganza ceremony as
Thailand is surfacing from its most severe financial crisis in
decades.
</P>
<P>
As prelude performance started at 18:00, Thailand's King
Bhumibol Adulyadej opened the Games at 20:24 in the 60,000-seat
Rajmangala Stadium of the Hua Mark Sports Complex here.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who is on a four-day official
visit to Thailand, attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were leaders of the international
sports organizations including the International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch and the Olympic Council of Asia
President Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 athletes and officials from 41 countries and
regions are participating in the Games, which features 377 gold
medals in 36 disciplines including Asian specialities such as
kabaddi and sepak takraw.

Each participating team was escorted by a Miss Thailander
holding its plate, while Sri Lankan put up a peculiar show with
six dancers in bright costumes.
</P>
<P>
However, several Thai beauty queens could not stand the hot

stadium.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a jazz composer, made the proclamation
to open the Games and released a Royal pigeon before songs written
by himself were played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's only Olympic gold medalist Somrak Khamsing, as the
last runner of the torch relay, became the cynosure of the whole
stadium by setting the cauldron alight, sending the whole audience
into elated acclamation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is hosting the last Asian Games of the century, the
fourth time being held in Bangkok after prvious successes in 1966,
1970 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
Despite the withdrawal of 17 sports teams which forced the
organizers to make three re-draws in some events, Sunday night's
performance, a feast-for-eye mixture of songs and dances by local
pop singers and performers in colorful costumes, reflected the
country's determination to further attain Asian unity and to
overcome the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first act "The Dawn", dusk was transformed to dawn when
the Sun God made its spectacular entrance at the stadium,
symbolizing the wit of Asian people to overcome any obstacles
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour ceremony featured 7,614 performers in
enlightening performances with the theme of "Friendship Beyond
Frontiers".
</P>
<P>
A martial art show depicted Asian unity, which was enhanced by
a later episode with four swan floats, each tied with a giant
balloon, to symbolize the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus.
</P>
<P>
After the display of fireworks and laser lights, the Royal
anthem was played to conclude the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> PNA Launches Campaign to Collect Illegal Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Sunday launched a campaign to collect illegal
weapons in the self-rule areas required by the latest agreement
signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli Wye accord reached on October 23
provides that the collection of illegal weapons in Palestinian-run
areas should start seven weeks after the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the campaign called on those
Palestinian citizens who own arms to hand over the illegal weapons
within weeks or apply for a license.
</P>
<P>
A decree issued by the PNA two weeks ago said that anyone, who
has illegal weapons but fails to turn them over, will be sentenced
to six months in jail and fined for 800 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord also envisages that Israel pulls out its troops
from 13 percent more of the West Bank within three months in
return for intensified Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
But Israel suspended the implementation of the accord last
Thursday, saying it will not resume the troops withdrawal until
the PNA made concessions over such issues as the release of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the Palestinian
statehood. The Palestinians have threatened to announced an
independent state next May whatever a peace treaty with Israel is
reached or not.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross will come to Israeli and
the Palestinian self-rule areas Thursday to try to restart the
implementation of the Wye agreement to prepare for a upcoming
three-day visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, which begins
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Games Chief Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of
Manchester's 2002 Commonwealth Games has resigned after less than
a year in the post.
</P>
<P>
Jim Seligman quit his 100,000-a-year job just 11 months into
his contract.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Manchester 2002 board said Mr Seligman's
commitment to the games had "restricted him from pursuing other
interests".
</P>
<P>
This high-profile departure will be a setback for preparation
of the games which are costing 58 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Mr Seligman came from an industry background and his role was
to attract business sponsorship and sell Manchester on the world
stage.
</P>
<P>
Although his departure was said to be amicable, it is reported
that there had been concerns about his overall management style.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Mr Seligman presided over the launch of Kit
-the games' mascot - and their "spirit of friendship" logo.
</P>
<P>
He also led the Manchester team in Kuala Lumpur where the last
Commonwealth Games were held .
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to Mr Seligman, the board chairman, Robert
Hough,said: "Jim has worked hard at a difficult job and we wish
him well in the future. He can look back with some satisfaction
at the team we are creating and the vision we are developing to
make sure that Manchester hosts the finest Commonwealth Games
ever and that the games make a real contribution to the quality
of life in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it will be business as usual in the games office
and the rest of the team will be working hard to make sure that
all current projects remain on course," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his parting statement, Mr Seligman said: "I have greatly
enjoyed my time working on the games in Manchester and I am
confident that the team I have helped build will produce a great
event.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank everyone in the games office, and wish
them all the best for the challenges that lie ahead."
</P>
<P>
The board confirmed there was no replacement in line to fill
the post but that the finance director Bill Enevolson would have
an expanded role.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Denies Kidd Pay Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards Sunday dismissed
claims by Brian Kidd that he had not offered him extra cash to
stay at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Edwards told BBC Radio 5 Live that he did make an increased
pay offer to Kidd but he could not persuade the United number two
to turn down the manager's job at Blackburn Rovers.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Kidd told a news conference: "There was no salary
increase offer to me and nor was there any sought. Money was not
the issue for me. I was not offered a salary increase and I
didn't seek one."
</P>
<P>
But on Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme, Edwards said he
was surprised at reports that Kidd claimed no improved terms were
forthcoming from the United board.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly did offer him more money - there is no question
about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What he said to us what that he wanted to go be given the
opportunity of being a number one and that this was a golden
opportunity he wanted to try."
</P>
<P>
Edwards also denied any suggestion of intervention on the Kidd
situation from broadcasters BSkyB who have put in a bid to take
over United.
</P>
<P>
"That is absolute nonsense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I did, out of sheer courtesy, speak to (Sky representative)
Mark Booth about it, and he gave me his backing to make any deal
with Brian Kidd that I thought was suitable.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have to refer to them. But out of sheer courtesy I
did ring him to tell him exactly what we were doing."
</P>
<P>
Edwards also tried to scotch rumours that Kidd decided to
leave because the door had been closed on him as a likely
successor to Alex Ferguson when the Old Trafford manager finally
calls it a day.
</P>
<P>
"That is also not true. Alex Ferguson's position when he goes
has never ever been discussed with Brian Kidd or anybody else."
</P>
<P>
On the question of Kidd's own replacement as assistant manager
Edwards said it was entirely up to Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very much that anything will be happening in such a
short space of time. But I think Alex himself has to decide who
he wants as his number two - and that could be a very long
process," he admitted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Learning The Importance Of Farm Product Trademarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Until quite recently, Chinese
farmers seldom bothered to apply for a trademark when they
developed a product.
</P>
<P>
So, when some villagers in Quxian County in Zhejiang province
registered their "Yi Pin Hong" brand oranges a few years ago,
their neighbors laughed themselves silly at the foolishness.
</P>
<P>
But, the neighbors' attitude changed in 1995, when oranges
without a brand name couldn't find buyers, resulting in 100
million yuan in losses to local growers. At the same time, Yi Pin
Hong oranges were bought by dealers for 4 times the price of other
oranges.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't need any brand in the past because farm products
were managed by the government," explains one farmer, but now they
see differently. In Zhejiang alone, there have been 4,974
applications for trademarks for everything from tea to mushrooms,
plums, walnuts, and geese.
</P>
<P>
To cultivate better brands, Chinese farmers have tried hard to
improve their techniques and strains and a number of farm
production centers have been established or expanded to produce
high-quality products that are likely to become well-known name
brands.
</P>
<P>
A name-brand farm-product fair here last month attracted over
200,000 people, including some 70 business people from Germany,
Japan, Canada, and elsewhere. More than 130 contracts were signed,
worth 4.7 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Brown: I Could Do Nothing at Celtic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Celtic general manager
Jock Brown has claimed he was so reviled at Parkhead that
whatever he did his actions would have been twisted and used
against him.
</P>
<P>
Brown left his post by mutual consent earlier this season
after a series of controversies, most notably being blamed by
head coach Wim Jansen for the Dutchman's decision to leave the
club 48 hours after lifting the title.
</P>
<P>
The protracted delay before the appointment of Jozef Venglos
as Jansen's successor also sparked criticism of Brown, who in his
final months at Parkhead refused all contact with the media.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The size of Celtic is ferocious. I didn't appreciate
before I went there ... who could unless they were in the middle
of it all. In these circumstances it was going to be a very
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
"I was told by a player a year ago that he envied me least of
all in the sense that if there was success the coach would take
it - if there was failure I would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
"I have lost track of the (press) accusations because they
were so persistent. It got to the stage where if I had rescued a
toddler from a burning building I would have been accused of
being a child molester.
</P>
<P>
"What I do know is there was a state of affairs created
whereby the perception was that I had power vested in me by the
board which was totally out of the bounds of reality.
</P>
<P>
"I was in the buffer zone. I was between the playing side, the
coaching side and the board side and had to take the flak - I saw
it as part of the job," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Golfer Regains Omega Order of Merit Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Kang Woon-soon
carved his name into Omega Asian Tour history after a commanding
victory in the 500,000 U.S. dollars Omega PGA Championship at
Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Completing a remarkable end to the season in Hong Kong, Kang
won by three shots from Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Chin-sheng, to
also claim the Omega Order of Merit title and become the first
player to win back-to-back Omega Tour events.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old South Korean, winner of last week's Perrier
Hong Kong Open, fired a final round four-under-par 66 for a
four-round aggregate of 17-under-par 263, while Hsieh returned a
65.
</P>
<P>
"I really felt the pressure today," admitted Kang after the
victory. "When I was on the practice putting green this morning,
I found it very difficult to settle down on the course. I am so
happy to have won again," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kang, who won the Omega Order of Merit title in 1996, became
only the second player to win four times on Tour along with
Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit.
</P>
<P>
Kang started the fourth day strokes ahead of Hsieh and he
never let his lead slip to less than three. After a
two-under-par 33 from nine he led by three from China's Zhang
Lian-wei and by four from Hsieh, and with three holes to play the
South Korean led both players by three.
</P>
<P>
Any hopes that Hsieh and Zhang had of catching Kang were
dashed when the steady South Korean birdied 17 before he added
the icing to the cake by holing a 12 footer for birdie on the par
five 18th. A double-bogey on 18 cost Zhang a share of the third
place with American Eric Rustand, who closed with a spectacular
course record leveling eight-under-par 62 for a 12-under-par
tournament total.
</P>
<P>
Ruangkit took the fourth place on 11-under-par after carding a
67 while American Erik Meeks fired a 65 to finish tied fifth with
Zhang a stroke further back.
</P>
<P>
The top prize of 80,750 U.S. dollars brought Kang, who had
been in the seventh spot on the Merit list, over England's Ed
Fryatt up to top the Omega Order of Merit, with a final earning
for the year to 150,771 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Omega Tour's season will be brought to a conclusion next
week with Volvo Asian Matchplay and Hugo Boss Foursomes slated
for December 10-13 at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lian-wei will compete as a hosting player while other
participants will be the winners of this year's Omega PGA Asian
Tour events.

<HEADLINE> South China Region Developing Rapidly with Central Leaders' Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southern China has made social and economic progress in
the past 40 years, thanks to special help from central government
leaders, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's political stability, economic development, ethnic
unity and social prosperity are the outcome of the kind attention
shown by three generations of leaders, says Cao Bochun, secretary
of the regional Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong visited Guangxi in January
1958, and the autonomous region was officially established in the
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Mao told the autonomous regional Party chief Wei
Guoqing to place greater importance on the unity of the Han,
China's major ethnic group, and the Zhuang, the largest ethnic
group in Guangxi, and 10 other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the government published its official Zhuang
dictionary, the first of its kind for China's largest ethnic
minorities areas, thus putting an end to the history in which the
Zhuang ethnic group did not has its own written language.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Premier Zhou Enlai replaced the character then used
for 'Zhuang' with another character with the same pronunciation
that means "strong" or "powerful".
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, late veteran Leader Deng Xiaoping visited the
autonomous region in 1973 and 1986, and gave special instructions
on environmental protection to help develop local tourism.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central government leaders have paid still
greater attention to Guangxi because it was lagging behind and
ranked the last but one among all provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions in the country in terms of the average annual
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan and other
third-generation Chinese leaders have visited the autonomous
region on many occasions and given instructions about how to cope
with different issues and a series of favorable policies and funds
have been provided by the central government to help Guangxi in
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
And the policies and financial assistances by the central
leadership have paid off. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1996), Guangxi's economy grew six percentage points faster
than the national average, at 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Guangxi's GDP was 206.7 billion yuan, 18.9 times the
figure for 1957, and its per-capita GDP ranked 11th in the country.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bangkok Governor Vows to Make Air Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok, a metropolis with
severe air pollution, has the chance of entering the new
millennium with clean air thanks to the ambitious environment
projects launched by the city administration.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok governor Bhichit Rattakul is guiding the capital, with
its 6 million-plus population, into a city free of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
In his two-and-a-half years in office, the governor had made
serious efforts to fight the city's air pollution, with several
high profile projects including the campaign for dust-free roads,
stop-checks for vehicles with excessive exhaust fumes, and a ban
on motorists running their engines while parking at public
buildings and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Bhichit has vowed that the city administration will go all out
to ensure that Bangkok's air become clean in the year to come.
</P>
<P>
"Improving the city's air quality will be the main activity for
the whole new year," the governor told reporters. The city
administration's most obvious achievement, he said, will be the
improvement of the city environment and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Well-known for his enthusiasm in tackling the air pollution,
Bhichit, a former Bangkok MP, has set up an action group for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
He successfully gained approval from Bangkok voters by
consistently campaigning against air pollution. The campaign
helped him win more than 700,000 votes in the city governor
election in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's air pollution comes mainly from about 3 million
registered vehicles, and the number of vehicles is on the rise
despite the economic crisis sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
With no restrictions on the number of vehicles, it will be hard
for Bhichit to handle this problem. But Bhichit has cards up in
his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
He said a citywide campaign against air pollution will begin in
March, 1999 with the number of vehicle exhaust checkpoints
reaching 200. "By the end of next year, air quality must be
better," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the city administration will launch campaigns to
educate Bangkok residents about how to maintain their car engines
and reduce fumes. For this purpose, the city administration will
receive technical assistance from the World Bank and the United
States Environment Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
The governor has more in his mind. He plans a series of
projects including resurfacing roads and footpaths, building more
bus stops, bicycle lanes, motorcycle parking lots, public drinking
stands, miniature parks, public toilets, tourist information and
municipal police kiosks, pedestrian bridges, planting of trees,
installing more rubbish bins and dredging storm drains.
</P>
<P>
Public transport projects including tram routes along city
canals and public vans are expected to be operational next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more public recreation areas and sports facilities
will be opened, and those left jobless by the recession will be
employed on the environment projects. Public health services will
be available to more people by the city's medical units, according
to Bhichit.
</P>
<P>
All the projects have won the applaud of Bangkokians. The
governor, however, has many obstacles to remove. Among them is the
lack of money.
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects are controversial and are questioned for
their high cost, including the purchase of palm trees to decorate
the road that runs parallel to the Ramindra-Arjnarong expressway,
and public toilets on Rajdamri road.
</P>
<P>
As measures are being taken to ease the city's air pollution,
the ban on motorists leaving their engines running seems not to be
effective. Most motorists ignored the city's threatened fines,
Security guards at parking lots are often reluctant to warn
motorists to turn their engines off.
</P>
<P>
In the latest controversial case, the city paid the State
Railway of Thailand 555 million baht (15.4 million U.S. dollars)
to convert its golf course, close to Chatuchak Park, into a new
public park.
</P>
<P>
But Bhichit is determined to achieve his goal. "I intend to
give Bangkokians an even better environment and higher quality of
life in the new millennium," he said.

Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minorities Choosing Spouses In New Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Young people in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region don't use the old means of love
songs much anymore to find their lifetime partners.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can find our loved ones just by singing
several love songs," says Xiao Huang, a young Zhuang ethnic group
woman. She found her boyfriend by attending a TV program for
singles.
</P>
<P>
Her father says, "Times have totally changed now. It used to be
rather difficult for men and women to see each other, but nowadays
men can date women by simply calling them." He says he found his
wife by singing lovesongs at the Zhuang song festival on March 3
of the lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists say that this is only one of the many changes in
customs. The greater opportunities to be in contact with Han
people and foreigners have brought great changes to their social
and political lives.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Miao ethnic group in the region's Damiao
Mountain area used to look for their loved ones by going to the
village where the girl lived to sing lovesongs on moonlit
nights. The girls would go to a river or well to drink the water
with the men if they found him suitable.
</P>
<P>
Young men in the Dayao Mountain area could go upstairs directly
to a room especially for young women to declare their love face to
face.
</P>
<P>
But, "This is rarely seen now. The place that used to be used
for dating by young people has become a scenic spot now and that
old way of finding one's love is performed now for tourists,"
according to Feng Wenzhou, deputy chief of Civil Affairs Bureau of
the Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
It also used to be quite common for cousins or nephews and
nieces to get married in remote villages of the Dong and Yao, but
this is now illegal because of the deformed children that can
result.
</P>
<P>
Marriages within ethnic and between ethnic groups and the Han
are on the increase and these changes reflect their ability to
adapt to the developing world and show the rapid development of
civilization in China, according to Wu Shihua, a scholar of ethnic
minority studies.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Steps Up Campaign for WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi is intensifying his campaign to win the post
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) director-general.
</P>
<P>
Thai News Agency reported on Sunday that Supachai, also
commerce minister, has won strong support from many countries in
Latin America and some African countries during recent talks with
their government officials.
</P>
<P>
Australia had earlier voiced strong support to Supachai, who
now focused his campaign on several African Muslim countries
currently supporting the Moroccan candidate, former Trade Minister
Hassan Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
Former New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore and former
Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren are also contenders.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial tallies suggested that Supachai and Moore were
leading the race.
</P>
<P>
Major WTO members which would have a decisive role in the
selection, including the United States and E.U. countries, have
yet to make public their positions.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO practice, inherited from the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, major decisions should be taken by consensus
among members, now totaling 132 countries.
</P>
<P>
But a November 30 deadline for identifying a leading candidate
around whom a consensus might be built slipped by and the
ambassadors of Switzerland and Brazil, conducting the selection
process, said they needed more time and planned to complete the
task by year end.
</P>
<P>
Also, the idea of a vote has been floated by ambassadors of
Egypt and Pakistan at an informal meeting of the WTO General
Council called to review the situation, although both said
consensus remained the best way.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said Supachai had gained support after
presenting his policies toward the WTO last month.
</P>
<P>
"Even Cuba and Brazil, which once nominated their own
candidates, lent support for Thailand," an official said.
</P>
<P>
The new director-general will succeed Italian Renato Ruggiero,
who completes his four-year term in April.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Y2K Efforts Gain International Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that international organizations have committed to back
efforts of the Philippine Presidential Commission on year 2000
Compliance to prepare the country for the Y2K, or the "millennium
bug" problem.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Joseph Estrada, the commission said
these agencies are now focusing their support on the holding of an
International Y2K Summit to be held in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have already
 promised their support for the summit, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the Philippine summit will have
"tremendous significance" in promoting awareness, getting best
practices and experiences, and updating on the progress of
international efforts to lick the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
But the commission has not proposed the date and the venue of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
The "millennium bug" is a built-in flaw in many computer
systems that could jeopardize a large number of activities in
both the private and public sectors beginning in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Anti Y2K efforts are focused on making sure computer systems do
not mistake the year 2000 for the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
At least seven sectors -- transportation, power, water, health,
 manufacturing, banking and finance and telecommunications and
government services --- may become paralyzed if concerned agencies
 and firms do not prepare them for the Y2K problem.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Agrarian Reform Communities for Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it has placed on the fast track the establishment of
agrarian reform communities (ARCs) in the countryside to deliver
basic services to the poor and free them from the clutches of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
These communities will provide beneficiaries not only with full
government assistance to increase their agricultural yields, but
with education, health, child care, shelter and other basic social
services as well, said Secretary Horacio Morales of the Department
of Agrarian Reform in a statement issued here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that around half of the rural poor households would be
able to cross over the income poverty line with the full
implementation of ARCs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Within these ARCs, farmer beneficiaries receive not just
financing, production, processing, and marketing assistance, they
also get basic social services -- education, health and shelter,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
So far 1,000 ARCs have been set up nationwide with the help of
donor governments and agencies, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, this figure hardly covers 10 percent of the
targeted rural poor.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Beef up Fire Alarm System in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Following an orphanage fire that
killed 30 people in Manila last week, the Philippine government is
planning to restore a citywide fire alarm system in the capital to
ensure speedy response from fire fighters, said an official.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview over the weekend, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said that the present fire alarm system has become
dependent solely on telephones.
</P>
<P>
The old fire alarm system in Manila was destroyed in the 1980s
to give way to the construction of the Light Rail Transit (LRT)
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our present fire system is completely dependent on telephones,
and that puts us in a difficult situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph has directed Undersecretary Ronaldo Puno of
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to meet
with Metro Manila mayors on Monday to discuss deficiencies in the
existing fire fighting system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a fire in a Manila orphanage killed 30 people,
mostly children abandoned by their parents. Initial investigations
show that faulty electrical wiring caused the fire.

ISLAMABAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban have
denied the opposition claims that people in northern Afghanistan
have staged uprising against the militia, according to a report
from the Afghan capital of Kabul Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman for the Afghan opposition as
saying that local population has staged rebellion against strict
interpretation of Islam by the Taliban and the unrest has now
spread to Faryab, Kunduz, Jauzjan, Balkh, Samangon and Baghlan
provinces in Northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman, however, has said that though fighting has
taken place in some areas, he dismissed the reports of general
uprising against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the opposition guerrillas have come down
from the mountains due to cold winter and shortage of food, and
some of them still want to continue the war with the Taliban while
others have joined the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Polio Immunization Program Launched in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of polio
immunization program was launched here Sunday and an estimated 125
million Indian children will be immunized from December 6, 1998 to
January 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International and
the Indian government have intensified their polio eradication
efforts this year. Millions of health workers as well as business
and youth volunteers have been mobilized to target areas where
confirmed polio cases have been found and routine immunizations do
not cover in the country.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, capital of India, the government has set up more
than 4,000 immunization booths for an estimated 1.9 million
children. About 30,000 volunteers, including students from 160
schools will participate in the event. Intensive door-to-door
campaigns will be conducted in 50 identified high risk areas in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Polio is caused by the wild polio virus which travels at a
lightening speed of infecting almost 200 children before the
disease is detected in the form of paralysis. Every unimmunized
child stands a threat of contracting polio. In India, over 10
percent of the children are still left unimmunized.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition to Launch Attacks against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- With a consensus having
developed among the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to push against
the militia, Afghan opposition groups are expected to launch
attacks against the Taliban in the northern and eastern parts of
the country during the next ten days.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West
Frontier Province, told Xinhua that the Afghan opposition leaders
are contemplating to go ahead with their offensives against the
Taliban before the starting of severe cold weather in the
war-battered Afghanistan, especially in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Northern Afghanistan usually receives heavy snowfall during the
months of December, January and February.
</P>
<P>
A three-day summit of the fractured anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance concluded in Panjsher on Saturday with a pledge to
overcome their differences and go for unified attacks against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban leaders are least concerned about the moot in
Panjsher, saying that the Northern Alliance has died a natural
death.
</P>
<P>
"It does not exist any more," a Taliban leader told Xinhua,
requesting not to be named.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the opposition is to launch attacks against
the Taliban forces in Baghlan, Kunduz and Takhar in the north of
Afghanistan and eastern provinces including Nangarhar, Kunar and
Laghman.
</P>
<P>
The Sources said that the Panjsher summit, however, remained
inconclusive to formulate its strategy about the southeastern
provinces where Commander Ahmad Shah Masood has developed
differences with Jamiat-e-islami leader Said Noorullah Emmad.
Emmad is a very influential Rabbani's Jamiat leader in the
southwestern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Sources further said Commander Masud also agreed to provide
military and financial assistance to the commanders in the eastern
provinces. However, he was not happy with performance of the
anti-Taliban commanders in the eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, those attended the moot included former
governor of Nangarhar province Abdul Qadeer, former governor of
Laghman province Abdullah Jan Wahidi, head of his newly-formed
faction of Hizb-e-Islami Humayun Jareer and representative of the
Mutawaqil faction of Hizb-e-Wahdat (Shiites group).
</P>
<P>
Besides, the sources said that about 170 commanders of
different anti-Taliban factions attended the meeting.

four ethnic groups: the Han, Miao, Dong, and Yao," says Feng

But now, people celebrate their festivals in a totally

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Asian Games opened in
the Thai capital of Bangkok on Sunday with an extravaganza
ceremony as the country is still battling the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej declared the Games open at
the 60,000-seat Rajmangala Stadium of the Hua Mark Sports Complex
here.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who is on a four-day official
visit to Thailand, attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony are leaders of the international
sports organizations including the International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch and the Olympic Council of Asia
President Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 athletes and officials from 42 countries and
regions are participating in the Games, which features 377 gold
medals in 36 sports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's only Olympic gold medalist Somrak Khamsing, as the
last runner of the torch relay, became the cynosure of the whole
stadium by setting the cauldron alight, sending the whole audience
into elated acclamation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is hosting the last Asian Games of the century amid
its most severe financial crisis in decades and a spate of
withdrawals even weeks ahead of the games' opening.
</P>
<P>
Organizers had to make three re-draws in some events as 17
teams had pulled out.
</P>
<P>
But even Sunday night's performance, a feast-for-eye mixture of
song and dance by local pop singers and performers in colorful
costumes, partly reflected the country's determination to fight
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first act "The Dawn", dusk was transformed to dawn when
the Sun God made its spectacular entrance at the stadium,
symbolizing the wit to overcome the financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
China, which won 126 golds at the last games four years ago, is set
to retain its number one position during the two-week event, with
Japan and South Korea contending for the second place.

at the Beijing leg, accumulated 98 points after his four-leg
competitions, including Canada, United States, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
Li defeated South Korean Kim Dong-Sung, who had two points

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Announces New Interest Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(POBC), China's central bank, announced a new package of interest
rate cuts today that will take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, they are an important way to boost the
economy by lowering interest rates on bank deposits and loans by
an average of 0.5 percentage points, and interest rates on
deposits and loans of the central bank reserve funds.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on demand and three-month deposits will remain
unchanged, interest rates for other deposits and all loans will be
cut. The bank will also cut interest rates on reserve funds and on
central bank loans to financial institutions from 3.51 percent to
3.24 percent and from 5.61 percent to 5.06 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
It says that the rate cuts are tied to the latest round of
reductions on interest rates by developed countries, giving China
room to lower its rates.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods have continued to decline in price, although at
a lower pace and as a result real interest rates remain high. The
performance of state-owned enterprises is improving slightly, the
bank says, but they are not regarded as having completely
recovered.
</P>
<P>
The bank has taken into consideration of the interests of
enterprises, individuals, and commercial banks as well as the
balance between interest rates of the renminbi and foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The bank says that all Chinese financial institutions must
abide by its regulations and that illegal raising of rates will be
penalized in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has reduced interest rates three times since
last October and this has had a positive effect in counteracting
the current financial turmoil in some Asian nations and the
effects of the devastating floods this summer, it says.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicts that the cuts will be important in increasing
the money supply by some time next year, lowering operating costs
of industrial and commercial firms, and increasing the amount of
consumer loans, domestic consumer demand, and of exports to have
rapid and healthy economic development.

ADDIS ABABA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), on
Sunday strongly urged factions concerned in the Anjouan conflict
"to immediately put an end to these senseless fightings."
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press communique issued here, Salim said
in a statement on the situation prevailing in the Comorian Island
of Anjouan that he is "greatly concerned with the unfolding
developments in Anjouan and the loss of lives and other
casualties as a result of fightings which erupted between
factions in the Island".
</P>
<P>
"These developments are all the more unfortunate as they occur
at a time when there were signs of hope for the convening of the
Comorian Inter-Islands Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief noted that senseless fightings "can only bring
about further suffering and destruction," and urged factions
concerned to "seize the opportunity of the envisaged Comorian
Inter-Islands Conference to peacefully address the problems
facing the Comorian Islands and their people."
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also appealed to member states, especially the
countries of the region to consider possibilities of extending
the necessary assistance to contribute toward an early return of
normalcy in the Indian Ocean island and the restoration of peace,
security and stability in the Island.

<HEADLINE> NATO Extraction Force to Be Deployed Over Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A NATO-led extraction force
will be deployed over this weekend in Macedonia as the backup for
the international verifiers for the Kosovo cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the extraction force, which will be
consisted of troops from France, Britain, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and Greece, will be in place for extraction operations
after NATO gave the deployment order on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The multinational force, which was formed at the request of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), would
be on standby to rush to the rescue of the OSCE-led verification
mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The extraction force, mainly paratroopers, will be able to
react within 30 to 60 minutes if the weather permits to pull out
the verifiers or to rescue the verifiers taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
NATO approved the extraction force concept in mid-November but
the newly-elected government of Macedonia approved the deployment
of the NATO-led force last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An official at NATO's supreme allied command in Europe told the
press last month that the OSCE verifiers would, in adverse
circumstances, first resort to the Yugoslav authorities for help.
</P>
<P>
In a deal reached between Belgrade and the OSCE, it is the
responsibility of the Yugoslav authorities to guarantee the safety
of the 2,000-member verification mission.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Launches Social Welfare Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labor and Social Welfare officials said Sunday that under the
program, the Social Security Fund will provide 150 baht (4.2 U.S.
dollars) per head/month for up to two children aged not over six
years old at a time in a family. But only families which have made
contributions to the fund for the past 12 months are qualified for
the benefit.
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to protect those who are not employed
continuously for 12 months and have more than two children.
</P>
<P>
The old-age pension scheme is aimed at those over 55 years
old. The monthly pension is 15 percent of the average monthly
salary over the last five years or 60 months of employment.
</P>
<P>
For instance, retirees with at least 30 years' membership of
the fund on an average monthly salary of 20,000 baht (555 dollars)
for the last five years of employment are qualified for a pension
of 7,000 baht (194 dollars) per month for the rest of their life.
</P>
<P>
If the fund members have made more than 180 monthly
contributions their monthly pension will go up 1 percent for every
year of additional payments.
</P>
<P>
If the members die in 60 months or five years of receiving the
pension, their relatives are entitled to get a sum amounting to 10
times their last monthly pension.
</P>
<P>
Members of the fund will next year make a monthly contribution
of 2 percent of their salary -- 1 percent to cover injuries,
sickness, disability and death under the first phase of the social
safety net and 1 percent to cover child welfare and old-age
pension under the second phase.

<HEADLINE> Many Firearms in Wrong Hands in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A large number of firearms in
private hands has led to increasing aggravated robberies, murders
and other serious crimes in Zambia, according to Sunday Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In the country with a population of nine million there are
more than 68,000 private guns including nearly 32,000 shotguns,
22,000 rifles, 10,000 handguns and 4,500 muzzle loaders, said the
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that previously when robbers raided a house
to steal property, they were generally armed with knives, pangas,
iron bars, bicycle chains or similar types of weapons.
</P>
<P>
But that no longer seems to be the case now as robbers
increasingly wield a variety of lethal military firearms such as
AK 47 assault rifles or Uzi sub-machine guns as they strike with
impunity, often in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted police spokesman Alex Chilufya as saying
that "I wish to inform the general public that the firearms used
in aggravated robberies and related criminal activities now
becoming rampant in Zambia particularly in Lusaka, are by and
large illegal military weapons."
</P>
<P>
He said that to stem the flow of guns, a countrywide amnesty
has been put in place up to the end of this year to facilitate
the recovery of illegal firearms.

<HEADLINE> OAU Committed to Congo (K) Peace: OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim has said that the
regional grouping will work tirelessly to ensure there is a
ceasefire in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking when he met Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister
Eric Silwamba Saturday during a brief stop-over at Lusaka
International Airport en route to South Africa, Salim said the
OAU is actively consulting on ways of finding a solution to the
four-month DRC crisis which is of great concern to Africa, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned paper quoted Salim as saying his meeting
with Silwamba is part of the process of consultation and that he
would take advantage of his visit to South Africa to continue
with the consultations.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to South Africa on a private visit but I will use
the visit to continue the consultations. We want to ensure there
is a ceasefire in DR Congo," said the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Salim added that the OAU has always understood there are both
internal and external forces to the DRC conflict which has sucked
in at least six foreign countries and it would take that into
consideration in trying to find a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the OAU is going to involve the Uganda and
Rwanda-backed rebels fighting against DRC President Laurent
Kabila in future talks, Salim diplomatically evaded the question.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever will be agreed upon, we will involve all parties.
But the modalities will depend on situation to situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believed Salim's visit to South
Africa is aimed at not only conducting consultations with
President Nelson Mandela who, from the very beginning of the war,
has been advocating for a peaceful solution, but also persuading
South Africa, a regional power, to play active rule in resolving
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DRC peace talks scheduled for this week in
Zambian capital Lusaka has been postponed to next week, a senior
State House official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
DRC leader Kabila is said to be ready for the Lusaka talks
during which a peace deal will probably be hammered out.

<HEADLINE> Brother of Ugandan President Admits Buying Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's brother Salim Saleh has admitted that he bought Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) from Westmont Land Asia of Malaysia through
Greenland Investment.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, who is also Museveni's security advisor and a
major general, admitted this after months of intensive media
pressure for the truth to come out on the relationship between
him, Greenland Investment, Westmont and UCB, the New Vision daily
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper broke the news on July 6 and Saleh has
persistently denied buying the bank since then. In November, he
denied before members of Parliament any involvement in the UCB
deal.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page statement he issued Saturday, Saleh also
announced his withdrawal from the deal in what he said was "to
save the government, the Bank of Uganda" and all stakeholders the
embarrassment over the affair.
</P>
<P>
He said he had used Greenland Investment to pay for UCB. This
purchase was made to rescue the only fully Uganda bank of
substance and history from foreign control, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Greenland Investment also threatened recently to sue the New
Vision newspaper over the reports it made on the affair.
</P>
<P>
The government sold its 51 percent shares in UCB to Westmont
at 11 million U.S. Dollars. The sale agreement was signed here on
October 26, 1997 but payment was not made until April of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's statement said that under a purported agreement dated
February 26, 1998, Westmont transferred all its newly-bought
shares to Greenland Investment.

WASHINGTON -- The United States said Saturday that it was
disappointed at Libya's disagreement to a definitive arrangement
for handing over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The State Department expressed the disappointment after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed to secure a clear-cut
agreement on the handover of the suspects during his talks with
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in a desert tent in Libya. "We are
disappointed that Libya is still not in compliance with the
Security Council resolutions. Compliance means turnover of the two
suspects for trial," State Department spokesman James Foley said.

has sent shock waves among residents of Kampala.
</P>

Some people in a market here became violent Saturday when
arguments heated up with Sebaggala supporters saying that the
whole thing was engineered by the government while others said
the mayor was indeed at fault, the Monitor paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most people, however, were glued to radio sets tuning on to
British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America programs to
update themselves with the final verdict of the four-week's case.
</P>
<P>
The jury in a Boston court announced that Sebaggala, Kampala's
first directly-elected mayor, was found guilty of all eight
counts of bank fraud, transportation of forged checks and lying
to U.S. customs officers.
</P>
<P>
The report said the 51-year-old mayor will be sentenced on
February 23, 1999, and faces a 21-27 month jail term.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was arrested on June 13 at the Kennedy International

</P>
<P>
Not being a member of the ruling National Resistance Movement,
Sebaggala was elected mayor of Kampala city in April in a hotly

<HEADLINE> 48,000 Road Accidents Recorded in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 48,000 road accidents have
been recorded in Zimbabwe so far this year in which 2,000 people
were killed and the Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Board (ZTSB) predicts
that more accidents will occur during the forthcoming festive
period.
</P>
<P>
ZTSB spokesman Romaldo Jokonya said here Saturday that the
accidents had surpassed those of last year by about 5,000,
killing about 2,031 people, 700 more than last year, the Sunday
Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The accidents include a record three-bus disaster, in which a
total of 77 people died and many others were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Jokonya said the increase in road accidents was caused by
motorists' rising lack of respect on proper road usage by most
motorists.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate bid to curb the carnage on the roads, a bill
was being drafted to clamp down on speeding in the wake of
numerous bus accidents which have claimed thousands of lives
since the country's independence in 1980, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZTSB was carrying out a campaign which was specifically
aimed at reducing road accidents during the forthcoming festive
season.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Retain Basketball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cagers are aiming at
retaining the Asiad title to tie the games' record of four
straight golds set by the Philippines in the early 1950s, China's
head coach Wang Fei said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China had won four gold medals in Asiad men's basketball
tournament and three of them came in the last three Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
With their young and talented 2.12-meter center Wang Zhizhi and
Asian all-stars Hu Weidong and Gong Xiaobin, the Chinese team
would accept nothing except the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"We come here for the gold," said Wang Fei, "and I think the
real contest wouldn't begin until the semi-final round when the
four strongest teams meet."
</P>
<P>
The four strongest teams Wang referred to are defending
champion China, last year's Asian Championship winner South Korea,
the all-pro Philippines and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fei thinks that China's tough rival is South Korea, who
used world-class long shots to upset five-time champion China in
last year's Asian championships. And this time in Bangkok, their
long range fire will be sharper with the upcoming young shooter
Cho Sang-hyun, who won the MVP at the William Jones Cup this
summer in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has formed their strongest ever team with top
pro stars and hopes to retain their past glory.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines have very good outside players but their
bigmen still lack of skills and strength to play against us, even
they have the sizes of 2.15m or 2.10m as we do" said power forward
Gong Xiaobin, captain of the Chinese team who led his team to a
78-70 win over the Philippines team last July.
</P>
<P>
Japan could not be counted out either as they came away from
the World Championships with one win and the 14th place finishing,
better than South Korea's 16th. They will mainly pin their hope
on Michael Takahashi and his Asian All-Star teammate Makato
Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
The basketball competition will begin on December 8 and end on
December 19. All the teams will take the Asiad tournament as a
warmup tournmaent for next year's Asian Championship, which will
decide the only berth for Asian teams to compete in the 2000
Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Central and Western China Stresses High-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China's vast central and
western regions are turning to develop high-tech industries in
order to gain an advantageous position in future regional economic
 competition.
</P>
<P>
For example, central China's Henan Province recently adopted
various policies to promote development of both the new and high
techology sectors, and industrialize related research findings.
The province will allocate 50 million yuan annually for high
technology development beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province will also encourage high-tech businesses and
scientists.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the provincial government adopted so
many measures to promote high-tech industries," said Zhao Chen,
deputy director of the province's Committee of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped Shaanxi Province in northwest China is another
example. It has decided to increase 30 million yuan every year for
the development of its high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The province is now implementing a program to integrate science
and technology with economic growth, focusing on some high and new
technological development zones in Xi'an and Baoji cities.
</P>
<P>
Against the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, provinces in
China's developed eastern part have managed to maintain economic
growth. However, central and western regions have been struggling
with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
So, their best choice is to develop high-tech in a bid to
restructure local industries and create new demand, a leading
official notes.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Groups Preserving Culture And Traditions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Scenes from major modern
Chinese city life can also be found in the capital of China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region: tall buildings, overpasses,
Mcdonald's hamburgers, and a lot of cars.
</P>
<P>
Most visitors probably don't even know that a million members
of 35 different ethnic groups live in the city and some might even
think that their ethnic identity is weakening, judging from their
appearance.
</P>
<P>
However, Tan Shengmin, deputy director of the Guangxi Research
Institute of the Zhuang Ethnic Minority, has a different view,
explaining that the Zhuang and other ethnic minorities have not
been assimilated by the Han as some Western scholars have said,
but have enhanced the consciousness of their own ethnic background
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Tan, who is a member of the Zhuang ethnic group, wears the same
clothes as the Han and writes in standard Chinese, but speaks the
fluent Zhuang language, in a city where 75 percent of the people
don't speak standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Tan is collecting historical materials on the Zhuang culture
and says that the Zhuangs still hold on to many of their customs.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has 37 ethnic minority groups, of which the Zhuang is
the largest.

<P>
Now, all over Guangxi, people are collecting ethnic minority
data, building museums of folk culture, and publishing works in
ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minority groups have a splendid culture that rivals that
of the Han, according to Meng Songyi, curator of the Du'an Yao
Autonomous County museum, who plans to go to Beijing to apply for
a loan for a new museum. This idea has attracted the attention of
the central government, which has a plan to allocate loans for
cultural projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars say that one of the main causes of the strong
ethnic identity after the reforms and opening up is the increase
in economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world. The
market economy is another factor, Tan Shengmin says.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Luocheng Mulam Autonomous County plans to
revive traditional festivals to attract Mulams living in other
parts of the country back to invest and help push up local
economic development. Other ethnic minority groups are collecting
folk songs and customs for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
China introduced a system of regional autonomy at the beginning
of the 1950s that allowed ethnic minority groups to manage
regional economic and cultural affairs on their own.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Helping With Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province, growing fast economically, has provided economic
assistance to the Three Gorges Area to help with its relocation
drive and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Guangdong has provided 199 million yuan in
financial aid to the area, 66.48 millon yuan of that being free,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
The funds have been used for 51 construction projects, 17
schools, helping 3,300 school drop-outs return to school, and for
providing training to 2,305 people.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has spent a lot on the area's infrastructure to help
improve the economic environment. Some 59.7 million yuan has been
for power, telecommunications and transportation construction.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Guangdong have encouraged local enterprises to
develop cooperative projects with enterprises in the Three Gorges
Area and has helped some enterprises in the area move to new areas
beneficial to technological development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Balconies Becoming More Beautiful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Small gardens have begun to
appear in parts of Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province -- but
they're actually balconies decorated with flowers and song birds.
</P>
<P>
Balconies used to be storage space for odds and ends, something
that didn't make the city look particularly good.
</P>
<P>
Gao Liang, a hospital employee, recently moved to Evergreen
Gardens, a new residential area, and still remembers how he had to
live on 3 sq.m. of balcony for twenty years, just room enough for
a single bed.
</P>
<P>
Even so, he says he was fortunate to have his own space,
because most children at that time had to live in the same space
as their brothers and sisters. Gao's new 125-sq.m. apartment has
two living rooms and two balconies, one of them just off one of
the bedrooms. The other is just off the kitchen. Gao spent nearly
10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars) on decorating the balconies,
2,000 yuan of that for flowers, miniature trees and a rockery.
</P>
<P>
Per capita floor space for the entire city has gone from 3.3
Sq.m. to 8.8 sq.m. in 20 years and balconies are seldom used as
kitchens or storage rooms any more, because newer apartments have
storage spacew built in.

<P>
SHENYANG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is gradually introducing the market economic system in
the management of public utilities.
</P>
<P>
Related innovations have helped public utilities overcome
financial problems and achieve sustainable development and
measures are introduced to attract funding for further development.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government initiated the reform of public
utilities management in 1997. Reform measures included permitting
individuals and foreign enterprises to participate in public
transportation, and ventures supplying water, gas and heating, all
of which were formerly controlled by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Related statistics show the province has used over three
billion yuan (360 million U.S.dollars) in foreign funding for
water purification projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Transportation Group Ltd. has earned over 250
million yuan in land-use fees for tracts of land covering
100,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the First Heating Supply Enterprise has issued
stocks valued at 120 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Government officials note that private taxi companies account
for 75 percent and private liquefied petroleum gas stations take
25 percent of the total number of related operations in the
province.

<HEADLINE> 40 Injured in Clashes Before Polls in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 people were injured,
four of them seriously, in clashes on Saturday between activists
of Bangladesh's ruling and opposition parties in northwestern
Pabna district ahead of a by-election there, press reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred between supporters of the ruling
Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) and the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) over campaigning for the by-election of
Pabna-2 constituency, scheduled for December 10.
</P>
<P>
The seat of the constituency was vacated following the death of
a BAL member of parliament earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Several houses were set on fire during the clashes and police
arrested five people in connection with the clashes, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Post and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim, Sate
Minister for Information Abu Sayeed and several other government
officials had campaigned for their candidate in the district.
</P>
<P>
The BNP charged that the campaigning by the ministers and
government officials violated election rules, but the charge was
denied by the BAL.
</P>
<P>
The BNP had formed 14 teams for conducting the election
campaign in 14 unions of the Bera-Sujanagar constituency and its
Chairperson Begum Kaleda Zia would start her two-day election
campaign from Monday, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Four candidates from different parties are contesting for the
seat, but the by-election is mainly a competition between the BAL
and the BNP.

China's hope to win the first gold medal of the Asian Games before
this evening's opening ceremony turned into a nighmare as pre-race
favorite Pan Jinhong of China wound up a distant fourth in 2:37:29, a
far cry from her personal best of 2:26:39.
</P>
<P>
Her fellow Chinese Wang Yanfang, who sprained her feet before
coming to Bangkok, lagged far behind at 13 km and finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great regret that I failed to win a medal for China,"
said the tearful Pan, Chinese national champion and winner of
Beijing international marathon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Pan said that she had not adjusted herself to Bangkok's weather
and didn't feel good before the race.
</P>
<P>
"Takahashi was too strong," she said. "I wanted to keep up with her
after 30km, but it was impossible since the gap was too big."
</P>
<P>
Takahashi headed the field of 12 runners away after the start
of the 42.195km race of stamina and endurance which started at
6:30 a.m. in Ayutthaya, 70 kilometers to the north of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
With 15km run Takahashi established a lead of around six minutes
over the chasing pack of six women led by Pan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who placed only fifth in 2:31:32 in the national
rankings, displayed top form and covered the first 25km in
1:22:08, extending her leading margin to three kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The second group could hardly pose threat and Takahashi kicked
in a solo run to win the Games' most grueling race and avenged
Japan's defeat in the event at the Hiroshima Asian Games four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Under such difficult conditions, the first thing is to gain
confidence," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was given a Japanese national flag, smiled and waved to the
supporters after crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
"If I have opportunity to run in the world championships next
year and the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000," she said, "I think I
can win there. "
</P>
<P>
Takahashi said there was no secret behind her success and rapid
improvement in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"It's my coach that turned me into the Asian Games champion. I
just followed his instructions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Yoshio Koide said this victory was of "special
significance" since the gold was the only one awarded before the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Koide, also coach of last year's world marathon champion Suzuki
Hirom, said he was also surprised at Takahashi's time.
</P>
<P>
"I expected she could run a time between 3:22:00 and
3:23:00," he said. "Now, I hope she can win the world championship
next year."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Yangon to Hold Talks on Refugee Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and Myanmar will hold
official talks on December 16 to expedite the repatriation of
Rohingya refugees, a Bangladesh Foreign Ministry official said
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also discuss border trade, the land mine problem
in the border areas, maritime boundary and development of
communications between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks will precede a state minister-level meeting of the
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic
Cooperation to be held here from December 17 to 19.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the Myanmar refugees, now staying in two
camps in southeastern Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, moved
very slowly, the official told Xinhua. It would take more than 10
years to complete the repatriation of the 21,000 refugees, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the latest arrangement between the two
countries, some 50 refugees would be sent back to Myanmar every
Wednesday, but only 71 were repatriated during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 out of 250,000 Myanmar Rohingyas, who crossed the
border into Bangladesh in early 1991 and took shelter in
southeastern Bangladesh, have returned voluntarily so far.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees stopped in July 1997
reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return and
resumed in late November this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimmers Face Uphill Battle in Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Against a full-fledged Japanese
legion, the absentee-depleted Chinese swimming contingent faces a
herculean task of keeping its supremacy in the pool at the 13th
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in eight years, the Chinese swimmers are
being tuned down as underdogs for the quadrennial regional sports
gala where swimmers from 29 teams will start to splash the pool on
Monday to chalk off the second biggest cake with 32 golds at
stake.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our utmost efforts to win golds, but it's rather
hard to edge over Japan in gold tally," said Chinese swimming
spokesman Shi Tianshu.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is a traditional swimming power in Asia and hatches a
batch of top-notched swimmers such as Mai Nakamura, Masami Tanaka
and Ayari Isoda," Shi said. "Japan enjoys one-upmanship in a lot
of events against our a few."
</P>
<P>
To make things even worse, China is to miss world record holder
Le Jingyi, a once formidable 23-year-older who captured the sole
swimming gold for China in Atlanta Olympics. The star swimmer has
decided to skip the Games to funnel her energy into university
campus.
</P>
<P>
He Cihong, another Chinese world record holder, was kept away
from the Games as she flunked in the trials, while Liu Limin,
dubbed as Butterfly Queen of China, retired late last year to
aboard for the United States for collegiate career.
</P>
<P>
The absence of these stars saps China's strength in the pool
without a slim of doubt, dimming its prospect to refrain from
losing to Japan, said Zhang Xiong, head coach of the Chinese
swimming team.
</P>
<P>
"China and Japan have competed head to head in the pool
throughout the 1990s," said Zhang, "But in the Asian Games, China
only beat Japan in 1990."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers notched up 23 golds in the 1990 Beijing
edition against Japan's seven, toppling their arch rivals for the
first time as swimming pace-setters in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Four years later in Hiroshima, the Chinese swimmers were
plunged into an abyss despite a 25-5 margin against the Japanese
in gold hunt as seven of them failed the doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Another four years went by, the Asian Games returns to the Thai
soils for the third time, where the 43-year-old Zhang foresees his
proteges to be sniped ferociously by the Japanese swimmers as they
are coveting to retain the top spot.
</P>
<P>
Japan has marked advantages in 13 events while China has seven,
leaving the remaining 12 wide open, Zhang explained.
</P>
<P>
"Since Japan has pinned its greatest hopes on its swimmers, the
battle against it in Bangkok will be very tough," the
husky-pitched coach Zhang said, "But so long as we unite to bring
out our best, we still have the chance to level against Japan."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, both teenager world record holders in
the women's 400m and 200m individual medleys respectively, are the
trump cards for coach Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chen struck golds in the 400m individual medley
and 400m freestyle and the 19-year-old Wu triumphed in the 200m
medley in the World Swimming Championships in Perth in January.
</P>
<P>
In the Bangkok Games, Chen is to compete in five events of the
200m and 400m individual medleys, the 200m and 400m freestyles,
400-meter freestyle and the 4x200 freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
For his male disciples, Zhang said Zeng Qiliang and Fu Yong are
sure to take golds in their respective specialities, the 100m
breaststroke and 200m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's Japanese peer Tsuytoshi Aoki seemed more like a
diplomat in fielding the question concerning the swimming battle
between China and Japan in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"The swimming in China is downwarding while Japan is upbeating,
but China is still strong enough as it is fielding in its best
swimmers here," Aoki said, "I hope my swimmers will perform to
their best and beat their Chinese opponents to stand atop of the
podium."
</P>
<P>
Japan is stronger than China in the men's events but weaker in
the women's swimming, and will take a maximum of 10 swimming
golds, the 51-year-old Japanese forecasted in a wary tone.
</P>
<P>
But Sri Lanka's swimming coach Rizvi Zain rippled the tune of
Aoki, saying "Japan has more good swimmers and I'm sure Japan will
beat China in the swimming pool in Bangkok."

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- a railing collapsed in the
stands during the U.S. Army-Navy game Saturday, injuring nine
cadets and prep school students and broke one person's neck in
Philadelphia, the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the railing in the first
row of the east end zone in Veterans Stadium collapsed when the
fans were cheering after Army took a 31-30 lead with 7"33 left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
The game, which Army won 34-30, was suspended for 31 minutes
as four ambulances drove into the field. Army Captain John
Cornelio said the injuries included sprained ankles, necks and
backs.
</P>
<P>
Cornelio said: "We're extremely worried. We're concerned
because cadets were injured. That's serious stuff."
</P>
<P>
The injured were four cadets from the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, and five students from academy prep school.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the railings in the stands, used only for
football, were held together by duct tape. It wasn't known
whether the incidents were related.

<HEADLINE> 18 Foreigners Arrested in Cuba for Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities have detained
18 foreigners allegedly linked to an international drug
trafficking ring, the official newspaper Granma reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The alleged drug traffickers were arrested between November 6
to November 16. They planned to take 53.5 kilograms of cocaine
and 1.32 kilograms of hashish from Jamaica to the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Among them, seven were Canadian nationals who came from Montego
Bay, Jamaica. They were detained at the Jose Marti International
Airport of Havana when they were trying to smuggle into the United
Kingdom 37.868 kilograms of cocaine hidden in 65 plastic
clothes-hangers and nine plastic suitcases.
</P>
<P>
This could be considered the biggest international drug
trafficking operation dismantled by the Cuban authorities at an
airport, Granma said.
</P>
<P>
In a previous case, three Jamaican nationals were arrested in
the same airport for 165 capsules of hashish totalling 1.32
kilograms in their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaicans, who also came from Montego Bay, told the Cuban
authorities that they were going to deliver the drug to a Canadian
citizen in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Other four Jamaicans were arrested between November 13 and 15
as they arrived in Havana with 15.65 kilograms of cocaine in their
luggage.
</P>
<P>
Investigations proved all those foreigners were linked to the
same drug trafficking ring. Four British citizens who were said to
be in charge of taking the drug out of Cuba were also arrested.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Said Unable to Topple Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday's Bangkok Post quoted New Aspiration Secretary-General
Sanoh Thienthong as saying the opposition, however, would continue
to block the government from carrying out the sixth letter of
intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said his party hoped to show the country that promises made
to the IMF were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
"We only want to use parliament as a forum for all parties
concerned to debate whether the letter of intent to obtain the IMF
loan violated the constitution and whether economic measures
required by the IMF will put the country at a disadvantage," Sanoh
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the sixth letter of intent to the IMF, approved by the
government earlier this month, the IMF will grant Thailand 4.74
billion U.S. dollars as part of the 17.2-billion-dollar bailout
package promised soon after the financial crisis broke out last
year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition maintained that Thailand had lost sovereignty
to the IMF by accepting its conditions for the bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh said the opposition will submit a petition to the
parliament next week seeking an impeachment of the cabinet for
alleged abuse of authority in issuing the letter of intent without
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition needed to muster the support of 75
percent of the members of both houses to remove the cabinet.
However, he said it did not have enough members to do this.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention to bring down the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said people would benefit from the debate because
they would understand more about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Suriyasai Katasila, deputy secretary-general of the Campaign
for Popular Democracy, said the Constitutional Court should be
asked to rule on whether the letter of intent was issued in
violation of the constitution.

MOSCOW -- Russia's foreign trade in 1998 declined 17 percent
from the same period in 1997, Russian Trade Minister Georgy
Gabunia said here Saturday at a meeting of the World Economic
Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign trade turnover is currently at the 1995
level. The imports decreased by 60 percent since August 17 when
Russia's ruble was devalued and the country defaulted on its debts.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia cited the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and
Russia, and Russia's banking system as the reasons for the decline.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia predicted that the situation might change for the
better when Russia's financial and economic systems are stabilized
and foreign trade achieves 3-4 percent annual growth. It could
return to the 1997 volumes in the years 2002-2003, he said.

NEW DELHI -- The World Bank (WB) has made a depressing forecast

target of over 6 percent for the current year would represent one
of the biggest challenges for the country's economy.
</P>

In its ninth annual report on the world economy, the World Bank
 says that "policy drift" and weak industrial performance have
slowed India's economy. Besides, depressed export markets in East
Asia and Japan are a blow, since they had come to account for a
significant share of India's exports. (India-World Bank-Economy)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed at Libya's Stand on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Saturday that it was disappointed at Libya's disagreement to a
definitive arrangement for handing over two suspects in the 1988
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The State Department expressed the disappointment after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed to secure a clear-cut
agreement on the handover of the suspects during his talks with
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in a desert tent in Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that Libya is still not in compliance with
the Security Council resolutions. Compliance means turnover of the
two suspects for trial," State Department spokesman James Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Washington had seen reports out of Tripoli but was
waiting to hear directly from Annan. "This has gone on for far too
long," he said, noting that the 10th anniversary of the tragedy
was fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over the two suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhiman, two alleged intelligence
agents, who were accused by the U.S. and Britain of blowing up the
Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 people were killed, 259 on the plane and 11 on
the ground, including 189 American citizens.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. and Britain agreed to Libya's
demand to set up a court in the Netherlands for the trial of the
two suspects before Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Annan made a lightning trip to Libya in the hope of securing a
definitive agreement for the turnover of the two suspects, but
came away without a firm accord, saying some outstanding issues
remained to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
But he said "considerable progress" has been made.
</P>
<P>
"You can take it that we have moved ahead and made considerable
progress" in resolving the dispute, he told reporters after his
meeting with Gaddafi Saturday.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Facing Tougher Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A tougher situation is expected
for China's textile exports next year, further hampering efforts
to lift the textile sector out of the red, according to a report
in today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
China's textile exports dropped 3.7 percent in the first ten
months of this year, compared to the same period of 1997, to 35.87
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports, which have maintained rapid growth rates over
the past few years, reported negative growth for the first time in
October.
</P>
<P>
The declines mainly resulted from the negative impact of the
lingering Asian financial crisis, Fan Min, a division chief of the
Industry Administration Department of the State Textile Industry
Bureau, was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the January-October period, Chinese textile exports
under quota control to the European Union, the United States,
Canada and Turkey rose 1.9 percent from a year ago to 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars, according to Chinese Customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
Yet exports of textiles made in inland China to the Republic of
Korea, Hong Kong and Macao, and Japan plunged 27.5 percent, 11.1
percent and 5.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fan predicted that as the negative consequences of the Asian
financial crisis unfold next year, Chinese textile exporters will
face even more difficult times.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the cost of taking part in this year's
public bidding for the 1999 quotas for 21 categories of
best-selling textile exports will raise the exporting costs,
according to some Chinese textile firms.
</P>
<P>
All this will make things more difficult for the country's
loss-stricken textile sector, as 40 percent of the sector's output
is sold abroad each year, Fan said.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry has experienced deficits for five
consecutive years, and more than 40 percent of the country's
textile companies are now on the brink of bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Housewives Get Education on HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 208,000 Myanmar
housewives have got health education on HIV/AIDS prevention under
a training program jointly run by a non-governmental women's
organization and a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
The program, undertaken by the Myanmar Maternal and Child
Welfare Association (MMCWA) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF),
was first conducted in 27 townships and has been further expanded
to 69 townships now.
</P>
<P>
The MMCWA has been actively involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and
 control projects as part of Myanmar's national health plan (NHP)
since 1993. The present five-year NHP (1996-2001) is under
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Marking the World AIDS Day here on Saturday, Myanmar Minister
of Health Major-General Ket Sein said that in some areas of the
country, some pregnant Myanmar women have been found infected with
HIV, the majority of them through their husbands.
</P>
<P>
He added that some young Myanmar girls in the border areas have
been lured with work and monetary incentives to the neighboring
countries and eventually ended up being forced into sex trade
resulting in infection with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government, in collaboration with NGOs, has
introduced programs for protecting young people especially girls
against exploitation and violence, obtaining assistance and
cooperation from four U.N. agencies and 13 NGOs inside and outside
the country for HIV/AIDS prevention activities.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar formed the National AIDS Committee in 1989 at the
central level with the participation of various government
departments and NGOs such as the MMCWA for the fight against
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to available official data, there were 17,846 HIV
positive people and 2,337 AIDS cases in Myanmar as of the end of
1997.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Says No to Pinochet's Stopover If UK Releases Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government will
not permit the plane carrying Chile's former president Augusto
Pinochet to make a technical stop on its territory if Britain
agrees to release the general now detained in London.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made before Britain's House of Lords voted
against the immunity of the former Chilean military chief last
month, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The British government is expected to decide on Friday whether
it would extradite Pinochet to Spain on judicial requests or it
would send him back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso vowed "all the
solidarity to the Chilean government in its negotiations related
to the Pinochet episode, but not to the point of supporting the
general himself."
</P>
<P>
Cardoso will discuss the Pinochet matter with his Chilean
counterpart Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in a private meeting on
Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, where the two presidents will
participate in a Southern Common Market (Mercosur) summit.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile
and Bolivia joined it as associate members.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pledges Not to Enter Military Alliance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat pledged Saturday not to enter into any military alliance
against Israel and vowed to renounce armed struggle against the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"For our part, we wish to emphasize that the Palestinian side
does not seek today, and will not seek tomorrow, to enter into any
military struggle or any arms race with Israel or with any other
party in the area," he said in a speech at Sweden's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Sweden earlier in the day to celebrate the
10th anniversary of his statement in Stockholm which recognized
Israel's right to exist. The statement laid the groundwork for the
historic Mideast peace accord in Oslo in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the address to Swedish legislators, Arafat said he
understood "the depth of the fears of the Israeli people" and
their concerns on the security issue.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here expected an Israeli welcome to this new moderate
tone as Israel would definitely not want to see Palestinians in
military alliance with such close neighbors as Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated the call to solve the Palestinian refugee
issue, warning that without a fair solution to this problem, it
would be impossible for the Palestinian side to strike a final
peace deal with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that the warning was couched in the harshest
wordings in the entire speech.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, however, did not make any reference to the sovereignty
issue of Jerusalem, which is wanted by both the Palestinians and
the Israelis for their capital, saying only that it should be kept
open to all people and not cut apart by borders, barriers or
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Neither did he repeat previous vows to declare a Palestinian
state unilaterally by May 4 next year.
</P>
<P>
Pressed by journalists at the press conference that followed,
Arafat merely replied that Palestine had declared itself to be an
independent state as far back as in 1988 and has so far been
recognized by 127 countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's address was heard by Israeli representatives to the
anniversary celebration -- parliamentary whip for the ruling
right-wing Likud party Meir Shitrit and opposition Labor spokesman
Yossi Beilin, who also made speeches on the importance of
Israeli-Palestinian peace.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by representatives from Egypt,
Norway, Russia, the United States, the European Union and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had originally been scheduled to travel to Oslo Sunday
following his stay in Sweden but canceled the trip "due to the
critical situation" in the Palestinian territories where clashes
were reported between some Palestinians and Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
His aide said he wanted to return early to the territories for
timely actions to ease the tension there.

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka Asks for Loan to Prevent Sea Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
requested a soft loan of 74 million U.S. dollars from the Asian
Development Bank to take long-term measures to arrest sea erosion
in the country, the official The Sunday Observer said.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda
Rajapakse told the paper that his ministry also plans to build two
fisheries harbors at Negombo and Chilaw with this loan.
</P>
<P>
However, he said priority will be given to the south, which is
the most affected by sea erosion.
</P>
<P>
Sea erosion in the country, particularly along the southern
coast, has become a major problem for Sri Lanka in recent years.
The erosion has been mainly attributed to illegal coral mining.
</P>
<P>
It is largely responsible for displacing several thousand
families from their homes near the coastal belt in the south of
the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The short-term measures of putting up of either stone buffers
or sand pillows along the coastal belt to avert rough sea waves
from eroding the land, have been carried out for more than 40 to
50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Conservation Development of Sri Lanka has spent more
than 74 million U.S. dollars so far, which is exactly the amount
of the money the ministry has asked from the ADB to bring the
problem of sea erosion under control.

SHANGHAI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. General Motors and
the Shanghai Environment Protection Association and other
organizations launched a joint move recently on the use of clean
gasoline in China.
</P>
<P>
They say that companies that pollute in China should meet the
new discharge standards for waste gas to reduce pollutants and
improve China's environmental situation.
</P>
<P>
China will start to use lead-free gasoline widely in 2000 and
they encourage the use of fuel additives and the production of
environment friendly gasoline in the country.
</P>
<P>
They say that all GM cars exported to China are equipped with
catalytic converters and Buicks with this equipment will be
produced by GM Shanghai next April. After new discharge standards
on waste gas were listed in Beijing, Shanghai and other large
cities, cars without catalytic converters could not meet the
requirements. Enitem

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Equities staged a recovery
though the volume remained low on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)
market during the past week in the wake of hectic purchases by
foreign funds and domestic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index of the BSE, which moved in a narrow range
in the early days of the week, showed a net gain of 66.72 points
closing the week at 2,849.82 as against last weekend's close of
2,783.1.
</P>
<P>
The national index also gained 24.16 points from the previous
weekend's close of 1,242.33. The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index
were quoted up at 294.1 and 115.1 compared with last weekend's
close of 289.03 and 113.17 respectively.

<P>
The volume of business on the BSE, however, was very low at
45.88 billion rupees (1.11 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The volume continued to be low due to disinterest by investors,
who considered the present prevailing political situation
unfavorable for fresh investments in the stocks, traders said.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports of Red Beans up Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China's red bean exporters are
turning in an especially stellar performance this year although
their major traditional buyers, Japan and the Republic of Korea,
have been heavily hit by the Asian financial turmoil, today's
Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the General Administration of
Customs, China's red bean exports amounted to 34,800 tons during
the first nine months, surging 60 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Turnover reached 16.5 million U.S. dollars, a 52 percent
increase from last year.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis has not exerted much negative
influence on China's red bean exports," an official with the China
Chamber of Commerce for Imports and Exports of Foodstuffs, Native
Produce and Animal By-products was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
The amount of Chinese red beans exported to Japan soared 113
percent from last year to hit 16,200 tons by the end of September,
with turnover rising about 100 percent to 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan used to depend completely on China to satisfy its large
demand-supply gap for red beans.
</P>
<P>
Although the Japanese Government has made efforts to reduce
this reliance, about 90 percent of Japanese red bean imports still
come from China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japan and the Republic of Korea each take 30 percent
of China's red bean exports, with Southeast Asian economies
absorbing the rest.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the strong growth of China's red bean
exports to the government's loosening of controls on red bean
export quotas early this year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ward off the impact of the crisis, the Chinese
government cancelled the export quota bidding mechanism for more
than 20 commodities, making them more accessible to exporters.

<HEADLINE> China to Promulgate Regulations on Prices of Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China will soon promulgate
regulations on medicine prices to pave the way for reform of the
country's health-care system, Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the regulations are aimed at
ensuring that major medicines will remain affordable to ordinary
Chinese people as government subsidies in health-care are
significantly slashed.
</P>
<P>
The new health care system aims to make individuals, work units
and the government jointly responsible for medical costs, instead
of the whole burden being shouldered by employees' work units.
</P>
<P>
The present medicine prices have been pushed up to high levels
by kickbacks, which are common practice throughout the health
sector.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the profit margins will be limited to within
five percent of the medicine's price set by wholesale and retail
to ensure that the prices should not be pushed up.
</P>
<P>
The government will reset prices for commonly used medicines
according to their current production and distribution costs. For
medicines whose prices are decided by producers themselves, the
government will put limits on profit ranges.
</P>
<P>
Importers of foreign medicines will have to report prices to
the pricing administrative organizations and get approval in
advance to redistribute and resell them.
</P>
<P>
Prices will be an important factor in decisions on import
licenses. If prices are found to be too high, the medicines may
not be imported into China, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will be imposed regardless of the ownership
structure of the medicine makers. Producers and trading firms
will suffer severe punishment, including stiff fines or even
closure, if they are caught not following the new rules on pricing.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will allow bigger profit margins for
medicines that demand high technological inputs. This provision
aims to spur domestic medical manufacturers to raise investment in
new and high-tech medicines to increase their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Medicine imports hit 500 million U.S. dollars in China in 1995,
compared to only 30 million U.S. dollars in the 1970s. And there
are 1,500 overseas-financed businesses in medicine-making industry
in the country.

<P>
BUDAPEST, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A Hungarian plane made an
emergency landing in Turkey after a drunk passenger attacked the

<P>
The news agency identified the Finnish passenger as Mikaeinar
Peterson, and said that he began to attack stewardesses
and passengers when the Bangkok to Budapest airliner was flying

emergency landing after the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
When the plane touched down, Peterson's body was taken to
hospital in Istanbul for determining the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying 190 passengers and a crew of six.
</P>
<P>
The crew members and several passengers were asked to stay in
Turkey for investigation. Other passengers arrived in Budapest at
7:10 p.m., 13 hours late aboard the same plane, which was flew by
a separate crew, reports said.

Beijing-based newspapers:

undertake a major move to improve the work style of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) next year.

<P>
The move called "three stresses" will target leading officials
at and above the county level through criticism, self-criticism
and education, with emphasis on studying theory, enhancing
political consciousness, and cultivating healthy trends.
</P>

<P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Studies European Monetary Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is studying the
functions and new systems of European monetary organizations in
the wake of a plan of the 13-member European Monetary Union (EMU)
to launch euro bank notes soon.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the EMU creating an entirely new global economic
system, jointly sponsored by the Central Bank of Myanmar and the
Dresdner Bank of Germany, was held here on Friday to study the
move.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein
urged local bank officials participating in the seminar to use
their knowledge for improvement of their services.
</P>
<P>
Matters relating to the EMU were also discussed at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a member of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
In October, the World Bank declared Myanmar ineligible for new
loans because it has not repaid the outstanding ones.
</P>
<P>
Regarding this, Myanmar responded by postponing the repayment
of loans to the World Bank until the latter resumes lending.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has suspended all loans to Myanmar since 1987,
charging that Myanmar is unwilling to modify the highly
distortional economic policies that the bank concludes have
created an environment in which external aid resources could not
be efficiently utilized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, although the impact of the Asian financial crisis on
 Myanmar has not been as serious as that on other Southeast Asian
nations, a further devaluation of the local currency has been
brought about after the introduction of the new 1,000-kyat bank
note last month.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerating Gold Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China is breaking industrial
and regional restraints in gold production, a decades-old monopoly
by the state, today's Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at achieving a sustainable growth of the
sector to meet the increasing demand for the precious metal on the
domestic market, Wang Dexue, director of the gold bureau with the
State Economic and Trade Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
With constantly improving living standards, Chinese people are
buying more gold articles for decorative and investment
purposes. Demand reached 213.8 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
China ranks third in the world in gold sales, after the United
States and India. But per capita purchasing last year was only 0.2
grams on average, 1.3 grams less than the world average.
</P>
<P>
To tap the potential, the country has begun to transform the
industry into a market-oriented one, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Other industrial sectors can explore gold resources after
gaining approval from the authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
Provinces with capital in hand can join in gold mining programs
in other provinces that have gold resources but lack funds.
</P>
<P>
The central government is also encouraging cooperation and
exchange in capital and technology with overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Yet due to declining gold prices and the government's
permission for foreign companies to explore only low-quality
mines, cooperation in the industry worldwide is at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu Shan'en, deputy director of the Gold Economic
Development Research Center, said that China had to depend largely
on its own resources to restructure the gold industry, and that he
was optimistic about the country's ability to realize successful
transition of it.
</P>
<P>
China's gold output reached 139.3 tons during the first ten
months of this year, up 18.4 percent from the same period of last
year. Total output this year is expected to reach 170 tons,
compared with last year's record high of 166.3 tons.
</P>
<P>
China's gold industry has grown for 12 consecutive years, with
annual average growth of ten percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Makes Fishbone Pictures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Gang, who lives in the
city of Tianjin, has made over 150 pictures using the bones of
more than 50 different types of freshwater and saltwater fish
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai office of the Guiness Book of World Records has
certified his fishbone pictures.
</P>
<P>
Zhao has produced the 4.5-meter-long "One Hundred Fish" picture
and the 0.5-centimeter-long seabed scene using fish bones.
</P>
<P>
Fish bones are superior to the bones of other animals, Zhao
explains, and almost every piece is usable. He uses the carp, with
its 360 bones, as an example. More than 50 of the bones are in
strange shapes and Zhao uses his imagination when looking at bones.
</P>
<P>
Gills can be used as coconut and pine trees, scales as grapes
and plum blossoms and Zhao can produce images of bamboo, peacock
feathers, camels, gourds, birds, and orchids.
</P>
<P>
Zhao was encouraged to make pictures as a boy. His interest in
fish bone shapes led to that of butterflies, cattle, and
elephants, all of this encouraged by his family.
</P>
<P>
Zhao has also found ways to remove the fat from the bones to
preserve them so that a fishbone picture can last for least 10
years.

<HEADLINE> EU to Discuss European Solution to Ocalan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said European Union (EU) foreign ministers will study on
Monday the feasibility of dealing with the case of Ocalan on a
European level.
</P>
<P>
Dini told reporters Saturday in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy,
that the monthly meeting of the EU's 15 ministers in Brussels
would provide an opportunity for "seeing whether a European
solution for trying Ocalan has the necessary backing."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers'
Party fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey, was
detained in Rome on November 12 and is now under house arrest in
Rome on the basis of a German arrest warrant, although Germany has
said that it would not request his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is Turkey's most wanted man, held responsible by the
Turkish government for thousands of deaths in his party's
14-year-old struggle for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
But an Italian court rejected Turkish demands for Ocalan's
extradition, sparking a dramatic deterioration in relations
between Rome and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A German and Italian backed proposal that Ocalan be tried in an
international court has been flatly rejected by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Dini tried to ease tensions by saying that it was "important to
obtain Turkey's approval for legal proceedings to take place
outside those countries (Germany and Turkey)."

The following is the third in a series of articles on the
fast-changing life and culture of the Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Shui, and
seven other ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
in southern China. They are being prepared by Xinhua reporters to
mark Guangxi's 40th anniversary on December 11.

<P>
Land Policy Harmonizes the Yao with Other Ethnic Groups (1)
</P>
<P>
NANNING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Dayao Mountain in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region is where most Yao people live in compact
communities. This region was once a battleground where the Yao,
Zhuang and Han ethnic groups fought over rights to the land.
</P>
<P>
The bloodiest fighting occured in 1884 when Hans who died in
battle were buried on a hill which came to be known as The Tomb of
Han.
</P>
<P>
A primary school is now on this site where the children of many
ethnic groups study and play together. Li Zhaojun, director of the
Ethnic Affairs Bureau of Jinxiu County, said there have been no
conflicts between ethnic groups in Dayao since the founding of new
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yulian, professor at the Central Ethnic Minorities
University, said that disputes over land was the major cause of
clashes among ethnic groups and among the Yao people themselves,
but the land policy of the Chinese government has brought a stable
and long-lasting peace to Dayao.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has 860,000 Yao people, divided into five branches, who
inter-marry and live together in harmony.
</P>
<P>
Farming land belongs to the collective and all farmers,
irrespective of their ethnic background, enjoys equal right. Farm
fields began to be distributed to each family for farming at the
start of rural reform in 1978, greatly heightening Yao's
enthusiasm for rural production. They then planted trees,
medicinal herbs and other cash crops in the previously barren
hills, which has brought them considerable economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The aniseed produced in Jinxiu county is exported to Hong Kong,
Japan and France and has earned 30 million yuan for local
farmers. By the end of last year, all the people in Jinxiu had
sufficient food and clothing.

income of this village has been increased to 6,000 yuan, and this
year, Chen was reelected head of the village committee.
</P>
<P>
Professor Liu, a native of Dayao, said that land reform put all
the ethnic groups on an equal footing, and the household
responsibility contract system solved the problem of food and
clothing, adding that the common prosperity of all ethnic groups
brought real equality and unity to Dayao.
</P>
<P>
A new round of land contract is now underway in Dayao, and the
thirty-year land contracts enable farmers to set long-term goals
for their farming. To date, 80 percent of the farmers here have
signed such contracts.
</P>
<P>
One villager said he worried about changes in state policy in
the past, but now, with his contract in hand, he no longer needs
fear that the state might take back the use right of his farmland,
and this makes him a better farmer, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Industries Grow Fast for Two Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The past two decades have seen
most fast development ever in the manufacturing sector of
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that since 1978, Shanghai's industrial
output value has increased at an average rate of 10.6 percent a
year, reaching 560.6 billion yuan in 1997, 6.8 times that of 1978,
and payment to the state has continued to rise at an average rate
of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic changes have taken place in the product mix of local
industries as well. As a result, sophisticate goods such as
integrated circuits, color TVs, and automotives and fax machines
have replaced the city's former leading products including
bicycles, radios, electric fans and sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this progress to the ongoing economic
restructuring and the reform of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old reform and opening drive have made local
industries an increasingly attractive sector for private and
overseas investors, who now contribute 53.4 percent to the city's
industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Shanghai has readjusted the local
industrial structure by placing light industry on the same footing
with heavy industry, while promoting the hi-tech sector, which now
generates some 16 percent of the city's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the manufacturing sector has taken steps to
explore international markets to a greater extent, and last year
Shanghai's exports surpassed 100 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Next President to Be Installed in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- If all goes according to plan,
Indonesia will see its fourth president taking the oath of office
on November 10, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Home Affairs
Faisal Tamin said.
</P>
<P>
"The plan is that on November 10, coinciding with National
Heroes' Day, we will see the new president and vice president
installed," Faisal disclosed during a meeting with university
students and rectors here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government has set the tentative date of October 28, which
is Youth Pledge Day, for the start of the general session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which will be formed after
the general election scheduled for June, Faisal was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the government has disclosed the
tentative dates for the general session of the MPR, which will
elect the country's president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
MPR Chairman Harmoko announced last week that the MPR and the
government had agreed to call a general election on June 7 and
convene the resulting MPR on August 28 for the swearing-in of the
members and the establishment of a working committee to prepare
for the general session.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is currently debating on three
political bills which will be the foundation of Indonesia's new
political system.
</P>
<P>
Faisal said that even as the house is still debating on the
bill, the government has begun preparations for the June election.
</P>
<P>
The government will begin registering the political parties
intending to contest the elections in January or February, he
said, noting that by Saturday, some 108 political parties had
registered their names with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration would begin in March or April, he said,
adding that the total number of eligible voters is expected to be
about 125 million, or 5 percent higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The campaign period will probably last a month and there are
now debates on whether a one-week "cooling off" period as in past
elections is necessary before the balloting day, he said.

<HEADLINE> HIV Positive Cases in Pakistan Reach 80,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 50,000 to 80,000
HIV infected cases have been reported in Pakistan which calls for
prompt and stringent steps at grassroots level to contain the
virus from further spreading.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media Saturday, Barjees Mazhar Qazi,
National Aids Program manager, said AIDS epidemic casts adverse
impacts on social and economic fabric of any community.
</P>
<P>
He said the HIV virus is a very deceptive one which even could
not be detected in many cases in five to 10 years even after
proper tests and investigations.
</P>
<P>
Qazi maintained that about 30 million people in the world today
are with HIV infection and one-third of them are young people aged
10 to 24.
</P>
<P>
He said that every day about 7,000 young people worldwide
acquire the virus. This means that around 2.6 million persons
become infected a year among young people, including 1.7 million
in Africa and 700,000 in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
He said young people account for at least 50 percent of all
those who become infected after infancy and in some countries the
figure exceeds 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Qazi asked Pakistanis to adhere to religious values and stick
to their life partners and avoid "unethical acts."

<HEADLINE> Munich Loses Top of German Bundesliga Standings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Bayer Leverkusen ended Bayern
Munich's reign at the top of the German Bundesliga standings
after three and a half months on Saturday with an impressive 3-0
hammering of VfL Wolfsburg.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen's win with the help of two goals from star striker
Ulf Kirsten clearly gives them the momentum going into next
weekend's top of the table clash with Bayern in Munich's Olympic
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Bayer stretched their unbeaten run to 13 games. For Wolfsburg,
it was the first defeat in 10 games during which they climbed
from last to sixth place in the standings.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen and Munich, who were held to a 2-2 draw at VfL
Bochum Friday night, have 35 points apiece. But Leverkusen's
superior goal difference ended Munich's run at the top that had
started August 22.
</P>
<P>
However, Munich have a game in hand, on December 16 at
last-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. Their coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld insisted: "We are in a good position. After all we are
playing Leverkusen at home."
</P>
<P>
In other action on a thin schedule due to three cancellations
by wintery weather, Jonathan Akpoborie scored a hattrick as VfB
Stuttgart held off SV Hamburg 3-1 the day after their coach
Winfried Schaefer quit after plenty of bad blood with the
players.
</P>
<P>
Struggling Schalke, meanwhile, left the relegation zone for
12th place by winning 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt. In another
match played Friday, visiting Hansa Rostock fought from 2-0 down
to a 2-2 draw in Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
But all attention was on Leverkusen, who have not lost since a
2-1 home defeat against Hamburg September 9 and conceded just one
goal in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
The sellout 22,500 crowd braving cold temperatures and snow
showers saw a cautious start from both teams as Leverkusen and
Wolfsburg showed a lot of respect for one another.
</P>
<P>
The opening goal came out of the blue in the 21st. Eric Meijer
stole the ball in midfield, marched down the right wing and sent
an accurate cross to Kirsten, who fired home from inside the
goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen took full control now and just five minutes later
Kirsten, back from a two-week injury layoff, got his ninth goal
of the season with a diving header off Carsten Ramelow's corner
kick.
</P>
<P>
Wolfsburg's only notable chance came in the 33rd, but Adam
Matysek got his fists up in time to stop Holger Ballwanz' short
range volley.
</P>
<P>
The hosts clinched the match nine minutes into the second half
with a short range effort next to the near left post from their
Brazilian midfielder Ze Roberto for what turned out the final 3-0
scoreline.
</P>
<P>
Stuttgart's woes seemed to continue under caretaker coach
Wolfgang Rolff when visiting Hamburg snatched a 37th-minute lead
through Bernd Hollerbach.
</P>
<P>
But the sparkling form of Akpoborie allowed the turnaround,
with the Nigerian striker on target in the 43rd, 46th and 51st.
Stuttgart moved up from 11th to ninth place.
</P>
<P>
The weekend action is completed Sunday when fourth-placed 1860
Munich meet number 5 Borussia Dortmund.
</P>
<P>
The matches Hertha BSC Berlin vs. SC Freiburg and Borussia
Moenchengladbach were rescheduled for Tuesday while MSV Duisburg
will now host reigning champions Kaiserslautern December 16.

LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A draw against Manchester

English Premier League standings.
</P>
<P>
Striker Julian Joachim fired a second-half equaliser to give
Aston Villa a 1-1 home draw with Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
United manager Alex Ferguson, in his first game since the
departure of influential right-hand man Brian Kidd to Blackburn
Rovers, was lifted by a 47th minute goal from Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
However, Joachim put his side level eight minutes later to

</P>
<P>
Kidd enjoyed a winning start at his new club, Blackburn
pulling off a 1-0 home victory against Charlton Athletic to move
off the bottom of the table.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday called
for legislations to require a "cooling-off period" of several days
before a prospective handgun sale despite a new system has made
background checking quicker.
</P>
<P>
"We must do even more to support the people and the laws that
protect our children and families," Clinton said in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go back to the days when dangerous criminals walked
away from stores with new guns, no questions asked," Clinton said.
"This cooling-off period will help prevent rash acts of violence
and give authorities more time to stop illegal gun purchasers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is implementing an
instant-check system that governing the purchase of handguns,
shotguns and rifles. The new system replaced a five-day waiting
period for handgun purchases only. The waiting period was to allow
local and state law enforcement authorities time to do background
checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, gun dealers must call to relay information
about prospective gun buyers to the FBI for computer records
checks, that could be completed within minutes. (US-Gun-Checks)

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Closer Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Saturday expressed the hope that the ongoing visit by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Turkey will help promote
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"We held the talks in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, "
Demirel told reporters after meeting with Mubarak, who arrived
here at noon for a two-day tour.
</P>
<P>
"There are strong bases in the relations between Turkey and
Egypt and there is no any problem existing between the two
countries," added Demirel.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Mubarak said "we hope Turkey will develop strong,
constructive and productive relations with Egypt and other Arab
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said it is possible for Turkey and Egypt to exert mutual
efforts in strengthening bilateral political ties. He added Cairo
has decided to carry on regular consultations with Turkey in a bid
to further their existing ties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the Turkish-Israeli relations, Demirel stressed
that the existing ties will not target any third country.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly growing Turkish-Israeli military and defense
cooperation has drawn harsh criticism from Muslim world and
Arab countries who fear it will change the region's balance
of power.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed a series of military and defense
accords which lay down that the two countries carry out joint air
forces training and that Israel helps Turkey upgrade its aged
fighters and tanks.
</P>
<P>
The naval forces of Israel, Turkey and the United States
launched joint exercises in the international waters of the
eastern Mediterranean last January, prompting strong protests
from Iran and Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: No E.U. Enlargement Timetable Till Late 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union cannot issue a
timetable for taking in European states until late 1999, said
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in an interview to be
published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This must really then offer a concrete and not a visionary
(membership) date," Fischer said in a Welt am Sonntag newspaper
interview made available in advance.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's remarks illustrate the deep contrast between
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's new government and former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl who had predicted Poland could become a
European Union (E.U.) member in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the chances for taking in new states in 2000,
Fischer replied: "Nobody believes that any more."
</P>
<P>
There would only be light at the end of the tunnel in
enlargement talks in late 1999, he said, adding this was the
earliest date for any E.U. expansion timetable.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the 15-nation E.U. will announce when it plans to take in
East European members over 10 years after the Berlin Wall's
collapse. In contrast, the NATO alliance will admit its first new
post-Cold War members next year: Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Looking toward next week's Vienna summit of E.U. leaders,
Fischer warned that Bonn would not pay the bills for planned
reform of the bloc prior to enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Germany wants its annual net payments to the E.U. of 22 billion
marks (13 billion dollars) to be cut as part of Union budget
reform under the Agenda 2000 package which will also seek to
revamp farm subsidy spending and infrastructure aid to the E.U.'s
poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder says he hopes to complete the Agenda 2000 by next
March while Germany holds the rotating E.U. presidency during the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We want this success but not at any price. None of our
European partners should believe they can just lean back because
the German government needs a success on domestic policy grounds,"
said Fischer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Waiting Period for Gun Purchasers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday called for legislations to require a "cooling-off
period" of several days before a prospective handgun sale despite
a new system has made background checking quicker.
</P>
<P>
"We must do even more to support the people and the laws that
protect our children and families," Clinton said in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go back to the days when dangerous criminals walked
away from stores with new guns, no questions asked," Clinton said.
"This cooling-off period will help prevent rash acts of violence
and give authorities more time to stop illegal gun purchasers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is implementing an
instant-check system that governing the purchase of handguns,
shotguns and rifles. The new system replaced a five-day waiting
period for handgun purchases only. The waiting period was to allow
local and state law enforcement authorities time to do background
checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, gun dealers must call to relay information
about prospective gun buyers to the FBI for computer records
checks, that could be completed within minutes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said during the first four days, 100,000 prospective
guns sales were reviewed and 400 felons, fugitives, stalkers and
other prohibited purchasers were stopped.
</P>
<P>
"That's more than 100 illegal gun sales blocked each day. Who
knows how many lives were saved?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president still wants handgun purchasers to face
waiting periods of three to five days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he will ask Congress to pass a legislation
next year for a lifetime gun-ownership ban juveniles convicted of
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the president asked Attorney General Janet Reno
and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to find ways to close a
loophole exempting people who buy guns at gun shows from
background checks.
