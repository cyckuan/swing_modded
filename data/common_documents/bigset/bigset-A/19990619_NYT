NATIONAL REPORT ON GAMBLING URGES A PAUSE IN CREATING CASINOS AND
GAMES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A national pause in the rush to ever more gambling
was urged Friday in a long-awaited report that people on both sides
of the issue touted.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission said gambling had
been a boon to local economies but a bane in the lives of millions
of people who fell victim to its promise of easy riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yielding more than $50 billion in gross revenues and still
growing, and with little end in sight to the proliferation of
gambling, our country stands at a crossroads,'' the commission said
in the opening paragraph of its report.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says states and Indian tribes that regulate most
casinos should consider a halt to more expansion until the true
costs and benefits can be weighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy formula for this,'' commission Chairwoman Kay
C. James said Friday. ``I am deeply disturbed by the impact of
gambling on the lives of individuals, families and on
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling industry has grown tenfold since 1975, and only
three states _ Utah, Hawaii and Tennessee _ have no form of legal
betting, the study found. There are now 100 riverboat or dockside
casinos in America, including nine in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The report offered other statistics: Revenue from legal wagering
had grown nearly 1,600 percent between 1976 and 1997; gambling
expenditure as a percentage of personal income had more than
doubled from 0.3 to 0.74; Indian tribe revenue had risen from $212
million to $6.7 billion since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission has issued an eye-opening report, which I hope
communities across the country will take time to consider,'' said
Rep. Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat who co-sponsored a House
resolution Friday to adopt the 76 recommendations in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling proponents took heart in the report, which found that
most Americans favored legalized gambling, that only a small
percentage were problem gamblers, that gambling created jobs and
that the industry was not controlled by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we come out of this looking very good,'' said Frank J.
Fahrenkopf Jr., president and chief executive officer of the
American Gaming Association. ``The commercial casino industry had a
good story to tell, and they made a good case to the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, also heard from people who went broke
at casinos and whose gambling addictions led to divorce, spousal
abuse and attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the study found, compulsive gamblers cost taxpayers,
employers and creditors $6 billion to $9 billion annually in lost
jobs, crime, bankruptcies, divorce and health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more convinced now than ever that gambling is a
destroyer, that it undermines the work ethic, that it is
devastating to those who give in to it and that it has major
implications for families,'' said James C. Dobson, a commission
member and founder of a Colorado-based group called Focus on the
Family.
</P>
<P>
   The commission study was about a lot more than casinos. Many of
its 76 recommendations focused on lotteries, horse and dog racing
and other forms of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Among its recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   Set the legal gambling age at 21 for all forms of gambling in
all states. The limit is already 21 in Missouri and Kansas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Scale back on advertising by state lotteries, especially
advertising aimed at the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate so-called ``convenience gambling,'' in which slot
machines and video poker machines are put in groceries, gas
stations, bars and other places at which people might play them on
impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Ban automated-teller cash machines inside casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Ban gambling on the Internet, in which people run up credit-card
bills placing wagers at home. Missouri and Kansas already have laws
against Internet gambling, laws that are being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibit bets on college and other amateur athletic events.
</P>
<P>
   Restrict what casino companies can donate to political
campaigns. Gambling interests gave $6.3 million to candidates for
Congress in 1997 and 1998, compared with $10.1 million the previous
eight years, according the group Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling-impact commission was appointed by the president
and leaders of Congress and held two years of hearings. The nine
members had strong views for and against gambling but reached
unanimous votes on most issues.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Coccimiglio, a gambling industry analyst for Prudential
Securities in New York, said the report was good news in that it
did not propose federal taxes on gambling and alleges no widespread
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainstream commercial industries, especially destination
casino resorts, come out well,'' he said. ``By and large, it's
pretty positive for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the federal government should not attempt to
override states and tribes on gambling regulations, except to ban
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's call on states and tribes to pause to consider
curtailing gambling's growth drew mixed reaction in industry. New
gambling operations are pursued only after some study is done, a
gambling official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that they don't think that is already
happening,'' said Pat Martin, director of external communications
for Harrah's Entertainment, which has casinos in Missouri and
Kansas. ``We work with the states on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has not approved a new casino in two years and only one
new casino is now under study, said Kevin Mullally, deputy director
for legal and legislative affairs for the Missouri Gaming
Commission. MORE
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had the go-slow approach and only when it appears
there is significant demand for a new facility have we licensed
one,'' Mullally said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, however, is considering loosening gambling regulations
by abolishing boarding time restrictions on the riverboats. At the
same time, efforts would be made to retain the $500 loss limit and
to move ATM machines off the boats.
</P>
<P>
   A halt to further development of casinos would hit the Indian
gambling industry hardest, said a spokeswoman for the National
Indian Gaming Association. The report said there were 260 Indian
reservation casinos, including four in Kansas, but Sheila Morago of
the Indian gaming association said her group counted 311.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos bring jobs and therefore more money and services to
reservations, many which are economically depressed, Morago said,
so plans are in place for more casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pause would be detrimental to some tribes,'' Morago said.
``Indian tribes have been in a pause for 150 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as gambling may boost the fortunes of some, it can sap
the resources of people it lures, the study said. In that regard,
lotteries took heat for spending about $400 million a year
nationwide on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, the state lottery spends about $8 million on
broadcast and newspaper advertising annually but does not aim at
the poor with images of quick riches, said a lottery spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the lottery, like any other business, you have to advertise
your product,'' said Gary Gonder, director of communications for
the lottery. ``We don't target any demographic area or race.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, said not enough consideration was being
given to the problems gambling could cause. It cites a study
showing that 2.5 million Americans are pathological gamblers and 3
million are problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on
Problem Gambling, said its study found that states spent only $20
million a year to deal with problem gambling and that 17 states
spent nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte's group proposes that every ad for gambling have a warning
about the addictive possibilities and that ads include a help-line
phone number.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Bible, a member of the national commission, said he
hoped that the group's legacy would be that it successfully pressed
for more research into the ills of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member advised a balanced view of the
economic and social effect of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically depressed cities that have been ignored by
private business are being helped,'' Richard C. Leone said. ``But
there is a price to pay unless we aggressively go after the
downside.''

A STROKE IS THE LATEST OBSTACLE TO CONFRONT SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT
DUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Every morning as Mike Daniels opens his
restaurant _ Jake Edwards Bar-B-Q _ he has an aching sense that
he's about to face the world with only one good hand.
</P>
<P>
   And if you understand the substance behind that figure of
speech, you know he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically, his other hand is a man named Jesse Smith. And
six months ago, at the age of 39, Smith had a stroke from which he
is now struggling to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 15 years it was just me and Jesse running this
place,'' said Daniels. ``We did it all together. I never would have
made it a success without him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until he met Smith, he barely made it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, now 41 and a former bricklayer, entered the restaurant
business alone and on a whim 18 years ago. It was almost a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   One of Daniels' relatives owned the building that housed the
restaurant popularly known as Jake's. And Daniels, who cleaned the
parking lot on weekends, got to know Edwards, a colorful, old-time
restaurateur, over a more-than-occasional beer.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, slick-bald and round as he was tall, was a
beer-drinking, hard-gambling, lovable fellow. But he wanted out of
his business.
</P>
<P>
   So one day when Daniels, then 23, drove up in a brand-new
Trans-Am, Edwards took a look and said, ``Kid, you ought to turn
that car in and use the money to buy this place.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Daniels did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold the car and bought Jake's for $10,000 on the spot. The
problem was that Jake just sort of left after that, sort of
disappeared. He didn't teach me a thing. And I'd never run a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really get things going until I met Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels met Smith one morning at a restaurant where Smith was a
short-order cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see Jesse knew what he was doing,'' Daniels said. ``So
I told him I needed help. He said he'd come over and take a look.
And he did. But he didn't say anything at first, and neither did I.
With Jesse, you sense right away that you don't tell him things. No
one tells him what to do. No one.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Smith's sister, Shirley Knighten, who raised her
brother after their mother died, is the rock-hard truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse's a stubborn, independent man,'' she said. ``He keeps
things to himself until he thinks they're ripe. Before that, he's
not showing you anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, barely out of high school when he met Daniels, looked
things over, pondered the situation, and finally said he'd help.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day on things changed,'' Daniels said. ``Jesse is a
really smart man. And working together we learned how to make this
place something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Together they mastered pit cooking, using only Ozark white
hickory, cooking the meat 24 hours, cooling it for days, aging it
in its own juice, and then bringing it back up to serving
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days in that kitchen we'd just look at each other and
say, `Wow, that's some good stuff,' &UR; '' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   They got rid of the restaurant's old meat slicer and began
carving every portion by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all trial and error. We taught ourselves how to slice
hot brisket so you could pull the meat apart like an accordion and
see light through it. It was that tender.''
</P>
<P>
   They created a new sauce, adding many fresh ingredients to Jake
Edwards' old recipe. They began making sweet potato fries, perhaps
the first in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   One year after they teamed up, a three-star newspaper review
raved about Jake's ``dark, sweet sauce,'' the sweet potatoes and
the ``intense naturally smoked flavor'' of the meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business tripled overnight,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz was on. Jake's was hot. A radio host called it one of
his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch hour a line of customers often extended half a
block up Main street.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their success, Daniels and Smith knew they were an odd
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like night and day,'' said Daniels. ``And maybe that's why it
worked. I'm an affable, beer-drinking kind of guy, and Jesse, well,
he's a world-class loner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that he is an artist, a musician, a photographer,
a kind of genius with electronics, but also a man who keeps his own
life very private. For years he never even gave me his phone
number. He was that solitary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we shared a desire for perfection in the restaurant. We
wanted every hand-carved serving to look like a picture. And we
went through some serious times together making it happen. We came
to trust each other completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Daniels married a Panamanian woman and had to
remain in Panama for five weeks, Smith took over the entire
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take long vacations in this business. And I wouldn't
have trusted anyone else to run the place,'' Daniels said. ``For
that alone, I owe him more than I can express.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith shouldered the added responsibility despite increasing
concerns about his own health.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   his own health.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago he lost an eye to diabetes, which left him even
more inwardly focused, more intense and solitary.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Jan. 5 of this year, just after noon, he suddenly
developed an agonizing headache followed by an eerie sense of
lightheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, he called no one, sought no help.
</P>
<P>
   He drove himself to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I don't understand how he did that,'' said
Knighten, his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was already becoming paralyzed on his right side, and his
car has a stick shift.''
</P>
<P>
   But he made it to Truman Medical Center's emergency entrance
before he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, hospital officials contacted Knighten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse couldn't move or talk at all,'' she said. ``I don't
think the doctors expected him to make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has.
</P>
<P>
   Several days ago, Smith was in the kitchen of his East Side
house, standing, walking, cooking his own dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take care of him,'' said his sister, ``but he wants
to do for himself. That's the way he's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in physical therapy six hours a day at Trinity Lutheran
Hospital, Smith has made astonishing progress.
</P>
<P>
   Although one arm remains partly paralyzed, and he still has
trouble forming complete sentences, he indicated that he intended
to return to Jake's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' he said. ``I will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says that to me every day,'' said Knighten. ``It's so
important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally important to Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Jesse I have to close down at five o'clock in the
afternoon during the week now,'' he said, ``because there's no
replacing him. I wouldn't even try. I wouldn't think of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as just me and Jesse, and that's the way it
will be again. It may take time, but he'll be back. If it can be
done, that man can do it.''

METS BEAT CARDS, 6-2, FOR 10TH WIN IN 12 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets invited trouble
for himself 12 days ago by placing a timetable on his job. Sitting
in Yankee Stadium, on the heels of a season-high eight-game losing
streak that had just cost three of his coaches their jobs,
Valentine said, ``I believe within the next 55 games if we're not
better, I shouldn't be the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Valentine has met his challenge. Because after the Mets
defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 6-2, here Friday night to give
them 10 victories in the 12 games since the skipper issued what
appeared to be his managerial death sentence, Valentine is off to a
pretty good start.
</P>
<P>
   At 37-30, the Mets are back to where they were when they began
the slide: seven games over .500, one shy of their season high. And
Friday night at Busch Stadium, a pair of 40-year-olds, Orel
Hershiser and Rickey Henderson, struck a blow for both Valentine
and middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (7-5) tossed five shutout innings of one-hit ball and
won for the fifth time in his last six starts. Valentine gambled _
and lost _ in the top of the sixth when he pinch-hit Matt Franco
for Hershiser with one out and the bases loaded in a 2-0 game. Juan
Acevedo struck Franco out, but Henderson followed with a two-out,
two-run single to center to help put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 starts with the Mets, Hershiser has lasted longer than six
innings just once. But the Mets' bullpen has been deep enough to
cover for him, as it did Friday night. Turk Wendell tossed two
scoreless innings in relief of Hershiser before allowing a 2-run
home run to Thomas Howard in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Later that inning, Armando Benitez came on with a runner on
first and walked Edgar Renteria on four pitches to give the
Cardinals runners on first and second with two out. But Benitez
roared back from a 3-ball 0-strike count to Mark McGwire to catch
McGwire looking at a 96 mph fastball for a called strike three;
McGwire had represented the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza then belted his 14th home run of the season to lead
off the ninth to finish out the scoring and extend his career-best
hitting streak to 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's blast provided the insurance for what was arguably
Hershiser's finest performance with the Mets. The right-hander, who
signed with the team near the end of spring training, faced two
batters over the minimum 15 through his five innings, as he earned
his 197th career victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser did it with both style and guile. He picked off the
first runner he allowed, Ray Lankford, who worked a walk to open
the second. The only hit Hershiser allowed was a lead-off single to
Joe McEwing in the fourth, and McEwing was erased when shortstop
Rey Ordonez made a nifty turn to throw out Renteria and complete a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Hershiser threw just 69 pitches, 47 for strikes. He
walked three and struck out four and was in trouble only once. That
was in the fifth, when he walked Fernando Tatis with one out and
then Darren Bragg an out later to give the Cardinals runners on
first and second with two out. But Eli Marrero flew out to right
and Hershiser departed with a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Over his last six starts, Hershiser has allowed 14 runs in 34
2/3 innings, for a very respectable 3.63 ERA. And Friday night's
outing followed a trend: Since the housecleaning that erased
pitching coach Bob Apodaca and bullpen coach Randy Niemann after
the Mets' eighth straight loss, the team's starters are a spotless
9-0 with a 2.82 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' hitters have done their share, too. One of the reasons
given for dismissing hitting coach Tom Robson was that the Mets
were leaving too many runners on base. Edgardo Alfonzo belted a
hit-and-run double inside third to score Henderson from first in
the third to give the Mets a 1-0 lead. And then, after Roger Cedeno
beat out a bunt single with two out in the fourth and advanced to
third on a wild pickoff attempt, the rejuvenated Ordonez singled up
the middle for the Mets' second run.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Cedeno and the 26-year-old Ordonez did their
best to represent their generation. Cedeno, who had missed two
starts with a bruised calf, had three hits and stole two bases, as
he extended his major-league lead in steals to 37. Ordonez had
three more hits in four at-bats to raise his season average to
.286. And that is significant because the Gold Glove shortstop has
never hit better than .257 in the major leagues.

 Former area teacher sentenced for statutory rape of student  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIM KOZLOWSKI  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ A Jackson County Circuit Court judge said
Friday that Amy Rodriguez appeared to be a good person who did some
bad things.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he sent the former teacher to prison for having sex
with a 12-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Court Judge John Moran sentenced Rodriguez, 39, to 10
years on each of three counts of statutory rape. The sentences will
run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   Moran also ordered Rodriguez to attend a sex-offender treatment
program and requested a report in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am responsible no matter what,'' Rodriguez told the judge.
``What I did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As an officer escorted Rodriguez from the courtroom, her
teen-age son and daughter wept.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had faced life in prison for taking a boy, one of her
sixth-grade students, to her home and having a sex with him on
three occasions in the spring of 1998. She pleaded guilty in March.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, W. Geary Jaco, had sought probation for his
client. After the hearing he said there was a slight chance that
the judge would release her after he read the 90-day report.
Otherwise, Rodriguez is likely to serve at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was glad that the judge allowed her to accept the
responsibility,'' Jaco said. ``She was glad the victim and the
family did not have to bear further trials because of this, and she
wanted to sincerely apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good result for her, and justice was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, an assistant Jackson County prosecutor, agreed. He
added that probation would have been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rape,'' Hunt said. ``I'm glad the judge recognized the
need for treatment. It's the proper sentence under the
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Before sentencing, attorneys called several witnesses, including
the boy, now 13, and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The boy testified that he did not initiate the relationship.
Rodriguez kept him after class, gave him rides home and took him to
a lake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to lie to my parents and say I was going to a
friend's,'' the boy said, looking down at times.
</P>
<P>
   His mother told the court that Rodriguez posed as the parent of
a classmate so she and the boy could spend time together without
arousing suspicion. But the mother sensed something was wrong. She
notified school officials after she found romantic cards and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, our lives will never be the same,'' his
mother said, her voice cracking. ``She's taken something from him
he'll never understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people took the stand to vouch for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Miller, a psychologist, testified that he had counseled
Rodriguez for about a year. She immediately took responsibility, he
said, but it was several months before she recognized the harm she
had done.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the last to take the stand, said she was ashamed of
the humiliation she had brought to the victim, his family and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to ask these people to somehow forgive me
someday,'' she said.

LAWMAKER SAYS HE HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ State Rep. Terry Riley said Friday that
Kansas City police are unfairly focusing on him in an investigation
into a reported break-in at the office of Mayor Kay Barnes' chief
campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Riley said detectives asked him Thursday
to turn over a copy of a document that described a St. Louis
company's strategy to privatize the Water Services Department in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who was elected as an independent from Kansas City,
referred to the document when he helped lead a municipal employees'
protest at City Hall two weeks ago that questioned the involvement
of Barnes and her campaign consultant Pat Gray with the company.
Riley also called for Barnes to resign and for U.S. Attorney Steve
Hill to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (police) are coming after me for what transpired
at City Hall,'' said Riley, who added he knew nothing about the
theft of documents from Gray's office. ``I guess this is what you
get when you try to stand up for the working people of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Police Chief Rick Easley declined to comment Friday
on Riley's allegations. ``That's under investigation,'' Easley said
of the break-in. ``We don't comment on active investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Barnes said she also would make no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who ran Barnes' successful campaign for mayor this spring,
did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gray reported that his office was burglarized in early March and
petty cash was taken. A supplemental police report, filed March 31,
indicated that ``documents'' also were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reported May 28 that Gray was working for
Environmental Management Corp. while he was running the Barnes
campaign. The company is part of a consortium called EA2/Systems,
which is interested in managing the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's involvement with Barnes' campaign and EA2/Systems at the
same time did not violate any laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, city workers and community activists were angered by
a document _ obtained anonymously through the mail by The Star _
outlining a plan for taking over Water Services. It included a
strategy to elect a mayor and council that favored privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has said she met twice with officials from EA2/Systems
before being elected March 30, and one 45-minute meeting included
Gray. She said she had not been influenced by Gray and that she had
been an advocate of exploring public-private partnerships for
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, city workers demonstrated for the second time in
two weeks at City Hall, demanding that Barnes explain her
relationship with Gray and EA2/Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, Barnes said the city has no plans to sell
Water Services and that she ``never has been coerced or urged to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said Friday that, to his knowledge, he's the ``lone
suspect'' in the police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange, because hundreds of people in this city have a
copy of that document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley reiterated that he did not burglarize Gray's office. At
the time, he was running for Kansas City's vacant 43rd District
seat in the Missouri House and said he had no political motivation
to break into Gray's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens in Kansas City when you call for an
investigation,'' Riley said. ``You get investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would turn over his copy of the document _ which he
said was put anonymously in his mailbox about the time The Star
article was published May 28 _ to police in the presence of his
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Fletcher called the questioning of Riley by
police a ``blatant abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you select Terry Riley as the person to investigate?''
Fletcher asked. ``It's not a coincidence that someone who contested
the actions of the mayor is subjected to a police investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron McMillan, a community activist who attended both City Hall
protests, appeared at the news conference in Riley's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tactics are not new,'' McMillan said of Gray. ``Setting
people up. Political intimidation.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Knicks' brazen Latrell Sprewell glared at the
Spurs and scowled at them, too. But the unassuming Tim Duncan and
the serene David Robinson just took all of the aggression and
intensity he brought with every drive and slapped it silly.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks had no answer for the Spurs' towering
duo, who combined to block nine shots and lead the San Antonio
Spurs to an 80-67 victory tonight in Game 2 of the NBA finals at
the Alamodome. The Spurs, who took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7-game
series, were led by 25 points from Duncan, who was dominating.
Robinson and Duncan combined for 41 points and 26 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had 19 points from Allan Houston and 26 from
Sprewell, but Sprewell shot 8 for 22 and tried to make every trip
down the floor a one-on-one challenge. As a team, the Knicks shot
32.9 percent from the floor, while the Spurs shot 42.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The series will move to Madison Square Garden for the next three
games, if three are necessary, beginning with Game 3 on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks came into the game understanding how timid they had
become as Game 1 wore on, how their layups had been too tentative
and their drives too awkward as they tried to steer around the
shot-blocking force of Robinson and Duncan in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know they are there,'' Sprewell said. ``Those guys
are good. You have to have a certain amount of respect for them.
But you can't let that respect make you soft going to the basket.
You have to go in strong and hard and still think attack.''
</P>
<P>
   They went in strong and hard to start the game. Houston and
Sprewell made repeated attacks on the rim in the first half, but
almost every single dunk and layup had to go through Duncan and
Robinson, who combined for six blocks in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, the Knicks kept coming, and by sheer volume of
attempts _ 47 first-half shots compared to the Spurs' 34 _ they
managed to come through just enough to stay close, trailing by
39-34 at the half. With Sprewell playing a lot of one-on-one
basketball, the Knicks shot 29.8 percent for the half, while the
Spurs methodically hit 44.1 percent, riding Duncan's 12 first-half
points.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell also had 12 points in the half, but was 4 for 12 from
the field. Next to him, Houston scored 11 points on 5-of-10
shooting. More efficient, Houston was the calm beside the stormy
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the second half, Sprewell was spotted
sitting outside the locker room, with one teammate beside him,
staring straight through the cinderblock wall before him. He was a
picture of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell came out firing the ball in the third period, but he
was backing away from driving and reverting to jump shooting and
missing. Meanwhile, the Spurs were living inside the paint, with
Robinson and Duncan each converting 3-point plays on the way to a
49-38 lead with 7 minutes 30 seconds left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The never-say-die Knicks started creating opportunities by
forcing the Spurs into turnovers and taking advantage of missed
shots by Mario Elie and Sean Elliott. While Duncan and Robinson
were doing their thing, the Spurs' perimeter players were missing
open shots. Those misses allowed Houston to get hot and bring the
Knicks to within &UR;  &LR; three points.
</P>
<P>
   But after failing on three straight possessions, the Knicks
allowed Elliott to dart inside for a layup while drawing a foul on
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The layup was good, but when Elliott missed the free throw,
Marcus Camby allowed Duncan to slip inside him, grab the rebound
and go up for a dunk with 0.7 seconds left in the third period to
give the Spurs a 56-49 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first half had been a study in frustration for the
Knicks. At one point, Sprewell, who was 2 for 8 in the first
quarter, began airing out his frustrations by trash-talking at
Elliott. It was as if Sprewell was trying to maintain the edge and
anger he needed to keep forging into the paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks missed six shots in the first quarter going right at
the rim, part of the reason they finished the quarter shooting 25.9
percent, and were behind, 20-15. The Spurs' frontcourt duo was
causing damage without drawing fouls. As hard as it was to believe
after Game 1's foul fest, there were no team fouls in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second started with plenty of whistles as the aggressors,
Robinson and Duncan, went to the free-throw line on consecutive
possessions and the Spurs built a 22-16 lead with 10 minutes left
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed a lift, and they got one when Camby came in
and countered the lengthy twin towers with some long arms and
lively steps of his own. He scored on a layup, then came back with
a runner to pull the Knicks to within 22-20 with eight minutes left
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Knicks crept close, the Spurs began to make them pay
for double-teaming Robinson, who passed out beautifully to the open
man. Two jumpers and a 3-pointer later, the Spurs had a 29-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same issue that haunted the Knicks in Game 1, when
they left Jaren Jackson open to bury them from the perimeter with
five 3-pointers. But just as in Game 1, the Knicks found a way to
stay close despite their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind, 39-30, the Knicks finished the half with a
drive by Houston for a layup and a trip to the free-throw line by
Sprewell, who hit both free throws with 4.7 seconds on the clock,
cutting the Spurs' lead to 39-34 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' gutsy shots and their uninhibited attempts to drive
to the basket despite the presence of Robinson and Duncan were part
of an effort that helped them stay with the Spurs, who were
dominating in every way but the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not intimidated,'' Sprewell had said. ``We're not
intimidated at all.''

STRAWBERRY AWAITS HIS FATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Darryl Strawberry received a 120-day
suspension Friday from Major League Baseball, it remains uncertain
whether he will return to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, the former Dodger whose long-awaited punishment for
possession of cocaine and solicitation of a prostitute last April,
has been waiting for a decision since negotiations started between
the Major League Players Association and the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is retroactive to April 24, the day Strawberry
was given an administrative leave by the commissioners office. He
was arrested April 14 in Tampa, Fla. Strawberry, 37, pleaded no
contest to the charges on May 26. He was tested for drugs the day
before his arrest, which proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig was seeking a season-long ban as part of
his increasing hard line against drug offenders, but several
factors weighed in Strawberry's favor _ including his battle with
colon cancer and his previously clean record regarding his drug
aftercare program. Selig also wanted to avoid a lengthy appeal
process by the union.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry completed a one-month drug rehabilitation program in
1994 when he played with the Dodgers. He was suspended for 60 days
in 1995 after testing positive for cocaine. He also underwent
treatment for alcohol abuse in 1990 when he played for the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether Yankees owner George Steinbrenner will
bring back Strawberry after he becomes eligible to play later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the commissioners decision and have no further
comment at this time,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad dropped: Angels manager Terry Collins is such a fan of
Darin Erstad that he was quick to point out that Friday's demotion
from the leadoff spot to No. 7 was just part of the club's strategy
against left-hander Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad entered the game batting .242 and his average was only
that high because of a seven-game hitting streak (.357, 10 for 28).
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Erstad went 1 for 3 with an eighth-inning single
that followed Troy Glaus' home run.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh is the lowest Erstad has batted this year. He has led
off 36 times, batted second twice, third 13 times, fifth six times
and sixth six times. But Collins, pointing out two solid seasons
that included an All-Star appearance last year, said Erstad is not
overwhelmed by trying to live up to past performance..
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody works harder or impresses you more with his dedication
than Darin,'' Collins said. ``We just wanted to switch things up a
little. It is nothing more than that.''

FOR EWING, THE TOUGHEST ACT OF ALL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He smiles and swears that he is wrapped up in
rooting, just another well-dressed fan with a courtside seat.
``Just like the Indiana series,'' said Patrick Ewing, but you know
this has to be an act, the toughest act of all, sitting close
enough that he can practically feel the finals he can't touch.
</P>
<P>
   He can't limp out there, even to be just another 7-footer, a
tag-team defender against Tim Duncan and the Spurs. If Ewing could
have played, Larry Johnson would not be asked to do what he can't,
cover a highly skilled player half a foot taller. It would be the
most bitter irony of all if the Knicks don't win because Patrick
Ewing couldn't be a generic big body, another six fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the NBA finals began Friday night with an air of
premature inevitability, based mostly on Game 1's having been an
extension of pre-series conventional wisdom. This is not the first
time people have overreacted to one game, but the view from here
was that the Spurs looked unbeatable only when Duncan or David
Robinson were posting up against a gimpy Johnson, waiting for him
to foul, or grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-5 against a 7-1 guy, and that's going to hurt,''
Robinson said, matter of factly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have Patrick, we're short-handed,'' said the Knicks'
assistant coach, Don Chaney. ``Larry's going to have play one of
the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago in Houston, Ewing could have stepped in at any
point in the fourth quarter of Game 7 and demanded the ball from
the wild-eyed John Starks. The Knicks needed him to be the
franchise player against Hakeem Olajuwon then. Not now. Not here.
Thirty-some minutes matching up against Duncan or Robinson would
have been sufficient, along with a few short, spot-up jumpers when
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston found themselves looking up at
the towers inside the lane.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility ended with Ewing's torn Achilles' tendon early
in the Indiana series. Are we still allowed a teeny criticism of
Ernie Grunfeld's roster construction? Given the advanced age of the
Knicks' two centers, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to have had
41-year-old Herb Williams and Georgetown alum David Wingate taking
up space as proverbial good guys and friends to Ewing. Buck
Williams, or some other veteran of interior playoff wars, sure
would be useful now.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that's retrospective nit-picking, but front-line
attrition was one of the primary issues confronting Jeff Van Gundy
Friday night at the Alamodome _ the reality of finally confronting
a go-to star at the top of his game, of moving far up in class from
Rik Smits, the foul-plagued Pacer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smits is big, 7-4, but you can get into his legs and he's not
the athlete that Duncan is, as far as catching and finishing,'' Van
Gundy said. ``With Duncan, if you play behind him, he can keep post
position because he's so strong. If you double him after you play
behind him, he's a great, great passer. And if you front him, he's
got great strength and hands. And then Robinson makes the high-low
pass as well as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The operative word here is great, but as has been the case with
every great player, rising to the level of championship greatness
requires impeccable fundamentals as well.
</P>
<P>
   When David Stern's handpicked committee to restore fluidity and
scoring to professional basketball convenes on Tuesday in New York,
the first order of business should be popcorn and a movie. Watch a
Game 1 tape of Duncan, the emerging standard-bearer who doesn't
waste motion, who shoots layups when he can dunk, who intuitively
understands the difference between a decent shot and a better one.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, widen the lane, make it tougher to grind. Just
don't think the dearth of offense is all related to athleticism and
rules. Duncan, like Olajuwon, didn't grow up with Amateur Athletic
Union coaches trying to raise their own profiles through a
developing adolescent. Maybe that is something for the NBA
committee to look into: the notion that American kids place a
higher priority on winning than learning.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks went through three playoff series and did not meet up
with one player who made them pay a price, no matter which tactic
they tried. Ewing, competitive against Alonzo Mourning on one good
leg, could not have stopped Duncan any more than Chris Dudley,
Marcus Camby or Kurt Thomas. But one more big man would have freed
Larry Johnson from the task of needing a ladder to guard an agile
7-footer. This series was already a tall enough order for the
Knicks. &QL;

HARRY S. TRUMAN GOOD NEIGHBOR AWARD FOUNDATION SELECTS NEW
PRESIDENT AND APPOINTS FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOARD MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award
Foundation has selected a new president, as well as the first
African-American member to serve on its board.
</P>
<P>
   Business executive Charles W. Battey is the president of the
foundation, which gives an award each year to a national figure who
exemplifies the ideals of President Truman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of the foundation's rich history, but it is
an appropriate time for a changing of the guard and to reappraise
what we have done,'' Battey said.
</P>
<P>
   Battey, of Mission Hills, Kan., replaces Philip Pistilli, the
Kansas City hotel executive who had been foundation president since
1982. Pistilli will now be foundation chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The first black board member is Cordell D. Meeks Jr., a
Wyandotte County District Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   The changes suggest the arrival of a new era for the foundation.
In the last year the foundation has been criticized for not having
selected an African-American to receive its annual award, and also
for having little diversity on its governing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cordell Meeks is a good start,'' Battey said. ``We
want to be more inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said he joined the board for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He has several friends on the board. He shared a dormitory with
one of them, Willard Snyder, at the University of Kansas in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   His late father, Cordell D. Meeks Sr., was a friend of Truman's
and served as a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention
in Philadelphia. The younger Meeks also has long admired Truman's
initiatives on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more than just trying to satisfy the board's need for
diversity,'' said Meeks. ``It is also a strong desire on my part to
honor the name of Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new board members are Kevin Pistilli of the Raphael Hotel
Group and E. Gerald Farrell, a Kansas City accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Last year U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright criticized the
foundation for not having selected an African-American to receive
the annual award, which the foundation has presented since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The first black honoree was historian John Hope Franklin,
honored last month.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation board member for about 15 years, Battey was
chairman and chief executive officer of KN Energy of Lakewood,
Colo., from 1989 through 1994. Before then he held various
executive positions with United Telecommunications, predecessor of
Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the foundation's financial future. Battey
deemed the foundation's condition ``satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the board recently decided to charge a fee _ yet to be
determined _ for persons who attend the annual lunch at which the
Good Neighbor Award is presented. The fee would help sustain both
the event and the scholarships the foundation awards each year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a change for the foundation, which has followed the
tradition established by Kansas City businessman Henry Talge, who
for years organized the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never charged for lunch,'' said Battey. ``Mr. Talge
wanted to celebrate Mr. Truman's birthday, and it started
relatively small.''
</P>
<P>
   Talge, who died in 1990, did leave money for the foundation. But
the lunches have grown along with their cost. In recent years about
500 guests have attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we as a board chose, we could (serve lunch free) for a few
more years more and then go out of existence,'' Battey said. ``But
we want to perpetuate the foundation.''

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The flexibility that manager Davey Johnson says
is missing from the Dodgers' offense could return today with
left-handed hitting Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth went 1 for 1 with a double and was hit by a pitch
in a rehab stint for Single-A San Bernardino on Friday. Barring a
setback, he's slated to be activated before this afternoon's game
against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said if Hollandsworth, nursing a sore oblique muscle in
his right side, is ready, he wouldn't hesitate using him to rest
his outfielders, particularly Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes through clean, we have the option to use him,''
Johnson said. ``I think we need to start trying a few different
things, getting more people in the lineup, rest more people, using
the whole bench more often. . . . I'm going to be able to rest a
few guys with the left-handed bat.''
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, Johnson talked extensively about using
Hollandsworth to rest each of his outfielders and give him a
left-handed bat against a tough right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was ideal in the series opener against the
Phillies, who started Curt Schilling. Sheffield sat out with
tightness in his hamstring but was replaced by the
right-handed-hitting Trenidad Hubbard because the Dodgers don't
have a left-handed-hitting reserve outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the bench has a purpose, not just to sit there,''
Johnson said. ``It's been difficult for me to rest a guy like
(Eric) Young and use (Tripp) Cromer against a tough righty. I
planned on (Hollandsworth) being a big part of the club, but with
his hamstring and his ribs, I haven't been able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth's missed 29 of 65 games and is on the disabled
list for the second time. He started in center field for San
Bernardino at Bakersfield. In his brief spell with the Dodgers,
he's hitting .304.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey's thinking, and he's right, we've been short-handed most
of the year in getting the proper matchups,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``This should help. We'll wait and make
sure Hollandsworth is healthy, though.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers activate Hollandsworth, they'll most likely
trim their pitching staff from 12 to 11. The pitchers to lose out
are either Doug Bochtler or Mike Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers make a decision based on performance, it could
mean the left-handed Bochtler, who has a 5.54 ERA in 12 games.
Maddux, a right-hander, has a 2.25 ERA in 14 games with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slow starters: The Dodgers entered the Phillies series with
11 losses in their last 15 games, and part of it is the
slow-starting offense. Adrian Beltre's second-inning homer off
Schilling was the sixth run the Dodgers scored in the first two
innings in their last 16 games. They've scored three runs in each
of the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Young) and myself, we're trying to do too much,'' said
Vizcaino, who is 11 for 49 (.224) and scored five runs since being
activated June 4. ``You have to be more patient. You have to think
it through, but sometimes it comes more natural. If you have a
plan, most times you're going to be successful. I guess we're
trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson reiterated what bullpen coach
Rick Dempsey said a day earlier by stating that he thought Todd
Hundley might be ready to catch next weekend in San Francisco.
Hundley has been working vigorously on the side with Dempsey the
last four days in a mini-spring training. ``I probably could have
done this out of the spring. Halfway in the back of my mind I knew
better, but I was hoping,'' Johnson said. However, Johnson didn't
say Hundley would take back the every-day catching duties. . . .
With Sheffield sitting, Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros each moved up
a slot to bat third and fourth. . . . Young has 23 steals but one
since May 26.

KC GIRL WRITES BOOK ABOUT AVIATOR, FRIEND OF EARHART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the better part of 18 months, Sara
Rimmerman, budding writer, and Fay Gillis Wells, pioneering aviator
and friend of Amelia Earhart, talked long-distance nearly every
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, 12, of Kansas City, was writing a book about Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, 90, was giving her plenty of material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so amazed,'' Sara said. ``If she was talking about
someone famous, she'd just kind of mention it and go on. And you're
like, `Wait. You worked with him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She talked, of course, about Earhart, with whom Wells founded
the International Organization of Women's Pilots, which today has
more than 6,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   But she also talked about helping Oklahoma aviator Wiley Post in
1933 become the first person to fly solo around the world. And she
told about world travels. As a correspondent for the New York
Herald Tribune in the 1930s, Wells covered a war between Ethiopia
and Italy, dignitaries in the Soviet Union and movie stars in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stories appear in Sara's 40-page paperback book,
Hidden Heroine, which was released Friday by Zeus Publications of
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The book will go on sale again July 24 at the Atchison, Kan.,
annual celebration of Amelia Earhart's birthday. It is not yet
available in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Sara said the idea for the book came in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, of Alexandria, Va., had spoken to Debbie Sack's
third-grade class. Sara's sister, Rachel (who wrote a poem that
appears in the book), was in the class and came home talking about
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's excitement rubbed off on the whole family. Her mother,
Carol, a retired English teacher, asked Sack whether they could
meet Wells someday. Later that year Sack arranged a lunch with
Wells, who was visiting in the area.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch, Wells entertained with stories about her life.
Sack, Sara recalled, asked Wells whether anyone had written a book
about her. No one had.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sack turned to Sara and said, ``Well, Sara, you like to
write....''
</P>
<P>
   Sara accepted the challenge. She spoke to people who knew Wells.
She thumbed through files and clicked away on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I started writing it as a report,'' Sara said.
``Then it got really long, so I started breaking it up (into
chapters).''
</P>
<P>
   With editing help from Sack and another teacher, Sara finished
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The book takes a chronological look at Wells' life, starting
with her birth in Minneapolis. Sara recounts many adventures,
including how Wells survived the midair disintegration of a plane
in 1929 when she was taking flying lessons in Long Island, N.Y.
(Wells parachuted unhurt into a tree.)
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with the creation of the International Forest of
Friendship. Wells came up with the idea for the forest, which
includes trees donated by each state of the union, as a
bicentennial gift to Atchison from the International Organization
of Women's Pilots. In a concrete path winding through the forest
are the names of people who have made significant contributions to
aviation and aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   One day this week, Sara and Wells sat on a bench in the forest
near a gazebo named after Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Sara talked about Wells. But Wells seemed more interested in
talking about Sara. She showed off the necklace Sara had made her,
a string of small wooden cubes that spells out Wells' name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not just a writer,'' Wells said, listing Sara's other
passions: basketball, percussion, dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Sara interrupted: ``I don't take dance anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't dance?'' Wells said. ``Honey, it's the beginning of
your life. You've got to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sara is content to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd like to try a mystery next,'' she said.

PETTITTE ENDS SLUMP AS YANKEES DOWN ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe Andy Pettitte needed to see his father in a
hospital bed again to give himself some perspective about his
pitching slump. Maybe Pettitte needed to feel that queasiness in
his stomach again to remind himself that baseball is merely a game.
Maybe Pettitte needed to be shocked off the field in order to relax
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for his revival, Pettitte was very relaxed
Friday night while pitching the New York Yankees past Chuck Finley
and the Anaheim Angels, 4-1, at Yankee Stadium. Pettitte's best
game of the season ended a vicious slide in which he had lost three
straight starts while allowing 15 earned runs in 13 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Pettitte returned from visiting his ailing
father, the Yankee left-hander was matched against the Angels'
left-hander who usually owns the Yankees. Finley was solid, as
usual, but Pettitte was superb in stifling Anaheim on one run and
five hits in 7 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my Dad today and he told me he was feeling better
than he has in 20 years,'' said Pettitte, who chuckled at the
obvious ploy designed to calm him. ``I told him, `Whatever. This
game is not that important. I'm worried about you.' It's easy to
focus once you get out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   With their new No. 3 hitter, Derek Jeter, scoring one run,
driving in one run and getting two hits, the Yankees scored two
more runs than they had managed in the preceding two games and
halted the Angels for the first time in four games. Still, the
Yankees were most pleased with Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best he's pitched all year,'' said Jeter.
``He had a sinker and a cutter. Hitters didn't know what to look
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's performance was a dramatic change from last Sunday's,
when he was battered for six runs in an ugly 8-2 loss to the lowly
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettitte returned to New York around midnight, he learned
that his father, Tom, had been hospitalized because he felt pain in
his chest. The 49-year-old Tom Pettitte underwent double-bypass
heart surgery last Oct. 16, five days before his son clinched the
World Series title in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pettitte received the sobering news, he never slept. The
pitcher had a car service pick him up at 4 a.m. and he took a 6
a.m. flight to Houston on Monday and spent the day with his father.
While a battery of tests showed that Tom's heart was fine, he is
scheduled to be examined by a neurosurgeon to determine the reason
for his dizzy spells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still gets light headed and that's not right,'' Pettitte
said. ``He's off from work, so hopefully it'll help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte needed no help Friday night through the first seven
innings. How efficient was he? Until Troy Glaus belted a homer with
one out in the eighth, the Angels did not have one runner reach
second. After Pettitte allowed a single to Darrin Erstad, he was
replaced and received a rousing ovation. The game got stickier, but
Mariano Rivera stranded a total of four runners in the eighth and
ninth for his 18th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very calm tonight,'' manager Joe Torre said of
Pettitte. ``That told me he was in that zone I've seen him in so
often in '96 and '97. Tonight was one of those nights. He didn't
have that distressed look in his eyes. He was very calm and very
determined. This is big for him, especially with what he's been
through in the last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre made a lineup change that he had been mulling for several
days when he shifted Jeter from second place to third and put
Bernie Williams second. Jeter, who is second in the American League
in batting at .377, had never batted third in his blossoming
career.
</P>
<P>
   The switch worked because Jeter scored the first run and knocked
in the third as the Yankees ended a streak of six straight losses
to Finley. After Finley hit Jeter in the ribs in the fourth, Jeter,
who was also drilled by Anaheim's Troy Percival on May 10, flicked
the ball away with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   When Chili Davis blooped a single to center, Jeter scampered to
third. On a 3-2 pitch to Scott Brosius, Davis, with little speed
afoot, chugged toward second base. As Brosius struck out, Matt
Walbeck, the Anaheim catcher, whipped the ball to second baseman
Randy Velarde, who was charging toward the plate. But as soon as
the ball left Walbeck's hand, Jeter scooted for home and was
credited with a steal as the off-balance return throw sailed past
Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, more shabby defense by the Angels and more
Jeter boosted the Yankees. Chuck Knoblauch singled and Williams
lined a ball to center that somehow skidded past Garret Anderson
and rolled to the wall. Knoblauch scored and Williams wound up on
third with a single and a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter ripped Finley's next pitch past the drawn-in infield for a
single to make it 3-0. Expect Jeter to bat third again today and
tomorrow and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything differently,'' said Jeter. ``It's just a
matter of my first at-bat being a minute and a half later.''

A RELAXED AL GORE APPLAUDS RUSSIAN DEAL, CRITICIZES GOP VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore on Friday voiced relief and
enthusiasm that the United States had worked through ``a sticky
wicket'' with the Russians on Kosovo, while excoriating the
Republican-controlled Congress as having ``nothing to show'' on gun
safety at home.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview as his plane approached touchdown in Seattle,
Gore decried House GOP leaders for their ``cravenness'' to the
National Rifle Association. The House early Friday voted to kill
legislation to force background checks on those purchasing firearms
at gun shows. Gore was here to wrap up a cross-country tour after
formally announcing his candidacy for next year's presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed, with wife, Tipper, by his side, the vice president
shucked his suit coat and hosted a town meeting on trade and
technology before about 400 people at the Seattle Center. Gore was
unfazed even when an animal rights protester yelled ``Whale
killer!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I come out here I appreciate the First Amendment
more,'' Gore joked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stopover in Seattle, his eighth visit since the 1996
election, took place against a backdrop of hopeful news abroad and
political impasse at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gore _ a key administration point man in U.S. dealings with
Russia _ celebrated the deal that ended the six-day standoff over
Moscow's peacekeeping role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an excellent agreement,'' he said in the interview. ``We
got everything that we needed. Cool heads prevailed. I believe the
forbearance shown by NATO was most impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian relations are ``back on the upswing,'' Gore added.
The vice president praised his friend, former Russian Premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin, for his ``great courage and wisdom'' in
helping bring about the withdrawal of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was particularly pleased that Russia stepped away from its
initial demand to be given a sector of Kosovo as its exclusive
peacekeeping zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Russian sector,'' he said. ``There is no partition
of Kosovo. It preserves the unity of command for Russian forces who
will serve in Kosovo. But all forces will follow common rules of
engagement. The (Russian-occupied) airport at Pristina will be open
to all KFOR (NATO-led) forces under procedures established by
KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Russia was trying to show by occupying the Pristina
airport in the first place, Gore joked: ``You'll have to ask
President Yeltsin the next time he's out here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, by contrast, Gore was talking the language of
a political Cold War. The object of his ire was a series of votes
in which the House of Representatives first weakened, and then
killed entirely, efforts to regulate gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defection of 45 Democratic House members on a key
vote, the vice president blamed House Republican leaders. He said
fear of the National Rifle Association caused lawmakers to ignore
public sentiment for gun safety stirred by shootings at high
schools in Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the House Republican leadership ended its work, it had
nothing to show,'' Gore said. ``After the nationwide soul-searching
over school violence that followed Columbine High, this is the
clearest demonstration imaginable that House Republicans and
Republican leaders around the country are doing the bidding of the
NRA _ not the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore charged that Republican leaders intended all along to head
off gun-control measures. The prospects for such legislation are in
turmoil after Friday's House votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some chance their plans will be complicated
by public outrage,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was trying to perform in a dual capacity yesterday _ as a
top policy-maker in the Clinton administration, and as a
presidential candidate trying to map out different policy
directions if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tricky role. Only one incumbent vice president in the
last 160 years _ George Bush in 1988 _ has won election to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore boasted of the 19 million new jobs that ``President Clinton
and I'' have created, and contrasted the administration's
performance to the ``economic catastrophe'' at the end of the
Reagan-Bush years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of quadrupling the national debt, we have nearly
quadrupled the stock market,'' the vice president said. He warned
that the ``extreme right philosophy'' of Republicans in Congress
could derail continued job and income growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was also seeking to position himself as an agent of
change. The vice president promised to work for ``revolutionary
improvements'' in public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems of 2001 will be completely different from what
Bill Clinton and I faced in the campaign of 1992,'' Gore added.
``We must continue to show economic strength, but use it to assure
that nobody is left behind. We need to revolutionize public
education. We need dramatic changes in public health care, and in
policies toward the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore laid out a number of specific programs. He promised
creation of a national college tuition savings plan, under which
parents can put away education money from the time of their
children's birth. The vice president would also create what he
called 401 ``J'' accounts, allowing citizens to set aside money for
future job training.
</P>
<P>
   As with Clinton in 1992, Gore identified himself as a Democrat
who supports expanded international trade _ with a caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will ask Congress for authority to negotiate new trade
agreements to expand our markets,'' Gore said. But he also pledged
to seek agreements governing working conditions and environmental
standards ``where possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few signals Friday day of a campaign to distance
Gore from Clinton. With nary a mention of turbulence in Clinton's
private life, the laid-back stability of Al and Tipper Gore's home
life was emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is incredibly committed to his family,'' Gov. Gary
Locke said in warming up the crowd for Gore at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts were also made to defuse the anti-Gore rhetoric of GOP
Sen. Slade Gorton, who has sought to blame the vice president for
the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was introduced at the Seattle Center by a Grays Harbor
County-based high-tech entrepreneur, Bo Wandell. The vice president
``promotes the information economy,'' said Wandell.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that, seven years ago, Washington's unemployment rate
was 8.5 percent with technology innovation ``stifled by huge
deficits and high interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign appears to be here to stay. In
less than three weeks, Gore and leading GOP presidential hopeful,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, are likely to make back-to-back Seattle
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be in Seattle on July 8, his schedule not yet
announced. Gore is tentatively slated to return the same week, for
UNITY '99, a convention of four national minority journalist
associations.

SPURS RIP KNICKS IN SLOPPY GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Break out the brooms, the NBA Finals has turned
into a Cakewalk on the Riverwalk.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's 80-67 Game 2 victory against the New York Knicks
last night was far from Spur-fect, but it gave the Spurs a
seemingly insurmountable 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series and
crept them within two victories of their first NBA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the second-lowest-scoring game in Finals history, Tim
Duncan's second-half offensive rebounding and 25 points performed
CPR on his team's gasping offense before Presidential hopeful
George W. Bush and an Alamodome crowd of 39,554 that spent most of
the fourth quarter chanting ``Sweep, Sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking sweep,'' Duncan said. ``But we like our
position. It wasn't the prettiest game, but that's our type of
basketball. We're not a pretty team, but our results are good.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, which topped the lowest-scoring Finals game of 145
points set by Fort Wayne (74) and Syracuse (71) in 1955 only with a
meaningless five-point flurry in the final 10 seconds, might have
been hideous, but it left the Spurs sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our margin for error just got real slim,'' Knicks coach Jeff
Van Gundy said. ``Our effort is fine, but we've got to find a way
to score against what is a great defensive team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks must now win four of the next five games against a
Spurs team that:
</P>
<P>
   Has won a record 12 consecutive playoff games, something not
accomplished by even Bill Russell's Celtics, Magic Johnson's Lakers
or Michael Jordan's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Is 44-6 since March, and hasn't lost consecutive games since
Feb. 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   Is 6-0 on the road in the playoffs, winning by at least seven
points and an average of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is scheduled for Monday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For historical perspective, last night's game might as well have
been a Game 7 for the Knicks,because only two teams _ the 1969
Celtics and the '77 Blazers _ have rallied from 0-2 deficits in the
Finals. For entertainment value, the game might as well have been
played at the local YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 33 percent (27 of 82), missed 12 of their 14
3-pointers, got a measly four fast-break points and never cracked
20 points in any quarter. The Spurs weren't much better, but they
did get 41 points, 26 rebounds and a crucial nine blocks from their
Twin Towers, Duncan and David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   How pitiful were the Knicks? Trailing 68-57 with less than three
minutes remaining, they inexplicably had shot-clock violations on
back-to-back possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got real stagnant on offense,'' Knicks forward Marcus Camby
said. ``Their big guys are really bothering us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who at one point were shooting 30 percent but
trailing by only three, self-destructed in the final five seconds
of the third quarter. After a Sean Elliott baseline layup and foul,
he missed the free throw. Duncan, however, beat Camby to the
rebound and his follow layup pushed San Antonio's margin to 56-49.
As in Game 1, the Knicks got no closer than six in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led 39-34 after a hideous first half that featured
air-ball jumpers, blown layups and fast breaks without finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took a 13-12 lead on a Latrell Sprewell transition
dunk, then went scoreless for almost five minutes because of their
carelessness, eight consecutive missed shots and San Antonio's shot
blockers. New York had four layups blocked, Camby blew a wide-open
layup and Charlie Ward committed silly back-to-back turnovers as
their frenetic pace didn't result in points.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led 20-15 after the first quarter but failed to widen
the gap despite the Knicks missing 18 of 19 shots during one
ridiculous stretch. A jump hook by Duncan over the smaller Larry
Johnson followed by an up-and-under layup over the weaker Camby
pushed the Spurs' margin to 38-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the core of our defense, intimidation and blocking
shots,'' Duncan said. ``We've got to affect shots, make them miss
and then next time make them take a bad shot.''

THIS TIME, FENWAY FRIENDLY TO RANGERS' MORGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last night marked the second start at Fenway Park for
39-year-old right-hander Mike Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The other occurred nearly 20 years ago, and Boston's Carl
Yastrzemski _ a Red Sox legend _ spoiled a 19-year-old pitcher's
afternoon by hitting his 400th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan surrendered another long ball last night, but this
second-inning, solo home run by left fielder Troy O'Leary would be
one of only three hits the Red Sox mustered during the Rangers' 4-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2, split-fingered fastball O'Leary hit over Fenway's
fabled Green Monster was the only blemish in Morgan's 61/3-inning
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good things have happened to me during my career in
those 20 years since then,'' said Morgan, who beat the Red Sox for
the first time and needs only victories against the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays to become the first pitcher
to beat 30 major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman recorded the final eight outs with
23 pitches and didn't allow a base runner for his first
major-league save, and first baseman Lee Stevens delivered the
game-winning hit with his sixth-inning, solo home run off
right-hander Mark Portugal (3-6).
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won their third consecutive game without catcher
Ivan Rodriguez, who remains sidelined after suffering muscle spasms
in his back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pitching staff continues to thrive with reserve Gregg
Zaun behind the plate. The Rangers have allowed only three runs
during Zaun's past three starts, which lends itself to speculation
about the significance of his role in the recent performance of the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   It could, of course, be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very fortunate here with Dave Valle, Bill Haselman
and now Gregg Zaun,'' manager Johnny Oates said of his reserve
catchers during his stint with the Rangers. ``All three of those
guys loved to catch when it was their turn, and you have to when
you're the backup and playing only once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zaun talks a good ballgame. I enjoy listening to him in the
dugout. He knows what he's doing out there behind the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan lacked the armor that knowledge brings before stepping
onto Fenway Park's mound on July 24, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A fly ball lost in the sun in foul territory prolonged
Yastrzemski's historic at-bat, Morgan recalled, and that allowed
the Hall of Famer another swing that resulted in a game-winning,
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even belong on the mound out there then,'' recalled
Morgan, Oakland's first-round selection and the fourth overall in
the 1978 amateur free-agent draft. ``I didn't even know what was
going on. I didn't know he was going for his 400th home run, and he
hit one out. I shouldn't have even been out there. I should have
been in rookie or low-A ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be much different for Morgan (7-5) nearly two decades
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight,'' Oates said, ``was probably the best game he's
pitched for us.''

ROBINSON HAS GOOD NUMBERS IN NO. 2 ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Being the San Antonio Spurs' undisputed go-to guy
and leader was something that no longer appealed to David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after he saw the way Tim Duncan was terrorizing
opposing players.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, earlier this season Robinson decided it was time for
Duncan to be the Spurs' headline player, and he graciously stepped
into the background. That, coincidentally, was about the same time
the Spurs rebounded from a horrible 6-8 start to launch a drive
that finds them within two victories of the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win, and I'll do anything that I can to help
this team win,'' Robinson said. ``Even if that means just
rebounding, blocking shots and playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it. The Spurs need Robinson _ as much
as they need Duncan _ to put the finishing touches on what has
become the finest season in the team's history.
</P>
<P>
   That was more apparent last night at the Alamodome during Game 2
of the NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, which the Spurs won,
80-67. While Duncan was putting on his usual star-studded
performance, Robinson was once again steady as a rock, finishing
with 16 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The five blocks were significant, because Robinson really
disrupted any hopes the Knicks had of establishing an inside game.
He also altered many of their shots, and the hapless Knicks shot
just 32.9 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Although Spurs fans often shower Duncan with chants of ``MVP,
MVP, MVP,'' Robinson said he has no problem with the adulation
directed at the second-year forward from Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, Tim deserves all of the accolades that he gets, and
probably some more that he doesn't get,'' Robinson said. ``He is
such a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even learned a few things from here. I just hope he
continues progressing the way he has because, if he does, the sky's
the limit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was one of the main reasons Spurs fans started chanting
``Sweep, sweep, sweep'' with less than three minutes left in the
game. The Spurs swept their two previous playoff series, against
Portland and the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is scheduled Monday night at New York's Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who collected 25 points and 15 rebounds last night, will
be the first to tell anyone within listening distance that he has
benefited handsomely from Robinson's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped me tremendously, not only as a player on the
floor, but just as a person giving me advice on the league, on
situations, on everything else,'' Duncan said. ``He's been a great
person to be there for me. It's been a lot of fun being with him.''

DUNCAN'S RETURN COULD HINGE ON NEW ARENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Are you sitting down, Spurs fans?
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan might leave San Antonio, and not just on today's
charter flight to New York for the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the biggest hero in this city since Davy Crockett, is
eligible to sign a contract extension this summer or become a
restricted free agent after the 1999-2000 season. Obviously, the
Spurs want to get the deal done now and lock up the game's best
player into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan's agent, and even Duncan himself are not so sure.
Spurs owner Peter Holt is desperately trying to get San Antonio's
taxpayers to vote on a new arena so the Spurs will no longer have
to play in the cavernous, football-first Alamodome. Holt has even
hinted of moving the team if a new basketball-only arena isn't
built.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who will command a maximum $70 million contract, has an
eye on the political red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a new arena is a big \Rfactor\S for me staying here,''
Duncan said. ``But now is not the time to think about it.
Hopefully, we can win this thing and give the new arena some
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Said agent Lon Babby, ``I don't think there's any urgency to do
Tim's deal now. Everyone understands that the timing is not the
best with the arena issue. And that's just an important piece of
information Tim needs to make his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate David Robinson is in the fourth year of a six-year, $66
million contract, but will also have the ability to opt out of the
deal after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are thoughts, but now is not the time for me to think
about it,'' Robinson said. ``Obviously with a team like this,
especially if we win it, there's no reason at all I would want to
leave. There's no amount of money in the world that would make me
want to leave after finally getting an opportunity to win. To put
together a championship or even two or three is an incredible
opportunity, so I probably would not even consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he stays in San Antonio, Robinson will make $13.3 million
next season and $14.7 million for the 2000-2001 season.
 &LR; subheds:Best and worst Best strategy: The Knicks' decision to
aggressively double-team Duncan in the post early in Game 2 forced
the Spurs to shoot perimeter jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Worst strategy: New York continually beat its head against a
brick wall, getting six shots blocked in the first half of last
night's game.  &LR; subheds:Numbers game 19: Players in the Finals
wearing Nike sneakers. Two wear Reebok and one each for Fila,
Converse and And1.
</P>
<P>
   10, 14, 15, 19: Four of the six quarter-point totals by the
Knicks through a game and a half.  &LR; subheds:24 seconds And you
thought Cowboys fans got into their team. There isn't a corner or
office window in San Antonio without the ``Go Spurs Go'' slogan.
One entire street near the Alamodome has put up its Christmas
lights early and the owners of a house mowed the slogan into their
lawn. ``We love the support,'' said Robinson, ``but they can get
out of control.'' The Spurs have a unique, small-town fan base of
65 percent public, 35 percent corporate. ... With the Sabres and
Stars battling for the Stanley Cup and the Spurs and Knicks playing
in the Finals, it's the first time since 1973 that teams from the
same state have played for major championships. It was 26 years ago
that the Knicks defeated the Lakers in the summer, followed by the
A's downing the Mets in the World Series. ... Surprising face in
the crowd was Vikings receiver Randy Moss. ... Because of NBC's
coverage of the U.S. Open, Game 3 of the Finals won't be played
until Monday night in Madison Square Garden.

PROPERLY WORKING VALVE MIGHT HAVE LIMITED PIPELINE SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The gasoline spill that culminated in a deadly
explosion and fire in Bellingham might have been greatly limited
had a valve worked properly, federal regulators say.
</P>
<P>
   A block valve, which is intended to close a section of pipeline,
is located just one-tenth of a mile north of where last week's
rupture occurred near Whatcom Creek in Bellingham, a town about 90
miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the valve ``either malfunctioned or was not closed in a
timely fashion,'' investigators found. As a result, up to 130,200
additional gallons were released, the U.S. Transportation
Department wrote in describing the preliminary findings of an
investigation into the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department estimated the total spill at
151,200 to 277,200 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   After fuel began leaking June 10, gasoline vapor ignited,
killing two 10-year-old boys. A teenager was overcome by fumes and
drowned in Whatcom Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Klinger, a spokeswoman for the department, said the
findings about the block valve are preliminary but still
significant. That is why the Transportation Department has ordered
Olympic Pipe Line Co. to test valves on the upper 37 miles of its
pipeline in the northerwestern part of the state. Regulators also
ordered the company to focus on valves in populated or
environmentally sensitive areas and add more if they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The block valve near the spill can be closed to stop the flow of
gasoline or other liquid fuel coming from refineries in Cherry
Point and Ferndale. It works by remote control, closed by operators
in a Renton office.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials are reviewing the preliminary findings and
aren't certain that the valve played a major role, said Joann
Hamick, a spokeswoman for Olympic Pipe Line Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know,'' she said. ``It's something they (regulators)
put there and it needs to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the company has already begun complying with the
Transportation Department's order, including reducing pressure on
some segments of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators trying to determine a cause of the spill and to
assess its aftermath will pay attention to the valve, said Keith
Holloway, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the SCADA (computer) system and operations
of valves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SCADA is a computerized system by which Olympic controls,
monitors and detects leaks in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't working right before and during the spill, according
to preliminary investigative evidence cited by the Transportation
Department, which oversees pipeline safety in the United States.
``System response time was reported as slow, and the system's
recording of some data was not consistent with normal operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say about an hour before they had the first
reports of a possible leak their computer system crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department also noted that the pipe in the
section that failed was manufactured before 1970 and had been the
subject of government warnings in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Pipe of its type had 12 failures of seams in 1988 and 1989,
prompting the Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety
to twice issue warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Office of Pipeline Safety also determined that
the same type of pipe developed hairline cracks as it was being
carried for delivery on railroad cars, Klinger said. The leaks
couldn't be seen by visual inspection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department urged operators who used this type
of pipe to make sure pipelines had corrosion protection, limit
pressure in them and to hydrotest them, which involves putting
water at high pressure through the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, they (Olympic officials), took corrective
action,'' Klinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary findings of the investigation are contained in a
Transportation Department order issued Thursday against Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   The order requires Olympic to keep the 37-mile section of
pipeline from Cherry Point to the Skagit County town of Allen
closed while a number of safety improvements and checks are made.
</P>
<P>
   Those safety improvements and checks focus on several factors
that could have caused or contributed to the spill: corrosion,
pressurization, computer systems and faulty valves.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic, for example, will have to check the pipeline for
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the 37-mile section begins operating, the pressure can only
reach 80 percent of what the pipeline had been running at, the
Transportation Department ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, regulators have ordered that the next section of
pipeline from Allen to Renton can operate at no more than 80
percent of normal operating pressure.
</P>
<P>
   That line is already operating at only 45 percent of capacity.
Only two refineries in Anacortes currently are supplying oil to the
pipeline. The rupture cut off refineries in Cherry Point and
Ferndale.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department noted in its order to Olympic that
the cause of the spill hasn't been pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the damaged section of pipe probably won't be removed
from the gasoline-saturated soil until at least next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to corrosion, federal investigators also will be
looking for any construction damage, Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   There was construction as recently as 1997 in the area, when
crews put in a 20-inch water line above the pipeline and a 24-inch
line below it, said Jack Garner, Bellingham's public works
director.
</P>
<P>
   But that construction was under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans for work were reviewed with Olympic Pipe Line, and
they had personnel on the site when the work was done,'' Garner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hamick said Olympic had two people watching the
installation of the water lines. Olympic then inspected its
pipeline for construction damage and found none, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Olympic also used an internal device known as a ``smart
pig'' to inspect that section of pipeline. The inspection found
some wall thinning but within Olympic's standards.
</P>
<P>
   However, it couldn't be determined Friday whether the inspection
took place before or after the water line construction.

THREE SHARE LEAD IN A DAY OF HIGH SCORES AT U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Cancel those players' complaints, voiced by
Lee Westwood and others, about scoring conditions being too easy at
Pinehurst Resort and Country Club because the rough failed to meet
traditional U.S. Open lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, instead, the warning uttered Friday by Corey Pavin,
the 1995 Open champ. Pavin predicted that, with more days of wind
and sunshine, Pinehurst might produce a round when no player breaks
even-par 70 before a winner is crowned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst came close to pitching a shutout Friday, but Payne
Stewart, Jeff Maggert and John Huston prevented it. Stewart grabbed
a share of the lead with a second-round 69, joining David Duval and
Phil Mickelson at 3 under par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert and Huston moved within three strokes of the lead, both
at even par, by matching Stewart's 69. No one else broke par on a
day when Pinehurst played to a scoring average of 75.4 _ 2.5 shots
per player higher than Thursday _ and elicited 13 scores of 80 or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing players backing up all over the place and
there's nothing we can do about it,'' Duval said. ``I think even
par is going to be a real nice position by Sunday. And if you're 1
or 2 over, you might not be too bad off, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-tucked pins and wind gusts of 20 mph helped dry greens and
complicate club selections on a sun-splashed day that ended with
the world's highest-ranked players _ Duval and Tiger Woods _
earning tee times in the final two groups of Saturday's third
round. Duval and Stewart will play together, with Phil Mickelson (3
under) joining Woods (1 under).
</P>
<P>
   One day after 23 players broke par in the opening round, only
seven golfers have sub-par totals through 36 holes. Hal Sutton,
Vijay Singh and Billy Mayfair all join Woods at 1 under.
</P>
<P>
   How tough was Pinehurst during the second round?
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman, the PGA Tour's career money leader, found just two
of 18 greens in regulation. Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champ,
split only five of 14 fairways. Lee Janzen, the defending champ,
needed a chip-in for birdie from 70 feet on the 18th hole to
survive the cut at 7-over par.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, a four-time champ, missed the cut with his worst
score in relation to par (14 over) since his Open debut as an
amateur in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Woods questioned the fairness of pin placements at Nos. 5 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both right on knobs. If you take a look at them,
you'd say that a pin really shouldn't be there,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, who has finished fifth or better in the past four
Opens, said the pin at No. 10 was ``so far left, it looked like it
was in the concession stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who offset two bogeys with three birdies, described the
pins as ``tough'' but not inaccessible. He backed that claim by
draining three birdie putts from inside 18 feet, including a tap-in
at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that are complaining about the pins, they haven't
played in enough U.S. Opens,'' said Stewart, the 1991 Open champ
and a runner-up to Janzen in 1993 and 1998. ``This was tough, not
questionable. You just had to be willing to take pars, however you
could get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the model of consistency in the opening round, took only
nine of them Friday. He collected more birdies (five) than any
player in the second round but trumped those by flushing four
strokes from the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Duval took a double bogey after blasting over the green from a
bunker at No. 6, then took bogeys from bunkers at Nos. 9 and 11. He
also failed to save par after his approach fell short of the green
at No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every time I was in the fairway, I was
in-between clubs,'' Duval said. ``When you try and hit a lot of
knockdown and three-quarter shots in this wind, you hit some bad
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad shots proved to be the affliction of the day at Pinehurst,
where 68 golfers survived to play the weekend rounds. Based on
Friday's results, said Mickelson, any of them could win. But the
buzz is building about a potential Woods-Duval weekend shootout
that could trigger a rivalry between the game's top-ranked players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be part of a battle like that,'' Duval said.
``As long as I'm part of the rivalry, I'm all for it.'' nn

TEXAS WESLEYAN JOINS NEW CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Wesleyan University is joining two
other Texas schools and three in Missouri to form a new NCAA
Division II conference for their athletic programs, the Fort Worth
school announced.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Texas Wesleyan in the Heartland Conference will be St.
Edward's University (Austin), the University of the Incarnate Word
(San Antonio), Rockhurst University (Kansas City, Mo.), Lincoln
University (Jefferson City, Mo.) and Drury University (Springfield,
Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   Texas Wesleyan officials said school president Jake B. Schrum
led the move to form the new conference after it was determined in
the fall of 1998 that several schools in the Rams' Heart of Texas
Conference were moving in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Schrum approached nine schools in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and
New Mexico to discuss forming a new conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the HOT Conference effectively ending as of July 1, Texas
Wesleyan would have been forced to be an NCAA independent,'' said
Dr. Albert G. Applin, Wesleyan's associate vice president of
student life and athletics. ``That would have been a difficult row
to hoe. Fortunately, these six schools are similar academically and
athletically, and some schools, like Texas Wesleyan, have already
won championships in the NAIA or the NCAA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heartland will sponsor two sports, men's golf and women's
tennis, its first year, although Wesleyan will continue to field
teams in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer,
women's volleyball, men's tennis, men's baseball and women's
softball.
</P>
<P>
   In the second year, the conference plans to sponsor several
sports, including men's and women's basketball, and to seek an
automatic bid to the NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament.

PORT WARNED THIRD SEA-TAC RUNWAY WILL COST MORE, TAKE LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Port of Seattle commissioners will meet next week to
deal with the latest in a series of problems plaguing construction
of a third runway at Sea-Tac Airport _ word that the controversial
expansion will cost nearly one-third more than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners will be asked Tuesday to approve a $186 million
cost overrun that will boost the price tag of the project _
originally estimated at $587 million _ to $773 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also, port staffers now say work on the third runway won't be
done on schedule in 2004 and isn't expected to be completed until
the second half of 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Money for the increased cost would come from future airport
revenue bonds, grants from the Federal Aviation Administration and
fees imposed on passengers flying in and out of the airport, a port
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Davis, Port Commission president, said she expects the
five-member commission to approve the increased costs, although
they might do it through clenched teeth. The Port of Seattle
operates Sea-Tac airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll approve it, but unhappily because of the
delay,'' Davis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Port commissioners have been expecting the bad news for some
time, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of waiting for this,'' Davis said. ``The fact of
the matter is there is nothing we can do. We just have to accept
this and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental concerns _ raised by discovery of wetlands when
the port began acquiring property in the path of the project _ are
responsible for much of the increased cost, port spokesman Bob
Parker said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the increase occurred because of construction
delays, regional growth in construction and real estate costs, and
project changes, port officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The port halted construction in October after discovering
unexpected wetlands on some of the property being acquired for the
runway project.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that you could just do an aerial survey and
identify the wetlands, but some of these just did not look like
wetlands,'' Parker said. ``Some had swing sets and dog houses on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Port officials realized some properties were wetlands only after
they were able to get onto the land and take core soil samples, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The port will have to pay more to address that problem by
providing compensatory wetlands in other nearby areas, improving
the quality of fill material used in the runway to minimize
erosion, and taking other actions to protect the environment, port
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased costs are unavoidable, Parker said. ``When you
come across wetlands, you have got to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the third runway have blasted the expansion plan on
numerous grounds, including noise, potential damage to the
environment and cost. Some opponents have projected the ultimate
cost of the runway at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new price tag and two-year delay in completion show the
opponents are right in fighting the project, said Bob Sheckler,
chairman of the Airport Communities Coalition. The coalition is a
group of airport-area cities and a school district opposed to the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago we were told that the region desperately
needed this third runway by 1998,'' Sheckler said in a written
statement Friday. ``Now, in 1999, nobody at the port seems to be
concerned about completing the third runway six years after we
absolutely had to have it built.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition believes runway costs will rise above $773
million, Sheckler said. ``The most expensive runway ever built in
Puget Sound has not submitted a wetlands application yet; that will
continue to drive costs up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Port staffers said they expect their new estimate of the cost of
the project _ $773,362,000 _ to remain firm. But they don't rule
out the possibility of another increase.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the third runway makes sense even at the increased
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that not having the third runway costs airlines
and travelers $189 million a year. So a $773 million runway makes
financial sense in just under five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the cost ultimately will be borne by travelers
through user fees, port officials aren't able to say how much the
increased pricetag will cost each individual traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ways the money gets handled that it is
impossible to trace a path,'' Parker said. ``I just can't say how
much. But if air services cost more, travelers pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Parker both say they're hopeful the third runway will
be in use before the new projected date of the third quarter of
2006. But that's largely out of the port's hands, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The new construction timetable estimates it could take a year to
get work permits from the state Ecology Department and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping the Department of Ecology gets that permit
through more quickly than a year,'' Davis said. ``Then we can go to
the Corps of Engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said that would enable the port to move up its timetable
for using the new runway.

DALY KNOWS VALUE OF SURVIVING CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Despite ballooning to a 77 in Friday's second
round of the U.S. Open, John Daly found a ray of sunshine at
Pinehurst Resort and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   At least he made the cut, which will break a string of four
consecutive tournaments without paychecks on the PGA Tour. The
weekend tee times are significant, said Daly, because he is still
feeling the effects of $9 million in gambling losses suffered
between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need the money,'' said Daly, a recovering alcoholic who
stands at 5-over par through 36 holes, eight strokes behind the
leaders. ``I have to make my money out here now. It's not like when
I had it coming in from other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his gambling debts have been retired, Daly said he
recently had to sell a Mercedes and a house in California to help
meet his $40,000 monthly obligation in alimony and child support
from three failed marriages. Daly said his home in Memphis, Tenn.,
may soon be put on the market to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Daly put himself in financial peril between 1993-96 when he won
$42 million from casino gambling but offset that total with $51
million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, I bet on it,'' Daly said. ``I always liked the
fast action, but I haven't recovered from all those losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said he has wagered as much as $220,000 on a single hand at
blackjack and $50,000 on a single football game. But he never bet
on golf. Since leaving an alcohol rehabilitation center in 1997,
however, Daly said he has not taken a drink or placed a wager.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the rehabilitation center, Daly received an
endorsement deal from Callaway Golf products and company founder
Ely Callway agreed to retire $1.8 million of Daly's personal debt
to various casinos. Previous deals from Reebok and Wilson helped
cover $1.2 million and the remaining $6 million in debt came from
Daly's pocket or the sale of personal items.
</P>
<P>
   That has left him feeling a financial pinch throughout the 1999
season, which shows Daly ranked 125th on the money list, with
$158,021. Until making the cut at the Open, Daly had not earned a
PGA Tour paycheck since May 16 at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic,
where he finished 67th and received $6,090.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the way I've played the last eight weeks, I didn't even
expect to make the cut here. I expected to play two rounds, then go
home and watch on television,'' Daly said. ``This has been a nice
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   As with public discussions about his battles with alcoholism,
Daly said he decided to share his tale of gambling woes because
``it helps me to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, however, said he has not been tempted to punch a hotel
room wall in anger, as Masters champ Jose Maria Olazabal did after
shooting a 75 in Thursday's opening round. Olazabal withdrew Friday
and Daly said he could empathize with Olazabal's frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This life (on the PGA Tour), it's not all that glamorous the
way everybody thinks it is,'' Daly said. ``But if I'd just won the
Masters, I don't think I'd be punching any walls. I'm the only one
who has a reason to punch something, because I haven't done crap
all year. At least he's got a green jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, on the other hand, has a financial crisis on his
hands. nn

THREE CALIFORNIA SYNAGOGUES HIT BY FIRES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A wave of apparently coordinated arsons struck
three of the five synagogues in the Sacramento area within 45
minutes early Friday morning, causing nearly $1 million in damages,
and the federal authorities opened a sweeping investigation into
what they described as deliberate hate crimes, in which anti-Jewish
fliers were found at two of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 agents and officers of the FBI, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local police and fire departments
were assigned to the case, but officials said Friday afternoon that
they had no suspects so far and no clear motives for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The fires occurred hours before scheduled Sabbath services and,
in the worst case, gutted the temple library at Congregation B'nai
Israel in Sacramento, destroying a collection of videotapes on the
Holocaust and Jewish culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate arson, it was a deliberate hate crime, and
beyond that we really can't say,'' James M. Maddock, the FBI's
special agent in charge of the Sacramento office, said in a late
afternoon news conference monitored by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they could not be sure whether the fires were
connected, but Maddock said, ``Obviously, that would be the most
common theory that we're working on.'' He said investigators had
not ruled out the possibility that a lone individual was
responsible for all three attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Maddock and other officials declined to give specifics of what
they described as anti-Semitic fliers found at the fires. But at
one fire, at the Kenesset Israel Torah Center in northeastern
Sacramento County, a local television crew found a flier that
blamed the ``international Jewsmedia'' for the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Temple B'nai Israel suffered by far the worst damage, about
$800,000, mostly to its library, officials said. A second
synagogue, Congregation Beth Shalom in suburban Carmichael, Calif.,
had about $100,000 in damage, most from smoke and water, while the
Knesset Israel Torah Center sustained about $30,000 in damage,
according to preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say precisely how the fires were set, but
Maddock said investigators had ``recovered a number of evidentiary
items from the crime scenes'' that would be analyzed by forensics
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Two toll-free numbers have been set up to take tips from the
public at (800) 435-7883 for the FBI and (888) ATF-FIRE for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second firebombing attack at B'nai Israel in six
years. In 1993, the temple was among the targets of firebombings
directed at several minorities; a 17-year-old white separatist was
later convicted in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mayor Joseph Serna of Sacramento said such acts were
``not typical of our city,'' and added, ``This has been a very sad
day for us here.''
</P>
<P>
   The regional office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, issued a statement that it had monitored activities of the
Sacramento branch of an anti-Semitic group called the World Church
of the Creator.
</P>
<P>
   The women's auxiliary of the group has recently published
materials attributing the war in Kosovo to a ``Jew world order,''
but the Anti-Defamation League said there was no known link between
that auxiliary and the arsons.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Brad Bloom of Congregation B'nai Israel said his
congregation was ``devastated, shocked and numb,'' but he vowed to
``be positive and rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Bloom added, ``we will create a culture which
will not tolerate intolerance anymore.''

DIGITAL SHOWINGS OF FILM TOUTED AS CINEMA HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Visual effects were sharper, sounds stood out, and
when the first commercial showing of a digital movie _ the ``Star
Wars'' prequel _ concluded, industry pros said it would lead to a
film revolution.
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas changed movies forever 22 years ago with the
original ``Star Wars,'' and Friday's historic digital showing of
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' left viewers anxious
for the time when movies shot entirely on digital cameras replace
the use of celluloid prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas is (proving) again that you don't have to accept the way
it was,'' said Nick Castle of Coyote Moon Picture Co. in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the pluses and minuses of both formats,'' Castle said.
``But considering this is the first out of the box, it's a pretty
good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital artist Danny Braet also walked out of the Pacific
Winnetka 21 _ one of four theaters across the nation to screen the
filmless ``Phantom Menace'' _ enthusiastic about a new age in movie
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time there's no grain on it. For us, it would be
cool to have a whole movie without grain,'' said Braet, of Station
X Studios in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The shutter flickers, film scratches and colors fade as prints
deteriorate. That would be eliminated with digital cinema.
</P>
<P>
   But the same industry pros and a movie fan who flew in from
Seattle also said the average moviegoer probably won't notice much
difference between digital and a new, first-quality film print.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pull in people who have never seen it before and don't
tell them you're not showing it on a projector, they won't notice
the difference,'' said R. Kelly Nelson, also of Coyote Moon Picture
Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience was J.V. King, a Seattle machinist who had not
yet seen ``Phantom Menace'' and wanted to be a part of movie
history. He sat next to industry pros who vowed he would be blown
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was necessarily sharper,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main impression is it's going to up the ante for special
effects people,'' he said. ``I like the live-action better. You
want the computer animation to blend so you don't see the
difference. That's why I think it will be a benefit to the
theatergoer in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the differences noted by many viewers of the digital
``Phantom Menace'' came in scenes combining computer-generated
characters with real actors. They said transferring
computer-generated images to film produces a grainy quality, but
the digital reproduction was brighter and featured sharper lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a lot of characters blended well with the live
action stuff,'' said Luke McDonald, a digital artist with Station X
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said even the often irritating amphibian creature Jar
Jar Binks improved on digital. ``I definitely want to kill him, but
overall it's more pleasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scenes with the star-filled universe as the backdrop also didn't
flicker as in the previous ``Star Wars'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crisp, the resolution was good,'' said Jim Smith, who
produces religious films for Archangel Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound was incredible,'' he said. ``I don't want to see it
on film.''
</P>
<P>
   That very reaction is what developers of the two leading digital
projection systems are counting on during the four-week digital run
of ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   CineComm is backing the Hughes-JVC Image Light Amplifier system
used at the Pacific Winnetka 21. Texas Instruments' Digital Light
Processing system also went on display Friday at the AMC 14 in
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The two other digital showings, featuring the same two systems,
were at two theaters in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The theaters will continue screening the movie on conventional
celluloid in other auditoriums.

COLLINS FEELING THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Terry Collins worried about losing his
job _ he did. But the situation is far worse now for his Angels
than it was three years ago when Collins managed the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels continued to disintegrate Friday night with a 4-1
loss to the New York Yankees, dropping them 10 games behind the
Texas Rangers in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Collins got canned by the Astros for finishing second. He'd win
a Nobel Prize if he could pull that off with this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through all that before,'' Collins said. ``I won't
get caught up in that again. The only thing that's important is
that we start to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't happening for a team that has lost five straight and
10 of their past 12 with five games remaining on a nine-game trip
that ends against improving Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the team have voiced their displeasure with Collins. Now
they are speaking much louder. Friday, they committed three errors,
two that led to runs, and managed only five hits against Yankees
starter Andy Pettitte (4-5) and three relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Until Troy Glaus homered with one out in the eighth, the Angels
had not advanced a runner to third in their past 23 innings. Garret
Anderson ended an 0-for-30 slump with an infield hit in the second
inning, but he misplayed Bernie Williams' single to center into a
two-base error in the sixth and the Angels never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time on this trip, catcher Matt Walbeck dropped a
foul pop. Although it did not cost the Angels a run, a wild throw
to the plate by second baseman Randy Velarde in the fourth, did.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Angels had the tying run at the plate against
Mariano Rivera, Glaus flied to center to end the game. It was
Rivera's 18th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep this up for a week or two, we're going to take on a
spoiler role,'' said Angels left-hander Chuck Finley (4-7).
``Fifteen games out by the All-Star break, I've done that too many
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who allowed six hits and three runs (two earned) in
seven innings, says this season reminds him of 1996 when the team
hoped to redeem itself from an epic late-season collapse the year
before. Instead, it lost 91 games, manager Marcel Lachemann
resigned and the Angels went out and got the high-energy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season we were out of sync,'' Finley said of 1996. ``It
just never came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places to reverse a trend, Yankee Stadium might have
been it. Just a month ago, the Angels swept the World Series
champion Yankees here in a three-game series. Finley came in with a
six-game winning streak against New York and had 16 victories
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck pitched a good game,'' Collins said. ``I thought we had a
couple of opportunities late. All we need to do is come up with a
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The big news before the game was New York moving shortstop Derek
Jeter to the third slot, replacing Bernie Williams, who had just
two hits in his past 16 at-bats. Jeter came in reaching base in 63
of the Yankees' 64 games and went 2 for 3 with two runs and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, were more pleased with Pettitte, who had
dropped three straight. But there was a feeling in the Angels
clubhouse that his victory should have come with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is everyone has to do just what they can do,''
said Mo Vaughn, whose fifth-inning single ended an 0-for-12 slump.
``You've got singles hitters trying to go deep. You've got everyone
pressing. We're playing too many 3-1 type games that we have to
win.''

STARS FIND INSTIGATOR IN `LITTLE BALL OF HATE'
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Pat Verbeek doesn't appear to be conspicuously
rabid when sitting at his locker in the Dallas Stars' dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   No growling, no baring of his teeth, no foaming at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But the way coach Ken Hitchcock talks about his ``Little Ball of
Hate,'' you'd think they keep Verbeek shackled so nobody gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has two different personalities,'' Hitchcock said.
``There's the personality in the dressing room on an off day, and
then he has a personality you avoid at all cost on the day of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't go near him. He's not a nice person to be
around on the day of the game. For anybody. Coaches or players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Ball of Hate'' is at his most hateful these days, and
that's how the Stars like him. Gritty, relentless, taking it right
at Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek as he did to score in Game 5 of the
Stanley Cup Finals on Thursday is how Verbeek has helped the Stars
to the brink of the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use him kind of as a catalyst,'' Hitchcock said. ``When we
need other people to get going, to get physically involved, we
would put Verbeek in and that's it. He would draw either the anger
from the other team or draw the anger from our own people, and it
was good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek is a player with a nose for the net and making trouble
around it. He says he likes ``the dirty areas'' on the ice, and
when he's in those spots, he likes to make them dirtier.
</P>
<P>
   All this hate comes in a convenient travelsize package, too.
Verbeek has made a career of playing bigger than his very generous
listing of 5-foot-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it could be what they call `Small Man's Disease,' ''
Verbeek said, analyzing the root of his hate. ``I'm not sure I have
it, but I'm close.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek said his ball of hate began rolling in his teen years in
Wyoming, Ontario. From age 14 through his first season in the NHL
in 1983, he had to prove he could overcome his small stature to
scouts, coaches and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle, Verbeek said, left him with a rather large chip on
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   And his opponents with an stick-wielding pest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always had the personality where I never liked to
take crap from anyone,'' Verbeek said. ``If they hand it out,
they're going to have to make sure they can take it, because
they're going to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the hate was derived from the ice. Verbeek, the oldest
of five, endured some tough love growing up. Verbeek said he had
two parents who taught him the value of work ethic, but also liked
to keep him in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like good cop, bad cop, and they took turns at it,''
Verbeek said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the thumb episode. Verbeek had his thumb
severed in an auger-driven fertilizer at the family farm when he
was 21. He found his thumb and had it reattached. And he proceeded
to score 25 goals the next season for the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team owner suggested we cut the other one off,'' Verbeek
said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, through all of this, Verbeek manages to leave the hate
at work. Father of four girls and a boy, Verbeek has been known to
play Beanie Babies with his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He draws the line at Barbies, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because when they say that `Little Ball of Hate'
stuff, I just don't know where they get it from,'' said Dianne
Verbeek, Pat's wife. ``Around here, he's really happy-go-lucky and
agreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Verbeek's nastiness continues to lift the Stars, the
niceness can be kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Ball of Hate'' wants his first Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in telling him no? nn

BILL BRADLEY AND WIFE SPEAK OUT ON BREAST CANCER DURING L.A. VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARY LOU AURELIO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
joined his wife, Ernestine, at a YWCA forum to talk about her
breast cancer battle and his experience as the husband of a
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When breast cancer hits, it hits an entire family, and all the
attention and care should go to the woman,'' Bill Bradley said.
``But men are traumatized too, and it's important to know other men
are out there like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a husband of a breast cancer survivor, I have tried to
reach others going through it with a kind word, or a story or a
letter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The forum at the Glendale YWCA in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley was held to let women know about ENCOREplus, a program
sponsored by the Y that provides free pap smears, clinical breast
exams and mammograms. A mobile mammography center visits the Y
eight to 12 times a month. Women receive free screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile Iris Cantor Center for Breast Imaging is part of the
UCLA Medical Center and one of the Y's partners. The George Slate
Mobile Pap Center, sponsored by Planned Parenthood, is another
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradleys urged women to take advantage of the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outreach programs are incredibly important,'' Ernestine
Bradley said. ``They reach those who would not normally have the
time or the resources. ``If found at an early stage, cancer is not
a fatal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley said a brush with cancer is a very profound
and moving event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on but much better than before _ life is more
precious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was lucky to have her husband at her side, and it
brought them closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good marriage before, but cancer gave us a bond that
neither of us thought could be forged,'' she said. ``This is the
good side, if you have the strength to see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   About 325 to 425 women a month are seen at the Glendale Y's
ENCOREplus program, said Laila Santos, program director. It is
aimed at women who have little or no medical coverage, but no one
is turned away.
</P>
<P>
   She said since 1994, the program has screened 9,000 woman and
found 78 breast cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   During a question and answer forum, Bill Bradley said such
health services should be provided to the 44 million uninsured in
this country, many of them working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can only happen when we have national leadership,'' he
said. ``Then any woman can get a pap smear, not just as a generous
gift, but because it is a right in America.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ The fierce combat raging along the
mountainous border between the parts of Kashmir controlled by India
and Pakistan is only the most visible face of an effort by Islamic
militants to turn Kashmir into a religious state.
</P>
<P>
   Militants from various countries appear to have chosen Kashmir
as a prime target in their campaign to bring the world's Muslim
regions under religious rule. The campaign is in part a legacy of
the proxy war that the U.S. waged against Soviet forces in
Afghanistan during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   During those years the United States trained and armed thousands
of Muslim guerrillas who opposed the Soviet troops because they
viewed them as anti-Islamic infidels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having succeeded in driving the Soviet forces from
Afghanistan and establishing a form of religious rule there, many
of the warriors are turning their attention to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict dates to the establishment of predominantly Hindu
India and mainly Muslim Pakistan in 1947 by Britain, the departing
colonial power. Since then the countries have fought two wars over
Kashmir, where most of the population is Muslim. Pakistan controls
about a third of the region, with India holding most of the rest
and China a smaller area.
</P>
<P>
   In Srinagar, the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir, militants from countries as far apart as Indonesia, Sudan
and Bahrain have given interviews asserting that they learned the
art of war from Americans and are now using their skills to fight
the Indian Army.
</P>
<P>
   Many are evidently using not only tactics that Americans taught
them, but also weapons that Americans gave them. The most graphic
example came soon after the latest round of fighting began last
month, when an Indian helicopter was shot down by an Islamic
guerrilla using an American-made Stinger missile.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officers say about a dozen more Stingers are
unaccounted for in this region, each able to shoot down a plane or
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of indication that former Afghan fighters from
the war against Russia are now fighting here,'' said Gen. Joszef
Bali, the U.N. envoy in Srinagar. ``Weapons provided for
Afghanistan with large help from the Americans and the CIA are now
in the hands of the militants.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian officers involved in the current fighting agree. ``The
militants are using not only small arms that they got from the
Americans, but also Stinger missiles and American anti-tank
weapons,'' said one officer, Col. Hemant Desai. ``It's not only
weapons, but also battle-hardened troops. It's a direct result of
the American policy in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent fighting in Kashmir broke out when Indian forces
sought to take up positions that they had abandoned during the
winter along the frigid border. They came under fire, and it soon
became clear that insurgents had crossed from the Pakistani side
and seized a sliver of Indian-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   India has charged that the insurgents are working closely with
the Pakistani Army and include many Pakistani regulars, but
Pakistan denies any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-handed Indian tactics here have turned many people against
India. The Indian authorities have arrested an estimated 30,000
young Kashmiris in the last decade, releasing nearly all of them
after a year or two without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more have died in shootouts, ambushes and battles.
Soldiers with bulletproof vests and automatic weapons patrol the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here feel very happy when Indian soldiers are dead,''
said Surinder Oberoi, an Indian journalist who has lived in Kashmir
for nearly a decade. ``When three aircraft were downed, it was
literally like a celebration. People were congratulating each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see another round of violence if the government of India
continues with this rigid policy. It's extremely dangerous in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kashmiris are also suspicious of Pakistan, where the tide
of religious militancy runs counter to their tradition of
tolerance. If allowed to vote in a plebiscite as their leaders
demand, many might choose independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a free nation, but we are not ruling out any
option,'' said Shabir Shah, who has spent 22 of his 46 years in
Indian prisons for advocating separatism and who now heads a
pro-independence party. ``If India and Pakistan would negotiate
with legitimate Kashmiri leaders, maybe some other solution could
be found. But unless India gives some response to our nonviolent
struggle, the field will be left entirely to the men with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The men with guns, aided by a spreading network of civilians,
are engaged in a social and cultural campaign to shake the
foundations of life here. Nearly every village in Kashmir now has
at least one mosque, many of them built in recent years with money
reportedly donated by people in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders have condemned the use of zirayats,
Muslim houses of prayer that are symbols of tolerance and welcome
Hindus and other non-Muslims. Several zirayats have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   Hindus and Christians have fled some villages in Kashmir,
complaining of threats and intimidation. Koran courses are
sprouting in many schools. Religious workers have begun a campaign
of adopting orphans and street children, who are given intensive
religious education.
</P>
<P>
   Radicals have warned women to wear modest clothing. In at least
three cases in the last year, they have shot women in the feet who
refused to stop wearing jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Islamic fighters in the mountains and
fundamentalist pressures in towns and villages is not all that
makes the Kashmir crisis explosive. India and Pakistan are the
world's newest declared nuclear powers, and although both have
pledged not to use nuclear weapons in this dispute, the prospect
lends an apocalyptic air to the recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact during
the Cold War, peace was maintained not only by the nuclear balance,
but also by a balance of conventional forces,'' said Bali, the U.N.
envoy. ``That meant that the nuclear threshold was very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here, where there is a great imbalance of conventional
forces, the nuclear threshold may be very low. The big powers can't
afford to sit back and let this situation play out.''

KILLER'S ACTIONS TOO COMPLEX FOR SLEEPWALKER, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater's actions after he stabbed his wife were
too purposeful and complex to have been done by a sleepwalker, an
expert witness for the prosecution testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very uncommon in sleepwalking to have a very neat, tidy
progression of events,'' said Dr. David M. Baratz, assistant
medical director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Good Samaritan
Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Baratz provided perhaps the strongest testimony yet for
prosecutor Juan Martinez, who has clashed at times sarcastically
with expert defense witnesses who testified that Falater was
sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife, Yarmila, 44 times.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Falater, who on previous days sobbed
remorsefully and said he was devastated by the death of ``Yarm,''
finished his testimony by answering questions from the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   In one question, read aloud by Judge Ronald Reinstein, a juror
asked if Falater, 43, felt responsible for the death of his wife of
20 years and the mother of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to leave that up to God to decide,'' he
said, then paused. ```Personally, it is something that is going to
haunt me forever. I don't know that I'll ever get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baratz based his opinion that Falater was not sleepwalking on
the eyewitness account of a neighbor who looked over a wall after
the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, Greg Koons, saw Falater approach his wife's body
twice, first looking down at her for about 30 seconds before
fetching a pair of gloves from the garage. Koons continued to look
on as Falater dragged her to the pool, rolled her in and held her
head underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Then Koons summoned police and paramedics, who arrested Falater
inside the house and pulled Yarmila's body from the pool. Official
reports listed her cause of death as ``multiple stab wounds with
drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has characterized the pool incident as the sort of
bizarre behavior that is typical of sleepwalkers. They said it made
no sense for Falater to leave the body floating in the pool and
then return to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Baratz disagreed. ``I can't see how that would be an act of a
sleepwalker,'' he said. He said it appeared to him that Falater
used the pool to finish off Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   Baratz also noted police reports that indicate Falater went into
the garage twice during the time he claims he was sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   First Falater removed his bloody clothes, then he returned to
stash his gloves _ along with the clothes and hunting knife _ in
the wheel well of his Volvo station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Martinez questioned Jacqueline Haek, a sleep
technician at St. Luke's Medical Center who administered four
nights of hospital sleep tests on Falater. The defense has used
test results to show that Falater's brain waves had characteristics
commonly found among sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Haek testified that one of the expert witnesses for Falater's
defense, Dr. Janet Tatman, asked her to alter the test results in
order to show Falater entered the deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable changing the data. This is a legal
document going to court, and I told her (the doctor) I didn't feel
comfortable changing it in the middle of the study,'' Haek said.
</P>
<P>
   During Haek's cross examination, defense attorney Lori Voepel
sought to portray her as a headstrong technician who used outdated
methods as she evaluated the brain-wave tests.
</P>
<P>
   Voepel showed Haek medical journals and technical manuals
authorizing the use of different methods.
</P>
<P>
   But Haek held her ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me to change the data. That's what I considered
unethical,'' said Haek.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is expected to finish his rebuttal case early next week
in the murder trial, which has drawn international attention to the
Maricopa County courthouse in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   That would set the stage for final arguments and for jury
deliberations that could begin as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez wraps up next week, he will not be able to present
testimony about a discussion Falater allegedly had three weeks
before Yarmila's death.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reinstein ruled that Martinez had resorted to
impermissible hearsay to claim that Falater had talked about the
case of a Canadian man who used a sleepwalking defense to walk away
from charges that he had murdered his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein also blocked Martinez's effort to call a witness to
testify that Yarmila developed a venereal disease in 1990. Martinez
said before the trial that the witness would testify that she told
Yarmila that Scott had been ``messing around.'' But Reinstein ruled
that the seven-year gap between 1990 and Yarmila's death was too
great for the issue to be permissible material for the trial. &QL;

<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Irwindale Speedway Super Stock points leader
Michael Price of San Pedro is the third-best race-car driver in the
Pacific Coast Region ShorTrack Series with Thousand Oaks' Larry
Kreiger ninth, according to the NASCAR Winston Racing Series.
</P>
<P>
   Price has a Competition Performance Index of .7778 to rank
third. Tim Clark of Watsonville Speedway is No. 1 with Robert
McCoun of Madera Speedway No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something new to shoot for,'' said Price. ``It's been
us and (T.K.) Karvasek battling for the lead. It's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nine other ranked Irwindale drivers with Grand Am
driver Kreiger ninth on the first tier.
</P>
<P>
   On the second tier, Karvasek is No. 1 and Grand Am/Super Late
Model's Rod Johnson fourth. Whittier Super Stock driver Greg Benner
third in the third tier with Grand Am's Gerry Mielke seventh.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth tier, Grand Am's Rip Michels is second with Tom
Siebuhr in Super Stock third. Kevin Wood in Super Stock is No. 1 in
the fifth tier and Grand Am's John Watkinson is eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Kreiger says the secret is that most of the drivers raced at
Saugus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it's all these Saugus guys,'' says Grand Am
points leader Kreiger. ``That was a hard track. The set-up was
tough. We can run anywhere _ Las Vegas, Mesa Marin _ and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Racing Series has contributed a $1.423 million fund
to be distributed among the 120 short tracks in the nation. Eight
California tracks make up the Pacific Coast Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being consistent is the key,'' Whittier's Brenner said.
``Being ranked is a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's race was the first time members of the Winston Racing
Series a main sponsor for the Winston West race had seen Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the finest track in the nation and that includes more
than 100 tracks,'' assistant manager Terry Rutledge said. ``The
venue is the best, the tech building is unbelievable and the
tear-down area is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Racing Series is based in Winston-Salem, N.C. The 10
regional champions will be recognized at the series banquet in
Orlando, Fla. in November.
</P>
<P>
   Track vice president Ray Wilkings says 3,000 of the 6,500
tickets have been sold for tonight's Winston West Irwindale 250.
</P>
<P>
   The West series qualifying will be at 5 p.m. with all drivers
available for an autograph session at 6 p.m. in the chalet area
between the grandstands and the pit area. Wilkings said that will
be a permanent track feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just making the area a good meeting area for families,''
Wilkings said.
</P>
<P>
   Winston West drivers Austin Cameron, Brendan Gaughan and Wayne
Jacks raced in Friday night's Super Late Model events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference,'' said Gaughan, who has raced at
Irwindale thee times. ``This car is 3,100 pounds compared to 3,400
pounds. There two-barrelled with restrictor plates compared to wide
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacks will drive his NWWS car with a picture of Pasadena's Olga
Mendez on the hood. Mendez has been missing since being adbucted in
February 1998. Jacks will be racing for Race for the Missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do anything to help anybody,'' Jacks said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time for a Los Angeles Dodgers quiz.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Dodgers lose this time? A) Poor starting pitching,
B) shoddy defense, or, C) failure to accomplish anything
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   On any given night this week, it could be all of the above, but
this time it was C. The Dodgers managed four hits and wasted a
bases-loaded opportunity in the eighth inning as they lost to the
Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 in front of 41,590 Friday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ninth time in 12 series the Dodgers lost the first game
of a series at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (30-35) are also five games under .500 for the first
time since losing to Philadelphia May 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play the game right,'' said Dodgers third baseman
Adrian Beltre, who hit a solo homer. ``I don't know what's going on
with this team. We're supposed to be strong with starting pitching,
and (Ismael Valdes) throws a great game and we don't score. If it's
not one thing, it's the other. It's a lot of bad things. Everything
is negative for us. We're not playing the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The lethargic Dodgers offense killed itself in the eighth
against reliever Steve Montgomery. First, pinch-hitter Dave Hansen
drew a four-pitch walk. Eric Young singled just over the head of
third baseman Scott Rolen and Jose Vizcaino sacrificed the runners
over a base. After a lengthy meeting at the mound, Raul Mondesi was
intentionally walked to bring Eric Karros to the plate with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the Dodgers found a way to get themselves out of
a big inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit a sinking line drive to shortstop. Alex Arias caught
it a few inches off the ground and threw to second to easily double
off Young and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did a better job of getting back it would have been a
double play anyway,'' Young said. ``This is a tough drop for us.
You keep going at it and hope it turns, and you hope you don't get
too far behind before it turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes pitched the ninth for his eighth save. The only
saving grace is Arizona lost and the Dodgers remain nine games
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right guys in the right spots and we just didn't do
it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``You're not supposed to
get doubled up on a line drive. Maybe from his view he thought the
ball was going to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Curt Schilling's first win since May 29 when he shut out
the Colorado Rockies, and also ended a miserable streak for one of
the best pitchers around. In his past three outings Schilling was
0-2 with a 6.97 ERA. During that span his ERA went from 2.57 to
3.39.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing the Dodgers did was take a few more pitches than
normal and get Schilling (9-4) out of the game after he threw, for
him, a relatively low 101 pitches. Schilling allowed three hits and
one run in seven innings. He struck out four and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes was nearly Schilling's equal. He
allowed five hits and two runs but lost. Valdes threw eight
innings, a windfall for the Dodgers starters, but left trailing
2-1. He struck out five and didn't walk a batter, but all that
meant was the Dodgers had a chance to win. Valdes threw 118
pitches, 81 of which were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fifth straight start Valdes has allowed three earned
runs or less, yet for the fourth straight time he lost.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Valdes has been victimized by this season is the
long ball, and that's how the Phillies built their 2-1 lead. Valdes
entered the night having yielded 15 homers, one fewer than Chan Ho
Park's team-leading 16. By the time the night ended Valdes had the
dubious lead.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, a Westlake High graduate, put
the Phillies ahead with his 15th homer of the season. His solo shot
in the second came with the count full.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre tied the score 1-1 in the bottom of the inning with a
solo homer to left with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes and Schilling remained locked in speedy duel until the
seventh when Rico Brogna led off with a homer to center field to
give the Phillies a 2-1 lead.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It was early in the game, and Latrell Sprewell was
in full intimidation mode. With a menacing glare, he was going to
the basket hard and fast, like a rock from a slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   But out of nowhere, the eerily quiet Tim Duncan popped out of
the paint like a submarine breaking the surface and timed his leap
in sync with Sprewell's. And in one instant, Duncan turned a sure
dunk into a blocked shot and rejected all the intensity and
determination Sprewell had bubbling inside of him.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that played itself out in the first quarter was
repeated Friday night, as Duncan joined his 7-foot partner, David
Robinson, to combine for nine blocked shots. Each was a dispiriting
slap to the Knicks' once unflappable confidence, which withered in
the end as New York was beaten, 80-67, by the San Antonio Spurs in
Game 2 of the NBA finals at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put my finger on the problem,'' Sprewell said before
having the shot-blocking numbers pointed out to him. ``You know
they are coming, both Tim and David. But you've got to go at them
and take it right to them. If they block it, they block it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time for a new plan. This was the Knicks' second
double-digit loss to the Spurs in two games. Once again, the Knicks
had no answer for Duncan, whose 25 points and 15 rebounds helped
give the Spurs a 2-0 lead in this best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   The series now moves to New York, beginning with Game 3 at
Madison Square Garden on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks' offense boiled down to whatever points
could be generated by the one-on-one style Sprewell and Allan
Houston were left to make up as they combined to shoot 17 of 42
from the field. They tried to drive and were stopped. They were
left to shoot jumpers and missed. Inside and out, the Spurs seemed
to be in the Knicks' heads as they held New York to 32.9 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were thinking about us when they were coming to the
hole,'' said Robinson, who finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds.
``They understand it's not going to be easy to get to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in and talked about getting one or two games here.
This is a different challenge for them. But with all the stuff
they've been through this year, we don't expect them to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't die easily. The Knicks led in the first quarter for
only one brief moment, but they were close for so long. They were
still scrambling and forcing turnovers and giving themselves a
chance deep into the third quarter. They were within three points
of the Spurs, trailing by 52-49 with 2 minutes 41 seconds left in
the third, and then they got outsmarted by their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had three chances to pull even but failed, on a
shot-clock violation and two missed jumpers. The Spurs were missing
as well _ failing on jumpers from 3-point range _ but then Sean
Elliott drove past Sprewell to the basket for a layup and was
fouled on the way by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   With 2.5 seconds left in the third period, Elliott stood at the
free-throw line. At that moment, Duncan noticed Marcus Camby
talking and not paying attention. As Elliott missed his free throw,
Duncan slipped inside of Camby and put the rebound back for a layin
with 1.9 seconds on the clock. The 4-point swing gave the Spurs a
56-49 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking, me and Latrell, and saying to each other to
move down,'' Camby said. ``He was able to sneak in there and grab
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had to accept part of the blame, as well, for chatting
during such a pivotal moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big moment for them,'' Sprewell said. ``If we stop
them, then it's a different game at that point. That allowed them
just to keep that little bit of extra cushion. So I mean, it was a
mental mistake on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   It cost them dearly. The Knicks were never so close again. They
closed to within six points with 8:22 left in the game. But at
almost the same moment as in Game 1, the Spurs went on a run to put
the game away, this one a 12-1 streak that capitalized on a
plethora of missed jumpers by the Knicks and four turnovers in a
six-minute span. This futility was not just pinned on Houston and
Sprewell, but on the teammates who were unable to make open jumpers
around them, as the Knicks went nearly seven minutes without a
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Larry Johnson finished 2 for 12 from the field and
scored five points on a sprained right knee, while a suddenly cold
Kurt Thomas was 1 for 6 and Chris Childs ended the night 2 for 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I don't think we're playing well offensively,''
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Tonight, I thought in stretches
we had good shots and missed point blank. Other times, I would
agree, we were trying to squeeze it ourselves instead of doing one
more thing, like an extra pass, one more drive and kick, whatever
it takes to create a better shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, layups are high-percentage shots. But not with Robinson
and Duncan ready to pounce on anyone coming their way. With the
Knicks so predictable in their one-on-one approach, Robinson and
Duncan just waited until a defender turned Sprewell or Houston into
the paint, and then timed their leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better offensively,'' Sprewell said. ``We have
to keep positive.''
</P>
<P>
   They have to remain confident despite two bad nights in the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them thinking about being down, 2-0,'' Van Gundy
said. ``I don't want them thinking that we have to win four out of
the next five games. All we need to think about is Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   And put all the rejection of the past out of their minds.

MIDENGINE ACURA NSX PUTS SPORT ON STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the talk turns to hot sports cars, it's not often that the
name Acura pops up. The upscale Honda division is best-known for
well-built luxury cars and some spunky compacts, but rarely
mentioned in the same breath as Corvette, Porsche, even Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the know are well-aware of the exotic, midengine
Acura NSX. Here's a supercar by any standard, an exclusive fantasy
machine and streetable racer that provides all the sounds and
sensations of the top performance sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The NSX is a thrilling car to drive. The powerful, tractable V-6
howls behind your ears, propelling the lightweight car like a
rocket and pinning you back in your seat. The firm, supple
suspension provides a solid sports-car ride without the punishing
harshness, but with the on-the-dime cornering. The Ferrari-esque
styling of the all-aluminum body turns every head, young or old.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it's a real-world vehicle that can be driven every day,
docile and smooth in traffic and backed by Acura's reputation for
reliability. The interior is roomy, simple and handsome. The trunk
space is decent. And the stereo is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   I'd order my NSX in a heartbeat if it didn't cost so darn much.
</P>
<P>
   One friend, a consummate vintage racer who collects Jaguar
sports cars and has the money to drive whatever he wants, traded in
his Porsche 911 for an NSX about a half-dozen years ago. And never
looked back. The NSX, he says, is the best street car he's ever
driven.
</P>
<P>
   I know I'm impressed. The NSX just aces the field in performance
and sheer driving fun. And before you start sneering at the
small-displacement V-6, consider that it's cranking out a solid 290
horsepower with only about a ton-and-a-half of aluminum sports car
to push around.
</P>
<P>
   The techy V-6, which uses Honda's pioneering VTEC
variable-valve-timing system, programmed fuel injection, variable
volume induction and exotic aluminum and titanium alloys, roars to
life at nearly any engine speed.
</P>
<P>
   VTEC is a complex system of camshafts and rocker arms that
actually change cam-lobe profile as engine revs climb. It provides
a mild profile for smooth low speeds, which switches at about 5,200
rpm to a profile that provides longer duration and higher lift to
boost high-end power. You can hear the engine roar turn more urgent
as the profile changes, and feel the power quickly build.
</P>
<P>
   This setup was first tried in the NSX when it appeared on the
scene in 1991, and since has spread to Acura's and Honda's more
mainstream cars. VTEC represents the performance wave of the
future, mainly on four-cylinder Honda engines that young gearheads
love to hot-rod.
</P>
<P>
   With its trick V-6, all-aluminum construction and exotic
midengine design, the NSX is the high-tech equivalent of big-block
supercars such as Chevy Corvette or Dodge Viper. And even at a
lofty $88,000 for the T-top version we drove (the coupe is a mere
$84,000), the NSX is a relative bargain compared with the big-time
exotics, such as Ferrari or Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the muscle-car acceleration is that wonderful,
balanced handling. Really, the midengine car takes the curves so
well it's almost humbling. A great driver could make this thing
jump through hoops. A not-so-great driver can push it as hard as he
or she dares, never really reaching its ragged limit or full
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you tried to drive this car full-bore on the street,
they'd throw you in jail. The best place to appreciate the NSX
would be on a race track, if you had the good fortune to get it on
one.
</P>
<P>
   The NSX interior is attractive and accommodating, with decent
leg and shoulder room, but a bit sparse on headroom. I had the roof
panel removed when I rolled past a buddy, who yelled at me, ``Hey,
your big head's sticking out.'' So much for my Michael Andretti
impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   The T-top, by the way, stows in a cleverly designed compartment
built into the engine hood just behind the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   For the driver, everything inside the NSX feels just right. The
steering is on the money in effort, feedback and precision. The
shifter moves with short, precise throws. All the switches, from
turn signals to radio dials, yield positive and solid movements.
It's a great place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, there is an automatic-transmission version with a
slightly detuned engine, but why anyone would buy an NSX so hobbled
is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is moved far forward in the interior, creating a
sloping form that provides a spacious feeling. The seats are firm
and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The NSX has never been a volume seller. They only make 500 of
them a year, completely by hand, one at a time. That compares with
about 10,000 Porsche Boxsters and 20,000 BMW Z3s sold last year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But for any well-heeled soul looking for a high-end sport
machine, I'd say check out the NSX. It's the best seat in town to
enjoy that midlife crisis. &QL;

CONFIDENT HALAMA CONTAINS CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The best team in basketball intimidates John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a diehard Knick fan,'' the Mariners left-hander said with
a sigh Friday night, as he watched New York struggle against the
San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. ``But they don't have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The best team in baseball doesn't faze him at all.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the measured self-assurance that is becoming a
trademark, Halama beat the Cleveland Indians, 9-4, with seven
strong innings at Jacobs Field. He was touched for two singles and
a three-run homer in the eighth, but mastered the Indians until
that inning, keeping them off balance with an assortment of
off-speed pitches and winning for the third time as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed that from him in spring training, and that's one of
the best features that he has,'' catcher Dan Wilson said of
Halama's poise. ``He's so stone-faced out there and so focused at
the same time. It's really a great asset for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Halama's repertoire, especially against a team like the
Indians, which often devours fastball pitchers. Halama's fastball
averages about 87 miles per hour, so he relies on change-ups,
curveballs and, like veteran Jamie Moyer, variations on his
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he realizes it or not, he changes speeds with his
fastball a lot,'' Wilson said. ``But he really didn't throw that
many tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   No more than half of Halama's 106 pitches were fastballs, and
Wilson said it may have been as few as 40 percent. The effect on
the Indians was dramatic. Cleveland came into the game with a .302
batting average, best in the majors, but did not manage a hit until
Manny Ramirez's leadoff single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Halama struck out five and did not walk a batter. He faced the
minimum number of hitters through four innings, and got double-play
ground outs to end the sixth and seventh. He improved to 5-2 on the
year, and is 3-0 with a 3.34 earned run average in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much that's going to bother me,'' Halama said.
``Give up a hit, so what? I just want to get outs. I don't want to
sit out there and keep my defense out there for a long time.
There's going to be times where I don't have it and get my tail
kicked and I give up a five-spot or a six-spot. I don't want to
walk hitters. I think that'll frustrate me more, when I walk
hitters, knowing that I'm a control pitcher. I have such a fluid
motion that I shouldn't walk anybody to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners offense gave Halama a five-run lead with a
second-inning outburst that stemmed from, of all things, an error
by seven-time Gold Glove second baseman Roberto Alomar. David Bell
looped a single over Alomar to bring home Seattle's first run, but
with two outs and two on, Brian Hunter bounced a ball toward
Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar bobbled it, and by the time his throw reached first,
Hunter already had crossed the bag. One run scored, making it 2-0
Mariners, and Charles Nagy then had to face Alex Rodriguez and Ken
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Double to left, single to right, 5-0 Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just seemed to come up on Robbie,'' said Indians
manager Mike Hargrove. ``Give credit to Brian Hunter on the play.
He hustled all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added two runs in the sixth and two more in the
ninth, when left-hander Ricky Rincon _ whom Seattle had tried to
acquire from Pittsburgh last winter _ gave up his first runs in 18
games this year. Griffey belted his 25th homer to lead off the
inning, rocketing a high fastball 464 feet into the right-center
field bleachers for the third-longest homer in the six-year history
of the Jake.
</P>
<P>
   It also moved Griffey past Indians legend Rocky Colavito for
42nd place on the all-time home run list, with 375. Butch Huskey
followed with his 13th homer one batter later.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero finished up for the M's _ who have now won four in
a row _ with his first relief outing since Sept. 11, 1993, a span
of 170 starts. Fassero sandwiched a strikeout between a pair of
ground outs for a one-two-three ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problems,'' he said. ``It was a positive first step. And
it's pretty easy to go out there with a five-run lead in the
ninth.''

FOR SLUMPING DAVIS, WALK A GOOD SIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It did not help his batting average or produce a run
or affect the outcome of a game. But Russ Davis had a good at-bat
Wednesday night in Detroit, and the way things are going for him,
that was a start.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners third baseman worked the count full, fouled off
about five pitches and drew a walk. Few in Tiger Stadium may have
paid much attention, but the Mariners bench noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he fouled those balls off, the entire dugout was roaring
for him,'' said hitting coach Jesse Barfield. ``You could see his
confidence building on each pitch. His swing was much shorter that
at-bat. As a hitter, you try to take something positive out of each
at-bat, and that was certainly something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last 11 games, Davis is 4-for-41 (.098) with one run
batted in and no extra-base hits. Manager Lou Piniella has started
John Mabry at third in four of the past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96 I struggled my first 50 at-bats,'' Davis said. ``I've
always been kind of an up-and-down, streaky type hitter, but I
think this is as bad as it's been since that '96 season.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse after Wednesday's game, Davis watched a video
of his walk and also studied the ``ugly ones'' that preceded it.
But Thursday's game brought no better results, as Davis went
0-for-2 and was removed for a pinch hitter. He did not start Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' Davis said. ``Guys are going to continue to
pitch me away and throw sliders away until I show them I can go get
that ball and take it the opposite way, like I've done in the past.
There's nothing wrong with my mechanics. It's simple _ I'm pulling
off the ball. I'm getting myself out swinging at stuff off the
plate and over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   By pulling off the ball, instead of keeping his lead shoulder
closed, Davis is denying himself his best asset, Barfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's on, he has some of the quickest hands in baseball,
and I try to continually remind him to trust his hands,'' Barfield
said. ``But when you're 2-for-20, your confidence level is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis agreed. Struggling for about a month, he felt he was
emerging from his slump two weeks ago. But then he got to Colorado,
where Rockies pitchers threw him nothing but sliders away, and he
went hitless in eight at-bats. He started tinkering with his stance
``instead of just going up there and hitting,'' and the problems
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to get my mindset right and believe in my
hands,'' Davis said. ``Let the ball just travel a little bit
further, let it get back in my zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Barfield isn't the only one helping Davis. Center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. recently noticed that Davis was standing flat-footed in
the batter's box. Correcting that, Davis said, will help him get to
more outside pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's behind me and wants me to get out of this thing,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   DEADLINE DOLLARS: Whenever the Mariners have been in a pennant
race the past several years, they've made deals near the July 31
trading deadline. With trade talk around the league increasing in
the next month, Mariners vice president for baseball operations
Woody Woodward would like to be active again.
</P>
<P>
   One snag, of course, is the budget. Ownership has yet to
authorize an increase in the team's $53 million payroll. When asked
if that could change if Seattle is still in contention in a month,
Woodward said, ``I don't know that right now. My directive from
(president) Chuck Armstrong is to be out there looking and keep him
informed of what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   That means approaching potential budget increases on a
case-by-case basis. ``It probably will depend on how strongly we
like what's available to us,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Kevin Appier and Toronto's David Wells are
front-line starting pitchers who are expensive but could become
available if their teams continue to struggle. Woodward appears to
be open to discussing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking is free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EDGAR READY: Concerns about Edgar Martinez's sore left elbow
were so serious Friday afternoon that Martinez said he would have
X-rays on it during the game. But the M's designated hitter took
batting practice and felt only minor soreness, and told manager Lou
Piniella he's ready to go. No X-rays were taken on the elbow, which
was hit by a pitch last Saturday.

SPURS PUT KNICKS IN 2-0 HOLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Say this much for San Antonio Spurs fans: They do
not hide the fact they're a spoiled and greedy bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Just how fat the Spurs have made their following became evident
midway through the fourth quarter at the Alamodome. At that time,
it was apparent San Antonio would polish off the New York Knicks
with Friday night's 80-67 victory in Game 2 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweep,'' the faithful roared. ``Sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. The Spurs did not get credit for three wins after going
ahead 2-0 in this best-of-seven series. No. The series is not over.
</P>
<P>
   But San Antonio has now won an NBA record 12 straight playoff
games, and it seems unlikely the Spurs' next loss is in sight.
Especially when the Knicks can't see straight.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's defense again forced a horrid shooting night by
the Knicks, who head home for Games 3 and 4, and Game 5 if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   New York's hope is that Madison Square Garden will provide a
better backdrop after it shot just 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams combined to produce the second-lowest scoring game in
Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Spurs are playing the type of defense they used to
sweep the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland in the previous two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two series weren't that easy,'' said Spurs center
David Robinson, who is two victories away from winning his first
title in 10 seasons. ``Everybody said it looked easy but they were
not that easy. Our defense just took them out of what they wanted
to do. Playing the Knicks is not easy. They're explosive. They're
relentless. ... I don't know what it looks like but they're making
us work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' postseason run is better than that of the great
Showtime Lakers during the 1980s, and the Michael Jordan-led
Chicago Bulls who won six titles this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are very confident,'' New York forward Marcus Camby
said. ``Guys on this team have a lot of pride. ``We definitely
don't want to get swept. I don't think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is working much harder but to no avail. Robinson and
Twin Tower Tim Duncan made scoring inside against them a fruitless
chore. Robinson rejected five shots and Duncan swatted four to
account for all of San Antonio's blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were even intimidated into missing several
point-blank shot attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent they're thinking about coming to the hole.
They understand it's not going to be easy getting to the rim,''
Robinson said. ``We've done a good job taking away the transition
buckets which they count on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, the Spurs disrupted the Knicks teamwork, too. New
York had just eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort level and our mental state is fine,'' Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``We just need to score. ... The shot-blocking
presence really creates bad shot selection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks reverted to one-on-one play, which allowed Duncan and
Robinson to stand in the paint like fly swatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great defensive team, especially at the basket,''
Van Gundy said. ``But the game was decided at the free-throw line.
They could get their shots and we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio shot 35 free throws. The Knicks were 11-of-12 from
the stripe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Game 1, New York stayed clear of foul trouble. Van
Gundy rotated Camby, Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby
to defend Duncan. Camby was the only one to foul out late in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson missed 10 of his 12 shots. Thomas was 1-for-6 and Camby
made just 3-of-9 field goals. Sprewell scored 26 points, but he was
8-for-22.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan finished with a modest 25 points and 15 rebounds after
taking 33 points and 16 boards in Game 1. It was Duncan who
provided the Spurs with the biggest momentum play.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 56-59 with 2.5 seconds left in the third, Duncan slid in
the lane and rebounded Sean Elliott's free throw miss. Duncan
scored a putback that keep the Knicks at arm's length heading into
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led 39-34 at halftime and never allowed the Knicks to
get closer than five points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed it up a little bit. They double teamed a little
harder,'' Duncan said. ``I didn't get as many easy looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duncan was plenty more effective than anyone the Knicks
had down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our main three guys to be efficient offensively,'' Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Or risk being swept?
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk will be there because of what happened in the last
rounds,'' Popovich said. ``But sweep was not in our minds against
the Lakers and Portland. We try to play with an appropriate amount
of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are evidently not afraid of playing on the road. They
San have yet to lose on the road in the playoffs.

SELFISH CHARITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Finance ministers meeting this weekend in Cologne, Germany, have
an opportunity to improve economic stability everywhere by helping
to ease the mountain of debt burying the world's poorest countries.
Reducing that burden is in the best interest of debtors and
creditors alike.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other
international lending institutions have identified about 40
countries with aggregate indebtedness of $170 billion that urgently
need relief. A sensible procedure has been established that
assesses the ratio between a country's annual cost for debt service
(interest and principal) and the income the country derives from
exports. If debt obligations exceed trade income by 2 1/2 times,
the country is deemed a candidate for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, first put to use three years ago, has produced only
modest gains so far. Only two countries _ Uganda and Bolivia _ are
fully engaged in a debt-clearing procedure, and four others are
approaching that goal out of a preliminary group of 12 nominated
for aid. Of the balance, some, like Sudan and Somalia, are in such
turmoil they are out of reach. Others haven't begun taking the
necessary political steps _ such as budget restraint and tax
collection _ to handle their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the debt problem of the poorest countries is
important not only for their interests but for those of wealthier
countries. In the struggle to cope with debt service, poor
countries sell their exports, often basic commodities like
minerals, at whatever price they can get, in the process driving
down not only their own income but that of other countries. While
lower prices benefit consumers, the benefits are achieved on the
backs of people at the bottom of the economic pile.
</P>
<P>
   The debt crisis also prevents poor countries from making
progress in basic development _ roads, education, medicine,
communications _ that would allow them to become better customers
for products from the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking this chain will not be easy or cheap. The alternative,
however, is in the long run far more costly.

DODGERS BATS GO SILENT
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHROUGH  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes was
close to brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   So upon consulting the Dodgers' hand-held chart of why this was
a loss, a lack of offense, coupled with better pitching from the
other team, seems to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the Dodgers' Murphy's Law-kind-of-world these days, in
which they managed four hits and lost to the Philadelphia Phillies
2-1 in front of 41,590 Friday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ninth time in 12 series the Dodgers lost the first game
of a series at home. The Dodgers (30-35) are five games under .500
for the first time since losing to Philadelphia on May 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on with this team,'' said Dodgers
third baseman Adrian Beltre, who hit a solo homer in the second.
``We're supposed to be strong with starting pitching, and (Valdes)
throws a great game and we don't score. If it's not one thing, it's
the other. It's a lot of bad things. Everything is negative for us.
We're not playing the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest undoing wasn't that Valdes surrendered solo homers to
Westlake High's Mike Lieberthal or Rico Brogna, or that Phillies
ace Curt Schilling returned to form. It was the Dodgers' running
themselves out of a potential winning rally in the eighth inning
with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros' one-out liner was caught by Phillies shortstop Alex
Arias, who doubled Eric Young off second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking my shuffled steps (on the pitch),'' Young said.
``If I did a better job of getting back, it would have been a
double play anyway. This is a tough drop for us. You keep going at
it and hope it turns, and you hope you don't get too far behind
before it turns.''
</P>
<P>
   The inning began with Schilling (9-4) on the bench after
throwing 101 pitches in seven innings. Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen
drew a four-pitch walk off reliever Steve Montgomery, Young singled
just over the head of third baseman Scott Rolen and Jose Vizcaino
sacrificed. Raul Mondesi was intentionally walked before Karros
lined into the double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about hitting it on the button, but you can't
guide it,'' Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes pitched the ninth for his eighth save. The only
saving grace is Arizona lost and the Dodgers remain nine games
back. But the Dodgers have lost six of seven and nine of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right guys in the right spots and we just didn't do
it,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``You're not supposed to
get doubled up on a line drive. Maybe from his view he thought the
ball was going to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Schilling's first win since May 29 when he shut out the
Colorado Rockies. It also ends a miserable stretch in which
Schilling went 0-2 with a 6.97 ERA in three starts as his ERA went
from 2.57 to 3.39.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who's thrown six complete games, allowed three hits,
and after Beltre's tied it 1-1 in the second allowed one runner
past first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Schilling looked like he was tired, although he
threw well,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``I don't think
Schilling has to pitch every inning to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was nearly Schilling's equal, but the trend of nonsupport
is now bestowed upon him. Valdes (5-6) yielded five hits and two
runs but lost. It's the fifth straight start Valdes has allowed
three earned runs or less, yet for the fourth straight time he
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Valdes has been victimized by this season is the
long ball, and that's how the Phillies built their 2-1 lead. He's
given up a team-high 16.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal put the Phillies ahead 1-0 in the second with his
15th homer, but Beltre tied the score with a solo homer in the
bottom of the inning. Valdes and Schilling remained locked in a
speedy duel until the seventh when Brogna led off with a homer to
center field to give the Phillies a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valdes did an outstanding job and again we didn't get him any
runs,'' Young said. ``We're just not getting the breaks. It seems
that's the way it keeps going.''

PET ROCK?

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Planetary Society's ``Name the Asteroid Contest'' is a nice
break for the earthbound. Even though the entry deadline has
passed, the winner is not expected for a few weeks, so a person can
still contemplate the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 entries came in for the naming of the space rock
known as ``1992 KD'' since its discovery seven years ago by Eleanor
Helin and Kenneth Lawrence at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They had naming rights
but thought the public might enjoy doing the honors and turned the
project over to Carl Sagan's Planetary Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since the asteroid is a study target for NASA's Deep Space 1
mission, which is testing new technologies, the society asked
entrants to name the rock after an inventor.
</P>
<P>
   There were the expected nominees _ Albert Einstein, Galileo
Galilei, Thomas Edison, Sir Isaac Newton. But the not-so-obvious
suggestions are more interesting _ Philo T. Farnsworth, inventor of
television; Microsoft magnate Bill Gates; physicist Stephen
Hawking; naturalist John Muir; the fictional Merlin; a cat named
``Gertie''; the word ``necessity'' _ because it is ``the mother of
invention''; actress Hedy Lamarr.
</P>
<P>
   That last name is not as crazy as it sounds, for Lamarr did
invent an electronic guidance system for the military that is the
underlying technology for cellular phones. Putting a Hollywood star
among the real ones for her intellect might appeal to the judges'
imaginations, although the International Astronomical Union, which
must approve the name, could take a more conservative view.
</P>
<P>
   Naming what is beyond our control makes nature less scary. An
asteroid may be more than a mile wide, but with a first name it
would seem less likely to blast a hole in the earth. Man continues
to make pets of the wild things, ever seeking to temper his fear
while reaching out for a piece of immortality.

SPURS SHOOT, MISS,   WIN EASILY ANYWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Less than two minutes into Game 2, Sean Elliott
pulled up from 24 feet and launched an unsightly jump shot that
smashed against the rim with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, his teammate, Mario Elie, stood alone behind
the 3-point line, waiting for the ball to arrive. When it did, he
set his feet, straightened his shoulders and released a misdirected
shot that ended up as a Chris Dudley rebound.
</P>
<P>
   For the Spurs, it was that kind of night. Midrange jumpers
clanged off the rim. Three-pointers fell short. And still San
Antonio defeated the Knicks by 80-67 to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams win ugly,'' said Jaren Jackson, who made one of
five 3-pointers after hitting five in Game 1. ``It was kind of
scary at moments, but we were able to finish it off and just grind
it out. It was ugly but it was effective.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how the game but overmatched Knicks will ever
defeat these Spurs if they did not do it Friday night. Jackson, who
scored 17 points in Game 1, was as cold as one of those late-night
bus rides he used to take while playing in the Continental
Basketball Association. He missed his first four 3-pointers before
making good on his last attempt with 10 seconds remaining and the
game already decided.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, the miracle worker who won Game 2 of the Western
Conference finals against Portland by sinking an off-balance
3-pointer with 9.9 seconds left, was more effective on the drive
than the spot-up jumper, going 1 for 4 from 3-point range. All
told, the Spurs made just 2 of 12 3-pointers and just eight shots
outside the painted area.
</P>
<P>
   It is on nights such as these that the Spurs are vulnerable. Tim
Duncan (25 points, 15 rebounds, four blocks) and David Robinson (16
points, 11 rebounds, 5 blocks) will always do their damage,
especially against injury-depleted front lines like that of the
Knicks, so when one of the Spurs' perimeter players is hot, San
Antonio is all but unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night the Spurs, who did not hit their first jump
shot until Steve Kerr buried a 21-footer 4 minutes 17 seconds into
the second quarter, won with a sometimes overlooked aspect of their
excellence _ their defense.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, the league's best defensive team throughout the
regular season, overcame its shooting woes by holding the Knicks to
32.9 percent shooting. With the great shot blockers, Duncan and
Robinson, combining to swat nine shots, the Spurs had the Knicks
bewildered. Even when one of the agile seven-footers wasn't there
to contest a shot, the Knicks seemed to be thinking about them as
they missed numerous attempts near the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a terrific defensive team,'' Elie said. ``Dave and
Tim are always talking, and if you get beat they're going to be
there and that's the trust we have in each other. We've been No. 1
in defense all year and there's a reason for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie's shot was as off as that of the rest of his teammates, as
he missed all three of his 3-point attempts, including one that
missed the rim and backboard entirely. But the New York City native
adjusted and, instead of settling for the jump shot, took the ball
to the hole to score 15 points, two of which came on a resounding
driving slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my game. I'm a city ball player,'' said Elie, who made
7 of 8 free throws. ``I put my head down and went to the rack. I
was a little frustrated that I missed two 3's from the corner, but
when your shots are not going, you have to put your head down and
try to get to the free-throw line and get a little rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Spurs' five key perimeter players _ Jackson, Elie,
Elliott, Kerr and Avery Johnson _ shot just 13 for 37 from the
field for 35.1 percent. Almost all the points they scored came from
the foul line and on drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich wondered aloud if
his team could win without a major contribution from outside
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly hope you're going to get something from the
perimeter,'' Popovich said. ``If we don't, we'll be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, that proved to be untrue. &QL;

REAPPRAISING THE ODDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A new national report on gambling has sound advice, making it
hard to ignore gambling's many problems, from addiction and youth
gambling to the industry's financial hold on elected officials. We
hope the findings will not go unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   Issued by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, the
report observes that too many governments make patchwork decisions
about gambling. Instead of hasty action, the commission suggests,
there should be a moratorium on any expansion of gambling so policy
makers can take time to think. It's a good idea but unlikely to
succeed, given the money-fueled passion of gambling proponents.
</P>
<P>
   And other commission ideas, because they are hard to do well,
stand to be ignored, especially a prohibition on Internet gambling.
But there should be fast action on the recommendation that
gambling-related problems should be added to existing federal
research on substance abuse and mental health. And the commission
wisely suggests that regulatory agencies set rules that would
permit gambling enterprises to refuse customers with pathological
gambling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthwhile step would be for the federal government to
collect and disseminate detailed case studies of specific
municipalities, from Las Vegas to less well known places in New
Mexico. The studies should examine revenues, traffic impact, how
much regulation is needed, police costs, security needs, divorce
rates, whether nongambling retailers are hurt, and the impact on
employment rates. The results would help illustrate some of the
commission's points, such as its observation that job quality is
better in resort casinos than in those that serve a local
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission can't force action. That has to come from the
public and the politicians.

COX'S CHINA SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a consequence of a House committee report marred by
unbalanced testimony and unfounded conclusions, Congress has been
in the throes of an old-fashioned Cold War fright about Chinese
espionage at the nation's nuclear weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial to retrace any actual theft of classified material
and rectify security violations that can be corrected, but the
shoddy work of the House Select Committee on US National Security
and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of
China, chaired by Republican Christopher Cox of California, has
induced an unnecessary panic about Chinese espionage and the
specter of poor security at US labs.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that measures taken against an overblown threat
can do as much harm to national security as the espionage they were
meant to thwart.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico the damage has
already begun. Congressmen and government bureaucrats who show no
understanding of science or security have imposed Draconian secrecy
rules. The primary effect has been not to make nuclear secrets more
secure but to undermine the quality of science and prevent Los
Alamos scientists from fulfilling their mission _ competent
stewardship of the country's nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States has ceased training enough top-level
pure scientists, Los Alamos is obliged to recruit 25 percent of its
pure scientists from abroad, and many of these exceptionally
qualified people come from so-called sensitive countries such as
Israel, India, and China. Rules imposed in the wake of the Cox
report prohibit non-US citizens from working on any pure science
project that might receive money from the ``X sector'' _ the
weapons sector _ at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the best postdoctoral fellows recruited for the
lab ``have turned us down because of this new climate of
suspicion,'' Fred Cooper, a senior scientist at Los Alamos, told
the Globe. Also, arbitrary restrictions on travel _ even by
scientists who do no work on sensitive projects _ have cast a chill
over a scientific community that depends on open conferences to
pursue its work.
</P>
<P>
   These rules and restrictions, although they do nothing to
improve security, are demoralizing and are driving away some of the
best scientists. ``This myopic view of the security problem really
jeopardizes our weapons program and the safety of the country more
than espionage can,'' said Cooper, stressing that he could speak
only as a concerned physicist and not for the Los Alamos
management.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the nonproliferation project at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, Joseph Cirincione, concurred on
the harm done at US weapons labs. ``The best scientists will leave
or just will not come,'' Cirincione said. ``The only question is,
How big will our losses be and how long will the panic last?''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione and Cooper are both adamant on the need for rigorous
enforcement of effective security rules at the labs. Both cite the
value of ending once and for all the insouciant habit some
scientists have had of downloading computer files from secure
machines at the lab to their computers at home. If researchers want
to do sensitive work at night, they will have to return to their
labs to work on secure computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FBI and the CIA conduct continual background checks
on lab staff, a useful improvement would be to make certain that
there are no gaps in this routine counterintelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security requires a delicate but achievable
balancing of espionage safeguards at the country's nuclear weapons
labs and the protection of a scientific culture that remains
hospitable to the best physicists from around the world. The false
conclusions and worst-case projections of the Cox committee must
not be allowed to subvert America's privileged status as the place
where the world's most accomplished scientists want to work.
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione recently said of the Cox report: ``I know
congressional reports. I have written congressional reports. This
is no congressional report. It is a propaganda piece.'' Propaganda
of this kind should not lead to fearful or confused politicians
casting away the irreplaceable scientific treasures that are unique
to this country.

 (For release Monday, June 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The car is getting smarter than the driver _ an unsettling trend
despite the good intentions of safety engineers. Nissan is
experimenting with a vehicle that not only warns motorists who are
about to do something stupid but overrides them if they don't heed
the warning.
</P>
<P>
   This back-seat driver in the dashboard can automatically hit the
brakes if the car is about to run into something. Also, sensors
outside the car _ and in the steering wheel, the seat, the gas
pedal, and the brakes _ allow a computer to track a driver's every
twitch, anticipating a lane change too close to an oncoming bus or
the need for more gas as the car enters a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Such a car is not yet on the road but could be by 2005. Japan is
marketing adaptive cruise control, a system that automatically
adjusts a car's speed to maintain a safe distance between it and
the car ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also, sophisticated navigational aids _ global positioning
systems _ are standard in Japan and becoming so in Europe. These
systems, available in luxury vehicles in the United States, can
give the driver precise, insistent verbal directions as well as
computerized mapping, so traveling with them is a bit like having
an automated spouse on board, particularly if a motorist decides to
defy the map and take a ``short cut.''
</P>
<P>
   US government and auto industry representatives are discussing
the life-saving potential and marketability of such innovations as
infrared windshield sensors for improved night vision, drowsiness
detectors that send a blast of peppermint-scented cold air into a
driver's face, and devices that sound an alarm if there is someone
in a driver's blind spot or if the vehicle is inching too close to
the edge of the road.
</P>
<P>
   All ingenious ideas, but do consumers want to pay for them?
We've come a long way since Henry Ford and the crank and the
quintessentially American experience of freedom on the road. But
for many drivers, progress will still come down to one basic
question: Would Jack Kerouac have driven across the country with
sensors in his seat?

FACING FACTS ABOUT CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, June 21, 1999)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a grim, common fact: Young minorities are overrepresented
in the criminal justice system. But in 1988, rather than succumb to
what-do-you-expect ennui, Congress required states to act. Today 40
states have programs that analyze and respond to the
disproportionate numbers _ without quotas and without being soft on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Now this progress is in danger. Senators Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota and Edward Kennedy presented an amendment to protect
these programs during last week's debate on the juvenile justice
bill, but it was tabled. Calling the amendment unconstitutional
because it ``makes an overt racial classification'' without having
any extraordinary justification for doing so, Utah's Senator Orrin
Hatch concluded that if more young minorities do the crime, they
should serve the time.
</P>
<P>
   This comfortable conclusion is flawed. Across all offense
categories from 1985 through 1994, black youths were more likely
than whites to be detained. Black males were four times more likely
to be admitted to a juvenile facility for property crimes and 30
times more likely for drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Black youths are 26 percent of those arrested but make up 32
percent of those sent to juvenile court, 41 percent of those
detained as delinquents, and 52 percent of those tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   As Wellstone notes, looking at race is not inherently
unconstitutional. In a letter, more than 35 law professors at
schools ranging from the University of Alabama to Yale wrote that
constitutional questions arise only ``if there is some burden or
benefit allocated on the basis of race.'' Merely investigating
discrimination is not illegal, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A House bill would preserve these efforts. And the House has
passed an amendment to expand them. Now the issue must be hashed
out in conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   It would be outrageous to stop asking why the legal system is so
much harder on minority youth. Contrary to Hatch's argument, there
is an extraordinary justification for doing so.

CUP COULD BE WOMEN'S SPORTS BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, N.J. _ Frankly, some soccer purists have been
offended that the 1999 Women's World Cup has been billed as the
world's largest women's sporting event, not as a world soccer
championship.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is soccer. Advancing opportunities for women is something
else.
</P>
<P>
   Or, is it?
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 World Cup set to open Saturday, U.S. superstar Mia
Hamm did not chafe at the notion that she and her teammates are
still as much a symbol of women's athletic ability and achievement
as they are real, live, superb soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   Their game cannot exactly be separated from the movement to
advance women's sports. They do not believe the intertwining of
sport and symbol diminishes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in terms of having it sink in that we have been
pioneers, it's a continuing process. We're doing everything we can
to continue this ascension (of women's soccer),'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a soccer perspective, we still want a professional league
started so those young girls can grow up dreaming of playing
professionally for a living. So there's still work that needs to be
done, but I think we're moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will these soccer players from 16 countries, who will
play in 32 games on the road to a July 10 championship match, be
like? That is the ultimate question on the eve of this
``breakthrough'' sporting event for women.
</P>
<P>
   Are they role models or soccer players?
</P>
<P>
   Are they pioneers or professional athletes?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it fine to be all those things at once?
</P>
<P>
   And when the TV cameras start rolling Saturday for the U.S.
opener at Giants Stadium, and the China match in Palo Alto, what
will this World Cup look like to whomever tunes in?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that, at least in the case of games involving the
U.S., China, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Brazil and Italy, there will
be general surprise at the level of skill and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, World Cup organizers are secretly hoping the Spurs
will sweep the Knicks and end the NBA Finals. That might open the
door for more cursory sports fans to channel surf to these World
Cup games, just to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, this tournament has a chance to build some
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to understanding the athletic and star appeal of
some of the world's best players, there is a good chance that just
like during the 1996 Olympics _ when the women in softball,
basketball, swimming and soccer shined _ new names and faces will
become familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hamm, U.S. striker Tiffeny Milbrett is expected to have
a breakthrough tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For Canada, a former North Carolina State star named Charmaine
Hooper is the team's top scorer, capable of making Sportscenter
highlight goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have a stellar goalie in Goa Hong, who is apparently
as media savvy and expressive as any Westerner.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians play the same balletic style as their male
counterparts, so look to Katia and Pretinha for fancy footwork.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians have Linda Medalen, a 33-year-old veteran who
lives to give the U.S. fits, and Ann Krisin Aarones, who scored the
goal in the 1995 World Cup that ousted the U.S. from the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball went over the top in the wake of the 1996
Olympics, when professional leagues arose, and so did a more
diverse landscape of athletic stars for fans of all genders, and
soccer has had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, with this World Cup, some of that waiting is over.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the announced crowd at Giants Stadium
for the opening matches of the 1999 Women's World Cup will exceed
76,481.
</P>
<P>
   That was the number of people who stood in Georgia's Sanford
Stadium to see the U.S. women win the gold medal in the '96
Olympics. That was the largest crowd ever to see a women's sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``To walk out onto that field that day in front of all those
people screaming, that was a tremendous crowd. That was quite a
statement,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as much as the quality of play is important, statements
are, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Giants Stadium must and will deliver a sellout. As
statements go, this opener must exceed the Olympic gold medal
match, just to put this tournament in motion, to get it rolling so
that this World Cup can set a new watermark.
</P>
<P>
   The players are more than ready for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always played this game with a high sense of
responsibility,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on this team a long time, but Michelle Akers and
April Heinrichs and the other veterans basically set the groundwork
for what this team is all about: working hard, no cutting corners.
There are no shortcuts. We treat the game and our opponent with
respect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we play, in a lot of different cities, in big
venues and small venues ... it's amazing the support we've gotten.
And also if you look at the number of young girls who are playing
soccer in this country, there's a market.''
</P>
<P>
   For the heavily favored U.S. team, winning this World Cup is
every bit about demonstrating their utter dedication to
professionalism. And then it is more than that. It is a celebration
and a dare. There is still more to be done, and this is the stage.

NBA FINALS GIVE FANS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Most discerning NBA followers knew that the Finals
between San Antonio and New York was not going to be epic.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it an unbalanced matchup, owing at least in part to
all the Knicks' injuries, it followed the worst season in NBA
history, owing to the lockout and compressed calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But no one quick expected the championship series to calcify
right before the eyes of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, good for the long-suffering basketball fans of San
Antonio, but the remaining witnesses need to petition the NBA to
call a halt to the proceedings before all hoops dignity is lost and
traditions forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's 80-67 win by the Spurs at the Alamodome was
another slash across a once-handsome face. Compared to the great
Celtics-Lakers matchups of the 1980s, or even a little of the
Bulls-Jazz dramas of the last couple of seasons, the Knicks and
Spurs are going positively Flintstone on us.
</P>
<P>
   Only it's not yabba-dabba-do time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Spurs are up two games _ the biggest 2-0 lead
since Sandy Koufax against anybody _ it's a little difficult to
celebrate anything about the second-lowest-scoring contest in
Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect us to shoot this badly,'' said David Robinson,
cringing a little at the numbers. ``We shot the ball better in the
regular season and earlier in the playoffs. But that also gives us
confidence because we still can win without great scoring. We know
somebody is going to step up and hit big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice because we don't have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine for you, big guy. What about the rest of us who have to
watch?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the Spurs have won a record 12 straight playoff
games and 44 of their last 50 overall. But 43 percent from the
field and 68 percent from the line against a crippled, intimidated
team? Expressions such as grandeur, majesty and whoopie do not
readily slip out the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we outplayed them,'' admitted Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich. ``We just knocked down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a better chance to knock down the building,
presuming they could be directed to a wall. They shot 33 percent,
including a stretch in the first half in which they missed an
incredible 18 of 19 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing the Knicks trying to score against the Spurs has all
the compelling allure of watching primitive man evolve from
hunter-gatherers to an agrarian culture. Decades can pass between
significant developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' offense clearly has developed a magnum case of the
yips about hoisting a ball anywhere near Robinson and Tim Duncan,
the 7-footers who now have only to flick eyebrows at the visitors
to alter shots. Despite all the New York pregame rhetoric about
attacking the big men, San Antonio tied a Finals record for fewest
personal fouls with 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason they lead the league in field goal
defense,'' said Knick coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``They do it with great
lane intimdiation. I thought we had some good looks. But nothing
comes easy with those two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair combined to block nine shots, and when it's considered
that the Knicks only attempted 67, that's a high failure rate
before the rocket even leaves the launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to attribute Knick failures strictly to
the imposing tandem. The Knicks also missed 12 of 14 shots beyond
the arc, where the giants never tread.
</P>
<P>
   The decimated Knicks are plain awful. There's a chance the U.S.
women's soccer team will score more goals today in its tournament
opener at the Meadowlands than the Knicks will muster in Game 3
Mondayin Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed point-blank shots,'' Van Gundy said. ``At other
times, we were trying to squeeze it, instead of doing one more
drive, one more kick-out or one more pick-and-roll to create a
better shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the missed shots. It was the 24-second
violations, the dribbles off feet, the silly fouls, the 35-12
disparity in free throws. The whole evening was lame, right down to
the ``Go Spurs Go'' chant that the team actually paid an ad agency
to invent and promote.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of great contemporary literature doesn't come cheaply,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very ugly win, no way to hide that,'' said Duncan,
who again led the Spurs with 25 points and 16 rebounds. ``We win
best ugly. We never claimed to be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's nice to know somebody's happy. The rest of us
will have to find joy going into the 1950s archives for those
dreamy set-shooting classics between Fort Wayne and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Retro is so big in so many parts of American culture that by
Monday the Spurs need to break out the short shorts and thick black
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Style points may be the only points available the rest of this
series.

PURSLEY FEELS RIGHT AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ The home-track advantage was all Greg
Pursley needed.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley, who has won at Irwindale Speedway five times, passed
Austin Cameron of the NASCAR Winston West series to win the Super
Late Model race before a crowd of 2,585 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty rough night,'' said Pursley, who has beaten
the best from the Featherlite Southwest Tour at Irwindale and now
three Winston West drivers. ``The competition was really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, fourth in the NWWS points race, led from lap 2 through
lap 30 of the 50-lap main event. Newhall's Pursley, running on
older tires, inched up on Cameron, from El Cajon, and drafted him
for two laps before making a pass on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to think tire strategy,'' he said. ``I knew that 112 car
(Cameron) would be hard to take because he had newer tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said he developed a push, which made it hard to maintain
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had the better car. I began dialing in more back
brakes. I'm just glad I was able to put more laps on this track
before (tonight's race).''
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-lap Grand American main event, Rip Michels pulled away
from Mike Ayers on the final two laps for the win. In the 25-lap
Street Stock main event, Doug McComb held off T.K. Karvasek for his
first Irwindale victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley started seventh in the inverted field and didn't seem to
have a shot at moving near the leaders early on. Finishing off lap
7, he found a hole between two cars and shot between it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes,'' Pursley said. ``The car on the outside
started drifting in and my spotter told me someone was on my
quarter panel. It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grand Am, Michels, from Mission Hills, led by half a
straightaway and looked like an easy winner until Gerry Mielke and
Robert Rice hooked up and spun in turn 4 with the white flag to go.
On the restart, Michels slowed Ayers, from Las Vegas, and then took
off for the win. Canyon Country's John Watkinson _ who crashed
during the trophy dash _ started last and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Michels said. ``I'm starting to build up for
the points race.''
</P>
<P>
   In Super Stocks, McComb, from Thousand Oaks, held off
hard-charging Karvasek, from North Hills. Karvasek got side-by-side
with three laps to go, but McComb managed to stay in front for the
win. Whittier's Greg Benner finished third.

   With the economy booming, the future's so bright for this year's
crop of college grads that, as the song says, they gotta wear
shades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet of course, not every job interview goes swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Recently in this space, prospective employers shared their
recollections of the most clueless applicants to ever walk in the
door _ including one loser who had a pizza delivered in
mid-interview and another who showed up in her bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to turn the tables _ with job seekers' critical
assessments of their corporate recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   The quotations below were collected in a written survey of
college seniors and post-graduates conducted this year by
WetFeet.com, an online job-market information service for students.

<P>
   _ ``During an interview, I was describing my work experience,
and the recruiter picked up his cell phone and checked his voice
mail while I was still talking.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``One of my interviewers ate an ice cream cone throughout the
entire 30-minute interview. He kept apologizing and said that it
was just too good to pass up.''

management consulting position, the interviewer spoke about his
life and past jobs for 38 minutes of the 45-minute interview.''

the other, and they both spilled their coffee on themselves.''

   _ ``My future boss stood in the doorway and started scratching
his back on the door frame like a big bear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When asked where I want to work, I replied New York City.
And the interviewer responded, `How about I put St. Louis?'''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I was so excited when I heard that there was a Fed Ex
waiting for me outside my dorm room. I figured it was details about
a `Super Saturday' of final round interviews, but in fact they
apparently thought I was so unqualified for the job that my
rejection letter required an overnight delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``One of my third-round interviews started with the following
statement: ``Same questions as yesterday, but you must respond
differently.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I interviewed with Microsoft, the interviewer asked me
how I would design Bill Gates' bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``One guy started counting his money in the middle of our
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Someone telling me I was getting old and needed to figure out
a definite career plan ASAP. (I am 30), followed immediately by the
next interviewer telling me I was quite young and could take my
time finding a career.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Being taken to a strip club in Los Angeles.''

<P>
   _ ``Rubbing my leg against the table leg only to eventually find
out it was the female recruiter's leg.''

   _ ``The chair I was sitting in broke and I fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When asked what the S with a star next to it meant on my
transcript, I replied that it meant that I was a superstar. (It

pass/fail.)''
</P>

   _ ``One interviewer at a top investment bank asked me how
horseback riding was like investment banking.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Upon entering the room, one interviewer asked, `And who the
hell are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I arrived, a car had smashed into the fire hydrant at
the front of the building. The front lawn, driveway and street had
been torn up by the resulting geyser. I was hired and it turned out
the car had belonged to my new boss.''

<P>
   _ ``Flying down to Houston to interview for a position in
Chicago. (I live in Madison, Wis.)''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A steel analyst in equity research at an investment bank
lamented the industry he was covering. He spoke thus: `If I was
covering technology, I would have a hotter wife, she would be

   This Is Why You're No Einstein Either, Sweetie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grim scientists hunched over a dissected brain, calipers in hand
_ it's a sepia-toned, 19th-century sort of image. Or something from
a bizarre corner of 1950s science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But phrenology, of sorts, has once again reared its woolly head.
Thankfully, it has been combined with neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the need to fit genius into a neat little box, the world
has long figured that the brain of one Albert Einstein, certified
genius, surely held some clue to that mystery of mysteries.
Einstein himself wanted his brain studied after his death. The
pioneering physicist died in 1955 at the age of 76.
</P>
<P>
   So in pursuit of that holy grail of a clue, scientists have
subjected Einsteinian gray matter to all manner of indignities _
photographing it, measuring it, slicing it into 240 pieces and
lugging it to and fro in jars and cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And now, 44 years after the brain was removed in an autopsy,
scientists in Canada, who received specimens in 1996, have reported
their findings in the medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   A critical region of Einstein's brain _ the inferior parietal
lobe, which processes mathematical thought, three-dimensional
visualization and spatial relationships _ is notably larger than
those of more plodding mortals, the scientists found.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed a clue to Einstein's mental power, it could
well prove a crucial research tool. But given the way humanity has
taken to tinkering with itself, it also conjures more bizarre
possibilities.

   Most of the messages in Jim Sanborn's ``Kryptos,'' a sculpture
at the headquarters of the CIA, have been decrypted. Nearly 100
characters remain scrambled. Here are three of four hidden messages
(misspellings intentional):
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the
nuance of iqlusion.'' 2. ``It was totally invisible. How's that
possible? They used the earth's magnetic field. x The information

Does langley know about this? They should: it's buried out there
somewhere. x Who knows the exact location? Only WW (thought to be
William Webster, the agency's former director). This was his last
message. x Thirty eight degrees fifty seven minutes six point five
seconds north, seventy seven degrees eight minutes forty four
seconds west. ID by rows.'' 3. (Howard Carter's account of finding
Tutankhamun's tomb) ``Slowly, desparatly slowly, the remains of
passage debris that encumbered the lower part of the doorway was
removed. With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper
left-hand corner. And then, widening the hole a little, I inserted
the candle and peered in. The hot air escaping from the chamber
caused the flame to flicker, but presently details of the room

   A Quake in Mexico Claims Lives and Priceless Buildings
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in central Mexico feared the worst when the ground
shook at 3:42 p.m. Tuesday, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, But
unlike the earthquake in 1985 that killed as many as 10,000 people,
this one will be remember for the damage it did not cause. By
week's end, the death toll was 19. The toll on buildings was
higher: in the state of Puebla, dozens of priceless gems of
colonial architecture, including churches, were crippled.

   Wrong DNA, Wrong Man
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Johnson Jr., 41, walked out of a life sentence for rape
in Georgia after DNA evidence exonerated him. Sixteen years
earlier, disregarding physical evidence pointing to his innocence,
an all-white jury had convicted Johnson, who is black, based on
hazy identification from eyewitnesses. His vindication gave new
hope that such scientific evidence might help redress decades of
racial imbalance in the Southern legal system.

   Wall Street Swindle
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the indictments of 85
people on charges of bilking investors out of more than $100
million by manipulating the stock prices of small and start-up
companies. Using cold calls and payoffs to brokers, the swindlers
generated higher stock prices. Investigators said two defendants
were associates of the Colombo crime family; a third had ties to
Russian organized crime.

   An Ailing Pope
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II fought age, flu and fretful aides to complete an
exhausting 13-day trip to Poland, his eighth there. The Pope
relived the early, euphoric days of his papacy, recreating masses
that electrified the country in 1979, when communism ruled. But the
pontiff, 79, also relived his childhood, making a nostalgic and
restorative visit to his birthplace, Wadowice.

   Prime Time for Casino Ads
</P>
<P>
   Gambling casinos have a product to market, and radio and
television stations are more than willing to sell them air time.
But a 65-year-old federal law made it illegal to broadcast
advertisements for casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous Supreme Court decision declared the old law
unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds, and riddled with
exceptions and inconsistencies. Gambling advertising by
Indian-owned casinos and by state lotteries, for example, was
permitted. Now all casinos can seek their customers on a level
playing field.

   The Koreas Sparring, Again  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after former Defense Secretary William Perry traveled
to North Korea with a letter from President Clinton proposing a
path to reconciliation between the two countries, the North
responded by getting its fishing fleet and navy into a fire fight
with South Korean ships along a disputed border. The North Koreans
lost a ship and more than 20 sailors. America, though, may have
lost a chance to convince Congress that sanctions on the North
should be lifted in return for commitments from Pyongyang to give
up their missile tests and other threatening programs.

   Hold That Coke  &QL;

<P>
   In the biggest recall in Coke history, four European countries
ordered Coca-Cola products off store shelves after dozens of people
in Belgium fell ill after drinking Coke. By Friday, despite an
apology from Coca-Cola's chairman and an explanation that the
problem originated at two European bottling plants, a ban on Coke,
Sprite and Fanta remained in Belgium and Luxembourg. The
Netherlands banned products handled in Belgium, and France demanded
a recall of beverages from a plant in Dunkirk blamed for some of
the incidents.

   No Magic Bullet for Cancer
</P>
<P>
   In an international study that offered new hope for delaying the
onset of breast cancer, risk of the disease was lowered by 76
percent among postmenopausal women who took an osteoporosis drug,
raloxifene, for three years compared to a similar group that took a
placebo. But because the duration of benefit is unknown and
raloxifene can produce unwanted effects, experts cautioned against
recommending it as an anti-breast-cancer drug except in clinical
trials.

   A New Indian Museum  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fine Arts Commission, the esthetic arbiter of the appearance
of what can be built in Washington's monument area, unanimously
approved the design of the Smithsonian Institution's new National
Museum of the American Indian. It will cost at least $110 million
and is to open in 2002 on the last available site on the Mall. The
museum's collection will include most of the holdings of the Heye
Foundation in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Indians played a major role in the design of the limestone
building. The land surrounding the museum will include forest and
wetland, and in the marshy area the cattails so essential to many
Indian rituals will be grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fabulous,'' said Emily Malino Scheuer, a member
of the Fine Arts Commission. ``It is a long overdue recognition of
native American culture.''

   GM and Ken Burns
</P>
<P>
   That Ken Burns would continue to make well-received
documentaries seems a safe bet. Still, General Motors took an
unusual flier on Burns when it committed to 10 years of
underwriting 35 percent of his future projects, sight unseen. GM
has been the sole corporate underwriter for ``The Civil War,''
``Baseball'' and Burns' newest, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The
Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' to be seen
on PBS in November. Now Burns, and many freelancers who work with
him, have some security and the luxury to explore projects in
advance.

   Everybody in central Mexico feared the worst when the ground
shook at 3:42 p.m. Tuesday, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, But
unlike the earthquake in 1985 that killed as many as 10,000 people,
this one will be remember for the damage it did not cause. By
week's end, the death toll was 19. The toll on buildings was
higher: in the state of Puebla, dozens of priceless gems of
colonial architecture, including churches, were crippled.

   Gambling casinos have a product to market, and radio and

But a 65-year-old federal law made it illegal to broadcast

   Two weeks after former Defense Secretary William Perry traveled

COLOMBIA'S SECRETIVE COURTS SURVIVE PROTESTS OVER RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ For a decade, terrorism and drug trafficking
cases in Colombia have been sent to special tribunals that allow
judges, prosecutors and witnesses to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite complaints by the United Nations and human rights
groups that such practices violate international law and should be
abolished, the Colombian government is moving to extend the life
and scope of these so-called ``faceless courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial system had been scheduled to expire on June
30. But new legislation, approved by the Colombian Congress last
week and about to be signed by President Andres Pastrana, renews
the faceless courts for another eight years and modifies, but does
not eliminate, many of the procedures that have been most
criticized as denials of fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning July 1, the identities of judges in terrorism and drug
cases will no longer be kept secret from lawyers and defendants.
But some prosecutors and witnesses will still be granted anonymity
and the law will continue to permit the government to detain
suspects for up to a year while the cases against them are
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old law, the new one infringes on citizens' rights to
due process, an effective defense, a fair and speedy public trial
and the presumption of innocence, according to an analysis
published by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other place in the world has something quite like this
system,'' said Anders Kompass, director of the U.N. office here.
``It does not correspond to international norms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombian government maintains that the faceless courts
are the only way to deal with the twin plagues of terrorism and
drug trafficking that have afflicted this country of 40 million
people for decades. Otherwise, officials say, judges, prosecutors
and witnesses are likely to be killed by the criminal gangs and
guerrilla and paramilitary groups whose offenses are currently
prosecuted in the parallel, anonymous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a state not of absolute normality but of atrocious
violence and massacres, and so normal procedures are
insufficient,'' the minister of the interior, Nestor-Humberto
Martinez, said in an interview this week. ``That means we have to
find an equilibrium between the rights of the accused and those of
the entire society, which is the real victim of that violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also argued that the secrecy of the faceless courts is
similar to some of the procedures being used in international
tribunals to prosecute war crimes in Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia. ``We are maintaining and respecting international
standards and principles, and fundamental rights are being
protected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials have reacted angrily to Kompass' statement that
Colombia had promised in writing to abolish the courts, contending
that he has interfered in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   `` Kompass' assessment constitutes a prejudgment that in the
opinion of the government is unacceptable,'' said minister of
foreign affairs Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, who also criticized
United Nations declarations on the subject as ``inappropriate and
imprudent.''
</P>
<P>
   But even within the Colombian government the issue has generated
sharp divisions. After it became clear last month that Pastrana did
not intend to abolish the faceless courts, Minister of Justice
Parmenio Cuellar resigned in protest and his portfolio was absorbed
into the ministry of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia cannot indefinitely withstand the coexistence of
exceptional justice parallel to the ordinary system,'' Cuellar
wrote in his letter of resignation, copies of which were made
public. It is the obligation of the state, he added, to guarantee a
legal system that ``does not resort to the discarding of procedural
guarantees or the disregard of universal principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure has also been widely condemned by human rights
groups here and abroad. The only significant foreign approval has
come from the Clinton administration, whose policy here, other
diplomats maintain, is driven primarily by its desire to cut the
flow of drugs to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems very important to us that there be a system to
continue with the protection of witnesses and prosecutors,'' Curtis
W. Kamman, the U.S. ambassador here, told the Colombian news agency
Ancol last month. ``We support the government's initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a detailed analysis of the faceless courts, the Colombian
Commission of Jurists, a human rights group, concluded that they
are both illegal and riddled with abuses and inefficiencies.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Talk about profiles in courage.
</P>
<P>
   After Columbine, the politicians in Congress assembled, worked
up their nerve and pounded together some legislation to help stop
horrific high school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution: Take two tablets; slap them above every
blackboard in American classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   They could have gone with the obvious approach _ do something to
make it harder for teen-agers and crazy people to get guns. But
noooooo. This is Washington, home of the opportunistic and the
polled.
</P>
<P>
   So they went the craven (i.e., the usual) route, passing a
measure to allow the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   These tablets are a noble guide for living. But since Moses
carried them down from Mount Sinai way back in B.C., they have
never been known to prevent violence. The first sight of the
commandments at that pagan party with the golden calf actually
incited a riot.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after the next school shooting? Will Congress
mandate that the rest of the Bible be stenciled across high school
walls?
</P>
<P>
   The politicians are giving virtue a bad name again.
</P>
<P>
   Morality cannot be reduced to gestures. Simply exhibiting the
Ten Commandments has nothing to do with teaching the meaning or the
truth or the value of them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Littleton, a rare consensus has developed that the
American love affair with guns has to cool down. Just as in the
impeachment debacle, the public understands that a few compromises
can bring about a sensible solution. Just as in impeachment, the
House is ignoring the public and going off on nutty tangents.
</P>
<P>
   Tom (The Exterminator) DeLay orchestrated watering down the gun
control provisions. His chief accomplice was Democratic boss John
Dingell, who sold out his party in the dark of night. Here's a
commandment for Democrats: Thou shalt not be hugged on the House
floor by Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The Torquemada from Texas let the whole bill collapse, forcing
Republicans to take the heat for thwarting gun control in the wake
of Columbine _ an outcome no one outside NRA headquarters wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of cheap virtue. Politicians are rushing to
take God's name in vain (thereby violating commandment No. 3).
</P>
<P>
   After linking Columbine to the culture of abortion and the
teaching of evolution, DeLay went to a rally of ministers waving
Bibles Wednesday and blamed separation of church and state for the
tragedy. ``All of this knee-jerk lawmaking is a waste of time,'' he
said. Odd remark for the House whip.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has so debased the discourse that he included this
charming anecdote as proof of the culture crisis: ``I got an e-mail
this morning that said it all. The student writes, Dear God: Why
didn't you stop the shootings at Columbine? And God writes, Dear
student: I would have, but I wasn't allowed in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The season of sanctimony isn't confined to the legislative
branch. According to Time, George W. Bush decided to run for
President at a private prayer service with his family last January:
``Pastor Mark Craig started preaching about duty, about how Moses
tried to resist God's call, and the sacrifice that leadership
requires. And as they sat there, Barbara Bush leaned over to the
son who has always been most like her and said, `He's talking to
you, George.'''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think W. would be aware of the perils of religiosity after
he had to spend all that time clarifying his 1993 comment that
people who do not accept Jesus Christ as a personal Saviour cannot
go to Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement speech in Carthage, Al Gore joined the God
Squad, intoning that ``most Americans are hungry for a deeper
connection between politics and moral values; many would say
`spiritual values.' Without values of conscience, our political
life degenerates.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith is an intensely personal matter. It should not be treated
as a credential or reduced to a sound bite. History teaches that
when religion is injected into politics _ the Crusades, Henry VIII,
Salem, Father Coughlin, Hitler, Kosovo _ disaster follows.
</P>
<P>
   Before they hang the Ten Commandments in the schools, they
should make sure they are hanging where they are broken daily:
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   They also might consider adding an 11th: Thou shalt not pander.

<P>
   Since the shootings in Littleton, Colo., the tone of complaints
about what children read has shifted dramatically from outrage
about sexual descriptions to concern about mayhem on the printed
page.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's free-for-all in Congress included proposed
legislation making it a felony to expose children to books, movies
and video games that contain explicit sex or violence. The measure
failed, with a vigorous lobbying effort by the entertainment and
book industries, but the debates lingers among the bookstacks of
public and school libraries.
</P>
<P>
   To date virtually no one has challenged ``Medea'' with its bleak
plot of adultery, poisoning and child murders, but the American
Library Association is tracking complaints from adult readers who
are scolding librarians for the violence in books like John
Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' or Alvin Schwartz's ``More Scary
Stories to Tell in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more complaints coming in because of violence,''
said Judith Krug, the director of the office for intellectual
freedom for the Chicago-based American Library Association, ``and
the people complaining say it's because of Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the ALA said libraries reported receiving 478
complaints, most of them predominantly about sexual material in
literature. The ALA estimates that those represent only one-fourth
of actual complaints since libraries call them to report challenges
on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutions, like the Cumberland County Public Library in
Fayetteville, N.C., responded to a complaint this spring by raising
the age at which teen-agers may borrow general circulation books to
16 from 13 and by issuing special library cards that allow access
only to juvenile books. The library took the action following a
complaint about sexual descriptions in three adult-level books, but
its review of the titles themselves continues, said the library's
director, Jerry Thresher.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the controversy has increased demand for the
disputed library books, ``Knowing'' by Roslyn MacMillan and
``History Laid Bare'' and ``An Underground Education,'' both by
Richard Zacks.
</P>
<P>
   Literary complaints usually come in distinct cycles, said Ms.
Krug, of the ALA. ``I've been here before,'' she said. ``It's just
that the subject changes and today it's violence and yesterday it
was sex and tomorrow it's going to be hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young readers may scorn ``Of Mice and Men,'' but for very
different reasons than an anxious adult fretting over the
coldblooded murder of a ranch hand by his friend to prevent his
death at the hands of a lynch mob. In focus groups in California
and Connecticut that were convened by Scholastic to explore teen
reading and buying patterns, teen-agers made a list of their
``unfavorites.'' Among them were Ernest Hemingway's ``Old Man and
the Sea'' (``very slow''), ``Animal Farm'' and ``Of Mice and Men.''
They explained that they wanted their reading set in a present-day
world.
</P>
<P>
   For boys, that means a reading diet of science fiction, horror,
spy stories and suspense. Girls also expressed an interest in
horror and ghost stories, and a taste for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Leonhardt, a high-school English teacher in Massachusetts
for more than 28 years, who wrote ``Keeping Kids Reading: How to
Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age'' (Crown Publishing Group,
1998), started thinking about a possible relationship between
violent books and violent youths when a student said how much more
she enjoyed reading Alice Walker's ``The Color Purple'' than seeing
the movie, which chronicles the struggles of a battered, sexually
abused heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I know,'' Mrs. Leonhardt said, ``Avid readers are
almost never violent kids. Kids can read war books and horror books
and science-fiction thrillers and still be gentle, peace-loving
students.'' She insists that there is a crucial difference between
reading about violence and watching movie mayhem; a book gives a
reader more complex information to understand the feelings and
insights of characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are inside the minds of the characters,'' Ms. Leonhardt
said. ``We understand their confusion. We feel their suffering.
While movies can desensitize us to violence, I think reading can
make us more sensitive to it. We understand, in a much deeper
sense, the impact of violence on a victim's life.'' She is less
concerned about violent images in books than whether a student
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Her own students have coined a term for their favorite subset of
literature, calling it the ``psycho-killer'' genre of tales of
deranged serial murderers. Thomas Harris' ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' and his earlier book ``Red Dragon'' remain perennial
favorites with students intrigued by the sinister Hannibal Lecter,
a gifted psychopath and serial killer who has a penchant for eating
parts of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gray, a 16-year-old sophomore in Ms. Leonhardt's
class at Concord-Carlisle High School in Massachusetts, said that
his last summer's reading material consisted of two sports
magazines. But this year, his literary appetite was whetted by the
chance to earn class course credits for reading up to 200 pages a
week of virtually anything he pleased. So a few weeks ago, he read
``Silence of the Lambs,'' which left him primed to read the third
book in the series, ``Hannibal,'' which Delacorte Press published
this month.
</P>
<P>
   For Gray, the violent images ``made the book a little more
interesting,'' he said. ``It sort of got me involved in it. I could
kind of picture it in my head. With me, it doesn't really affect my
life. It's just sort of a way of entertaining myself. Personally, I
think it's kind of funny that anybody thinks that the violence in
books is going to play a role in someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Hannibal, Gray said he plans to read more than just
sports magazines this summer.

the Sea'' (``very slow''), ``Animal Farm'' and ``Of Mice and Men.''
They explained that they wanted their reading set in a present-day
world.
</P>
<P>
   For boys, that means a reading diet of science fiction, horror,
spy stories and suspense. Girls also expressed an interest in
horror and ghost stories, and a taste for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Leonhardt, a high-school English teacher in Massachusetts
for more than 28 years, who wrote ``Keeping Kids Reading: How to
Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age'' (Crown Publishing Group,
1998), started thinking about a possible relationship between
violent books and violent youths when a student said how much more
she enjoyed reading Alice Walker's ``The Color Purple'' than seeing
the movie, which chronicles the struggles of a battered, sexually
abused heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I know,'' Mrs. Leonhardt said, ``Avid readers are
almost never violent kids. Kids can read war books and horror books
and science-fiction thrillers and still be gentle, peace-loving
students.'' She insists that there is a crucial difference between
reading about violence and watching movie mayhem; a book gives a
reader more complex information to understand the feelings and
insights of characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are inside the minds of the characters,'' Ms. Leonhardt
said. ``We understand their confusion. We feel their suffering.
While movies can desensitize us to violence, I think reading can
make us more sensitive to it. We understand, in a much deeper
sense, the impact of violence on a victim's life.'' She is less
concerned about violent images in books than whether a student
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Her own students have coined a term for their favorite subset of
literature, calling it the ``psycho-killer'' genre of tales of
deranged serial murderers. Thomas Harris' ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' and his earlier book ``Red Dragon'' remain perennial
favorites with students intrigued by the sinister Hannibal Lecter,
a gifted psychopath and serial killer who has a penchant for eating
parts of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gray, a 16-year-old sophomore in Ms. Leonhardt's
class at Concord-Carlisle High School in Massachusetts, said that
his last summer's reading material consisted of two sports
magazines. But this year, his literary appetite was whetted by the
chance to earn class course credits for reading up to 200 pages a
week of virtually anything he pleased. So a few weeks ago, he read
``Silence of the Lambs,'' which left him primed to read the third
book in the series, ``Hannibal,'' which Delacorte Press published
this month.
</P>
<P>
   For Gray, the violent images ``made the book a little more
interesting,'' he said. ``It sort of got me involved in it. I could
kind of picture it in my head. With me, it doesn't really affect my
life. It's just sort of a way of entertaining myself. Personally, I
think it's kind of funny that anybody thinks that the violence in
books is going to play a role in someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Hannibal, Gray said he plans to read more than just
sports magazines this summer.

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S GRUDGE MATCH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, a look at the proper way to make a major structural
change in government:
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, the lead
headline in The New York Times of Feb. 27, 1951, said: ``2-Term
Amendment in Force as the 36th State Ratifies; Truman Exempt From
Limit.''
</P>
<P>
   I offer that venerable nugget to the mayor of New York, Rudolph
Giuliani, who frequently exhibits a disturbing compulsion to govern
by personal vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Truman exempt from limit.
</P>
<P>
   When the 22nd Amendment imposed its two-term cap on the
presidency, it did not target the sitting president, Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nicety that's lost on the mayor. Nearly half a century
later, Giuliani is engaged in an unconscionable effort to change
the City Charter _ in effect, the constitution of the City of New
York _ to punish an official he doesn't like, Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is likely to run next year for the U.S. Senate. If he
wins, Green, currently the public advocate, would automatically
succeed him as mayor and serve out the remainder of the term.
That's the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani cannot stand Green and is disgusted by the idea
that he might succeed him. So he has created a Charter Revision
Commission that will seek to deny Green the right to automatically
take over as mayor. This would be accomplished by that most
un-American of activities _ changing the rules in the middle of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to replace the existing succession process with a
hastily devised plan for a special election. It's as if Bill
Clinton suddenly decided that Al Gore would not automatically
become president if Clinton were to leave office early.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's typically mean-spirited effort was immediately
denounced by an unusually broad range of politicians, civic groups
and newspaper editorial boards. Conn Nugent, executive director of
the Citizens Union, a respected civic group that endorsed Giuliani
for mayor, derided the move as a ``charade.'' Former Mayors David
Dinkins, Ed Koch and Abraham Beame all characterized it as an abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Newsday, in an editorial headlined ``Shame on Rudy for War on
Green,'' said the attempt to change the law because Giuliani does
not like Green was ``a rotten misuse of power.'' The paper said the
``scheme may be legal _ but it's also selfish and malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani is bothered by the criticism, he's not showing it.
It would seem that no amount of criticism can temper the joy he
takes in using the power of his office to pummel people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the mayor of New York City,'' he said last week. ``I hold
a political office and the City Charter gives the mayor certain
powers, which I exercise. What I am doing is perfectly
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone agrees with him. Said Nugent: ``This is wildly
inadvisable.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Giuliani threatened to shut down a successful
state-run psychiatric center in Brooklyn and replace it with a
homeless shelter as a way of punishing the local councilman,
Stephen DiBrienza. At the time I asked Koch, the former mayor,
about Giuliani's tendency to go overboard against his critics.
Koch, who has himself feuded with Giuliani, said the mayor's modus
operandi is to ``dehumanize and demonize'' his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a critic,'' said Koch, ``you are not just a critic;
you're a threat to the world. You've gotta be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Giuliani's eyes, Mark Green is the latest threat to the
world. Green has dared to criticize the mayor on a number of
matters, including his response to police misconduct. Massive
retaliation is required. If the structure of city government must
be hastily changed in order to punish him, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   More and more New Yorkers are seeing Giuliani for what he really
is, a power-hungry, petty and vindictive man whose policies are
often fundamentally anti-democratic. For years his excesses have
been obscured or excused because of the falling crime rates in the
city. That has encouraged greater excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The city's tolerance of those excesses seems to be diminishing.
Fair and reasonable people can keep their eyes closed only so long.
</P>

<P>
   SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ High in the forbidding Himalayan foothills
north of here, the half-century-old struggle for control of Kashmir
is entering a new and unpredictable phase. Islamic fighters have
crossed the line that divides the state between zones of Indian and
Pakistani control, and the Indian army is waging a bloody campaign
to drive them back. It is the latest battle in a conflict that has
taken tens of thousands of lives over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Kosovo campaign, awareness is growing in
Washington and other capitals that the world pays a high price for
waiting too long to address growing crises. The one in Kashmir is
among the most combustible, and the fact that both contending
nations are armed with nuclear weapons lends it an apocalyptic
urgency. It is now drawing more serious attention than at any time
since it started.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton telephoned the prime ministers of India
and Pakistan last week to urge them to resolve this crisis, he was
stepping gingerly, and on territory where few outsiders have dared
to tread at all. His message was vague and tentative, but in
suggesting that Pakistan use its influence to pull the insurgents
out of Indian territory, he was at least signaling the world's
growing fear that this obscure conflict could spiral out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a small war, but it can escalate,'' one of
Kashmir's wise men, Sufi Ghulan Mohammed, editor of the
Urdu-language Srinagar Times, said last week. ``Escalation means
devastation. It does not have to be planned. Anything can happen at
any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir conflict, overlaid with religious passion as well as
chauvinistic competition, is perhaps even more complex than those
that have shaken the Balkans. Kashmir is about 75 percent Muslim,
but when India and Pakistan were created in 1947, the maharajah, a
Hindu, chose to lead it into Hindu-dominated India rather than
Islamic Pakistan. He felt that the mixed society he ruled would
fare better in an officially secular state than one devoted to a
single religion.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has never accepted Kashmir's accession to India, and
has waged two wars to seize it. The last one, in 1971, ended with a
cease-fire that left two-thirds of the state in India and the rest
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the conflict is so difficult to solve is that in
different ways, Kashmir is central to the national ideals of both
India and Pakistan. Indian leaders fear that losing Kashmir would
set off a wave of separatist movements in other Indian states, and
implicitly accept the failure of the premise on which India is
built: that it can embrace peoples of many different religions.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, in contrast, was built on the idea that all Muslims on
the subcontinent should live in their own state. Allowing all or
part of Kashmir to remain under Indian rule contradicts that.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful Pakistanis believe that Kashmir represents the
unfinished agenda of the 1947 partition. Others see war here as a
way to punish India for its support of Pakistani rebels who
succeeded in separating Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fire behind the current conflict is the desire of
Islamic militants to wrest control of what they consider a Muslim
land from the control of infidels. Many of them fought in
Afghanistan; some are loyal to the anti-Western Muslim
fundamentalist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pakistan has sought to internationalize the
issue by bringing it before the United Nations and other bodies.
India opposes all such efforts, and insists that the question be
resolved only by the two nations. But President Clinton's telephone
calls last week, along with expected discussions of the problem at
this weekend's meeting of leaders of the biggest industrialized
countries in Germany, suggest that India may now have to accept the
world's growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the holocaust in Rwanda and successive
catastrophes in the former Yugoslavia, many voices are being raised
in favor of intervening before future crises around the globe reach
the point of explosion. There is still no consensus on how, when or
where to act, and much fear about the consequences of aggressive
intervention. But few international summits are likely to pass now
without discussion of the possibility of assertive action in places
like Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is a good place to start because it reflects not only
how dangerous obscure wars can become, but also how difficult it is
to resolve them. Many people in the Indian-held section are highly
suspicious of Pakistan, which is in even worse social, economic and
political shape than India and where religious fundamentalism is on
the rise. But they have no love for the Indian security forces,
which human rights groups say regularly ransack and burn villages,
torture prisoners and assassinate suspected militants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some Indian leaders have suggested that the
solution lies in giving the province what Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao in 1995 called ``anything short of independence'' and what
Prime Minister Deve Gowda a year later called ``maximum autonomy.''
That, however, is anathema to much of the Indian establishment,
which fears a precedent for splintering India itself.
</P>
<P>
   Every proposed solution, in fact, is fraught with danger. To
reach a lasting peace, all three sides would have to make historic
compromises involving their basic principles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the West, China, which borders Kashmir and faces
a rising Islamic movement in its own western provinces, is
increasingly worried and increasingly ready to apply pressure for a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But if outside powers are to break this deadlock, they need
strong partners in both India and Pakistan, leaders who can break
with the past and persuade their peoples to do so too. No such
leaders are on the horizon.

   It's been a year and a half since the word ``intern'' became a
punchline, time enough, perhaps, to purge the national
consciousness of tiresome jokes about fringe benefits and dry
cleaning. And time enough for interns to resume their rightful
place at the bottom of the office food chain, no matter how they
got their jobs or how much money their parents gave the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, interns have labored in obscurity, working
long hours for little or no pay, and without the prospect of a book
tour at the end. And so it will be this summer, as this year's
class of young achievers arrives in Washington. If all goes well,
it may once again be safe for them to note the internships on their
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Congress and the White House have produced handbooks for
interns with advice about handling the difficulties that can arise
in Washington. Each was written well before the need for such
guidebooks became glaringly apparent. In that regard, the manuals
seem prescient, even wise, double entendres notwithstanding.

   It's been a year and a half since the word ``intern'' became a
punchline, time enough, perhaps, to purge the national
consciousness of tiresome jokes about fringe benefits and dry
cleaning. And time enough for interns to resume their rightful
place at the bottom of the office food chain, no matter how they
got their jobs or how much money their parents gave the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, interns have labored in obscurity, working
long hours for little or no pay, and without the prospect of a book
tour at the end. And so it will be this summer, as this year's
class of young achievers arrives in Washington. If all goes well,
it may once again be safe for them to note the internships on their
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Congress and the White House have produced handbooks for
interns with advice about handling the difficulties that can arise
in Washington. Each was written well before the need for such
guidebooks became glaringly apparent. In that regard, the manuals
seem prescient, even wise, double entendres notwithstanding.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) ``The Congressional Intern Handbook'' by
Sue Grabowski, published by the Congressional Management
Foundation, offers some thoughts for starting off on the right foot
with the boss.(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Once you start getting to know the Member, he starts asking you
to do things you'd rather not do (e.g., get shoes shined, buy
lunch), but these tasks are an avenue by which to build a stronger
relationship with the Member. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It can be an eye opener to learn that the boss has his/her
faults like anyone else and that nobody is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The Member is a public servant.(END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   An intern should realize that there is only one public
personality in the place, and that is the one embodied in the boss.
Interns and the staff are parts of the woodwork when it comes to
presenting a face to the public _ the Member/Senator is the only
person who counts. . . .

issue;

or has been active on similar issue in past (voted/signed
letters/etc.);

   Don't mope or moan. . . . Ninety percent of interns are
over-qualified to be interns, but some don't realize this basic
fact of life. . . . You may end up salvaging a part of humanity,
but don't expect it as a matter of course.

<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE) He hasn't rolled in yet. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In general, don't volunteer specific information on why a person
isn't in. In particular, never admit the staff person hasn't come
in yet in the morning. . . . A good general phrase is, ``He is not
at his desk.'' . . . Short answer on speaking with the press:
don't. . . . What you may think is a joke or polite conversation,
or just plain old trying to be helpful, can end up in the morning
paper and cause much embarrassment to the Member or Senator. The
press is always out for a story _ and rightfully so. It's their
business. However, your Member's or Senator's perception of a story
and the press' perception might be worlds apart.

   An internship is a chance to occasionally run around and have
fun observing the spectacle without chafing against the confines of
a real job. . . . It can be the best of all worlds _ a share in the
action, but not an overwhelming stake in the future. This is not
advocacy of irresponsible conduct or unreliable behavior. . . .
Somewhere between laid-back and manic there lies the balanced
internship _ sensitive to one's contribution to any project, but
aware of one's place in the broader picture.

   What should you do if you observe what appears to be unethical
actions on the part of other interns or staff? In most cases the
best course of action is to take up your concern directly with the
individual involved. This can clear up misperceptions and set an

grave nature, it should be brought to the attention of your own
outside supervisor, the appropriate staffer within the office or
the Member/Senator. . . .

<P>
   If you believe you are being abused or otherwise being requested
to do something improper or unethical, talk to an appropriate
person within the office first and then, if not satisfied, talk to
your outside intern supervisor, if you have one. Example: An intern
was asked to dress in a mini-skirt and serve drinks at a fund

   KOSOVO PACKAGE:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Pristina) _ With the last Yugoslav forces streaming
out of Kosovo ahead of schedule, NATO commanders here have reached
a tentative agreement with Albanian rebel leaders to gradually
disband the Kosovo Liberation Army as an organized military force,
NATO officials said Saturday. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-RUSSIA (Cologne, Germany) _ When the Clinton
administration invited Russia to help it out of the war in Kosovo,
the idea was that the involvement in big game diplomacy would help
maintain the ailing Washington-Moscow relationship, and even
improve it. But as Yeltsin prepares to make his first foreign trip
in four months on Sunday to attend the G7-plus-Russia summit
meeting here, and in particular to meet Clinton, as many questions
are hanging over the Russian-American dialogue as were before the
war. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SUMMIT-RDP (Cologne) _ The European Union on Saturday
announced plans to provide $1.5 billion over the next three years
for the reconstruction of Kosovo as the West tried to map out a
strategy that would channel money to the war-devastated area
without giving financial support to Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia. By
Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NOTEBOOK (Stimlje) _ The proud talk of NATO victory seems
hollow here, in this dank little cellar where Nesibe Gashi has been
hiding for months, with her memories and her nightmares and her
grief. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>

   OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS:

<P>
   ROYAL-WEDDING (London) _ England's Prince Edward gets married.
By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-UNREST (Mexico City) _ Riot police clash with municipal
workers, a harbinger of what's to come before Presidential
elections. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-COURTS (Bogota, Colombia) _ For a decade, terrorism and
drug trafficking cases in Colombia have routinely been sent to
special tribunals that allow judges, prosecutors, and witnesses to
remain anonymous. Now, despite complaints by the United Nations and
human rights groups that such practices violate international law
and should be abolished, the Colombian government is moving to
extend the life and scope of these so-called ``faceless courts.''
By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-BARAK (Washington) _ His coalition almost complete, Ehud
Barak, Israel's prime minister-elect, is expected to come to
Washington early next month to unveil his keenly awaited thoughts
on reviving peacemaking in the Middle East. It is a harbinger of
the style Barak brings to his new job that he has declined to
discuss his intentions with any American official since the
election _ not Dennis Ross, the American mediator, not even the
American ambassador in Tel Aviv. And he has asked that his first
meeting be a long and private one with Clinton. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ISLAM (Jakarta) _ A restive but largely quiescent
political force for decades, Islam has suddenly emerged, in the
vacuum of the slow vote count, as a potentially divisive issue
here. There is no question of a rise of militant Islam or an
imposition of Islamic law. But all of Indonesian politics is in
flux now, one year after the forced resignation of former President
Suharto, and Islamic factions are shifting and roiling as they seek
a new place in a new political order.
</P>
<P>
   ARABS-CHASTITY (Resaifah, Jordan) _ More than pride, more than
honesty, more than anything a man might do, female chastity is seen
in the Arab world as an indelible line, the boundary between
respect and shame. An unchaste woman, it is sometimes said, is
worse than a murderer, affecting not just one victim, but her
family and her tribe. It is an unforgiving logic, and its product,
for centuries, has been murder _ the killings of girls and women by
their relatives, to cleanse honor that has been soiled. Across the
Arab world, in Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, the
Palestinian territories and among Israeli Arabs, a new generation
of activists has now quietly begun to battle these honor killings,
an enduring wave of crimes prompted by sexual conduct that is
sometimes only imagined. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   KOREAS-ENGAGE (Seoul, South Korea) _ The gun smoke over the high
seas may be gone, but there is growing apprehension here that as
relations with the North become more varied, they will also become
more vexing. As they watched a push-and-shove naval match in the
Yellow Sea erupt into a firefight this past week, many South
Koreans were renewed in their belief that even as relations thaw
across the Korean peninsula, North Korea remains an irascible,
secretive, terrorist neighbor. By Sheryl WuDunn.

<P>
   BAPTIST-CONVENTION (Atlanta) _ In its annual conference this
week, the Southern Baptist Convention avoided, for the most part,
its headline-grabbing rancor of years past. The most controversial
resolution it passed, calling on President Clinton to rescind his
ambassadorial appointment of James Hormel, a homosexual, to
Luxembourg called for no official action on the convention's part
and was more a public finger-wagging than anything. But the
convention's president announced something a little more
surprising: he wants to see a greater number of blacks becoming
Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   SONOFSAM-MEMORIES (New York) _ David Berkowitz, the serial
killer known as the Son of Sam, wept in prison last week, grieving
over the coming release of a Spike Lee movie called ``Summer of
Sam.'' Although Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures will not release
the movie until the first week of July, ``Summer of Sam'' is
already jarring loose memories _some of them extraordinarily
painful _ inside the circle of New Yorkers whose lives were
fundamentally changed by the Son of Sam.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GANGS (Los Angeles) _ Incongruously close to some of this
city's most affluent neighborhoods and a shell's throw from
touristy Venice Beach and the azure Pacific, a gang war has played
out over a decade, in which dozens have been killed and scores
wounded. The conflict is driven in part by racial differences and
in part by the desire to control the drug trade in Venice Beach.
Now public nuisance laws are increasingly being used against the
rival gangs, since a series of court rulings have strengthened the
hand of law enforcement.

   GUN-CONTROL-POLITICS (Washington) _ Democrats are moving to
capitalize immediately on the failure of the Republican-controlled
House to pass even modest gun-control legislation, and promising to
take the issue to the forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign.
By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-LEGALDRUGS (Washington) _ Congress seldom meets a
hearing that it doesn't like, but the one that Rep. John L. Mica, a
Florida Republican, convened on Wednesday raised quite a few
hackles. Its topic: ``The Pros and Cons of Drug Legalization,
Decriminalization and Harm Reduction.'' The hearing, the first on
the subject since 1988, was motivated by suspicions on Capitol Hill
that legalization of drugs is the ultimate goal of people who
actively promote marijuana as a medicinal palliative or advocate
giving sterile syringes to heroin addicts to prevent them from
contracting AIDS. The hearing illustrated Congress's reluctance to
rethink the war against drugs, on which the federal government
spends nearly $18 billion a year. And it presaged the sort of
discourse about drugs bound to surface in next year's election
campaign. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   WIND-ENERGY (Washington) _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says
he will announce on Monday a plan to produce 5 percent of the
nation's electricity from wind by 2020, up from 0.1 percent now.
Under the plan, the federal government, the nation's largest
electricity customer, would rely on wind for 5 percent of its use
by 2010. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   SPEECHES-POLITICS (Washington) _ To judge from the speeches
announcing their candidacies for president, Vice President Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush could be declaring the primary campaign over,
the general election begun and the battleground designated as the
moderate middle, with ideological extremes out of bounds. Yet even
though they did not engage over detail, Gore and Bush were fighting
over much of the same ground. Both opposed drugs in schools. Both
promised to involve religious organizations in social welfare
programs. Both supported foreign trade. By Adam Clymer.

   Cyberspace, which not so long ago was heralded as the arrival of
Marshall McLuhan's long-awaited Global Village, has instead become
Milton's Paradise Lost.
</P>
<P>
   In early June an Internet worm, known as Explore.exe for the
file that launches it, emerged to cut a wide swath around the
globe, leaving in its wake gigabytes of erased files and hordes of
frantic computer system administrators. For many computer users,
the program marked the end of trust in the virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   Most people already knew that it was dangerous to trust
strangers in cyberspace, just as it is in the physical world. The
infectious Explore worm, however, masquerading as e-mail from a
friend, raised the specter that it might no longer be possible to
trust friends either.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace, once thought of as the world's most cozy community,
has quickly become a lonely, infinite expanse of electronic
hallways filled with endless queues of online shopping malls and
shadowy alleys where computer outlaws and their rogue programs
lurk.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of the disk drive engineer in Silicon Valley
who made the mistake of clicking on the innocuous document titled
``zipped-files.exe'' that was sent as an e-mail attachment from a
close friend. That simple action launched the omnivorous worm,
which spread itself throughout his company, erasing his files from
his hard disk drive and more than 30 gigabytes of corporate
administrative data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't open an executable file even if it came from my
mother,'' one of his company's vice president told him later.
Another colleague suggested that he ``go away for a while.'' The
engineer describes the incident as the most embarrassing incident
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The worm was also a bitter lesson for Jim Walsh, the chairman of
the department of organizational behavior and resource management
at the University of Michigan Business School. Sitting with his
laptop at Starbucks a week ago Friday, he was reading a message
from a friend at a Seattle software company when he clicked on the
infected file.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like pushing the red button,'' Walsh said. ``I clicked
my mouse and boom!'' When he returned to his office, a phone
message from his friend was waiting to warn him not to open the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost 950 files, including a new course that he had
developed in January, Walsh is trying to stay in good spirits about
his misfortune ``It's kind of like spring cleaning,'' he said,
acknowledging that he has become the laughing stock of his school.
``I've had people stop me in the halls to offer their
condolences.''
</P>
<P>
   If the victims feel chastened, the program has served to
construct even thicker walls and stronger locks in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are more guarded and measured about how they use
technology are going to be safer,'' said Andrew L. Shapiro, author
of ``The Control Revolution'' (Public Affairs, 1999), a book about
the Internet's impact on society. ``The idea that the Internet
lifts us above geography contributes to the kind of naivete that
places people in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who remember when the Net was a remarkably
convivial place. From its roots in the late 1960's as the ARPAnet,
the Pentagon-funded experiment that connected computers at computer
research laboratories and universities, the Net was once an
intimate virtual coffeehouse where software and opinions were
freely shared. Locks and passwords were unknown in a hacker's
community based almost entirely on trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days you could attach faces and personalities to
people on line,'' recalled Bill Duvall, who helped create the
original ARPAnet while working at SRI International, a research
center in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Now we've created a virtual society
and nothing is what it appears to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists believe that it will be possible to design
``synthetic'' trust and embed it in network software, using
encryption and other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' said Kevin Kelly, one of the co-founders of
The Well, an early online community that emerged in the mid-1980s.
``This is a fantastic time. Step by step, we're going to invent a
science of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly argues that this is the power underlying the world of
computers and networks. ``You can take things that the philosophers
have talked about for centuries,'' he said, ``and wire them up in
virtual reality and see how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   From this point of view the rogue worm is simply a useful flaw
that can serve as a guideline for engineers who are building a more
workable system.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the reality of cyberspace is emerging as a
darker vision mirroring the world described by William Gibson in
his novel ``Neuromancer'' (Ace Books, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big, bad world out there in cyberspace,'' said
Shapiro. ``It's certainly not Kansas.''

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The generals who once made and deposed
presidents are now so marginal a factor in Brazil's daily life that
a milestone went almost unremarked this month. When President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a bill merging the army, air force
and navy ministries into a single Ministry of Defense headed by a
retired senator, Brazil became the last member of Mercosur, the
South American customs union composed of former military
dictatorships, to place its armed forces under full formal civilian
control.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rest of the world still envisions the likes of
Pinochet, Peron, Trujillo, Somoza and Torrijos when it thinks of
Latin America, these are trying times for soldiers throughout the
region. Government spending is declining even faster than the
prestige of a military career. In virtually every country the armed
forces confront what Armando Borrero, a Colombian scholar of the
military, calls ``an existential problem: What is their role now
that they are no longer the dominant force in their societies?''
</P>
<P>
   For the whole region, getting soldiers to go back to their
barracks has brought indisputable political and economic benefits.
When generals were in charge in Argentina and Brazil two decades
ago, for instance, troops were deployed on their border, and both
were pursuing costly nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   But after democratic civilian rule was restored in the
mid-1980s, the countries buried their historic grievances and
married their fortunes in Mercosur. Trade and other forms of
contact have exploded. In June, Cardoso and Argentine President
Carlos Menem even decided to seek a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Argentina and Chile have settled all but one of 23
border disputes, and civilian presidents in Peru and Ecuador just
recently laid to rest a boundary conflict that caused several wars
in the past 50 years. Perhaps that explains why the Clinton
administration, which lifted longstanding restrictions on U.S. arms
sales to Latin America in 1997, has found so few takers for the
wares it wants to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military leadership does not want to go back to the old
system,'' said Richard Millett, the author of ``Beyond
Praetorianism: The Latin American Military at the End of the 20th
Century.'' ``They see less to gain from confrontation than in
cooperation against the real enemy, like transnational crime
groups. They know that the strength of your neighbor is not a
menace; it's his weakness that is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, in fact, the armed forces of Ecuador and Paraguay
resisted the temptation to intervene in a crisis. They know that a
coup would lead to ostracism, loss of trade benefits and
elimination from prestigious and profitable United Nations
peacekeeping missions. Cardoso even warned Paraguay's soldiers that
Mercosur is a club for democracies only and that a coup would lead
to expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   While the Latin American military may be out, it is not
necessarily down. ``You do not yet really have true civilian
control of the military,'' Dr. Millett said. ``What you have is
enhanced civilian influence and reduced military autonomy. The
civilian defense ministers in a lot of these countries don't order
the generals around, they consult and negotiate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   One big question for any civilian government is what to do to
keep the idled troops out of mischief. Washington's answer,
regarded as a recipe for disaster by every government in the
region, has been to press the armies to enlist in the war against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans tend to think that Latin America spends so much on
the military that it might as well get something useful out of
them,'' said Alfred Stepan, author of several books on the Latin
American military. ``But that is a dangerous way of looking at
things. If the military get involved in the anti-drug wars, not
only are they not prepared for it, but doing so has a corrupting
impact and may contribute to an expansion of their role.''
</P>
<P>
   The Central American military offers a different but no less
disturbing model. With no more guerrillas left to battle _ or
slaughter _ they have been transformed into economic conglomerates
that threaten to choke off competition from private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In a study titled ``Soldiers as Businessmen,'' Arnoldo Brenes
and Kevin Casas have documented how Central America's armed forces
have taken over banks, hotels, funeral homes, radio stations,
advertising agencies, supermarkets and stores through their pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   In general and at a theoretical level, many people are concerned
by the fact that the military, which already has the power of arms,
may also try to obtain uncontrolled economic power,'' they write in
the book, published last year in Costa Rica by the Arias Foundation
for Peace and Human Progress. When the profit motive replaces
national defense as the army's mission, the pair warn, ``the very
reason for the existence of the armed forces is distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Their patron Oscar Arias, a former president of Costa Rica who
won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize, argues that the best way to avoid
such problems is to follow his country's example and abolish the
armed forces altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need in our countries is a good police force with a
civilian mentality and some cheap, light arms, not an army that
needs to maintain its power with sophisticated weapons,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The only other countries to follow that recipe have had second
thoughts. Panama is unable to fend off Colombian guerrillas who
regularly cross into its territory, and Haiti finds its sovereignty
ignored by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Venezuela, where the rise of Hugo Chavez, a
cashiered colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992 and
was elected president last December, has meant a more prominent
role for the military. But that country, Arias noted, was spared
the last cycle of military rule and abuses, which makes it a
special case.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the suffering that people in the rest of Latin America
have endured, nobody wants the return of the military,'' he said.
``People are not going to forget what the military did to repress
and oppress. They know that the litmus test of democracy is the
subordination of military power to civilian authority and that is
what civil society demands.''

   SEATTLE _ In an unusual case that unfolded in Worcester, Mass.,
last week, a reputed mobster by the name of Vincent ``Gigi
Portalla'' Marino went to court to find out whether the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration had secretly implanted a microchip
tracking device in his body two and a half years ago during surgery
to remove a bullet from his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors first argued that the government was not required to
confirm whether it had done such a thing, but later, after a judge
ordered them to respond, they said the drug agency had not
implanted a microchip in Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot speak, however, for any extraterrestrial beings,''
said U.S. Attorney Donald Stern.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as the case sounded, Marino was really not so far off
base in thinking that there is a gadget that could allow his
location to be pinpointed at all times, with the help of global
satellites. The intriguing question is whether a large market will
ever emerge for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls all the time: `Is this available for children?'''
said Paul McMahon, a spokesman for LoJack Corp., based in Dedham,
Mass., which markets a positioning device that has helped track
down 30,000 stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   People also frequently ask about using LoJacks for an elderly
relative who might be suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other
disorienting ailments, said McMahon: ``Our answer is no, our
technology is not appropriate for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But why not, exactly? We're willing to put positioning devices
on cars and cell phones, and we already put microchips inside our
pets. In fact, more than 1.5 million American cats and dogs have
been surgically implanted with tiny chips the size of a grain of
rice, encoded with information about how to reunite them with their
owners. So why not put chips inside the people we love the most?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center
for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ``Why? Because
there's a level of concern, some based in fact, some based in fear,
about the loss of children, about kids being stolen in custody
disputes, about terrorism, about kidnapping, that leads people to
be frantic about wanting to know where other people they care about
are.''
</P>
<P>
   People are also likely to encode themselves with chips
containing medical information, Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are both scary and humorous, and they are
endless _ especially if the devices could be implanted, as the
lower-tech pet chips are, painlessly and in seconds. (That may
still be an issue; The LoJack device is actually the size of a
chalkboard eraser.)
</P>
<P>
   As the technology advances, they could even be inserted
surreptitiously. Wary spouses could either confirm or allay
suspicions about their mates. Bosses could monitor their employees'
whereabouts or, to turn the tables, workers could monitor whether
the boss is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could all be done for more romantic reasons.
Consider Professor Kevin Warwick, a cybernetics expert at Britain's
Reading University, and his wife, Irena, who announced last year
that they both planned to be fitted with computer chip implants in
an experiment to see whether they could keep track of one another
and even transmit emotions over great distances.
</P>
<P>
   The chip technology could work in much the same way a mobile
phone takes spoken words and turns them into electronic signals,
Warwick said in a telephone interview last week. ``I think you
could really do the same thing with emotions some day _ you could
transmit them digitally.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor described the technology as extremely useful,
because he travels a lot and works long hours and ``sometimes we
just don't get enough quality time.'' Or, as Mrs. Warwick put it to
The Sunday Times of London last year, ``It would be so romantic to
know when he was thinking of me when we are apart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly those who argue vigorously against any of
this technology, even in pets.
</P>
<P>
   The Whole Dog Journal, a newsletter for holistic dog care
published in Greenwich, Conn., says many dog owners refuse to
implant the identification chips because of the ``Big Brother''
aspects of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   And early last year, even as the Los Angeles Department of
Animal Services said it would like to see every pet dog and cat in
the city microchipped to cut down on forced euthanizing of stray
animals, officials acknowledged that many pet lovers would not buy
the chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something spooky about it,'' a Los Angeles official
said at the time, ``and everyone realizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   In human beings, it would, of course, seem all the spookier,
though it's hard to say whether the practice might become more
acceptable in another generation or two: After all, in the computer
age, whether we like it or not, the amount of information that is
out there about each of us would have seemed unimaginable a few
decades ago. And some day-care sites already have ``Web cams''
through which parents can check in on their infants during the day
by logging onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's all a trade-off,'' said Peter Szolovits, a
professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and an expert on the privacy of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, you were ever getting kidnapped, you might be
delighted to have one of these things in you,'' Szolovits said. On
the other hand, he said: ``I'm not sure that I want to have my
children growing up in a society where they have the sense that
their every movement can be tracked at any time. This strikes me as
psychologically not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents like Warwick said people need to overcome such
old-fashioned objections. Even what seems like the best reason for
using the chips raises a frightening possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very dangerous, because once kidnappers get to know
about these things, they will skin you alive to find them,'' Terry
Waite, the Church of England envoy who spent five years as a
hostage in Beirut, told the Sunday Times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reservations about putting chips in children or
spouses, the feeling about criminals, convicted or even accused,
may be different. Many people agree to wear electronic monitoring
devices as an alternative to imprisonment: These devices enable the
authorities to make sure the subject does not leave home.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the next-generation tracking devices, the kind
that Marino said a drug agent told him had been implanted by the
government. (Prosecutors said the agent was only joking; Marino's
lawyer, Robert Sheketoff, said his client, now in prison, ``doesn't
trust the government'' and wants an MRI scan to check for a
microchip.)
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the FBI would not say whether it ever uses such
tracking devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to fall into the no-comment category,'' said a
bureau spokesman, Paul Bresson. ``It's discussing investigative
techniques, and that's about akin to a journalist disclosing
confidential sources. It's very sensitive.''

   SEATTLE _ In an unusual case that unfolded in Worcester, Mass.,
last week, a reputed mobster by the name of Vincent ``Gigi
Portalla'' Marino went to court to find out whether the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration had secretly implanted a microchip
tracking device in his body two and a half years ago during surgery
to remove a bullet from his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors first argued that the government was not required to
confirm whether it had done such a thing, but later, after a judge
ordered them to respond, they said the drug agency had not
implanted a microchip in Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot speak, however, for any extraterrestrial beings,''
said U.S. Attorney Donald Stern.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as the case sounded, Marino was really not so far off
base in thinking that there is a gadget that could allow his
location to be pinpointed at all times, with the help of global
satellites. The intriguing question is whether a large market will
ever emerge for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls all the time: `Is this available for children?'''
said Paul McMahon, a spokesman for LoJack Corp., based in Dedham,
Mass., which markets a positioning device that has helped track

IN RUINED KOSOVO VILLAGE, NO JOY IN `VICTORY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STIMLJE, Yugoslavia _ The proud talk of NATO victory seems
hollow here, in this dank little cellar where Nesibe Gashi has been
hiding for months, with her memories and her nightmares and her
grief.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, there is the rumble of British armor, but inside there
is mostly silence, broken by sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gashi's husband is long dead and her son, Emin, is missing,
having fled to the mountains to try to stay alive. Her house has
been looted and burned, her animals killed, her village reduced to
rubble. A sweeping, five-day orgy of rage and psychosis by Serb
forces and her own neighbors, she said, began the first night of
the NATO bombing campaign, March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was fighting near here all the time,'' she said, as
Yugoslav forces struggled with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
was always strong here near the Jezerce Mountains. ``But with the
bombs, the Serbs turned on the people.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a popular view in Washington and London, but Fehmi
Baftiu, the director of the Mother Theresa charity in Stimlje,
bears it out. ``Before, the whole population of Stimlje, perhaps
13,000 and 35,000 with the villages, was here, and all the villages
were full,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night the NATO airplanes flew, that night they started to
burn in Stimlje and shoot with different weapons. They went from
house to house and didn't check if anyone was inside _ they just
shot and burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The first night, he said, many ethnic Albanians fled Stimlje for
the woods. The next day, Serbs entered their homes to loot and then
burned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five days without stopping, every night they shot weapons
and burned and beat people on the street, and people ran until
Stimlje was nearly empty,'' Baftiu said. ``Look around: The houses
that are not burned are looted or damaged. And it was worse in the
villages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, moving through areas where the insurgency was strong,
emptied the villages and brought refugees down to Stimlje, where
they were put on more than 100 buses and shipped toward Albania,
Baftiu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earth was burning, from the ground and from the sky,'' he
said, referring to NATO's bombs. ``Fear ate everything, and it
seemed there was nowhere to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the killing and destruction in Stimlje itself, much was
done by local Serbs, he said. There was no local Serb male not
mobilized and in uniform. ``I know the names and the faces,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   `War Makes You Crazy'
</P>
<P>
   As the raw stories of atrocities mount, large and small, checked
and unchecked, they begin to become wearying, like bloodlust
itself. The world knew what was happening in Kosovo, but the
details first humanize the horror, then overwhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Without context, the rage of Kosovo's minority Serbs seems
entirely arbitrary; with context, it can still seem inexplicable.
But not to one network cameraman, who served in the U.S. Army in
Vietnam. ``It's My Lai, man,'' he said. ``War makes you crazy, and
you've got a rifle and a lighter in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of journalists fresh to Kosovo, hearing the wrenching
tales of refugees and seeing their handdrawn maps, consider every
burned house as newly destroyed, when a good part of the
destruction took place last year, in the various Yugoslav
offensives against the insurgents that first caused NATO to
threaten bombing in October.
</P>
<P>
   That confrontation brought the international verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to Kosovo, and
this war has now brought some of them back.
</P>
<P>
   North in Glogovac, in the Drenica region, Vaga Nielsen, a Dane,
returned to see what had happened to the town where he had served
as one of the European monitors.
</P>
<P>
   After long experience in Bosnia, he said sadly, ``I knew we
would be watching the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and then be
accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen returned with another international organization that he
asked not be named. He was relieved to see Glogovac. ``It's bad,
but not as bad as I thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was ashamed that the earlier monitors' mission
failed and pulled out of Kosovo five days before the bombing began,
leaving a vacuum that let the Yugoslav offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army intensify without witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little responsible for what happened,'' Nielsen said
quietly. ``We and the West were accomplices. We didn't want it to
happen, but we couldn't prevent it. And all of it,'' he said _ the
half-measures and the withdrawal and then the bombing _ ``set off
something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   He's returned, he said, to do what he can to fix what has been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   A Culture of Revenge
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Serbs who are fleeing Kosovo, in a broken
mirror-image of the forced Albanian exodus, are not likely to be
back, given the tardy NATO efforts to keep them here and to
restrain the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Peace may prove infectious, but this is a culture of revenge,
where compromise is viewed as weakness, said a prominent member of
Pristina's small ethnic Turkish minority, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brains and thoughts of Balkan people do not change so
easily,'' he said. ``There will be new cycles of revenge. Balkan
people cannot stop themselves so easily. And I'm afraid that the
Albanians will make themselves no better than the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The West ``wants to bring peace here, and we need peace,'' he
said. ``But it won't be easy, and the West does not understand the
Balkan people very well.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a story of a Serb neighbor with whom his aunt had warred
for 30 years. ``But that Serb saved my aunt from the police,'' he
said. ``Why, no one can understand.'' And for 30 years, he
continued, the family had wonderful relations with another Serb
neighbor. ``But that neighbor threw my cousin out of the house when
he sought refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The man paused, stirring his Turkish coffee, as a British foot
patrol strolled by. ``They may have to stay forever,'' he said.
``There's no logic here. There is no tradition of democracy, of
compromise. The trouble comes where you don't expect it. The
Albanians ruled the Serbs with little justice from 1974 to 1981,''
he said. ``They reaped what they sowed. And now it's changed again.
But it's the ruling logic of the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO cannot keep Serbs here and allows Kosovo to become
independent, he predicted flatly: ``There will be another war.''
</P>
<P>
   A Serb official in Pristina pointed to a passage in the
post-World War I diaries of the late Milos Crnjanski, an
anti-communist novelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What difference does it make to us to kill three million
people?'' he wrote. ``The sky is the same everywhere and blue, so
blue. Death has returned, but peace will follow. We will be free
and strange.''

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS SEEK MORE BLACKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ariz., Mass. Pa., Nev., Wash.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In its annual conference this past week, the Southern
Baptist Convention avoided, for the most part, its
headline-grabbing rancor of years past.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial resolution it passed, calling on
President Clinton to rescind his ambassadorial appointment of James
Hormel, a homosexual, to Luxembourg called for no official action
on the convention's part and was more a public finger-wagging than
anything.
</P>
<P>
   But the convention's president announced something a little more
surprising: he wants to see a greater number of blacks becoming
Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, convention president, announced that
in the next three years the denomination will make a major move
outside of its rural, Southern base to spread the Gospel and
recruit more blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the convention, Patterson said that beginning in
Chicago and Phoenix next year, the convention would spend at least
$2.5 million in each city to establish a Southern Baptist presence
in areas it has usually avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our convention is too white and too Anglo-Saxon,'' Patterson
said in an interview after his address to the denomination's annual
meeting, which ended on Wednesday. A similar statement by the
Southern Baptist Convention leadership would have been unthinkable
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson said no one would be more disappointed than he if
the initiative did not result in a large increase in the number of
blacks joining Southern Baptist congregations. Of the convention's
40,870 churches, about 2,800 are predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called Strategic Focus Cities, focuses on
creating 180 churches in six cities, with a concentration on
neighborhoods undergoing transitions in their racial makeup. After
Chicago and Phoenix, the cities to be focused on in 2001 are Boston
and Las Vegas, Nev., and Philadelphia and Seattle in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year initiative is an extension of a 1995 public
apology by the Southern Baptist leadership for the convention's
past policies, said the Rev. R. Phillip Roberts, vice president of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show that while in the past Southern Baptists have
refused to minister to people because of their race, today we're
talking about sharing a Gospel that sees no color,'' Roberts said,
noting that during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 60s
the denomination strongly opposed integration.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to reach out to urban centers was never far from the
eyes of the 12,000 delegates who attended the convention. Large
banners that depicted Jesus looking over a city skyline that
proclaimed, ``He beheld the city and wept,'' hung on the walls of
the the Georgia Dome, the home of the Atlanta Hawks, where the
convention was held. Videotapes describing the six cities and their
needs were given to the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than good will and supplies for Southern
Baptists to make inroads among African-Americans, said the Rev.
Grant D. Perry, a black pastor who met strong resistance from other
black clergy last November when he founded a Southern Baptist
church in Winterhaven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deep skepticism among many blacks about a
denomination that was founded on the principle of slave ownership,
Perry told the convention. When the fear of black clergy about an
``invasion'' of their neighborhood by a large, wealthy white
denomination is added, the result is often a tense environment
without enough communication between churches, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson acknowledged that Southern Baptists had an image
problem among minorities, particularly blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were them, I wouldn't take that apology seriously unless
I saw some action behind it,'' he said. ``But in the end, my own
perception is black people are just like everybody else in the
world; they want to be loved and we're going to show them we love
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Southern Baptists to reach out to urban areas is
important not just for blacks, but for making the denomination a
more vital one, said Bill F. Sumners, director of the Southern
Baptist Historical Library and Archives. He maintained that the
success or failure of initiatives like Strategic Focus Cities could
determine whether the Southern Baptist Convention grew or began to
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the
United States, was formed in 1845 by Southern whites, based
primarily on their desire to further the practice of slave
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   This year marked the first time since 1926 that the convention
has had a decline in membership. Although the decline was put at
only 162,158 in a denomination of about 15.7 million, the drive to
add more members came up more than once in Patterson's speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson said there was no connection between the six-city
initiative and a desire to increase membership.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy D. Martin, a professor at the University of Georgia who
studies the role of religion in America, said, ``Even if you look
at it in a less noble light, it's still quite something for them to
make an effort to say, `We want to become a more diverse body.'''

<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly hinted last
week that the central bank will raise interest rates later this
month to prevent the galloping economy from setting off inflation _
even though, he conceded, inflation remains inconsequential.
``Pre-emptive action can obviate the need of more drastic actions
at a later date,'' he told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same Alan Greenspan who has steered unemployment
rates to their lowest levels in 30 years precisely because he was
willing to let the economic party go on? Now he says growth,
averaging 4 percent a year, is on an ``unsustainable trend,'' even
though increases in hourly wages are falling and inflation in May
was zero.
</P>
<P>
   Has Greenspan reversed course, discarding his brilliantly
executed regime of watchful waiting in favor of pre-emptive strikes
against nonexistent inflation?
</P>
<P>
   Some students of the Fed say Greenspan has been more a pragmatic
opportunist than a watchful waiter, taking clever advantage of
special circumstances like falling oil prices and spikes in
productivity. Others say he has been more lucky than good.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking beneath this debate is a more important one about how
the economy works and how central bankers should control it.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional economic wisdom, circa 1990, came in three parts.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was thought to be a minimum long-term unemployment
rate, estimated to lie between 6 and 6.5 percent. If the Fed would
try to push unemployment any lower, the theory went, it would send
wages, then prices, spiraling upward.
</P>
<P>
   Second, inflation, once started, tended to accelerate out of
control. Breaking inflation would require the Fed to raise interest
rates so much that recession would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it was thought that Fed policies to break inflation would
need a year or more to take hold. Conventional wisdom said, then,
that the Fed should strike pre-emptively against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But something weird and wonderful happened on Greenspan's watch.
For reasons nobody really understands, unemployment fell steadily
from above 7 percent in 1992 to 4.2 percent today. Yet inflation
stayed quiet. Something was wrong with the Fed's models.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, like Professor Frederic Mishkin of Columbia
University, chalk up Greenspan's success to subtle pragmatism. In
1992 and 1993, Mishkin cites as an example, banks were in poor
financial health, so Greenspan kept interest rates low; that way,
banks wouldn't have to pay as much to depositors. After the banks
recovered, he raised rates in 1994 to keep the economy from
overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Benjamin Friedman of Harvard provides another example.
In 1998, the Fed reduced rates to keep the economy from slowing in
response to the financial crisis spreading from Asia. Now,
Greenspan indicated during his testimony last week, the Asian
crisis has dissolved and some of the rate cuts may no longer be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank and
former head of the Council of Economic Advisors under President
Clinton, takes a dimmer view of the Greenspan record, suggesting
that the post-1993 recovery happened despite errors Greenspan made.
Stiglitz says the Fed misjudged the favorable economic impact of
the budget plan that Congress passed in 1993 to trim the deficit.
It therefore sat on the sidelines as the economy roared ahead,
pulling the unemployment down to levels the Fed had thought
dangerous. If Greenspan had correctly forecast the impact of the
budget plan, Stiglitz argues, he would have raised interest rates
to fight inflation _ and the country would have lost a roaring
recovery that has brought jobs to millions of low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Greenspan achieved spectacular economic results by
accident or mistake, Friedman gives him credit for letting
unemployment fall to levels the Fed considered unsafe _ thereby
discovering the economy could do a lot better than the Fed had
thought possible. Stiglitz draws some other lessons. Research by
the Council of Economic Advisers, he says, refutes most of the
conventional wisdom. Inflation is not the scourge it was only
recently thought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Professor James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas agrees.
``Research does not show that, once started, inflation
automatically spirals upward,'' he said. ``Nor is there evidence
that reversing modest increases in inflation is all that costly.''
</P>
<P>
   By this line of argument, there's no harm in waiting to attack
inflation until it actually appears. And waiting has the advantage
of letting the Fed learn how fast the economy can grow. So, it
might seem, the debate comes down to a dispute between economists
who think it is important to pre-empt inflation and those who think
fighting inflation can wait. It's not quite that simple. This is,
after all, the Delphic science of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Friedman. He agrees that the Fed can reverse modest
inflation with only modest recession as a result. In this, he
sounds like Stiglitz. But he also wants the Fed to raise interest
rates next week. That sounds like the strategy preferred by
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has an explanation: ``I called for rate hikes five
years ago when I thought the economy was growing too fast. And I
was wrong. I called for rate hikes two years ago. Again, I was
wrong. But labor markets are tighter now than they were five years
ago or two years ago, and our economy is growing even faster. The
Fed cannot wait around for mistakes to happen when it thinks they
are in the works.''

OPPONENTS INVOKE ISLAM AS INDONESIA FACES POSSIBILITY OF A WOMAN
PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Like white doves, demure and cowled, the
girls of the Asshiddiqiyah Muslim boarding school nestled on tiny
carpets for their noon prayer, their thick-soled sneakers lying in
a jumble on the steps outside.
</P>
<P>
   Then came lunch and gossip and glances across the small brick
courtyard at the boys and, all right, if we must, some talk of
politics. Can a woman be president of Indonesia, the world's
largest Islamic nation?
</P>
<P>
   It is the question of the day. The leading contender for the
presidency in Indonesia's long, tortured political process is a
woman, Megawati Sukarnoputri. As coalition lobbying intensifies
following this month's inconclusive election, some of her opponents
are playing the Islamic card.
</P>
<P>
   A restive but largely quiescent political force for decades,
Islam has suddenly emerged, in the vacuum of the slow vote count,
as a potentially divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question of a rise of militant Islam or an
imposition of Islamic law. But all of Indonesian politics is in
flux now, one year after the forced resignation of President
Suharto, and Islamic factions are shifting and roiling as they seek
a new place in a new political order.
</P>
<P>
   The wedge issue is gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Woman President: No Way!'' shouted a recent newspaper
headline, stating the case succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   This was also the opinion of Rosita, 17, a student here at the
boarding school. ``We think a woman always follows her feelings and
is too emotional,'' she said, expressing a view commonly held here.
Then, as if to prove her point, she exclaimed, ``We love Habibie!''
_ the incumbent president, B.J. Habibie _ ``He is so handsome!''
</P>
<P>
   The rector of the boarding school, Noer Muhammad Iskandar, took
a different (perhaps less emotional) view. ``Why not?'' he said.
``Islamic laws allow a woman to be president. All this business is
a political interpretation of Islamic law, not a religious
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement between the student and the rector goes all the
way to the top of the religious hierarchy. Three of Indonesia's
five leading clerics argue that a woman cannot be president; two
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In the political field, a dozen parties that label themselves
Islamic _ out of 48 that contested the vote _ are also divided on
the question.
</P>
<P>
   But there is agreement among most political commentators that
the real issue here is not gender or Islam but politics. This is a
country where nationhood has always taken precedence over religion
and where Islam, in its many variations, has for the most part been
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where some 90 percent of the population of more than
200 million are Muslim, there is no such thing as a unified Muslim
vote. Instead there is a continuing debate over the role of
religion in society and a continuing jostling for dominance among
the more orthodox and more secular views, and their various
subsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam is factionalized and they are poorly organized,'' said
Arief Budiman, a leading political scientist. ``But it has the
potential to be an effective political tool especially if it is
focused on a unifying issue, even a small issue. But that does not
mean fanaticism in the religion like the Taliban,'' a reference to
the fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years in power, Suharto worked to neutralize the
power of Islamic politics. He also at times subtly played an
Islamic card when it suited him.
</P>
<P>
   On voting day in the coastal village of Sukawali, 30 miles
northwest of Jakarta, a fisherman named Hasan Bisri, 60, expressed
the nationalist philosophy that Suharto had fostered. ``Some people
might vote for an Islamic party,'' he said. ``But we prefer to put
Islam aside. We prefer to put the nation first and Islam second.''
</P>
<P>
   Islamic parties generally did poorly in the election. The
potential problem, political analysts say, is that if they are
ignored in the government coalition that will eventually emerge,
the seeds could be sown for future tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The religious question emerged quite suddenly on the eve of the
June 7 vote. First came an unconfirmed report that 60 percent of
Mrs. Megawati's parliamentary candidates were non-Muslim. Then, in
a clear attack on Mrs. Megawati's party, came a round of
streetcorner fliers urging good Muslims to vote only for parties
that support Islam. Then came the debate over a woman president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati's party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Reform, represents the country's mainstream of secular nationalism
and is home to many members of the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   But she herself and most of those who support her are Muslim. If
indeed a disproportionate number of her candidates are Christians,
said Goenawan Muhamad, a leading publisher and political analyst,
it was as much as anything a sign of her political ineptness,
``most unwise on her part, and insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from questions of religion, Mrs. Megawati's party will
need to form a coalition in order to take power. And the two most
likely partners are the parties of the two most prominent Muslim
politicians _ both of whom also covet the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One, headed by Abdurrahman Wahid, has its base in the nation's
largest Islamic association, with a membership approaching 30
million, the Nahdlatul Ulama _ which means council of religious
scholars. It represents a relatively relaxed and moderate approach
to religion, but it is so large that there is more than enough room
for divisions over issues like the propriety of having a woman
president.
</P>
<P>
   The second, headed by Amien Rais, is based in his more
conservative Muslim association, the Muhammadiyah, but contested
the election as a secular party.
</P>
<P>
   Rais was the first major politician to concede defeat in the
election, when the early count showed his party trailing. But he
could still form a crucial swing vote between a Megawati-Wahid
alliance and an alliance built around the incumbent party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great faith in the capacity of Muslim politicians to do
the most remarkable deals with non-Muslims,'' said Harold Crouch,
an expert on Indonesia at Australian National University in
Canberra. ``I think they'll be bargaining hard like everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is not rising fundamentalism we have here. It's
old-style Islamic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all as it should be, said Rosita's Islamic law professor
at the boarding school, Tohirin Suparta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the history of Indonesia, our country was
established by nationalism, not by Islamic law,'' he said. ``We are
not an Islamic nation, so the political leader is higher than the
religious leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Her English teacher, Jazeri Sardi, looked on as the girls in
their white cowls knelt in intense concentration, dipping their
heads to the floor as their rector read a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many Christian friends,'' Sardi whispered. ``We visit
each other often and we don't have any conflict. Religion has come
to make people love each other, not to make people hate each other.
What do you think?''

<P>
   W was the letter of the week _ as in the middle initial and
nickname of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas who announced his
candidacy for president in trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. But by
the time Bush had made his way home to Austin, another letter in
the alphabet was crowing for attention in this swift presidential
primary campaign: C, as in CC, the shorthand in the Bush campaign
for ``Compassionate Conservatism.'' It was on that rhetorical
ground, the son of the former president declared in the course of
10 speeches in three days, that his campaign for the White House
would rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   And what ground was that? Bush devoted eight lines in his speech
to a discussion of compassionate conservatism, but at the end of
his announcement tour it was clear that the phrase was as open to
interpretation as the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Was this alliterative call to arms a fundamental new variation
of conservative thought, a bold attempt to move the Republican
Party to the center, much the way Bill Clinton pulled the
Democratic Party away from the left in 1992? Or was it a narrower
political calculation designed to fit a new suit around the
conservative policies that Republicans have been advocating in
Washington in recent years, if not quite so kindly and gently as
Bush did last week.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``compassionate conservative'' has been the subject
of much discussion (and some confusion) in recent days, as
Republican leaders, watching Bush seek to dominate the presidential
field, consider exactly what it means, and how it applies to this
race. Is there, for example, a compassionate conservative view on
gun control or abortion rights or gay rights or China policy?
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Republicans acknowledge they aren't sure. But
that hasn't inhibited a lively and sometimes cranky debate within
the party over the meaning of compassion and the nature of
conservatism, a debate that reflects larger conflicts over who the
Republicans are and what they should stand for.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I can't give you a straight answer on
it,'' said California Republican Party chairman John McGraw when
asked his definition of compassionate conservatism. ``I've been
conservative my whole life, and I think I've been compassionate,
too. I just never hooked the two words together.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the confusion was by design: It is not in the
interest of Bush, the front-runner by acclamation, to take too many
positions on too many issues. Compassionate conservatism can mean
different things to different people, depending on which word the
listener chooses to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   As a result there appear to be as many interpretations as there
are factions in the Republican Party _ some intended to define what
Bush means before he gets around to it, others using it to
discredit the ideological credentials of the candidate most
Republicans view as the party's likely nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush talks more about teaching reading rather than
abolishing the Department of Education, that's the language of
compassionate conservatism,'' Nelson Warfield, the conservative
Republican who served as press secretary to Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said approvingly. ``That's more relevant to
voters than flaming rhetoric about burning down the government.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki applauded the slogan as a cogent
summary of Republican policies that had been unfairly criticized.
``The compassionate conservatism that Governor Bush speaks about is
exactly right and precisely what we are trying to do,'' he said.
``Our policies, our conservative policies, result, in fact, in
better lives, and recognize true compassion for people who are
striving for a better lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a Bush rival, faulted
Bush for political gimmickry, describing the phrase as a sign of
disrespect for the party's conservative base. ``I don't know what
it means,'' Alexander said. ``I don't think anyone else does
either. I think it's a carefully tested way to confuse the voters
so they won't know what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, agreed William Kristol, the editor of the
conservative Weekly Standard, is little more than ``a way of
distinguishing himself from the congressional conservatives.'' He
added, ``The opposite of compassionate conservative is angry white
male.''
</P>
<P>
   The variety of these responses suggests that Bush may have
created (or more precisely, adopted; the phrase has been around for
at least 15 years) one of those political slogans that is useful
because people can read into it whatever they want. If that is
true, it is evidence of the keen skills that Bush has brought to
this campaign; compassionate conservative is certainly more
memorable than the call for ``practical idealism'' offered by Vice
President Al Gore last week in announcing his own bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the phrase, combined with Bush's promise to present
the details of his platform ``on my own timetable,'' would seem to
invite voters, along with Republican leaders, to fill in the
blanks, investing Bush with their own values and views.

<P>
   W was the letter of the week _ as in the middle initial and
nickname of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas who announced his
candidacy for president in trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. But by
the time Bush had made his way home to Austin, another letter in
the alphabet was crowing for attention in this swift presidential
primary campaign: C, as in CC, the shorthand in the Bush campaign
for ``Compassionate Conservatism.'' It was on that rhetorical
ground, the son of the former president declared in the course of
10 speeches in three days, that his campaign for the White House
would rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   And what ground was that? Bush devoted eight lines in his speech
to a discussion of compassionate conservatism, but at the end of
his announcement tour it was clear that the phrase was as open to
interpretation as the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Was this alliterative call to arms a fundamental new variation
of conservative thought, a bold attempt to move the Republican
Party to the center, much the way Bill Clinton pulled the
Democratic Party away from the left in 1992? Or was it a narrower
political calculation designed to fit a new suit around the
conservative policies that Republicans have been advocating in
Washington in recent years, if not quite so kindly and gently as
Bush did last week.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``compassionate conservative'' has been the subject
of much discussion (and some confusion) in recent days, as
Republican leaders, watching Bush seek to dominate the presidential
field, consider exactly what it means, and how it applies to this
race. Is there, for example, a compassionate conservative view on
gun control or abortion rights or gay rights or China policy?
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Republicans acknowledge they aren't sure. But
that hasn't inhibited a lively and sometimes cranky debate within
the party over the meaning of compassion and the nature of
conservatism, a debate that reflects larger conflicts over who the
Republicans are and what they should stand for.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I can't give you a straight answer on
it,'' said California Republican Party chairman John McGraw when
asked his definition of compassionate conservatism. ``I've been
conservative my whole life, and I think I've been compassionate,
too. I just never hooked the two words together.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the confusion was by design: It is not in the
interest of Bush, the front-runner by acclamation, to take too many
positions on too many issues. Compassionate conservatism can mean
different things to different people, depending on which word the
listener chooses to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   As a result there appear to be as many interpretations as there
are factions in the Republican Party _ some intended to define what
Bush means before he gets around to it, others using it to
discredit the ideological credentials of the candidate most
Republicans view as the party's likely nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush talks more about teaching reading rather than
abolishing the Department of Education, that's the language of
compassionate conservatism,'' Nelson Warfield, the conservative
Republican who served as press secretary to Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said approvingly. ``That's more relevant to
voters than flaming rhetoric about burning down the government.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki applauded the slogan as a cogent
summary of Republican policies that had been unfairly criticized.
``The compassionate conservatism that Governor Bush speaks about is
exactly right and precisely what we are trying to do,'' he said.
``Our policies, our conservative policies, result, in fact, in
better lives, and recognize true compassion for people who are
striving for a better lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, a Bush rival, faulted
Bush for political gimmickry, describing the phrase as a sign of
disrespect for the party's conservative base. ``I don't know what
it means,'' Alexander said. ``I don't think anyone else does
either. I think it's a carefully tested way to confuse the voters
so they won't know what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, agreed William Kristol, the editor of the
conservative Weekly Standard, is little more than ``a way of
distinguishing himself from the congressional conservatives.'' He
added, ``The opposite of compassionate conservative is angry white
male.''
</P>
<P>
   The variety of these responses suggests that Bush may have
created (or more precisely, adopted; the phrase has been around for
at least 15 years) one of those political slogans that is useful
because people can read into it whatever they want. If that is
true, it is evidence of the keen skills that Bush has brought to
this campaign; compassionate conservative is certainly more
memorable than the call for ``practical idealism'' offered by Vice
President Al Gore last week in announcing his own bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the phrase, combined with Bush's promise to present
the details of his platform ``on my own timetable,'' would seem to
invite voters, along with Republican leaders, to fill in the
blanks, investing Bush with their own values and views.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered a few hints of what compassionate conservatism
means to him. On taxes, for example, Bush said in his announcement
that he would propose changes to help families living on the edge
of poverty. By contrast, most Republicans tend to rely on cuts for
upper-income taxpayers to boost prosperity for all. ``It is
conservative to cut taxes,'' Bush said. ``It is compassionate to
help people save and give and build.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply impose stringent welfare reduction policies,
Bush said, he would propose ways to permit private charities to
help welfare recipients find their way. ``It is conservative to
reform welfare by insisting on work,'' Bush said. ``It is
compassionate to take the side of charities and churches that
confront the suffering which remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, demanding standards in public education _ such as
barring promotions of students who perform poorly _ would be
matched with programs to help children who might otherwise be left
behind. ``It is conservative to insist on education standards,
basics and local control,'' Bush said. ``It is compassionate to
make sure that not one single child gets left behind.'' Details are
left to future speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush might have been restrained in defining the term; other
Republicans were not, though, suggesting one of the risks Bush
faces in throwing out such a broad conceptual framework. ``I also
think it's compassionate to advocate campaign finance reform to
reduce the influence of special interests,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., the contender who has put himself at odds with many
Republicans by embracing tighter restrictions on contributions and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion rights have also been quick to apply
Bush's formulation to their cause, notwithstanding the fact that
the governor of Texas, who is generally against abortion rights,
wants to avoid what he views as a no-win topic during this
campaign, his aides said. ``If compassionate conservatism means
anything, it has to mean, `Do anything we can to stop the loss of
1.5 million unborn children every year,''' said Gary Bauer, a
candidate favored by religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, one of the conservative Republicans who describes
Bush's slogan as ``slick marketing,'' sarcastically suggested that
there should be a compassionate conservative position on gun
control _ though he said he would not try to formulate it until
someone told him ``what the uncompassionate conservative position
is.'' (Bush said that he supports the right of citizens to bear
arms.)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Bush's course is reminiscent of the one Clinton
and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate
Democrats, took in anticipation of the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison only goes so far. Clinton was elected after
making a specific series of proposals that directly assaulted basic
Democratic positions: He advocated federal spending cuts, free
trade and anti-crime measures. Bush has yet to say anything that
might anger conservative voters, and there is no indication that he
feels any need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they haven't done yet is they haven't gone through the
agony and the tough, hard work that we did to really shape a
different agenda,'' said Al From, the executive director of the
Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would seem that Bush has decided that the only thing
he needs is to ``put a smiling face on conservatism again,'' in the
words of Ralph Reed, the conservative consultant, and leave it to
others to figure out precisely what he means.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It begins where so many father-son stories begin _
on a baseball diamond. Where it goes from there is the stuff local
legends are made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the kid?'' George Voita asks, looking over his shoulder
and spotting the same familiar face sitting up there alone in the
bleachers watching him throw extra batting practice to his son,
Sam, after practice one afternoon during the 1992 baseball season
at Granada Hills High.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Kyle, Sam told his dad. He was waiting for his mom
to get off work to pick him up. His dad was deceased.
</P>
<P>
   George waved for the kid to come down and take some swings, but
the kid shook his head no. There were only so many pitches left in
Voita's arm, and the kid didn't want to take any away from one of
the team's top players, Sam, who would go on after college to play
in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays major league baseball organization for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your butt down here and take some swings,'' George yelled.
</P>
<P>
   The kid smiled and grabbed his bat. It was the beginning of a
long, close friendship with the Voita family for a kid with no dad.
</P>
<P>
   That's the day the seed was planted, George Voita says _ when he
started getting serious about this wonderful, crazy idea he had
more than six years ago to sell his successful citrus fruit
marketing business and become part mentor, part surrogate dad to
kids with no active fathers in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home one day, told my wife and kids what I wanted to
do, and they said go for it, so I did,'' says George, 48.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have far to look.
</P>
<P>
   George found plenty of fatherless kids in his own church, at his
own children's schools and on local Little League and Pony League
baseball fields where he's helped coach and counsel hundreds of
young kids over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He found them, and they found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is like a big, overstuffed teddy bear, and kids just
gravitate to him like a homing device, particularly the kids who
are hard to reach,'' says Margie Keyser, youth pastor at the Valley
Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a survey in the church of the 130 kids on our roster,
and almost 50percent of them had no participating father in their
lives,'' Keyser said. ``George stepped in and filled that role. The
kids have this incredible sense of comfort with him.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes as any surprise to his family, says Mary
Herrero, one of Voita's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was always the house for people who had no place to go on
holidays, or for people who needed a place to live for a while,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening his heart is what makes him happy, and has value for
him. Most successful businessmen want to keep making more money,
but my dad said I have enough, and went off and did what he really
wanted to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He started a nonprofit organization called Children of Promise,
to fund scholarships, pay medical bills and hire school tutors to
help single moms trying to raise their children without a father
around.
</P>
<P>
   George went out and found kids like Reggie Marshall and Rio
Appling. ``He put us through summer camp three years in a row, and
when I graduated from high school, it was George, not my own
father, who took the time to come to my graduation ceremonies,''
said Appling, who now attends CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   He found kids like Chris and Kim Hamilton, whom he has helped
with college scholarships and sports coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy like him before,'' says their
grandfather, James Geeslin. ``He pours out his heart and money for
all these kids, and works hard to develop their character.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, George used his baseball contacts to get a tryout
for Lynn Novac's son, John _ a once promising pitcher who graduated
from El Camino High in 1993, and went to the University of Nevada,
Las Vegas, where his college career ended after two elbow
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``John still had the bug for baseball, and was throwing hard
again,'' Lynn said. ``George started helping him for no other
reason than he is a good man. He got my son a tryout with the Texas
Ranger organization, and they signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now playing on their class A minor-league team in
Savannah, Ga., where he's doing great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All George wants to do is help kids follow their goals and
believe in themselves,'' she added. ``There was nothing monetarily
involved in what he did. It was done strictly out of the goodness
of his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more accolades like this from other mothers and kids _
many more.
</P>
<P>
   None of them surprise Sam Voita. ``There's not a day that goes
by that dad doesn't get five to 10 calls from kids asking him to
come to their birthday parties, graduation ceremonies and
weddings,'' he says. ``And, he always does.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason his dad's his role model, Sam says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role models we look up to always seem to let us down
because we're looking up to them for the wrong reasons, like a job
or achievements in sport. The reason my father's my role model goes
deeper than that. It goes right to his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When you finally stop looking up to people for all the wrong
reasons, and find the right reason, they never let you down.
</P>
<P>
   It was blazing hot at 2 p.m. out on the mound at the West Hills
baseball complex Thursday, but George Voita ignored the sweat
running down his face and continued throwing batting practice to
his youngest son, John.
</P>
<P>
   George saw a kid leaning against the fence whose been hanging
around watching them _ a boy he knew doesn't have a father around
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kid, get your butt over here and take some swings,'' he
yelled out.
</P>
<P>
   The kid smiled and grabbed his bat.

ARAB HONOR'S PRICE: A WOMAN'S BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RESAIFAH, Jordan _ It took six years for the al-Goul family to
hunt down their daughter Basma.
</P>
<P>
   She had run away with a man, afraid for her life after her
husband suspected her of infidelity. Her husband divorced her and,
in hiding, she married the other man. But back in this overcrowded,
largely Palestinian village, where a woman's chastity is everyone's
business, the contempt for her family kept spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the most prominent family, with the best reputation,''
said Um Tayseer, the mother. ``Then we were disgraced. Even my
brother and his family stopped talking to us. No one would even
visit us. They would say only, `You have to kill.'''
</P>
<P>
   Um Tayseer went looking for Basma, carrying a gun. In the end,
it was Basma's 16-year-old brother, just 10 when she ran away, who
pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can walk with our heads held high,'' said Amal, her
18-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   What is honor? Abeer Allam, a young Egyptian journalist,
remembered how it was explained by a high-school biology teacher as
he sketched the female reproductive system and pointed out the
entrance to the vagina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the family honor lies!'' the teacher declared,
as Allam remembers it. More than pride, more than honesty, more
than anything a man might do, female chastity is seen in the Arab
world as an indelible line, the boundary between respect and shame.
An unchaste woman, it is sometimes said, is worse than a murderer,
affecting not just one victim, but her family and her tribe.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unforgiving logic, and its product, for centuries and
now, has been murder _ the killings of girls and women by their
relatives, to cleanse honor that has been soiled.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Arab world, in Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen,
the Palestinian territories and among Israeli Arabs, a new
generation of activists has quietly begun to battle these honor
killings, an enduring wave of attacks prompted by sexual conduct
that is sometimes only imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, home to the most candid talk about the issue, the
government under King Abdullah has promised to join in the fight,
following the example set by the late King Hussein and Queen Noor,
who helped to lift a lid on public discussion of the killings. At a
conference in Jordan in early June, delegates from across the
region were asked to develop ways to respond ``sensitively to the
situation in countries of concern.'' But those engaged in the
battle say it would be hard to exaggerate the magnitude of the
opposition they face.
</P>
<P>
   Across today's Arab world, modernizers may be wrangling with
traditionalists, and secularists with Islamists, but a nationalism
overlain by Islam remains a powerful political force. Even leaders
like the late King Hussein and Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak,
long entrenched, have had to balance pro-Western outlooks against
the risk of being seen as the instruments of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Activists trying to call attention to honor killings say they
face a similar challenge from those who portray their campaign as
an assault on Arab ways. ``They accuse me of trying to make the
country promiscuous,'' said Asma Khader, a Jordanian lawyer who is
a leader in efforts to tighten the laws against honor killing.
</P>
<P>
   Even in places like Resaifah, a largely Palestinian village of
noisy streets and dirt alleyways 45 minutes from Jordan's capital,
Amman, contempt for honor killing can be heard. ``If you spit, does
it come back clean?'' said Sheik Ali al-Auteh, 57, a tribal leader,
mocking the idea that honor could be cleansed with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who kills might think that dishonor goes away,'' said
his daughter, Yousra, 17. ``But when he walks past, people will
say, `There goes the guy who killed his daughter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stories told by the al-Goul family and others, including
killers and women who were attacked by their families, suggest a
broad acceptance of an unwritten code, one that sees the unchaste
woman as a threat. As long as they can remember, girls like Amal
al-Goul say, their brothers warned them: If you stray, you die.
</P>
<P>
   And when a woman like Basma al-Goul is thought to have crossed
the line, her family is ostracized, with her eight sisters deemed
unmarriageable by the neighbors, and her five brothers confronted
with taunts in the street. It was after other boys questioned his
manhood, saying that Basma should be dead, the family said, that
Mahmoud al-Goul ran to shoot his sister down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my sister was killed,'' Amal, the 18-year-old, said,
``I had to walk with my eyes to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Most often, the killings occur among the poorer and less
educated, particularly in Arab tribal societies like Jordan's and
the Palestinians, with long traditions of self-administered
justice. The killings are rare among the educated and urbane.
</P>
<P>
   But even among those upper classes, it is rare to hear
condemnation of the killings. Across Arab society, a bride is
expected to be a virgin, and other people's justice is not a
subject for polite company.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of conversations in the Arab world in recent months,
lawyers, laborers, clerics, cooks, physicians and politicians said
most often that, personally, they could not condone honor killing.
But most also said they felt the tug of traditions that could lead
a man to kill, and some suggested that they would be inclined to
act on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do what I have to do,'' said Bassam al-Hadid, a
Jordanian with an American doctorate who spent 12 years as a
hospital administrator in the United States, when asked whether he
would kill a daughter who had sex outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Even some victims of the attacks said they deserved their fate.
``He shouldn't have let me live,'' said Roweida, 17, who was shot
three times by her father after she confessed to an adulterous
affair, and, along with dozens of girls with similar stories, is
being held for her own protection in a Jordanian prison. ``A girl
who commits a sin deserves to die.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among all Arab countries, only Jordan publishes what are
considered credible crime statistics, so the extent of honor
killing is difficult to gauge. Often the killings are hushed up,
experts say, and disguised as accidental deaths. And, most often,
the killings occur outside the big cities, far from government
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Jordan, government officials tend to treat the issue
as taboo, at least in response to queries from foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistics show honor killings regularly claim 25 lives
a year in Jordan alone, about one in four homicides in a country of
just 4 million people, according to Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, which last reported crime statistics in 1995, a
government report counted 52 honor killings out of 819 slayings. In
Yemen, with a population of 16 million, Mohammed Ba Obaid, who
heads the department of Women's Studies in Sanaa University, said
that his surveys found that more than 400 women were killed for
reasons of honor in 1997, the last year for which research is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture does not allow any other choice for males,'' said
Obaid, who attended the recent conference in Jordan and called the
figures ``very alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings are also known in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other
Persian Gulf countries, and among Arabs in Israel, the West Bank
and Gaza. The experts say it would be safe to estimate that the
number of Arab women killed for reasons of honor amounts to
hundreds each year.
</P>
<P>
   But in most countries, activists and human-rights groups say,
most killers receive light punishment, when they are prosecuted at
all. Arab judges, who are almost always male, are generally allowed
great latitude in sentencing, and most tend to see honor as a
circumstance akin to self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can really want to kill his wife or daughter or
sister,'' said Mohammed Ajjarmeh, chief judge of Jordan's High
Criminal Court. ``But sometimes circumstances force him to do this.
Sometimes, it's society that forces him to do this, because the
people won't forget. Sometimes, there are two victims _ the
murdered and the murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of empathy is built into judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   An explicit exemption in Jordanian law, for example, allows a
man who kills a female relative surprised in an act of adultery or
fornication to be judged ``not guilty'' of murder. Another loophole
sought out by most defendants allows leniency for those who can
persuade the court that their sense of lost honor caused them to
act in an uncontrollable rage.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordanian found guilty in an honor killing can be sentenced to
as little as six months as prison. If the killing is ruled to be
premeditated, the minimum penalty is a year. No similar forgiveness
is offered to a woman who kills, even if the circumstances are the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the laws that Jordan's government has signaled that it
intends to toughen. But, in an indication of the depth of
opposition in place around the region, the speaker of the lower
house of Parliament, Abul-Hadi al-Majali, and the district attorney
of Amman, Tawfiq al-Quaisi, said in interviews that they opposed
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an internalized belief that the woman is the one
responsible for shame, because she could have resisted the
seduction,'' said Zahra Sharabiti, a Jordanian lawyer who
specializes in defending those accused of honor killings. In Egypt
and in Jordan, convicted killers who opened their doors warily to a
Western stranger soon spoke with a defiant pride about the justice
they administered and received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not consider this murder,'' said Wafik Abu Abseh, a
22-year-old Jordanian woodcutter, as his mother, brother and
sisters nodded in agreement. ``It was like cutting off a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Abu Abseh killed his sister, bashing her over the
head with a paving stone when he found her with a man. He spent
four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Marzouk Abdel Rahim, a Cairo tile maker, stabbed his 25-year-old
daughter to death at her boyfriend's house in 1997, then chopped
off her head.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had no regrets. ``Honor is more precious than my
own flesh and blood,'' said Abdel Rahim, who was released after two
months.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, honor is so precious, that it is not unusual, experts
say, for a victim to be slain on the basis of rumor alone. As often
as not, said Hani Jahshan, Jordan's deputy medical examiner, his
autopsy of a woman slain for reasons of honor will find that her
hymen is intact.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, premarital sex is a criminal offense, regarded as
equal to adultery, while a girl under 18 who engages in consensual
sex is deemed to have been raped. A woman cannot leave home without
the permission of her family, and an unmarried woman who becomes
pregnant is not merely a criminal, but, by law, her child is taken
away at birth to be raised in an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   Jahshan's duties include examining girls and women taken into
custody and accused of involvement in breaking sex laws. His
findings are reported to the police and prosecutors, not to the
girls' families. But three times already, girls he examined alive
have been returned to him dead.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was a 17-year-old girl arrested as a runaway
this spring. Her father had heard that the girl and her 16-year-old
sister had been in restaurants with men. Jahshan found that the
girl was a virgin, and she was ordered released by the authorities,
who first obtained assurances from her family that she would be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks later, the girl was back on his table, killed,
along with her sister, by her father and two brothers, who could
not believe that they were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working here is very difficult,'' Jahshan said, as he showed
forensic photographs of the bruised, burned, battered or punctured
bodies of the young women who have come to him as corpses. ``We
have to solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor killings are not exclusively an Arab phenomenon. They are
known in India, Pakistan and Turkey, among other places,
particularly among poor, rural Muslims. Many Arabs complain that
attention to their society's portion of the problem reflects a
Western tendency to see them as backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Western man kills his lover or wife, the crime is
called a crime of passion,'' said Mohammed Haj Yahya, an
Arab-Israeli sociologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem who is
active in efforts to combat honor killings. ``But when it happens
in Arab societies, it is called a family honor killing, and we are
viewed as barbarous.'' Still, the prevailing tendency in the Arab
world has been to leave the phenomenon unexplored. In Egypt,
Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and other places where honor killings
take place, newspapers rarely mention such killings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And when an American news magazine wrote earlier this year about
the killings in Jordan, its Egyptian counterpart, Rose al-Youssef,
issued a loud defense, saying that the notion that such a ``brutal
custom'' was still being practiced was a product of foreigners'
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   But what distinguishes honor killings in the Arab world is that
they are seen less as crimes of passion than as inherently just.
``Women are largely looked upon as bodies owned and protected by
the husband, by the father, by the brother or even other
relatives,'' said Salwa Bakr, a novelist who is Egypt's most
prominent feminist writer. ``And these crimes are committed under
the pretext that these men are defending not only their honor, but
society's morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Abseh, the Jordanian who killed his sister with a paving
stone, was doing more. He was administering God's law, he said.
``We are Muslims,'' Abu Abseh's older brother said, ``and in our
religion, she had to be executed.'' That is certainly a
misunderstanding of Islam, Islamic scholars say, but it is not an
uncommon one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a fundamentalist fervor that has touched much of
the Arab world in the last two decades, Islamic faith has come to
be worn more and more often as a badge of honor. Sometimes, it as a
badge less earned than invoked, for purposes that do not always
have a basis in the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``These crimes are occurring because of ignorance of Islam _ by
the women who commit these un-Islamic acts, but also by the men who
kill them,'' said Abul Menem Abu Zant, a prominent Islamic leader
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   For women, and for men, Islam does put a premium on chastity,
and it prescribes harsh punishments for sexual misconduct _ death
for adultery, flogging for fornication. But Islam also teaches that
religious authorities, not family members, be the judges, and that
any punishment be deferred until a considered judgment is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic teachings caution further against false accusations.
Only repeated confessions from the accused or the testimony of four
male witnesses are seen as conclusive evidence of sexual
misconduct. ``Treat your women well, and be kind to them,'' the
Prophet Mohammed is recorded as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Islam has always coexisted and, in some practices, become
intertwined with, older Arab traditions. One pre-Islamic Arab
custom still prevalent in Mohammed's time was known as al-maoudeh _
the practice, explicitly condemned in the Koran, of burying baby
daughters alive so that they would not later cause the family
shame.
</P>
<P>
   The era that preceded Islam's arrival in the 7th century is now
known to Muslims as Al Jahiliya, or the Age of Ignorance. But its
traditions of harsh justice, rendered in verse by the 10th-century
poet Al Motanabi (``Your utmost honor will not be cleansed, until
blood is spilled,'' he wrote) have survived in Arab folklore and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Arab Christian as well as Muslim men are often
advised on their wedding night, only half in jest, to ``slaughter
the cat.'' The phrase is a reference to a tale in which a groom
brutally beheads a kitten in the bedchamber before having sex with
his virgin bride. If she strays, the man tells her, she will suffer
the cat's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Honor killings are not committed by Arab Muslims alone. Arab
Christians are a small minority today in places like Egypt, Jordan
and the Palestinian territories, but they account for a
proportionate share of those killings, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   It is among Arab tribes, whose centuries of intermarriage have
created powerful bonds, that traditional notions of honor may be
most enduring. Even in modern urban life, in places like Jordan,
many people identify most strongly with a tribe, so that the
conduct of one reflects on all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man's daughter does a wrong, he cannot sit amongst
men,'' Banjes al-Hadid, a member of Jordan's Parliament and a
prominent tribal leader, told a visitor to his home, atop Amman's
highest hill. ``He will be ostracized. They will not even give him
coffee. Who would like to kill his wife or daughter? But if he does
not, in a village or among a tribe, they will look down on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Sheik Abu Zant, the Islamic leader, argue that
stricter allegiance to Islam is the answer. They note that honor
killing, by most accounts, is far less common in Islamic countries
like Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have imposed strict Islamic law
and where premarital sex, sometimes, is indeed punished by lashing,
and adultery by death. If Jordan were to follow that example, Sheik
Abu Zant said, fathers, brothers and sons would be less inclined to
carry out the honor killings that some now justify as taking
Islamic law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   But a broader consensus holds that a better solution is silence,
when it comes to sexual misconduct. ``You have to cover it up,''
said Sheik Hadid. ``If no one knows what happened, everyone will be
more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   One option pursued by some young Arab women is surgery. On her
wedding night, an Arab bride is expected to bleed. A woman who does
not can expect to be hauled to a gynecologist by her husband, who
would demand to be told whether she had truly been a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For women who have had premarital sex, a way to avoid discovery
is known as hymen restoration. As long as the woman's sexual
experience has been limited, gynecologists say, the surgical
procedure is simple and inexpensive _ a stitching together of what
remains of the hymen, usually a few days before the wedding, so
that it will tear again during intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, Jordan, and most other Arab countries, the procedure
is illegal, because it is seen as defrauding the husband. But it is
also widely practiced. ``What's important is saving the woman's
life,'' said a Jordanian gynecologist who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   But the more traditional Arab way to cover up is through a kind
of shotgun marriage that keeps honor intact. Tribal leaders in
Jordan, who serve with the blessing of the government, say they act
as intermediaries many dozens of times a year, sometimes at the
request of young women, and sometimes by their families, in the
hope of legitimizing a union before it becomes fodder for gossip.
</P>
<P>
   If the male partner is reluctant, Sheik Hadid said, he makes a
powerful plea: ``Do you want her parents to kill her? Do you want
her to die?'' And as cruel as it may sound, Sheik Hadid said, he
tries to arrange marriages between the sexual partners even in
cases of violent rape. ``It might not be her fault,'' he said,
``but as I see it, the girl has no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Egyptian Parliament acted in April, that thinking was
built into Egyptian law, with the statute that promised a pardon to
any rapist who agreed to marry his victim. One attempt to change
that statute failed last December, and the usually compliant
Parliament did not finally acquiesce until Mubarak ordered it
repealed by decree.
</P>
<P>
   And even now, some Egyptian legal scholars argue that old
provision should be restored. ``Executing or putting a rapist in
jail does not help anyone,'' said Mustafa Ewis, a senior lawyer in
Cairo's Legal Resource Research Center, which describes itself as a
human-rights advocacy group. ``But if he marries the victim, then
it helps both of them, giving them a chance to start fresh and to
protect the girl from social stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude is repellent to people like Fawziya Abdel Sattar, a
leading law professor and former member of the Egyptian Parliament
who was active in pressing for the change. ``Instead of punishing
the rapist, the law gave him back his victim to re-rape her,
legally this time,'' Ms. Abdel Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once the specter of shame begins to loom, some families
come to see killing as the only choice. In March, the family of
Amal, a 17-year-old Jordanian, discovered that she was pregnant.
She told them she had been raped in December by a friend of her
father's, who was staying in the family home. Her sister-in-law
sold her gold jewelry to pay for an abortion. But the doctor
refused to perform the procedure, which is illegal in Jordan. And
so instead, Amal said, her father decided to use the money to buy a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he sent her mother and younger siblings from the
house, closed the windows and curtains, then turned the music loud.
As Amal lay on a mattress in her room, the father and her
22-year-old brother took turns with the revolver, shooting her
eight times and leaving her for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Amal's brother is still in jail, but her father is already free
on bail. And Amal, now bullet-scarred and six months pregnant, is
also in jail, with much less hope of swift release.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, she is being held for her protection. Her father,
brother and her cousins all still want to kill her. But she is also
a prisoner of her culture, and of a paternalistic Jordanian law
that allows a woman to be released only to a close male relative.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 or so other Jordanian women caught with Amal in a
similar limbo, prison officials say, many have been in custody for
years _ one since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists have begun to conclude that their only escape
from honor's thrall may be to leave Jordan forever, through
complicated arrangements that require the help of foster families
abroad. ``They should be considered social refugees,'' said Ms.
Khader, the Jordanian lawyer.

DEMOCRATS MOUNT ATTACK ON GOP OVER GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are moving to capitalize immediately on
the failure of the Republican-controlled House to pass even modest
gun-control legislation, and promising to take the issue to the
forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a short, blistering radio address delivered Saturday from
Europe, President Clinton took the House and the National Rifle
Association to task and set the tone for the coming campaign.
``Time and again, the gun lobby has used every weapon in its
arsenal to defeat any effort to strengthen our gun laws, no matter
how sensible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives gutted our bill in the dark of
night _ literally, after midnight _ because the gun lobby didn't
want common-sense gun legislation to see the light of day,''
Clinton said. ``That is unacceptable. We can't allow the gun lobby
to rewrite our laws and undermine our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, the two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,
also excoriated Republicans for the House's failure. But it was
mostly Democrats who killed the final package, saying that it was
too watered down to be effective and that they did not want to give
the Republicans bragging rights for passing even modest gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that Democrats killed the package so that they
could exploit the gun issue both in the presidential campaign and
in their eagerness to try to win back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were campaigning in California, a state where
shootings over the last several years have increased sentiment for
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the Congress doing?'' Gore asked incredulously. ``Why
don't they just wake up and respond to what the American people
want?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who pollsters
say is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, took the opposite tack. On Friday, the day of the House
vote, he signed into law a bill passed by the Texas Legislature
that would bar local governments from suing gun manufacturers to
recover damages from gun violence, putting him on the side of the
National Rifle Association. Texas is the 14th state to enact such a
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Austin, his office said: ``Governor Bush
does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product should be held
responsible for the criminal misuse of that product.''
</P>
<P>
   This dovetails with a pervasive Republican view that cultural
factors, such as moral decay and a loss of faith _ not the
availability of firearms _ are responsible for disasters like the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo. As Rep. Tom DeLay, the Texas
Republican who is the majority whip, put it, the issue is ``God,
not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off that theme, and providing a counterpoint to the
contentious gun legislation, the House did pass, easily,
legislation urging states to allow the Ten Commandments to be
posted in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This had the apparently unintended consequence of embodying the
Republican response to Littleton in one person, Charlton Heston,
the actor who played Moses in the 1956 movie of ``The Ten
Commandments'' and who is now the most visible spokesman for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The actions by the House, and the mixed signals from Democrats,
many of whom come from conservative gun-supporting districts, may
only have confused the public while catapulting the issue into the
hands of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control is moving increasingly from the legislative venue
to the electoral venue,'' said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group based in
Washington. ``It will increasingly be fought out at the
presidential level, because essentially these House members voted
their districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to play down the discord in their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it wasn't the cleanest of political hits,'' Jim
Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,
said of the House votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordan said, ``what matters less is specific votes than
overall impressions that political events create.'' He added:
``It's not just that Republicans shut down the government or just
that they impeached the president against the wishes of the public;
it's not just that they criticized a legitimate war effort in
Kosovo, and it's not just this gun vote. It's a series of events
over and over that solidifies an image of being bitter and partisan
and nasty and out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it was the combined actions of Bush in Texas and the
Congress in Washington that provided Democrats with instant grist
for the campaign mill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, addressing a high school audience in Los Angeles, said of
Bush, ``The stakes are too high for any presidential candidate to
stand on the sidelines.'' Since Gore officially declared his
candidacy on Wednesday, he has been warning his audiences that Bush
would sign a bill that would ``protect gun manufacturers'' and that
he himself would not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, countered by suggesting that
Gore appeared to be promoting litigation as a solution. ``If Vice
President Gore wants to take the side of frivolous lawsuits, which
cost jobs and clog the courts and delay justice for people who need
it, we'll fight that fight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has until now preferred to speak in broad thematic
generalities about his candidacy. But on Friday night he advocated
several specific gun-control measures that he wants to enact, at
the same time assuming a lofty tone that suggested both parties in
Congress were tied in partisan knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end up with a shrill and stale debate that offers false
choices and little hope of reducing the carnage in America,'' he
said at a dinner in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a culture that he said was so permeated with violence
that there are more gun dealers than gas stations and grocery
stores, Bradley said he supported limiting gun purchases to one a
month per person, requiring those who own handguns to pass a basic
safety course, banning pistols known as Saturday night specials,
increasing the license fees for gun dealers and requiring dealers
to have photographs and fingerprints taken when they make
applications to sell guns. He said he also wanted to restrict
federal firearm licenses to businesses situated in commercial
zones, banning them from residential areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that guns alone among consumer products had generally
escaped regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks were softer than his campaign's earlier
suggestions that he believed handguns should be banned altogether,
and he couched his call for restrictions in language that was
sympathetic to gun owners, noting that as a boy he had gone
target-shooting with his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a subtle dig at Clinton for not doing more. He said
that much of the national conversation about guns was based on
polls and focus groups. ``Why should our leaders self-censor their
proposals on gun violence to what they think Congress might be
willing to pass, as opposed to what might work?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this month that he had tempered his anti-gun
proposals out of a realistic sense of what would pass the Congress.
``Let's join the real world here,'' Clinton said when ABC's Charles
Gibson had asked him on ``Good Morning America'' why he had
proposed such relatively modest measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, for example, that he wanted to require people to
register their guns just as they are required to register cars, but
that he knew Congress would not accept this.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded his radio address Saturday by appealing to the gun
lobby to help Congress pass measures to increase the time for
background checks on gun buyers and close loopholes on buying guns
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to be hurt by this legislation,'' he said of
proposals to close gun-show loopholes. He added: ``The American
people understand that common-sense gun laws don't infringe our
rights; they protect our lives. It's that simple.''

A ROYAL PRINCE TAKES A COMMONER BRIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, England _ It is the marriage of a prince who prefers to
be called ``mister'' to a suburban girl turned downtown publicist
who brings a commoner's touch to the starchy British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   This ancient castle town was the setting Saturday for the
wedding of Prince Edward, 35, the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth
and the last to wed, to Sophie Rhys-Jones, 34, the daughter of a
tire salesman from the village of Brenchley, Kent, and head of the
R-JH public relations firm in London.
</P>
<P>
   At their engagement in January, the couple had said they hoped
to have a low-key, family wedding, and Saturday's ceremony was that
only in contrast to the pageant-filled, high-profile marriages of
Prince' Edward's three royal siblings. It may have been the very
contrast he was seeking since his sister, Princess Anne, and two
brothers, Princes Charles and Andrew, all saw their grandly-feted
marriages end in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday night, Prince Edward said that
his love for his fiancee was ``the most important thing of all,''
and commentators promptly compared it to Prince Charles' dismissive
``whatever love is'' response after his engagement to Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhys-Jones decided she wanted the word ``obey'' included in
her vow ``to love, honor and obey,'' a stance that brought her some
critical comment but also served to set her off from Diana, who
insisted on dropping the word from her wedding. Ms. Rhys-Jones has
let it be known that, while she understands the comparisons her
passing resemblance to Diana prompts, she does not want to
encourage them.
</P>
<P>
   The couple chose Windsor, the weekend home of the queen, over
the more majestic Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral in the
capital, sites of the other royal family weddings. They scheduled
the ceremony for the evening and said the dress code for women
would exclude the long ballroom dresses and hats that are standard
gear at royal events.
</P>
<P>
   The only military participating were the musicians of the Royal
Marine Band. The service was the standard marriage rite from the
Book of Common Prayer with the traditional three hymns and three
anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Their open carriage ride after the ceremony will be not along
the mall leading from Buckingham Palace but around the streets of
Windsor and through the castle grounds where 8,000 people, almost
all of them residents of this town 30 miles from London, have been
invited.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list of 550 to the wedding itself inside St. George's
Chapel included no politicians, only a handful of members from
Europe's other royal houses were invited, along with the few
celebrities the couple knows, like Andrew Lloyd Webber, who gave
the prince his first job with his theater production company.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Mail stamp that has been issued to commemorate the day
appears to celebrate their informality, showing them both in
profile, dressed in matching turtle neck shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent plea that they be let alone, Andrew Motion, the
new poet laureate composing his first official verse, produced a
three stanza poem ending with a series of vows including the hope
``for privacy and what its secrets show.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps their most overt lunge at normality, the couple
decided that the reception dinner in the soaring 180-foot-long St.
George's Hall with its heraldic flags of the knights of the Order
of the Garter and its ornamental Gothic hammer-beam ceiling would
be beef stroganoff, served buffet style.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, who is seventh in line for the throne and the first
member of his family to hold down a nongovernment job, prefers to
be known as Edward Windsor in his role as co-owner of Ardent
Productions, a film company.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday he got two more titles from his mother that he can ask
people not to use when addressing him at work _ the Earl of Wessex
and Viscount Severn. Ms. Rhys-Jones becomes Her Royal Highness the
Countess of Wessex, sparing her the impersonal title of Princess
Edward that she would have assumed had the Queen not acted.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the young couple would like their union to be considered
just another June wedding, there were some striking differences.
</P>
<P>
   Their first home as newlyweds is the $16 million, 88-acre
Bagshot Park in Surrey, where 60 workmen have been laboring in
recent weeks to have the premises ready for them. Their gift
registry, with Thomas Goode of Mayfair, included matching $16,000
water and milk pitchers, a $14,000 silver teapot, a $10,000 sugar
sifter, a $5,000 hallmarked tea strainer and a 26-piece fine bone
china coffee and tea service for $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Prince Edward say he had hoped to play down the
public nature of his marriage but did not anticipate the amount of
interest that there would be in a royal wedding. The BBC is
televising the event worldwide and says it expects an audience of
more than 20 million. Souvenir stores plates and mugs and postcards
with pictures of the couple, and a Regent Street shop announced
Saturday that it would have a copy of Ms. Rhys-Jones' wedding dress
designed over the weekend and in its showroom window by Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-wedding interview with the BBC, Prince Edward was asked
if he feared for his own marriage, given the experiences of his
brothers and sister. Princess Anne, who divorced Capt. Mark
Phillips after 19 years of marriage in 1992, has since been married
again, to a former naval officer, Timothy Laurence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think about it,'' Prince Edward said. ``Anybody who
presumably decides to get married is doing it for the very best
intentions. They are going in there because they hope it is going
to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhys-Jones is older than either Diana Spencer or Sarah
Ferguson were when they married into the Royal Family, and she has
had the advantage of acclimatizing herself to their famously cool
ways during the six years she has been Edward's steady companion.
</P>
<P>
   When The Sun published a decade-old picture of her with her
breast exposed on May 26, Buckingham Palace vigorously came to her
defense, attacking the tabloid paper for ``premeditated cruelty''
and successfully demanding a published apology.
</P>
<P>
   She should not present the kind of challenge that other spouses
have to the courtiers and the senior members of ``The Firm,'' as
the Windsors are known to call themselves. Asked how she saw her
future, she told a television interviewer: ``I certainly see it
more in a supporting role to Edward rather than rushing off and
forging my own path, going off and taking on the mantle of various
charities. We are very busy as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing her practiced hand at public relations, she added: ``I
also think there is the queen and the rest of the royal family
doing an exceptionally wonderful job in a public role. I don't see
a massive need for me to go out there and do the same thing.''

   WASHINGTON _ Debate last week in the House of Representatives
centered on the sale of weapons at gun shows, an issue that has
drawn wide attention in the two months since the shootings at
Columbine High School. In the end the House defeated legislation
that Democrats and Republican moderates said had been hopelessly
watered down by lawmakers who caved in to the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But consider a measure that failed even to make it to the floor
for a vote _ tighter controls on one extreme weapon, the
long-range, semiautomatic, .50-caliber sniper rifle.
</P>
<P>
   This 28-pound, rapid-fire monster costs $6,800 and hardly seems
like a sporting rifle. It is a military weapon designed to destroy
armor-reinforced vehicles, punch through ballistic glass, pulverize
an enemy bunker or knock down low-flying aircraft. The .50-caliber
is extraordinary because of both its power and its staggering range
_ it is deadly accurate at more than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the government actually underwrites the civilian
market for this weapon, according to a report issued last week by
Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee at the request
of Reps. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., and Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon pays a West Virginia company to dispose of the
surplus bullets. After refurbishing thousands of the
half-inch-thick shells, the company sells them to retailers for
sale to the public. Some offer the shells for sale by fax or on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ammunition for the .50-caliber is readily available on the
civilian market in black-tipped, armor-piercing or silver-tipped,
incendiary varieties. And yet, for all their fire power,
.50-caliber guns are easier to buy than a handgun. Gun dealers may
sell anyone a .50-caliber if buyers present identification showing
they are 18 years old and have no felony convictions. Handgun
purchasers must show that they are least 21.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said the largest manufacturer of
these guns, Barrett Co., sold more than 2,800 .50-calibers between
1987 and 1998 _ most after the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The GAO
found that the guns had wound up in the hands of terrorists,
religious cults and drug traffickers. One group in Montana had
built hidden underground bunkers where it stockpiled 10 .50-caliber
guns.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators, posing as prospective purchasers of
.50-caliber ammunition, recorded several conversations with gun
dealers. In one conversation, an unidentified undercover agent
asked an unidentified dealer in Nebraska about the penetrating
power of a .50-caliber bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay,'' the agent said. ``Do you think it would go through,
like, an armored limousine?''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, the dealer replied, ``Oh, well I think it would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about bullet-proof glass?'' the agent asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, it'll go through that,'' the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's ballistic glass, it'll still go through?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' the dealer answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the first round?'' the agent asked.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer replied, ``Right.''

REBUILDING BALKANS WILL BE HARD IF SERBIA IS LEFT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:
47-42-80-44). Latin American points: contact Olivia Vasquez in Los

 By ALISON SMALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the fighting raged in Kosovo, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and
other leaders cast the latest Balkan battle as a moral imperative
on the order of fighting Nazism. Much less forcefully stated was
another goal: creating a Europe whole and free. Then Clinton, in
his speech marking the end of bombing, invited Serbia to join what
he termed ``this historic journey to a peaceful, democratic and
united Europe.'' But he insisted Serbia would get nothing but the
most basic humanitarian aid unless its leader, Slobodan Milosevic,
goes.
</P>
<P>
   So NATO's military might has proved, in the end, able to realize
one alliance goal: the return of the Kosovo Albanians forced out by
Serbian terror and the sheer violence that followed the alliance's
decision to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But it left its other goal _ the rebuilding of the Balkans _
very much open to question. In large part, that is because, barring
the sudden disappearance of Milosevic, the West is proposing to
rebuild the area without rebuilding Serbia, the country at the
Balkans' heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as NATO's troops took control of Kosovo, they were
finding more evidence of the kind of atrocities widely associated
with Serbian security forces. Those horrors had already earned
Milosevic and some of his closest cohorts indictments from the
international war crimes tribunal. Confirmation of the murder and
brutality described by Kosovo's fleeing Albanians seems certain to
isolate Serbia even further.
</P>
<P>
   The moral satisfaction of doing no business with Milosevic may
wind up conflicting with the political and economic logic of
finally bringing the Balkans fully into the new Europe, a costly
and long-term enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Europe does not need the Balkans to prosper,
but cannot truly be at peace unless the Balkan states prosper too.
For a century, these lands, haphazardly formed from the
disintegration of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires, have been of
interest to the rest of Europe only when fresh imperial ambitions
made this expedient.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the builders of the new Europe _ the Europe of a single
currency and trading bloc, of a common security and foreign policy
_ seem to have concluded that this Europe has no chance without
finally quieting the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that goal must be achieved through tens of thousands of
peacekeepers and aid workers, who have already created a virtual
protectorate in Bosnia, dependent on foreign money and might for
its existence. If a less clinging child is to be born in Kosovo,
and the tens of thousands of NATO soldiers pouring in there are
ever to leave, the world will have to help its people build a
functioning state, one where Serbs and Albanians can trust each
other with their lives. That would be more difficult with a
pauperized, resentful Serbia next door.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, the larger task is now to close the yawning
territorial gap between the north European and Greek halves of the
European Union, and between most NATO members and the Greeks and
Turks. The paths for commerce and tourism along the Danube, between
northern and southeastern Europe, from the Black Sea to the
Adriatic would be more open and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, none of this was of great concern when Western
Europe failed to end the war in Bosnia in the early 1990s, or when
the Clinton administration later passed up the chance to expand
NATO swiftly into the post-communist Balkans by rejecting Romania
in the first wave of NATO enlargement. But now the continuing
bloodshed, having drawn NATO into a major military role in the
region, seems to have convinced the West to try to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the 10 million Serbs, who are still

but the Greeks and Romanians on the Balkan peninsula.

   Serbia is to the Balkans what Germany is to Europe: a country
and culture too big to ignore. After World War I, Europe and
America considered Germany to have been the main cause of that

and effectively isolating it from the rest of Europe. The policy
was perhaps morally satisfying, even just. One of its unintended
results was the rise of Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, leaving Serbian hatreds and the traumas of the
past 12 years of Milosevic's rule to fester could well turn many
Serbs even more against the outside world. Clinton has called on
the Serbs to remove Milosevic but there is no assurance that they
will, any more than Iraqis have followed the urgings of Clinton and
his predecessor, George Bush, to rid themselves of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein. And for as long as he remains in power, Milosevic and his
media would still paint Serbs as victims of foreigners and the
other peoples of the old Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal killers who have served the Serbian leader would have
little compunction about acting as arms procurers or mobile
guerrillas to anyone willing to pay (Iraq is among Serbia's closer
allies). Politically, Milosevic could be driven even further into
the arms of the only president who visited him during the Kosovo
war, the Stalinist leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   With such a state at its heart, the Balkan region would have
little hope of achieving stability or peace. And the European
Union, which will pay most of the bill for rebuilding the Balkans,
might well find itself wasting any money it throws at the
struggling states of Bulgaria, Romania, Albania and Macedonia.

<P>
   As the fighting raged in Kosovo, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and
other leaders cast the latest Balkan battle as a moral imperative
on the order of fighting Nazism. Much less forcefully stated was
another goal: creating a Europe whole and free. Then Clinton, in
his speech marking the end of bombing, invited Serbia to join what
he termed ``this historic journey to a peaceful, democratic and
united Europe.'' But he insisted Serbia would get nothing but the
most basic humanitarian aid unless its leader, Slobodan Milosevic,
goes.
</P>
<P>
   So NATO's military might has proved, in the end, able to realize
one alliance goal: the return of the Kosovo Albanians forced out by
Serbian terror and the sheer violence that followed the alliance's
decision to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But it left its other goal _ the rebuilding of the Balkans _
very much open to question. In large part, that is because, barring
the sudden disappearance of Milosevic, the West is proposing to
rebuild the area without rebuilding Serbia, the country at the
Balkans' heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as NATO's troops took control of Kosovo, they were
finding more evidence of the kind of atrocities widely associated
with Serbian security forces. Those horrors had already earned
Milosevic and some of his closest cohorts indictments from the
international war crimes tribunal. Confirmation of the murder and
brutality described by Kosovo's fleeing Albanians seems certain to
isolate Serbia even further.
</P>
<P>
   The moral satisfaction of doing no business with Milosevic may
wind up conflicting with the political and economic logic of
finally bringing the Balkans fully into the new Europe, a costly
and long-term enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Europe does not need the Balkans to prosper,
but cannot truly be at peace unless the Balkan states prosper too.
For a century, these lands, haphazardly formed from the
disintegration of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires, have been of
interest to the rest of Europe only when fresh imperial ambitions
made this expedient.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the builders of the new Europe _ the Europe of a single
currency and trading bloc, of a common security and foreign policy
_ seem to have concluded that this Europe has no chance without
finally quieting the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that goal must be achieved through tens of thousands of
peacekeepers and aid workers, who have already created a virtual
protectorate in Bosnia, dependent on foreign money and might for
its existence. If a less clinging child is to be born in Kosovo,
and the tens of thousands of NATO soldiers pouring in there are
ever to leave, the world will have to help its people build a
functioning state, one where Serbs and Albanians can trust each
other with their lives. That would be more difficult with a
pauperized, resentful Serbia next door.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, the larger task is now to close the yawning
territorial gap between the north European and Greek halves of the
European Union, and between most NATO members and the Greeks and
Turks. The paths for commerce and tourism along the Danube, between
northern and southeastern Europe, from the Black Sea to the
Adriatic would be more open and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, none of this was of great concern when Western
Europe failed to end the war in Bosnia in the early 1990s, or when
the Clinton administration later passed up the chance to expand
NATO swiftly into the post-communist Balkans by rejecting Romania
in the first wave of NATO enlargement. But now the continuing
bloodshed, having drawn NATO into a major military role in the
region, seems to have convinced the West to try to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the 10 million Serbs, who are still
the most numerous people in the former Yugoslavia, outnumbering all
but the Greeks and Romanians on the Balkan peninsula.
Geographically, Serbia is at the heart of this region _ its roads,
railways and rivers indispensable to any commerce or communication
that might finally wear down the hatreds and rivalries that have
gnawed at these lands this century.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is to the Balkans what Germany is to Europe: a country
and culture too big to ignore. After World War I, Europe and
America considered Germany to have been the main cause of that
conflict, and punished Germany by imposing impossible reparations
and effectively isolating it from the rest of Europe. The policy

Serbs even more against the outside world. Clinton has called on
the Serbs to remove Milosevic but there is no assurance that they
will, any more than Iraqis have followed the urgings of Clinton and
his predecessor, George Bush, to rid themselves of Iraq's Saddam

</P>
<P>
   Thus, while declaring that it is up to the Serbs to topple
Milosevic before they get any help, the Clinton administration does
seem to be working quietly toward the Serbian leader's ouster.
Robert Gelbard, one of Clinton's envoys to the Balkans, has been
meeting with Serbian opposition leaders in Montenegro, and the
president has reportedly approved a covert action program to
destabilize Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat forced upon Serbia by the allied bombing may inspire
more Serbs to oppose Milosevic's continued rule. Back in the winter
of 1996-97, they staged highly disciplined but ultimately
unsuccessful protests against Milosevic. Last week, as NATO
peacekeepers poured into Kosovo, the Serbian Orthodox Church called
for him to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, a Serbian opposition leader who fled to
neighboring Montenegro during the Kosovo war after Belgrade accused
him of being a traitor, was encouraging Westerners last week to
work with provincial opposition leaders; many of these are mayors
of some of the most heavily bombed cities in Serbia, such as Nis,
Cacak, Kragujevac and Novi Sad. ``There are regions and cities in
Serbia that share the same views that I do and it wouldn't be
suitable or just if these people pay the price of the isolationist
policy of Milosevic, which will leave all of us isolated
together,'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   A leader as resilient as Milosevic is unlikely to go quietly,
though, and a danger of trying to topple him from a distance is
that any failure could reinforce East European doubts about the
West's resolve. The Hungarians, Czechs and Poles bitterly recall
how little NATO (which they have finally joined themselves) did for
them when their own people tried to throw off Soviet power in 1956,
1968 or 1981. For the Western message to have any genuine
attraction for the Serbs, they will have to see that this time the
West is serious, realistic and yet imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, for instance, the Serbs are watching to see if the
West can guide Albanians to build a state, and steer them away from
their own version of the Greater Serbian nationalism that has
proved so disastrous for the Serbs, and is now ebbing in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 120 years, the great powers, or the international
community as it's now called, have intervened in this region to
further their strategic aims and inflicted enormous damage on the
people of the Balkans,'' said Misha Glenny, a British author who
has written extensively about the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 120 years, the great powers now have an
opportunity to make good the destruction for which they bear
considerable responsibility. If they fail to address the pressing
economic and social needs of the region, then the Balkans will
again be a theater of war.''

   ARABS-CHASTITY (Resaifah, Jordan) _ More than pride, more than
honesty, more than anything a man might do, female chastity is seen
in the Arab world as an indelible line, the boundary between
respect and shame. An unchaste woman, it is sometimes said, is
worse than a murderer, affecting not just one victim, but her
family and her tribe. It is an unforgiving logic, and its product,
for centuries, has been murder _ the killings of girls and women by
their relatives, to cleanse honor that has been soiled. Across the
Arab world, in Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, the
Palestinian territories and among Israeli Arabs, a new generation
of activists has now quietly begun to battle these honor killings,
an enduring wave of crimes prompted by sexual conduct that is
sometimes only imagined. By Douglas Jehl.

EUROPEAN UNION TO PROVIDE $1.5 BILLION FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The European Union on Saturday announced
plans to provide $1.5 billion over the next three years for the
reconstruction of Kosovo, as the West tried to map a strategy that
would channel money to the war-devastated area without giving
financial support to Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Burghardt, the director-general for Europe's Balkan
policy, said the 15-nation bloc would provide $500 million annually
over three years to Kosovo ``irrespective of whether Milosevic is
there or not.'' But he added that the Yugoslav president, who was
indicted by the international war crimes tribunal last month, was
``a cancer'' that had to be isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get rid of the source of the cancer that has been
spreading throughout the region over the past eight years,''
Burghardt said. ``That means we have to isolate Mr. Milosevic and
put democratic institutions in his place.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union announced the aid on the second day of a
summit meeting of major countries that was on Saturday devoted
largely to Kosovo and possible financial support for the
debt-ridden Russian economy. Russia's prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin, is also attending the talks, and President Boris Yeltsin
is expected to arrive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official pointedly avoided
Burghardt's forceful language on Milosevic, saying only, ``We
believe that a fully open and democratic process could easily have
a different result in terms of the kind of government we would see
in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was ``not aware that there was specific
discussion about Milosevic remaining in power.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that a sea change has occurred since the
1995 Dayton peace for Bosnia, reached with Milosevic's help. While
Serbian war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo have scarcely differed,
NATO's ability to get to the scene of the crimes within weeks in
Kosovo has brought a decisively new level of outrage against the
Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The exact direction of policy toward Milosevic still appeared
unclear Saturday as Western leaders reviewed the options. A plan of
aggressive financial aid for Kosovo, while largely isolating the
rest of Serbia as long as he remains in power, presents several
difficulties, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   These include the fact that Kosovo formally remains part of
Serbia, that it has no independent financial institutions capable
of negotiating for loans, that its long border with the rest of
Serbia is likely to be porous, and that it cannot indefinitely
survive on aid alone in what now amounts to an institutional limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the United States said Saturday that it
is ready to give a measure of emergency humanitarian aid to other
parts of Serbia. But the distinction between this and the kind of
support for reconstruction and development that Washington wants to
avoid as long as Milosevic is in power could easily become murky.
</P>
<P>
   It may also prove extremely difficult to help Montenegro, the
other surviving republic in today's truncated Yugoslavia, while
avoiding support for Milosevic. The West has indicated it wants to
accentuate the isolation of the Serbian leader by supporting
Montenegro's democratically inclined government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Stepashin had objected to the plans to isolate
Serbia from international aid for reconstruction, the senior
administration official said he did not know. But French officials
said the Russian prime minister, who took office last month, had
argued forcefully for extensive aid to Serbia, saying that the
conduct of Milosevic could not be allowed to prejudice millions of
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's broad support for its traditional Orthodox Christian
Serbian allies has been strong, but tempered by the fact that
Yeltsin has no personal affection for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Burghardt said that the European Union had decided to set up a
special agency to deal with aid for the Balkans and that a special
international donors' conference for Kosovo would be convened in
July, probably in the first half of the month. The countries
meeting in Cologne will play a central role in this conference.
</P>
<P>
   It will be devoted to emergency assistance _ essentially the
provision of shelter, medicine and food before the winter sets in.
Later in the year, a further conference will be held on the basis
of a detailed assessment of Kosovo's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Joly Dixon, a senior European Union financial official, said
Western financial support would be concentrated on Kosovo in a
first stage, to be followed by other countries affected by the war
and finally the Balkan region as a whole. The European Union has
already begun intensive consultations with the World Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration official said teams from the United
States were already in Kosovo assessing needs for the first
conference in July. Between July and the fall, he added, there
would be ``a more intensive effort involving the World Bank, the
European Union and others.''
</P>
<P>
   How much the United States will spend on Kosovo reconstruction
remains unclear, although Europe has indicated it will bear most of
the burden. In Bosnia, over $5 billion was pledged over four years,
with Europe paying more than half. But actual payments proved slow,
complicating and holding back reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear in the leaders' discussions on Saturday that for
the first time since the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began
eight years ago, the West has decided to approach the crisis in the
Balkans in a broad way, providing massive assistance to the region
in the hope of integrating the states there with one another and
with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After a long period of hesitation, the specific prospect of
membership of the European Union has been held out to Croatia,
Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania and Yugoslavia itself, providing that
democracy and a market economy are convincingly installed.
</P>
<P>
   A Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, agreed on earlier
this month by European Union leaders, said peace in the area
depended on ``democratic principles and values'' being firmly in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But how stability can be reached while Kosovo's status and
future remain so vague was an issue that none of the Western powers
appeared inclined to address on Saturday. In effect, the West has
decided to help the province as if it were independent, while
adhering to a policy that says such independence will not be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders devoted some of their time on Saturday to the
question of who should occupy the pivotal top civilian post in
Kosovo, without making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration official said the person had to be
someone who was a ``very strong leader who has management skills,
communication skills, the ability to deal with difficult political
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the official, to be known as the special
representative of the U.N. secretary-general, will be a kind of
proconsul in a province marked by an extraordinary administrative
void.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tasks facing the administrator will be coordination
and channeling of the various forms of assistance now being offered
by the West, and the delicate management of any relations with
Belgrade.

UPBEAT ISRAELI LEADER HAS U.S. GUESSING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His coalition almost complete, Ehud Barak, Israel's
prime minister-elect, is expected to come to Washington early next
month to unveil his keenly awaited thoughts on reviving peacemaking
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is a harbinger of the style Barak brings to his new job that
he has declined to discuss his intentions with any American
official since the election _ not Dennis Ross, the seasoned
American mediator, not even the American ambassador in Tel Aviv. He
has asked that his first meeting be a long and private one with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, the directness and the air of mystery still
surrounding a leader who has spent far more of his life in the
secretive discipline of warfare than in the rowdy universe of
Israeli politics, have created a whirl of speculation and
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration _ which has not concealed its
satisfaction with the demise of the outgoing prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu _ Barak is perceived as a virtual reincarnation
of Yitzhak Rabin, as a warrior-turned-peacemaker who will put
Rabin's peace effort back on the heady track it was on before
Netanyahu was elected three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that I will have to take any steps to revive
the peace process,'' Clinton confidently declared this week in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Ross described Barak as a leader who ``intends to get the
country going.'' Speaking Thursday at a conference of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Ross left little
question that it was Netanyahu he blamed for the stagnation of the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have the kind of mutual confidence and trust that
we had before,'' he said. ``I am confident that we will restore
that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But at that same conference, Israeli hawks could be heard
pointing out that Barak's campaign statements on the Palestinians
were not so different from Netanyahu's, while a respected
Palestinian analyst, Mahdi F. Abdul Hadi, said many Palestinians
were apprehensive that Barak was coming to office as a former
general with an immediate surrounding of other former generals.
Rabin, he noted, had the dovish Shimon Peres at his side.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak's policies take shape, analysts are virtually
unanimous in their conviction that he will be a leader
qualitatively different from Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak has a different point of departure from Bibi,'' said a
senior American official, using Netanyahu's nickname. ``Bibi saw
enemies everywhere. He saw any meeting with us or the Palestinians
as a threat that he had to manage. He presumed the worst would
happen. Barak won't be like that. He knows Israel is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials described Barak as a brilliant and
methodical planner who thought big but kept his cards close to his
chest. ``He's talking big bucks, big treaties, big concessions,''
said an analyst for a major Jewish lobbying group. ``Barak is
coming into this as a big-type guy. He's a genius, he disassembles
clocks for a hobby, he's a concert pianist, a meticulous planner.
He analyzes every aspect of a situation. He's not a dove; he's a
doer.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they said, he was a man who would carry out what he
pledged to do, in contrast to Netanyahu, whose intentions
invariably became mired in wrangles with his unwieldy coalition.
That alone, American officials argued, would help restore some of
the mutual trust that collapsed under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he has avoided meeting with Americans since the
election, officials said, demonstrated his determination to end the
situation under Netanyahu, in which the Americans moved from being
mediators to direct negotiators, severing any direct contact
between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Already, American officials noted, Barak has shown a readiness
to communicate with Arafat. ``The way to re-establish relations is
to talk,'' one official said. ``Engagement counts for a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside his intentions and style, analysts have identified
several advantages and disadvantages Barak will face in resuming
the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   His strongest suit is his landslide victory in the election, and
the fact that he will have a coalition that controls at least
two-thirds of the seats in the Parliament. He will also have the
support of an Israeli public far more supportive, as election
results demonstrated, of swapping land for peace than it was three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles, one may be his own priorities. In his
election campaign, Barak pledged that he would make peace with
Syria, with a withdrawal in the Golan Heights, and would withdraw
Israeli troops from their self-proclaimed buffer zone in southern
Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the experience of Middle East peacemaking that Israel
cannot proceed on two fronts at once, and the question is whether
Barak will become focused on the more dramatic goal of concluding
peace with the last of Israel's neighbors still holding out, to the
detriment of the far more tangled Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real fear among the Palestinian people that you
will have a peace treaty with Syria, but we will still be
nowhere,'' said Abdul Hadi. ``We are the small fish in the region.
But if it cannot swim, it will bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle is that if Barak does pick up the Oslo process,
he will do so at a point where all the choices are brutally
difficult. The process was designed to create momentum and mutual
trust by resolving the easier issues first, and leaving the
difficult ones for the end _ the status of Jerusalem, the plight of
refugees, the fate of Jewish settlements, control over water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Oslo, the can was supposed to be kicked down the road,''
said David Makovsky, political writer for the Israeli daily
Haaretz. ``Well, now the can is down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Barak will have to confront the spate of
settlements that right-wingers have launched in the West Bank, with
the blessing of Netanyahu, in anticipation of a change of
government. How he deals with these will have a major impact on his
standing with Palestinians, Americans and West Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the closer Israel approaches ``final status'' talks
with the Palestinians, the greater the gap. Though Barak has a far
greater consensus among his people than any of his predecessors, it
is still far from the expectations of the Palestinians, who still
anticipate getting a sovereign state in much of the West Bank and
Gaza with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will also face a Palestinian leader who is aging and
ailing. Should Arafat die, officials said, it would be a long time
before a leader took charge who would have anywhere near Arafat's
stature or control. ``We don't have very much time,'' Abdul Hadi
said. ``We cannot bring in a new leader in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak will have one advantage. Under Netanyahu, Arafat
garnered considerable sympathy in Washington and Europe as the
maligned underdog, and the Americans often interceded for him in
Jerusalem. Now, should Arafat not like what Barak is offering, he
is not likely to be given a sympathetic ear, at least not so long
as talks are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say we don't trust him,'' Abdul Hadi said, ``but we
would like very much to test him.''

<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ It is nearly impossible to find a Serb
here anymore, a state of affairs that is novel for the Albanians
and which the better side of Naim Spahiu, a 30-year-old driver,
said was not good for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should stay here,'' Spahiu, an Albanian Kosovar, said
Saturday as he walked past Prizren's main mosque, filling with
worshipers. ``We've always lived together.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, all the anger and resentment felt on
both sides of the ethnic divide of Kosovo spilled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took our money,'' he said. ``They killed us. We couldn't
go anywhere freely. I'm a driver and I used to travel to Pristina.
You can drive there in an hour. But it would take me two or three
hours because I always got stopped by the police. They never
stopped the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   This lovely city in southern Kosovo, dotted with mosques and
churches alike, has been reborn in the last week under the watchful
eye of NATO peacekeeping troops. Stores are opening. The oldest
barbershop is back to normal hours. But Prizren has come alive
again without the city's perhaps 10,000 Serbs, most of whom have
fled north over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still possible to find a few people who believe in a
multiethnic Kosovo, most Albanians here seem frankly just as happy
to see the Serbs gone. Their anger underscores not only the
sufferings of the recent war but longstanding distrust between the
two groups, which foxy politicians, like the Serbian president,
Slobodan Milosevic, have been able to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have long regarded themselves as the wall between
Christianity and Islam, and regarded the Albanians, many of whom
converted to Islam under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, as
traitors. The Albanians, with varying degrees of freedom under
different regimes, have regarded the Serbs as brutal oppressors.
Each side has inflicted horrors, the Serbs after the breakup of the
Ottoman Empire and the Albanians during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city seems like the kingdom of death,'' the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Skopje wrote about Prizren in 1913 when the
Ottoman Empire collapsed and Serbs massacred Albanians. ``They
knock on the doors of Albanian houses, take away the men and shoot
them immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for plunder, looting and rape, all that goes without
saying,'' he continued. ``Henceforth the order of the day is:
Everything is permitted against the Albanians _ not merely
permitted but willed and commended.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people here _ Serbs and Albanians alike _ said that for
the most part ordinary people have largely gotten along. After
Milosevic came to power in 1989, though, stripping many Albanian
Kosovars of their jobs and their rights, the relationship changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all politics,'' said Dragica Spasic, 53, one of perhaps a
dozen Serbs who are left in the hillside neighborhood of Podkalaja.
``Milosevic did all this. Now the Serbs have all left. They went to
Serbia and they are all going to kill Milosevic.'' She is leaving
too, to be with her husband and children in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all lived here,'' said Leposava Sekulic, 74, a Serbian
woman who lives down the hill a few houses. ``We all worked here. I
have so much pity for the Albanians. We can't live without them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the distrust remains: As Mrs. Sekulic spoke, she and a few
others noticed three young men, apparently Albanians, and commented
that they might have come up the hillside to loot. It was certainly
possible: Houses around the neighborhood, several marked with
funeral notices for the Serbs who died in the war, have clearly
been ransacked.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that Serbian forces looted Albanian homes, in a
pattern of atrocities against Albanians that is evident around
Kosovo. To have the Serbs gone, said Salajdim Ashikferki, 67, owner
of a barbershop that has been open since 1939, is simply
``better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After 2 in the afternoon, there was nobody here, only the
police,'' he said Saturday between shaves at 60 cents apiece.
``They set fire to the houses. They stole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so good'' that all the Serbs are gone, he said. ``But
after what they did, it's better that they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Another barber in the shop, Abdxlhadi Gjinali, 65, said he had
sympathy for ordinary Serbs, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all politics,'' he said. ``The politicians destroyed it
all. But almost all the Serbs listened to their politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, on the main square, Arlinda Mustafa, 23, said she hoped
that a Kosovo largely without Serbs would mean a new start for
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother hasn't worked for 10 years,'' she said. ``Now that
they have left, we can go back to work, back to school. We
Albanians are hard-working. Now we can go back to work.''

CLASH WITH RIOT POLICE SPARKS ISSUE IN MEXICO CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAUCALPAN, Mexico _ The fatal shooting of a young municipal
worker this week by a police officer here provoked a rampage of
partisan violence that could affect the outcome of closely watched
gubernatorial elections next month in Mexico's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, union activists loyal to President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party attacked municipal police in this
industrial suburb governed by the opposition, vowing to avenge the
killing by police the day before. The violence suggests that police
abuse is likely to be a potent campaign theme as Mexico moves
toward presidential balloting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Naucalpan is a city of 1 million residents in the state of
Mexico, a region of smoky factories and gritty slums adjoining
Mexico City. The state has for 70 years been governed by Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial elections are scheduled for July 4, and Jose Luis
Duran, who two years ago won election as Naucalpan's first
opposition mayor, has taken a leave of absence to run as the
candidate of the pro-business National Action Party, called PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide opinion surveys show Duran to be closing a modest lead
held by Ricardo Montiel, the PRI candidate. Higinio Martinez, the
candidate of a leftist party, is running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates have sought to capitalize on public
distress over crime and police corruption, which are rampant all
across Mexico and which no party has battled with much success.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, two Naucalpan police officers attempted
to detain Mauricio Martinez Hernandez, a 25-year-old city
waterworks employee, and one of the officers shot him dead when he
attempted to flee, in disputed circumstances. Naucalpan's acting
mayor said in an interview Saturday that the killing followed a
dispute between Martinez and the officer over a woman; local PRI
leaders insist the shooting occurred after Martinez resisted police
attempts to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   Angry residents gathered around Martinez's body, the officers
fled in their squad car, and local PRI leaders, shouting at the
crowd, immediately blamed the killing on Duran. Within hours of the
shooting, thousands of handbills headlined ``Killer Police, Duran's
Legacy!'' were being distributed across the state of Mexico. In one
city north of Naucalpan, state police officers were seen
distributing the leaflets, National Action officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, during a public display of Martinez's coffin in the
Naucalpan plaza, leaders of his union, which is affiliated with the
PRI, urged about 1,000 municipal workers to take vengeance. Some
300 laid siege to the Naucalpan police headquarters and city hall,
shattering windows with rocks and engaging in hand-to-hand combat
with 500 helmeted riot police officers, some of whom appeared to
have fired their service revolvers. Several officers were dragged
away from police lines, disarmed and beaten. One officer's leg was
broken.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people, including seven officers, were injured and
at least one union worker was wounded by gunfire. Five police cars
were destroyed, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Naucalpan's police have arrested the officer accused of shooting
Martinez. The other is a fugitive. The investigation of the death,
however, appears most likely to be caught up in the partisan
warfare, because jurisdiction falls to state detectives who work
for the PRI governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Naucalpan violence took center stage in the campaign for the
governorship, Mexico's most important electoral contest before
presidential balloting next year. But it was not immediately clear
who would be hurt and who would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the killing of Martinez, Montiel had been under fire from
human rights groups because, in positioning himself as a
law-and-order candidate who can crack down on crime, he recently
began airing ads that say, ``Human rights are for humans, not for
rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the killing has put Duran on the defensive by raising
questions about how much progress he has made in efforts to
professionalize the Naucalpan police, which have been a centerpiece
of his campaign. In an interview Saturday, he said he had purged
500 corrupt officers from the city's 1,800-officer force during his
two years in office, and had founded a police academy to train new
recruits. Naucalpan, he said, ``is the city in the state of Mexico
that has made the most strides in controlling crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lamentable act, that a young man dies at the hands
of the police,'' he said. ``But the violence we've seen here is an
utterly irresponsible political manipulation by the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Vasquez Castillo, president of the PRI in the state of
Mexico, shot back, ``With their diatribes, Duran and the PAN are
just trying to divert attention from a homicide for which they're
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the desperate tactics of a candidate who's tried to
sell the image that he's created a pristine police force in
Naucalpan,'' Vasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, much of the Naucalpan plaza was still spattered with
blood, and dozens of police on horseback were patrolling the
streets. Curtains flapped in the empty window frames of the
shattered police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen riot police officers were holding defensive
positions in the lobby of the city hall. Upstairs, Alejandro
Gutierrez Gutierrez, a National Action city councilman who in
Duran's absence is Naucalpan's acting mayor, was huddled in his
office, looking beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for the PRI to call on people to commit
aggressions against authorities or to try to take over a police
station by force,'' he said. ``They've called out their
neighborhood organizations, the street vendors, the taxi drivers,
all to create tensions before the elections. I think they're
putting our political system at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the plaza, David Parra Sanchez, a leader of the
PRI-affiliated municipal workers union, was addressing 200
municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there's total insecurity in Naucalpan,''
he shouted. ``The police are murdering our young people, and when
we protest, they say we're politicizing the murder. Was Mauricio
Martinez's death political?''

UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS IN U.S.-MOSCOW RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ When the Clinton administration invited
Russia to help it out of the war in Kosovo, the idea was that the
involvement in big-game diplomacy would help maintain
Washington-Moscow ties, and even improve the ailing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is about to make
his first foreign trip in four months on Sunday and to meet here
with President Clinton, as many _ if not more _ questions are
hanging over the dialogue as were before the war.
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said here on Friday
that relations with Russia had been ``strained'' by NATO's
airstrikes against Yugoslavia but now were ``reinforced'' by
Russia's participation in the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But as Berger left a briefing room after making those remarks,
he pretended not to hear a question about the likelihood of
Yeltsin's actually turning up in Cologne. The last time the Russian
leader was abroad, for the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in
February, he cut his stay in Amman to about an hour, apparently
because of illness. ``No, I didn't hear it,'' Berger said of the
query.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, by declining to answer, Berger appeared to
summarize the uncertainties of the Washington-Moscow relationship,
which was most recently buffeted by three days of intense arguments
in Helsinki, Finland, over where and how Russian troops should
operate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the Russian troop issue on Friday night was a
relief for the administration. But it remains to be seen how the
plan for the dispersal of Russian troops in Kosovo will be accepted
in Moscow, where politicians and the public alike felt humiliated
by the NATO airstrikes and where the Kosovo peace settlement
orchestrated by Victor Chernomyrdin was assailed as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said at the signing
ceremony in Helsinki that the agreement on the troops would benefit
overall American-Russian relations. But the dispatch of Russian
troops from Bosnia to the Pristina airport in the dead of night
exactly a week earlier _ apparently without Ivanov's knowledge _
showed that the foreign minister does not always speak for all the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Russians won concessions in the way their forces
will interact with NATO in Kosovo, including 16 Russian liaison
officers in the field and a Russian as commander of the Pristina
airport. A senior administration official said Saturday that the
agreement gave ``more broadly national Russian control'' over the
Russian troops than in Bosnia, where Russian forces also serve with
NATO. If broad disagreements develop beyond day-to-day tactics, the
Russians can dissent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki agreement states that ``all command arrangements
will preserve the principle of unity of command.'' But unlike the
arrangement in Bosnia, the paragraph in the Helsinki accord on
unity of command adds: ``This presumes that the Russian side
exercises full political and military control over the Russian
contingent.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration was eager to have the peacekeeping dispute
resolved before Yeltsin's arrival here at the conference of the
seven major industrialized nations and Russia, thus giving what one
senior administration official described as a ``reasonable prospect
of getting the core parts of the relationship back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But one inescapable issue for Washington is the flagging health
of Yeltsin, in whom the administration has vested much. Asked
several weeks ago whether Yeltsin would make it to the meeting in
Cologne, a Russian diplomat deadpanned: ``He's transportable.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision-making process in Russia, never crystal clear, has
also become even murkier of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deep questions in Russia, now penetrating the
administration, about Yeltsin's mental as well as physical
health,'' said Thomas Graham, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and a former American diplomat
who served in Moscow until 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more unreliable and erratic than he was three or four
months ago. There are a lot of doubts about whether he can make the
flight and then function effectively for three to four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Yeltsin does arrive in Cologne, administration
officials say they will be dealing with a leader whose attitude
toward the West is now pressed by increased anti-Western feelings
at home.
</P>
<P>
   A stark example of the anti-NATO sentiment from usually
pro-Western quarters came from Boris Fyodorov, the former chief of
the Federal Tax Service. Fyodorov, who helped organize a petition
to stop NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, said of the alliance:
``Nobody can assume the role of a policeman to the universe, to
murder people in the name of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   For reformist Russian politicians who favored Russia's becoming
a member of the Joint Permanent Council, an adjunct to NATO where
Russia is consulted on NATO issues, the war in Kosovo has been a
souring experience. Their argument for Russian participation in the
Permanent Council was based on the notion that NATO was a
defensive, not an offensive, alliance. ``Those Russians feel
burned,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to re-energize the relationship with Moscow, Clinton met
Saturday afternoon with the new Russian prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin. Before doing so, in keeping with the administration's
disposition to lavish praise on new Russian leaders who may be open
to Washington, Clinton said through an aide that he was ``extremely
impressed'' by the prime minister. The two were to meet with other
leaders at dinner Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin, Clinton plans to raise a longstanding menu of
standard issues, officials said. These are arms control, economic
reforms and nonproliferation, in particular what Washington argues
is Moscow's continued transfer of sensitive nuclear technology to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On arms control, Washington will continue to press for the
passage of the START II treaty and will explain again the rationale
for Clinton's announcement in the State of Union address that the
United States would pursue a national missile defense system.
Moscow has objected to Clinton's proposal on the ground that it
would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult issues arising at a bad time in
American-Russian relations,'' Graham said of arms control. ``Russia
needs to do it for financial reasons, but Russia can't for domestic
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   On economic progress in Russia, the picture is not so bleak,
administration officials said. Stepashin is moving on bank
restructuring, a key demand of the International Monetary Fund.
``There is a sense that Russia has played, overall, a constructive
role,'' one official said. ``People are going to want to be
forward-leaning and helpful, but in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this means that the IMF will probably be prepared to
release the first installment of a $4.5 billion loan next month,
the official said. The managing director of the fund, Michel
Camdessus, praised Russia last week for improved tax collections, a
slowing of inflation and an increase in business activity.
</P>
<P>
   If the first installment is released, there is a ``common
understanding'' among the seven industrialized nations here, the
official said, that scheduled Russian debt payments of $5.5 billion
should be deferred to the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But no decision was reached here about what to do in the longer
term with Russia's total debt of $155 billion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the continued transfer of nuclear technology, the United
States has placed sanctions on about a dozen institutes in Russia
that the administration contends have been involved in sending
scientists and selling nuclear know-how to Iran. These sanctions
prevent the institutions from doing business with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is one of the most difficult, American officials
said, because Washington cannot understand why Moscow would want to
have nearby Iran become a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   It is also difficult, administration officials said, to
determine whether the sale of the technology to Iran is government
policy or is yet another example of the breakdown of government
control in Russia that allows economic fiefs left over from the
Communist era to do what they want.

<P>
   In Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor's mythical Minnesota
community, the women are strong, the men are good looking and the
children are all above average. But who knew that those children
were pawns of standardized testing?
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, a country doctor in West Virginia, John
Cannell, was treating teen-age patients with self-esteem problems.
Although their school test scores showed them performing above
average, they were depressed about not doing well in class. When
tested on different test, by independent psychologists, the
children scored below average.
</P>
<P>
   Enlisting his staff as detectives, Cannell surveyed school
districts across the country and found that most of them reported
their students scoring above the national average on standardized
tests _ something that any high-school math student would dismiss
as statistically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Cannell's discovery, nicknamed the Lake Wobegon effect, set off
a furor over standardized testing as researchers confirmed what he
had discovered. Now an increasing number of states are adopting
high-stakes testing as a condition of high school graduation and to
reward or punish schools. Experts warn that the incentive to
massage test results is great, and that parents and children should
beware of the recurrence of Lake Wobegon effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be forgotten, but it is not gone,'' said Robert Linn, a
professor of education at the University of Colorado in Boulder,
who investigated Dr. Cannell's original findings.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways for scores to be artificially inflated, from
companies marketing old tests to outright cheating. There have even
been treatises on the politics of testing; how changing tests can
lower scores when mayors are elected or school superintendents are
appointed and raise them over the next few years so those in charge
can take the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Take New York City, the nation's biggest school district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani campaigned for re-election
touting a rise in reading scores of three percentage points, even
as his opponent, Ruth Messinger, scoffed that such a gain was
hardly cause to, as her press secretary put it, break out the
champagne. The mayor was celebrating results showing the school
system, with its high concentration of poor children and
immigrants, could produce results comparable to the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   That blissful picture was shattered recently when the Board of
Education announced the results of new tests, administered in
April. Last year, 49.6 percent of the city's elementary and middle
school students could read as well as the typical American student.
(By definition, 50 percent of all children should be reading better
than the typical student, and 50 percent worse.) This year, the
percentage of children reading at this level dropped suddenly, to
44.6. Math scores dropped 10 points, from well above the typical
level to a shade below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me guess,'' said Walter Haney, a professor and senior
research associate in the Center for the Study of Testing at Boston
College. ``They changed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, they did.
</P>
<P>
   New York City changed from one major battery of standardized
tests, the California Achievement Test, to another, the
Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills. The city also updated its
scoring, comparing schoolchildren to a national sample who took the
test in 1996, instead of 1991. The combination of new material and
a higher standard depressed the scores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Board of Education argued that scores had risen one
percentage point in reading, not dropped, using a method called
equating _ a statistical calculation designed compare old and new
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Most statisticians, though, say equating is deeply flawed and
valid in only the most narrow circumstances. In New York City's
case, the test publisher, CTB/McGraw-Hill, refused to endorse the
equating done by the city's Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   A national testing program, which President Clinton proposed in
his 1997 State of the Union message, would impose consistent
standards and dampen the Lake Wobegon effect. But many states have
balked, saying that a universal test would intrude on the tradition
of permitting school districts to set their own policy and
curriculum. As a compromise, Congress asked the National Academy of
Sciences to study whether the wide array of state and commercial
tests could be equated to one another _ or to the National
Assessment of Education Progress, which is the closest thing to a
nationwide test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conclusion was that it is really not feasible to develop a
common scale for those tests,'' said Dr. Michael Feuer, director of
the board on testing and assessment of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Some equations are simple, Feuer said. Visiting a friend in
Germany, you may learn that the temperature there is 30 degrees
Centigrade and easily convert it to Fahrenheit. But what if you
wanted to convert temperature to rainfall? Reading, like the
weather, is not measured by only one factor. That is the equating
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   As for New York City, Dr. Daniel Koretz, a senior social
scientist at Rand Education, a research group in Washington,
predicts that the latest results will soon be a distant memory.
Test scores will begin their inevitable rise again, he says, driven
by the growing familiarity of teachers with the test and an
outdated standard of grading.
</P>
<P>
   Cannell is now a forensic psychiatrist living in Los Osos,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real time-consuming task,'' he said last week of his
crusade to end the manipulation of test scores, ``and one that
brings me enemies, not friends. Politicians, test publishers,
schools, they just have too much to gain by having test scores that
are going up every year.''

for Sunday, June 20, 1999, moved Saturday.

<P>
   ON THE DRESS PAGE:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The phrase `compassionate
conservative' has been the subject of much discussion (and some
confusion) in recent days, as Republican leaders, watching George
W. Bush seek to dominate the presidential field, consider exactly
it means, and how it applies to this race: is there, for example, a
compassionate conservative view on gun control or abortion rights
or gay rights or even the nation's China policy? By Adam Nagourney.
(`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   BALKANS-REBUILD-REVIEW (Undated) _ NATO's goal of rebuilding the
Balkans is questionable. That is because, barring the sudden
disappearance of Slobodan Milosevic, the West is proposing to
rebuild the area without rebuilding Serbia, the country at the
Balkans' heart. By Alison Smale. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   TEST-SCORES-REVIEW (Undated) _ There are many ways for scores to
be artificially inflated, from companies marketing old tests to
outright cheating. There have even been treatises on the politics
of testing; how changing tests can lower scores when mayors are
elected or school superintendents are appointed and raise them over
the next few years so those in charge can take the credit. By
Anemona Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERGUN-SUBSIDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Pentagon is
subsidizing the civilian market for a long-range, semiautomatic
50-caliber rifle, a military weapon designed to destroy armored
vehicles and aircraft, according to Democrats on a House panel. The
Pentagon sells surplus ammunition at a discount to a West Virginia
company that markets the half-inch-thick bullets to the public via
retailers, some of whom offer the shells for sale on the Internet.
By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DANGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For many computer users, the
infectious Explore worm marked the end of trust in the virtual
world. Most people already knew that it was dangerous to trust
strangers in cyberspace, just as it is in the physical world. The
worm, however, masquerading as e-mail from a friend, raised the
specter that it might no longer be possible to trust friends
either. Cyberspace, once thought of as the world's most cozy
community, has quickly become a lonely, infinite expanse where
computer outlaws programs lurk. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP-IMPLANTS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ In a bizarre case that unfolded
in Boston last week, reputed mobster Vincent Marino sued to find
out whether the DEA had secretly implanted him with a microchip
tracking device. But the case may not be as strange as it sounds. A
European company already claims to have implanted at least 45
people with such chips, all either willing adults or children of
millionaires who were worried about the possibility of kidnapping.
By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The defeat in Congress of a
bill making it a felony to expose children to books, movies and
video games that contain explicit sex or violence has not quelled
the debate among public and school libraries. The American Library
Association is tracking complaints from adult readers who are are
scolding librarians for the violence in books like John Steinbeck's
`Of Mice and Men' or Alvin Schwartz's `More Scary Stories to Tell
in the Dark.' By Doreen Carvajal. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Some Fed watchers say Chairman
Alan Greenspan has been more a pragmatic opportunist than a
watchful waiter, taking clever advantage of special circumstances
like falling oil prices and spikes in productivity. Others say he
was been more lucky than good. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   DC-INTERNS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Congress and the White House
have produced handbooks for interns with advice about handling the
difficulties that can arise in Washington. Each was written well
before the need for such guidebooks became glaringly apparent. In
that regard, the manuals seem prescient, even wise, double
entendres notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-INTERVIEWS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Job seekers' critical and
sometimes humorous assessments of their corporate recruiters:
quotations collected in a written survey of college seniors and
post-graduates.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with Einstein's brain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-MILITARY-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ Latin America's armies
are down but not out. But these are trying times for soldiers
throughout the region. Government spending is declining even faster
than the prestige of a military career. In virtually every country
the armed forces confront the question of what is their role now
that they are no longer the dominant force in their societies? By
Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (Srinigar, Kashmir) _ In the wake of the
Kosovo, awareness is growing in Washington and other capitals that
the world pays a high price for waiting too long to address
mounting crises. The India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir is among
the most combustible, and the fact that both contending nations
have nuclear weapons lends it an apocalyptic urgency. It is now
drawing more serious attention than at any time since it started.

worm, however, masquerading as e-mail from a friend, raised the
specter that it might no longer be possible to trust friends
either. Cyberspace, once thought of as the world's most cozy
community, has quickly become a lonely, infinite expanse where
computer outlaws programs lurk. By John Markoff.

   CHIP-IMPLANTS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ In a bizarre case that unfolded
in Boston last week, reputed mobster Vincent Marino sued to find
out whether the DEA had secretly implanted him with a microchip

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ With the last Yugoslav forces streaming
out of Kosovo ahead of schedule, NATO commanders here have reached
a tentative agreement with Kosovar Albanian rebel leaders to
gradually disband the Kosovo Liberation Army as an organized
military force, NATO officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which must still be signed by NATO and the
group's leaders, the rebels will have to withdraw from fortified
positions held during their civil war against Yugoslav forces, turn
over their heavy weapons, shed their uniforms and cease any
organized military activities within a 30-day period.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials led by a British officer, Brig. Gen. Jonathan
Bailey, have held a series of meetings at undisclosed locations
with various commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has an
opaque and disparate leadership structure. NATO officials refused
to disclose the identities of the rebel commanders, saying they
were being withheld at the rebels' request.
</P>
<P>
   While they have reached a tentative agreement, the disparate and
sometimes competitive nature of the commanders of the rebel force
has complicated the completion of the accord, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of
Britain, is eager to initial the agreement with the group's leaders
as soon as possible, according to a NATO spokesman, Maj. Jan
Joosten. Once that happens, NATO's ambassadors in Brussels,
Belgium, are expected to move quickly to give it final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would come into force tomorrow,'' a NATO official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came as Yugoslavia's army and special police
continued to withdraw rapidly from the province, turning over more
and more territory to NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, only 3,000 to 5,000 of the roughly 40,000
Serb-dominated forces deployed in Kosovo during the war remained.
NATO officials here said they expected the last would leave by late
Saturday or early Sunday, well ahead of the midnight Sunday
deadline agreed to by Yugoslav generals on June 9. Their departure
will effectively end Serbian control over a province considered to
be Serbia's cultural and historical cradle.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO officials have portrayed the withdrawal as a smooth
one, the task of moving such a large force _ including hundreds of
tanks, armored personnel vehicles and all other manner of military
vehicles _ proved overwhelming to the Yugoslav commanders. They
have left dozens of vehicles and weapons behind in Kosovo,
providing NATO with an inventory and asking permission to retrieve
them later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was logistically impossible to get them all out,'' said
Joosten, the NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Yugoslav army would likely return for the vehicles
soon, under NATO escort. ``We don't want to get stuck guarding
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops, now 17,000 strong, have moved into every major city
in Kosovo and are slowly expanding their military presence. Late
Friday, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen reached an
agreement with Russian officials, including the defense minister,
Marshal Igor Sergeyev, to add 3,600 Russian troops to NATO's
peacekeeping force, which will ultimately total more than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will deploy troops in the American, German and French
sectors in Kosovo and control the grounds of Pristina airport,
while leaving air control to NATO forces. The agreement resolved
the embarrassing impasse created a week ago when some 200 Russians
seized the airport west of Pristina hours before the first NATO
troops could arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met Saturday at the airport with the commander of the
Russian forces, Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, to work out how to
integrate the Russian soldiers into the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman here, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, said he expected
the airport to open within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO troops amassing and the last Yugoslav forces leaving,
NATO is now focusing its attention on expanding security. Ever
since the first peacekeepers arrived, the presence of heavily armed
fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, as much as the retreating
Serbs, has been the biggest threat to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group's leaders have by and large cooperated with
NATO's peacekeepers, the group has taken over what passes for
political and civil authority in the battered province.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every town, including the provincial capital,
Pristina, the group's red-and-black flag now flies from checkpoints
and ``official'' buildings, guarded by fighters dressed in
camouflage or entirely in black.
</P>
<P>
   Their increasingly brash presence has prompted tens of thousands
of civilian Serbs to flee Kosovo, despite entreaties from NATO and
U.N. officials to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia began in March, the group
agreed to lay down their arms during peace talks in Rambouillet,
France, as part of a deal ultimately rejected by President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   With no agreement in place after the bombing stopped, NATO's
interaction with the KLA has been guarded and inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren, German troops quickly established a delicate
coexistence with the group that allowed them to keep their weapons,
mostly AK-47s and other rifles, but on Friday they arrested 25
fighters involved in beating Serbian civilians and Gypsies and,
beginning Saturday, have vowed to confiscate weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few miles to the east, U.S. troops began confiscating the
rebels' weapons from the start, disarming an entire company in the
village of Zegra on Thursday. A day after that incident, by
contrast, French troops allowed a large contingent to march,
heavily armed, into Srbica, northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren on Saturday, KLA weapons and nearly all the uniforms
seen on the streets in the past week disappeared overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in keeping with the agreement reached between the
regional KLA leader known as Cmdr. Drini and the Germans, the
swaggering presence of the victorious rebels evaporated abruptly at
midnight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prizren seemed to be struggling to return to normal, with young
people _ now in civilian clothes _ thronging the square near the
old mosque and filling the outdoor tables at cafes. Shopkeepers
reopened, many of them busily replacing shattered plate-glass
windows. Somewhat inexplicably, stores displaying wedding gowns
appeared undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a quiet night and now the situation is quiet,'' said
Sgt. Maj. Johann Fritsch, a German military spokesman. ``We are
confiscating weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a long tradition in Kosovo of keeping weapons
at home, and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas may have simply put
their guns in safe keeping.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not carrying their guns. A few managed to retain a
big hunting knife or empty pistol holster as a symbol of military
prowess, but even the guards at the gate of the former Serbian
officers' club, now a symbol of the rebels' takeover, were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   At the town's main intersection, German infantrymen maintained a
roadblock, stopping cars driven by Albanian men in any remnant of
military garb, and searching for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part these exchanges seemed friendly, ending in
handshakes and thumbs-up signs. When something was found _ such as
an ammunition vest with pouches of AK-47 assault-rifle clips early
Saturday afternoon _ a German soldier recorded the find on a list
and wrote a receipt, which he courteously gave to the Albanian man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later what the receipt was for, the German soldier
shrugged, threw up his hands and rolled his eyes skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the return of Kosovo Albanian refugees continued in
huge numbers. On Friday, nearly 25,000 people crossed back over
into Kosovo, 14,500 from Albania and about 10,000 from Macedonia,
said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees. Four of the tent cities in Kukes, Albania, which only
a week ago were packed with crowds of refugees, have closed down.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 75,000 refugees have returned from Albania in the last
four days alone, and the pace from Macedonia appears to be picking
up.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials have been trying to slow the numbers because of
worry about mines or booby traps _ and on Saturday the medical
charity Doctors Without Borders said it had documented six cases of
land mines or booby traps exploding. Near Srbica, one man was
seriously injured when he detonated a booby trap by taking laundry
off a clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agreement on disarming the KLA rebels is said by NATO
officials to mirror the one signed by representatives of Kosovo's
Albanians during the peace talks in France in March. It would
require the rebels, now thought to number as many as 17,000, to
disband within a month and start training to become a police force
for the province.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the agreement would require that the rebels
respect a cease-fire with the retreating Serbs. They would also
have to stay more than a mile from the main roads and from NATO's
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Within four days, the rebels would withdraw from the fortified
positions they held during the conflict. After seven days, the
rebels have to begin to turn over their heavy weapons, including
those of 12.7-mm or larger caliber. By the end of 30 days, they
must disband as an organized force. ``It's a positive sign that
they're willing to allow NATO to be the only military presence in
Kosovo,'' Joosten said.

<P>
   NAUCALPAN, Mexico _ The fatal shooting of a young municipal
worker this week by a police officer here provoked a rampage of
partisan violence that could affect the outcome of closely watched
gubernatorial elections next month in Mexico's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, union activists loyal to President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party attacked municipal police in this
industrial suburb governed by the opposition, vowing to avenge the
killing by police the day before. The violence suggests that police
abuse is likely to be a potent campaign theme as Mexico moves
toward presidential balloting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Naucalpan is a city of 1 million residents in the state of
Mexico, a region of smoky factories and gritty slums adjoining
Mexico City. The state has for 70 years been governed by Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial elections are scheduled for July 4, and Jose Luis
Duran, who two years ago won election as Naucalpan's first
opposition mayor, has taken a leave of absence to run as the
candidate of the pro-business National Action Party, called PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide opinion surveys show Duran to be closing a modest lead
held by Ricardo Montiel, the PRI candidate. Higinio Martinez, the
candidate of a leftist party, is running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates have sought to capitalize on public
distress over crime and police corruption, which are rampant all
across Mexico and which no party has battled with much success.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, two Naucalpan police officers attempted
to detain Mauricio Martinez Hernandez, a 25-year-old city
waterworks employee, and one of the officers shot him dead when he
attempted to flee, in disputed circumstances. Naucalpan's acting
mayor said in an interview Saturday that the killing followed a
dispute between Martinez and the officer over a woman; local PRI
leaders insist the shooting occurred after Martinez resisted police
attempts to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   Angry residents gathered around Martinez's body, the officers
fled in their squad car, and local PRI leaders, shouting at the
crowd, immediately blamed the killing on Duran. Within hours of the
shooting, thousands of handbills headlined ``Killer Police, Duran's
Legacy!'' were being distributed across the state of Mexico. In one
city north of Naucalpan, state police officers were seen
distributing the leaflets, National Action officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, during a public display of Martinez's coffin in the
Naucalpan plaza, leaders of his union, which is affiliated with the
PRI, urged about 1,000 municipal workers to take vengeance. Some
300 laid siege to the Naucalpan police headquarters and city hall,
shattering windows with rocks and engaging in hand-to-hand combat
with 500 helmeted riot police officers, some of whom appeared to
have fired their service revolvers. Several officers were dragged
away from police lines, disarmed and beaten. One officer's leg was
broken.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people, including seven officers, were injured and
at least one union worker was wounded by gunfire. Five police cars
were destroyed, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Naucalpan's police have arrested the officer accused of shooting
Martinez. The other is a fugitive. The investigation of the death,
however, appears most likely to be caught up in the partisan
warfare, because jurisdiction falls to state detectives who work
for the PRI governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Naucalpan violence took center stage in the campaign for the
governorship, Mexico's most important electoral contest before
presidential balloting next year. But it was not immediately clear
who would be hurt and who would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the killing of Martinez, Montiel had been under fire from
human rights groups because, in positioning himself as a
law-and-order candidate who can crack down on crime, he recently
began airing ads that say, ``Human rights are for humans, not for
rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the killing has put Duran on the defensive by raising
questions about how much progress he has made in efforts to
professionalize the Naucalpan police, which have been a centerpiece
of his campaign. In an interview Saturday, he said he had purged
500 corrupt officers from the city's 1,800-officer force during his
two years in office, and had founded a police academy to train new
recruits. Naucalpan, he said, ``is the city in the state of Mexico
that has made the most strides in controlling crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lamentable act, that a young man dies at the hands
of the police,'' he said. ``But the violence we've seen here is an
utterly irresponsible political manipulation by the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Vasquez Castillo, president of the PRI in the state of
Mexico, shot back, ``With their diatribes, Duran and the PAN are
just trying to divert attention from a homicide for which they're
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the desperate tactics of a candidate who's tried to
sell the image that he's created a pristine police force in
Naucalpan,'' Vasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, much of the Naucalpan plaza was still spattered with
blood, and dozens of police on horseback were patrolling the
streets. Curtains flapped in the empty window frames of the
shattered police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen riot police officers were holding defensive
positions in the lobby of the city hall. Upstairs, Alejandro
Gutierrez Gutierrez, a National Action city councilman who in
Duran's absence is Naucalpan's acting mayor, was huddled in his
office, looking beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for the PRI to call on people to commit
aggressions against authorities or to try to take over a police
station by force,'' he said. ``They've called out their
neighborhood organizations, the street vendors, the taxi drivers,
all to create tensions before the elections. I think they're
putting our political system at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the plaza, David Parra Sanchez, a leader of the
PRI-affiliated municipal workers union, was addressing 200
municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there's total insecurity in Naucalpan,''
he shouted. ``The police are murdering our young people, and when
we protest, they say we're politicizing the murder. Was Mauricio
Martinez's death political?''

U.S. AIMS TO HAVE 5 PERCENT OF ELECTRICITY FROM WIND BY 2020 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.D., S.D., Wyo., Minn., Iowa, Vt.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says he will
announce Monday a plan to produce 5 percent of the nation's
electricity from wind by 2020, up from 0.1 percent now. Under the
plan, the federal government, the nation's largest electricity
customer, would rely on wind for 5 percent of its use by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that wind technology has the most potential of any
renewable energy technology right now,'' Richardson said in a
telephone interview. The other leading renewable contenders are
electricity from the sun or from biomass, including crop wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts agree that wind is the closest to being
competitive in price. Charles McGowin, the team leader for
renewable energy at the Electric Power Research Institute, of Palo
Alto, Calif., a utility consortium, said, ``There's a lot of
untapped wind potential in the United States, particularly in the
upper great Plains, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota and
Minnesota and Iowa.'' One problem, though, is that transmission
lines will have to be built if wind machines become widespread
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials say wind turbines, the industry's preferred
term for windmills, are good cash producers for farmers, who can
graze cattle or grow crops in their shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who will make the plan public in a speech to the
American Wind Energy Association's annual meeting, in Burlington,
Vt., said the department would seek to ``merge technology with good
commercialization.''
</P>
<P>
   The department will take steps like encouraging ``wind-friendly
codes and covenants,'' investing money in research and development,
and encouraging vocational schools to help train ``wind smiths.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, about 2,500 megawatts of capacity are
expected to be in service by the end of June, up from about 1,600
megawatts a year ago. The difference, 900 megawatts, is about the
capacity of one medium-size nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Corp. began construction in May of a 16.5-megawatt plant
in California to meet demand for ``green power'' there. The company
expects that, as the power market there is deregulated, customers
will choose clean power.
</P>
<P>
   Several projects are scheduled for completion by June 30, when a
federal tax credit of 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour expires. The
Clinton administration is seeking a renewal for projects completed
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a kilowatt-hour from wind has declined to about 5
cents, said Dan Reicher, assistant secretary for energy efficiency
and renewable energy. It was as high as 40 cents when the federal
government first pushed wind turbines for electricity production
during the oil crises of the 1970s. Combined with the production
tax credit, the price is low enough to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The department believes that the cost of production must fall to
between 2 cents and 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour to succeed in the
first decades of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The average American residential consumer pays about 7 cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is enough energy to light a 75-watt bulb for
13 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has made large strides on cost, though, partly by
increasing the size of its machines. The first turbines were a few
kilowatts, good for a house or two; now they are 1,000 times
larger. The biggest being installed now are 1.65 megawatts, with
blades the length of the wings on a Boeing 727, but engineers are
drawing plans for turbines of up to 4 megawatts in capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of price cuts is improvements in electronics.
Blades used to have to turn at a fixed rate to make alternating
current at the strict 60 cycles per second required; now they can
turn at whatever rate the wind pushes them, and the energy is
electronically converted to 60 cycles. Wind machines now cost $900
to $1,200 per kilowatt to install; the Energy Department expects
the price to decline to $625 a kilowatt by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Direct comparisons of construction costs with coal or natural
gas plants are difficult, because those plants can operate 24 hours
a day, but wind turbines operate only when the wind is blowing.
Wind turbines typically produce only a little more than one-third
of the amount of electricity that would result from operation 24
hours a day at 100 percent operation. But ``once you're up and
running, there is no fuel cost and the maintenance cost is
negligible as well,'' said Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the wind
association.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change since the 1970s, one helpful to wind, is that
states are deregulating their electricity systems, and the
manufacturing of power by independent producers, as opposed to
utilities, will soon be the norm, many industry executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities were never very enthusiastic about building wind
capacity themselves, but soon they will not be building any
capacity of any sort, and when the utilities are buying all their
electricity from independent plants running on coal or natural gas,
then buying power from a wind farm will not be much different,
experts say.

NEWS ANALYSIS: IN WORDS, GORE AND BUSH STAKE OUT MIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush,
declaring their candidacies for president, sound as though they are
proclaiming the primary campaign over, the general election begun
and the battleground designated as the moderate middle, with
ideological extremes out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who announced in Carthage, Tenn., on Wednesday, and Bush,
who did so in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last Saturday, spoke as if they
were using the same pollsters and some of the same speechwriters.
</P>
<P>
   There were major structural differences, to be sure. In
Carthage, Gore had dozens of quite specific proposals, both because
that is the sort of person he is, and because he wanted to contrast
his experience with Bush's. Gore described himself as ``a leader
who has been tested.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cedar Rapids, Bush said that the time had not come for
``10-point plans'' and that he knew being governor of Texas ``isn't
the same as being president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has one singular reason to avoid specifics early: There is
a large Republican field ready to pick his proposals apart.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they did not engage over detail, Gore and Bush were
fighting over much of the same ground. Both opposed drugs in
schools. Both promised to involve religious organizations in social
welfare programs. Both supported foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Gore boasted that ``America now has the
strongest economy in the history of the United States,'' but said
that was not enough, but merely a foundation from which to ``make
family life work in America, for the issue is not only our standard
of living, but our standards in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, while saying the Clinton administration ``did not invent
prosperity any more than they invented the Internet,'' said
American prosperity had to amount to more than ``simple
materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity must have a greater purpose,'' he said. It has to
provide ``men and women who work hard, dream big, love their
family, serve their neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement speech used to be the one occasion when a
would-be president could count on getting his message of why he
should be president out, relatively undiluted by analysis of his
motives or chances.
</P>
<P>
   That exposure is less certain today, in large part because
candidates seek to have so many bites of the political apple, from
announcing an intention to form an exploratory committee, to
announcing the committee, to announcing the plan to announce, to
the announcement itself. Indeed, Bush tried to reserve a later bite
last Saturday. Even though he said, ``I am running for president;
there is no turning back,'' he also maintained, ``I'll have a
formal announcement sometime in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But an announcement speech still offers an opportunity to define
a campaign, as Ronald Reagan did in 1979 when he quoted John
Winthrop's line in establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony in
1630, ``We shall be as a city upon a hill,'' and promised to lead a
nation out of the pessimism he accused President Carter of
inflicting upon it. Or as George McGovern did in promising in 1971
to withdraw every American soldier from Vietnam, or as Bill Clinton
did in 1991 saying he would ``fight for the forgotten middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only each candidate, but each kind of candidacy, has a
formula.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing a challenge to an incumbent of one's own party, as
Reagan did in 1975 and Edward M. Kennedy did in 1979, requires
saying the president has failed his party's ideal. Running against
the other party's president if the economy is strong requires a
speech so good no one _ certainly not Walter Mondale in 1983 or Bob
Dole in 1995 _ has written it yet.
</P>
<P>
   But the demands of running when a vice president of an
administration with a successful economy seeks to succeed a
president whose popularity is wearing thin are special _ and both
speeches in the last few days owe a lot to the announcement speech
of the last vice president in such a situation, George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For example, though Gore used the word ``Clinton'' but twice,
Vice President Bush said ``Reagan'' only once. Both vice presidents
bragged on the economy. Just as Bush was running against ``an
economy buffeted by incompetence and intrusion'' he said Carter
left behind seven years before, Gore recalled ``deep recession and
high unemployment,'' and said, ``We remember what it was like seven
years ago and I never want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to distance himself from the worst part of his
administration's image, his president's scandals, by promising to
use the nation's ``moral leadership to fight for America's
families.'' He said, ``I will take my own values of faith and
family to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Bush confronted the worst of the Reagan
administration's image when he said: ``Where is it written that
Republicans must act as if they do not care, as if they are not
moved? I say to my fellow Republicans: We are the party of Lincoln.
Our whole history was protecting those who needed our protection
and making this a kinder nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's son played against the Republican image, too, when he
defended his own commitment to ``compassionate conservatism,'' and
asked: ``Is compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our
party be led by someone who boasts a hard heart? I know Republicans
_ across the country _ are generous of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other, perhaps familial, similarities of phrasing.
Bush said ``prosperity must have a purpose.'' His father had said
``prosperity with a purpose means giving back to the country that
has given you so much.'' The younger Bush said, ``I'm running
hard''; the elder Bush said, ``I mean to run hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes and Gore, too, to give a message of inclusiveness,
spoke a few words in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Differences of approach will become clearer as Bush's policies
become clearer. The most precise promise he made in his
announcement speech was to see to it that Head Start, the
pre-school program for poor children, would ``teach our youngest
children phonics,'' the method of teaching reading that relies on
the sounds of letters.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a distinct difference in their attitudes toward
the role of government, though not the chasm that exists between
the caricatures each party sketches of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``government can help'' make schools safer and make
examples of bad behavior. He said, ``government should do a few
things and do them well.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Gore said no legislation and no president could
replace parents as moral guides to their children, he offered a
list of things government should do:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Making high-quality pre-school available to every child in
every community all across the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding ``community policing, with more cops walking the
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Amending the family leave law so parents could leave work for
parent-teacher meetings and children's medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enacting a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping ``seniors pay for the prescription drugs they need.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Gore gave 15 specifics for government action in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican presidential contenders have struck more
combative, ideologically charged notes in their announcement
speeches. Patrick Buchanan, the conservative commentator, for
example, urged his followers to ``mount up and ride to the sound of
guns,'' while vowing to protect the rights ``of the innocent
unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another conservative, announced his candidacy
shortly after the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and
criticized American culture, saying it ``glorifies death in a
thousand ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle also cited the culture wars in
his announcement. Referring to a famous speech he gave as vice
president, in which he lambasted the values of American popular
culture, Quayle noted, ``Murphy Brown is gone and I'm still here
fighting for the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley, has
not given a formal announcement speech but has tackled broad
subjects like race in his appearances. His stands on most issues do
not contrast sharply with Gore's.

COURTS IN LOS ANGELES HELP FIGHT GANG CRIME WITH INJUNCTIONS
BARRING GATHERINGS 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Incongruously close to some of this city's most
affluent neighborhoods and a shell's throw from touristy Venice
Beach and the azure Pacific, a gang war has played out over a
decade, in which dozens have been killed and scores wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, driven in part by racial differences and in part
by the desire to control the drug trade in Venice Beach, began in
earnest on Thanksgiving Day, 1993. Members of the mostly Hispanic
Culver City Boys gang, whose main turf is in the Mar Vista
neighborhood, firebombed the homes of black families in the Mar
Vista Gardens housing project and set fire to the cars of at least
12 members of a black gang known as the Venice Shoreline Crips.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two rival gangs have become the latest targets in the
increasing use here of public nuisance laws to combat street gangs,
after a series of court rulings backed the views of law enforcement
over those of civil liberties advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles became the first city to use a civil injunction to
combat gang crime in 1987, but six years passed before it secured a
second. Now, as the city adds more lawyers dedicated solely to
developing cases for court injunctions that would keep gang members
from gathering in public, the authorities have sought and received
six such court orders in the last two years. Two of them, including
one covering 75 members of the Culver City Boys, have come in the
last two months and a hearing on yet another, which would cover 38
members of the Venice Shoreline Crips, is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the Police Department has seen the results and likes
this technique and is very supportive of it,'' said Jim Hahn, the
Los Angeles city attorney. ``I think that's the reason we're doing
more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the broad Chicago ordinance struck down this month by the
U.S. Supreme Court, which made it a crime to linger in the presence
of a suspected gang member after the police had issued an order to
move on, Los Angeles' injunctions names gang members and accuses
them of being involved in gang activity. The court orders usually
cover only the gang's neighborhood, and in addition to barring
members from gathering in public, they prohibit them from warning
others of approaching police officers or carrying pagers and impose
a 10 p.m. curfew on them.
</P>
<P>
   The injunctions also give the police probable cause to stop and
search members named in the court order at any time. Gang members
found guilty of violating the injunctions can be ordered to pay
fines or serve time in jail, and probationers can be returned to
prison to serve the remainder of a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California
challenged the injunctions on the ground that they were too broad,
the California Supreme Court rejected the argument, in 1997. While
opponents continue to criticize the injunctions and question the
authorities assertions of success in using them to combat gangs,
they acknowledge that their legal challenges have been unsuccessful
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are concerned about the proliferation of gang
injunctions here in Los Angeles, particularly since crime is way
down, as it is in most places,'' said Ramona Ripston, the executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California. ``But legally, there doesn't seem to be much that one
can do to stop this proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in Los Angeles is the lowest in 20 years, but
gang murders account for more than a third of the homicides here
each year _ perhaps unsurprising in a city with 400 gangs and
64,000 gang members, more than any other city in the nation, say
experts on street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The city sought injunctions against the Culver City Boys and the
Venice Shoreline Crips after 11 gang members and bystanders were
killed in the summer of 1997. In an attempt to end the conflict,
the orders bar each gang's members from being seen together on
rival turf as well as on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Culver City Boys and representatives of
the Venice Shoreline Crips declined to be interviewed for this
story.
</P>
<P>
   There are 22 unsolved slayings in which members of the Culver
City Boys are the lead suspects, according to court records. One
member was a suspect in several killings and was charged in two.
The charges were dropped after witnesses recanted, the police said.
One man was beaten and kicked to death by at least 10 Culver gang
members in 1996; the police were not called for half an hour and no
one was convicted of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after the 11 gang-related deaths, the Los Angeles City
Council offered $10,000 rewards for information leading to an
arrest in each homicide. No reward has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   Police statements filed in court in support of the injunction
against the Venice Shoreline gang said gang and family life are
sometimes so intertwined that some residents let members flee
through their homes, closing the gates on police officers in
pursuit. But the declarations also said that some residents were so
fearful that their homes would be firebombed or that they would be
shot by the Shoreline Crips that they did not answer the door when
the police arrived to investigate a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say they hope the injunction will eliminate
intimidation of witnesses in the prosecution of gang crimes by
making police officers the chief witnesses against gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn, the city attorney, said gang-related crime had decreased
in every neighborhood where an injunction had been issued,
sometimes by half. Critics say that can be attributed to the
nationwide drop in crime rates and the addition of nearly 2,000
police officers in Los Angeles in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Klein, a professor emeritus at the University of
Southern California and an expert on gangs, said the injunctions
appear to strengthen the fabric of gang life.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 members of the Culver City Boys sat quietly in a
courtroom earlier this month as Judge Patricia Collins granted the
injunction against them. Two days later, Mar Vista Gardens was
covered in the gang's freshly spray-painted markings ``CXC'' and
implied death threats against members of the Los Angeles Police
Department and the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ruben Lopez said that gang members had told him they would
not commit any more crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, we haven't been able to gauge that yet,'' he
said.

CORONET BEING RESTORED TO 1800S GLORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Me., Md., R.I.)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ If a boat could look like a homeless waif, the
133-foot schooner Coronet is a ragamuffin of the high seas. But
beneath its scruffy exterior is a sailboat as vital to U.S.
yachting history as a national monument is to the American
archives.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the snubbed stem where a graceful bowsprit once
jutted. Ignore the boxy-looking wheelhouse on a deck that never
knew clutter. Try to overlook the absence of a rig where two masts
once soared to 135 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The porcelain sinks that fold up like closed scallop shells are
still affixed to its cabin interiors. The dark, richly carved
panels of rare mahogany still line bulkhead walls between six
gracious staterooms.
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune was missing, however, when it came to the polished
marble steps of the main saloon. They are gone now. So too is the
brass chandelier, the writing desk and the open-tiled fireplace.
But most any part of a boat can be replaced or rebuilt at the
International Yacht Restoration School here. At least, that's the
attitude that prevails when it comes to Coronet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the U.S.S. Constitution is to the U.S. Navy, the Coronet
is to yachting,'' said John Mecray, a marine artist who has helped
spearhead a campaign to restore Coronet to its 19th-century
eminence. ``There is no second.''
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition including photos and artifacts from the partially
denuded yacht is scheduled to open June 26 at the Newport Art
Museum. Entitled ``Coronet: An Air of Greatness,'' the three-month
show precedes a fund-raising effort for the yacht.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, Coronet was the flagship of the New
York Yacht Club. Built entirely of thick-planked oak and pine in
1885 by Rufus T. Bush, a club member, the yacht was designed for
global voyages. It was built at the former Poillon Brothers
boatyard in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1887, in its trans-Atlantic racing debut, Coronet defeated
the famous 123-foot schooner Dauntless by more than 30 hours. The
14-day passage from New York to Ireland was widely publicized.
Then, under a series of eight owners, the vessel circled the globe
to great fanfare. In 1888, it was the first registered yacht to
round Cape Horn, at the tip of South America, from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   It sailed in 1895 on a scientific expedition to Japan for
Amherst College when owned by Arthur Curtiss James, a former club
commodore. In 1905, the Kingdom, a nondenominational Christian
group based in Maine, bought Coronet to ferry its missionaries
around the world. Four years ago, the group gave Coronet to the
yacht restoration school.
</P>
<P>
   Of special significance at the exhibit will be three models of
Coronet on loan from the New York Yacht Club's main clubhouse in
Manhattan. The display is designed to broaden public awareness of
the boat, which Mecray said will cost about $7 million to restore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expresses an age that has vanished,'' Peter Stanford,
president of the National Maritime Historical Society, said by
telephone from Peekskill, N.Y. ``It is about ship design, and how
people of that time spent their money. She has traveled so much of
the globe, in voyages for scientific, religious and recreational
purposes. She wraps up so much of our relationship with the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   As many as 250 sailboats are expected to race beginning Monday
in Block Island Race Week. Organized for 18 years by the Storm
Trysail Club, the five-day Rhode Island Sound regatta includes
yachts from 24 to 60 feet. One-design class competitions take
precedence this year over boats sailing under grand prix handicap
rules. More than 70 sailboats are racing in closed one-design
classes such as J-29, J-35, J-44, J-80, J-105, J-120, Farr 40 and
ID35.
</P>
<P>
   Three sailboats broke the Annapolis to Newport Race record last
week. Finishing first, and setting a course record of 47 hours 45
minutes, was Chessie Racing, a 70-foot yacht skippered by George
Collins of Annapolis, Md.

THE TAMING OF A RALLY RANKLES THE BIKERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ Every summer, when several hundred thousand
motorcyclists roar into this lakeside town for the grand-daddy of
all biker bashes, Deborah Gagman, a k a the exotic dancer Autumn
Blaze, poses happily in the crowd with all who ask, positioning her
pasties for best photographic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   This year was different. When, on Thursday, Ms. Gagman pulled
forward the suspenders that were all that was covering the Harley
Davidson patches that were all that was covering her secondary
sexual characteristics (and primary professional assets), she found
herself facing a $250 citation for ``inciting the crowd,'' her
outraged manager, Lee Blais, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such strictness, declared Blais, is utterly out of place in the
rough-and-tumble atmosphere of this bacchanalian June motorcycle
week. ``These are  &UR; bikers &LR; '' he said. If town officials ``are
trying to make this Disneyland, they've got a long way to go. This
is never going to be Disneyland. Look around you!''
</P>
<P>
   Not Disneyland, certainly not; too many nipple rings. Still, for
all that this great gathering is the essence of subculture, replete
with enough black leather to jacket every soldier in the standing
U.S. armed forces and enough fringe to line the Brooklyn Bridge, it
is not so far removed from the cultural currents of mainstream
America, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: This year, the small city of Laconia, population about
17,000, is enforcing a new woman-protecting,
quality-of-life-protecting ordinance that bars women from
displaying their breasts in public and anyone from encouraging them
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, it seems, is that Laconia's motorcycle week has
become known for a certain habit among beer-happy men to encourage
women to flash their upper bodies by shouting various rude
variations on ``Show us your breasts!'' Some women comply, which
fuels the problem for those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my big issues is violence against women,'' said Laconia
Police Chief William Baker, who issued the first citation under the
new ordinance to Ms. Gagman. ``And I'm afraid with these sexual
contests in bars, these drunk men observe these things in a bar and
then they stumble out onto the street and assume every woman is
also a contestant. And there are a lot of women on the street being
treated in ways they're not happy about.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two major national motorcycle gatherings each year, in
Sturgis, S.D., and Daytona Beach, Fla., are not known as paragons
of decorum either, but Laconia's reputation, many bikers say, has
been the rowdiest. An image, say its organizers and hosts, that
needs to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Laconia rally, at 76, is the oldest of the major motorcycle
gatherings, but its name took on a tinge of infamy in 1965, when a
riot erupted that involved the National Guard. In general,
old-timers recall, those gatherings in the '60s were wild indeed.
``It was, like, serious party, like, insane stuff, but it's
mellowed, it's become a business for a lot of people,'' said Joseph
Delio, better known as Papa Joe, an ex-biker minister who offered
blessings to several dozen motorcyclists Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bikers of that era are grandparents now, and the
country has changed, and so has motorcycling. It is a mass-market
sport, not the Hell's Angels specialty it used to seem _ though
Hell's Angels still show up at the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   If Laconia is any indication, about as many women ride their own
motorcycles as are passengers. And bikers range from teens to
octogenarians, from gang members to lawyers, from walking tattoo
canvases to wholesome Tommy Hilfiger models.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the times, the Laconia gathering, for all its
intense racing, arm-wrestling, drinking, bike-inspecting, seeing
and being seen, has also clearly become a serious business: for the
corporate sponsors, for the hundreds of vendors, for the
townspeople of Laconia, even for New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen,
who talks about insuring ``a safe family week'' in the event's
official bulletin. It is too big to be spoiled by what Charlie St.
Clair, its chief organizer, calls a few idiots, generally not even
bikers but locals, who harassed women.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the ordinance might not be construed as a stab at
political correctness in the most un-PC of crowds, he responded,
``How is that PC, when you're stopping a person from grabbing
somebody? From shouting at them? No one has the right to do that to
another person on a public street. It offends me as a human being
to see that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Clair's sentiment does not seem to be shared among the
motorcycle multitudes gathered at Laconia's Weirs Beach. More than
a dozen interviews shouted over the engine racket and through the
exhaust failed to turn up any support for the new ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Yonkers, N.Y.-based Attiqua Motorcycle Club,
each contributing a sentence fragment where the last had left off,
said: ``Part of the fun of coming up here . . . is the freedom the
women have . . .to express themselves . . . and show their
well-sculpted bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Several women said they expected the shouted comments and were
not offended by them _ sometimes, even flattered. Diane Ciampa of
Norwood, Mass., considers the shouts ``part of the whole thing,''
she said. Her husband, Wayne, added, ``I think it's cracking down
on your freedom'' at an event known as a time to ``let it all hang
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials are well aware of such sentiments. When he was
citing Ms. Gagman, Baker said, ``A lot of men came by and said,
`Leave her alone, that's what this event is all about.' Well, we
disagree.'' &QL;

   SEOUL, South Korea _ The gun smoke over the high seas may be
gone, but there is growing apprehension here that as relations with
the North become more varied, they will also become more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   As they watched a push-and-shove naval match in the Yellow Sea
erupt into a firefight last week, many South Koreans renewed their
belief that even as relations thaw across the Korean peninsula,
North Korea remains an irascible, secretive, terrorist neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   While North Korea blames the South for an exchange of fire on
Tuesday in which South Korean naval vessels sank a Northern torpedo
boat, South Koreans are certain that the incident was initiated by
the North and that the North was the first to open fire. The
confrontation left at least 20 North Koreans dead.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, President Kim Dae-jung reaffirmed his ``sunshine
policy'' of expanded contacts with North Korea. He also ordered
resumption of an aid shipment of 14,000 tons of fertilizer to the
North.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, relations with the North seem increasingly fraught with
contradiction, as engagement and confrontation play out
simultaneously. Lee Sei-ki, a former minister of unification,
expressed the mood when he spoke to the National Assembly this week
on the rising tourism to North Korea in the seas to the east of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West Sea, there was an exchange of fire, while in the
East Sea, there was a luxury cruiser going back and forth to the
North,'' he declared. ``This is the most bizarre situation since
the division of this country. And the public is confused.''
</P>
<P>
   The high seas shootout erupted after a nine-day standoff in
disputed waters in the Yellow Sea, where North Korean fishing
vessels were catching crab just south of the ``northern limit
line,'' the customary line of demarcation separating the seas of
the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The North does not recognize the line and has often sent ships
south of it, but they normally retreat when shouted back by South
Korean patrol boats. This time, however, the North Korean vessels
refused to back off. A week ago, South Korean vessels began to ram
the North Korean boats. The North responded by opening fire,
according to the South's account.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's policy of engagement is an attempt to end the hard-line
approach that traditionally shaped South Korean attitudes to the
North, and it has become an important cornerstone of his
administration. What was earlier a bold proposal, has now become a
tricky one.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers have criticized Kim, saying that it was
inappropriate to reward the North with fertilizer shortly after it
had triggered a naval battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want war. We have to do something humanitarian to
help North Korea feed its children, so there is no opposition to
that,'' said Lee Shin-bom, an opposition lawmaker. ``But the
sunshine policy is one of the tools we may use. It cannot be an
unchangeable principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, many South Koreans appeared relieved at the display
of force by the American military, which is sending ships,
destroyers and an aircraft carrier to the region. Some said that as
officials in the South were playing down the episode, Americans
were doing the opposite and that this could create
misunderstandings in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Korean government is betting on the sunshine policy
as a kind of adventure, and experiment,'' said Paik Jin-hyun,
professor of international relations at Seoul National University.
``There is likely to be a further perception gap between South
Korea and the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial moment for North Korea. Its relations with the
South and the rest of the world seemed to offer the promise of
becoming smoother, despite its firing of a missile over Japan last
year and suspicions that it is building nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is considering a U.S. plan, drawn up by former
Defense Secretary William Perry, that could lead to a dramatic
warming in relations between North Korea and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that it is also a time of intense conflict
and confusion within the North Korean leadership, as leaders try to
cope with widespread famine and disgruntlement in the ranks. Thus,
South Korea may become the target of more violence as North Korean
leaders try to redirect anger against themselves toward a common
enemy in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``For North Koreans, psychologically they are depressed,'' said
Kim Joung-won, a professor of international politics at Sejong
University. ``They can say that South Korea attacked North Korea
and therefore we must solidify and unite against the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see the incident in the Yellow Sea as a sign of maturity,
in that South Korea can embrace both tourism and torpedoes from the
North. Others see it as a sign that the North is just pushing the
South around and taking its money to boot.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a tourism project run by Hyundai Corp., South Korea's
largest conglomerate, South Koreans get to tour Mount Kumgang in
the North, in exchange for pouring $125 million in cash so far this
year into an offshore bank account owned by the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is almost obsessed with the sunshine policy,''
said Park Shin-il, a spokesman for the opposition party, the Grand
National Party. ``And therein lies a question: Why are we doing it?
For whom? North Korea? South Korea? Kim Dae-jung?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Berkowitz, the serial killer known as the Son
of Sam, wept in prison last week, grieving over the coming release
of a Spike Lee movie called ``Summer of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Mona Lisa half-smile that spooked the nation after
his arrest 22 summers ago. Gone, too, was the unblinking stare that
unnerved detectives when the pudgy postal clerk cheerfully
confessed how he shot six people to death and wounded seven others.
He took orders, he said then, from a black Labrador retriever owned
by a neighbor named Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Now 46 years old, still pudgy, and going gray, Berkowitz walked
briskly last week into a cramped visiting room in the Sullivan
Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison near Albany, N.Y.
He carried a Bible and smelled pleasantly of talcum powder. In a
green polo shirt, white Nikes and blue prison pants, the most
publicized murderer in New York history had the crisp, slightly
officious bearing of a camp counselor _ until he began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This madness, the ugliness of the past is resurfacing again _
all because some people want to make some money,'' said Berkowitz,
who agreed to be interviewed because of his distress over Lee's
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy superintendent for security at the prison describes
Berkowitz as an ``exemplary'' inmate whose good behavior has made
him a role model for other prisoners. The murderer who once taunted
police with notes about hunting in Queens for ``tasty meat'' says
he is a born-again Christian. He works as a helper and peer
counselor in the prison's mental health unit.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz said that from prison he monitors ``everything there
is'' about Spike Lee and his family. ``I pray for Spike Lee and his
family, his wife, Tonya, his two children, Jackson and Satchel,''
he said. ``God does not want me to be angry with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures will not release the
movie until the first week of July, ``Summer of Sam'' is already
jarring loose memories _ some of them extraordinarily painful _
inside the circle of New Yorkers whose lives were fundamentally
changed by the Son of Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of young people killed by Berkowitz are enraged by
the movie. They accuse Lee of callously cashing in on their misery.
For the police who struggled to find Berkowitz and for the
journalists who made reputations covering him, the movie, which has
been screened for a few people in New York, has become an occasion
to meditate on a singularly riveting episode in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the movie shows a corpulent Son of Sam
character stalking the boroughs of New York at night, firing his
.44-caliber revolver into the faces of young people, most of them
women in parked cars. The murder scenes are unflinching,
blood-splattered and harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz said the movie will cause needless pain for families
of his victims, while reminding America of what is better
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just so sorry that this movie is coming out,'' he said.
``I am so sorry that, you know, this pain doesn't seem to end. I am
disappointed in Hollywood and the Walt Disney company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' zeroes in on what Lee has called an ``insane''
season in the history of New York. ``I was attempting to put
madness on film,'' he said at the Cannes Film Festival last month.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1977 was maddeningly hot and sticky. An electrical
blackout triggered looting. The city teetered near bankruptcy.
Police seemed powerless to stop a mysterious white man from
killing. Periodically, the killer teased the city with chillingly
literate notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that because you haven't heard from me for a while
that I went to sleep,'' Berkowitz wrote to Jimmy Breslin, then a
columnist for The Daily News. ``No, rather, I am still here, like a
spirit roaming the night. Thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest;
anxious to please Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslin, who appears as himself in Lee's movie, said,
``Berkowitz is the only murderer I ever heard of who knew how to
use a semicolon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two murders occurred within a mile of where Breslin lived in
Forest Hills, Queens. His daughter, Rosemary, was the age of the
victims. Afraid that his daughter might be a target, Breslin sent
his family to live with relatives in East Hampton and accepted
police protection for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dreadful summer,'' said Breslin, now a columnist at
Newsday. ``My family was away. I was drinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   People unable to move out of the city devised ways to elude the
Son of Sam, who was rumored to prefer longhaired brunettes. Many
hundreds of young women had their hair cut short and dyed blond.
Thousands more simply stayed home at night. Many nightclubs and
restaurants in the Bronx and Queens were all but empty that summer.
</P>
<P>
   For police and for the news media, it was a season of lucrative
overtime and neglected families, soaring television ratings and
record newsstand sales, professional jealousy and shameless
gimmicks to milk the story. Editors at The New York Post, which had
recently been purchased by Rupert Murdoch, were said to be furious
that Berkowitz chose to write to The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murdoch was screaming, `Why can't we get a letter from this
blighter,''' said Breslin, who remains puzzled as to why Berkowitz
singled him out.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Berkowitz was captured, The Daily News sold 2.2
million copies, 350,000 more than usual. After its famous one-word
banner headline _ ``CAUGHT!'' _ circulation at The New York Post
jumped for a day from 609,000 to 1 million. At its core, though,
the hunt for the Son of Sam was ghastly, soul-crushing work. Hordes
of detectives and reporters periodically spent long nights
inspecting the bullet-mangled bodies of innocent young people and
then weeks hounding heartsick families.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of those families remain heartsick. They are also furious
about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee feels that murder is entertainment, which, No. 1, it
is not,'' said Michael Lauria, 67, a retired bus mechanic in the
Bronx. His 18-year-old daughter, Donna, was Berkowitz's first
murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee is making the families relive this all over again,''
said Lauria, who protested last summer when the movie was filmed in
the Bronx. ``He is making money off my sorrow and my family's hurt.
He has got no compassion. They should have come to the families and
asked for permission. Let me tell you something, Walt Disney must
be turning over in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Neysa Moskowitz, 66, whose 20-year-old daughter, Stacy, was the
last to die, said she does not want her daughter ``to be remembered
all bloody and shot by a lunatic.'' A scene of her daughter being
shot to death in Brooklyn is depicted in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee was out there to make a buck, but he could have been
much, much nicer to the families,'' said Mrs. Moskowitz,
interviewed by telephone from her apartment in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the pain of the victims' families, Lee said:
``I made a statement on that at the beginning. You will have to do
some fact checking.'' He ended the phone interview after less than
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   At Cannes in May, Lee told reporters: ``I feel deeply for the
parents of the victims of Son of Sam. At the same time, I'm an
artist, and this is a story I wanted to tell. Even if I didn't make
this film, that was not going to bring their daughters, their loved
ones, back. They got buried by a psychopath. We do not feel that
the film is a glorification of David Berkowitz.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berkowitz was arrested and confessed to the murders, a
handful of the 200 detectives assigned to the investigation were
promoted. Joe Coffee, a sergeant in charge of the weekend night
shift when Berkowitz committed most of his murders, was among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a $5,000-a-year raise,'' said Coffee, 61, who retired
from the police force in 1985. ``But I think the case has taken at
least 10 years off my life. I quit smoking three years before I got
called in on Son of Sam. But I started again after I saw what he
did to Virginia Voskerichian, and I never stopped smoking since.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Voskerichian, 19, a Barnard College student, was shot in the
face and killed, a scene that is depicted in Lee's movie.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer who profited most from working on the case is
Bill Clark, now an executive producer of the television drama
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do make more money than the police commissioner,'' said
Clark, 55, who credits his 1992 move to television, after a 25-year
police career, to contacts he made with reporters while working on
the Berkowitz case. Clark lives in a large house in Santa Monica,
Calif., and owns four cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fair bet to say had I not met Dick Schaap and Jimmy
Breslin, I probably would not have ended up out here,'' Clark said
in a phone interview. Schaap and Breslin worked together on a novel
based on the shootings called ``.44.''
</P>
<P>
   At the extreme end of the Son of Sam continuum is Berkowitz
himself. He is serving six consecutive life sentences that total
more than 300 years. An inmate at Attica slashed his throat in
1979, and the wound required 65 stitches. For fighting with the
many inmates who taunted him, he was often confined to his cell in
Attica and other prisons. The fights ended with his transfer 12
years ago to Sullivan Correctional Facility, where he says he
converted to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be released from prison,'' he said last week. ``I
deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life. I can accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz prefers not to talk about, as he blandly puts it,
``the things that happened in my case.'' But when pressed, he
blames the murders on Satan. In a television interview two years
ago, he said he belonged to a satanic cult when he was the Son of
Sam. He committed only three of the six murders to which he pleaded
guilty, he said, while other cult members committed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely convinced without a shadow of a doubt that I
was demonically possessed and controlled,'' he said last week. ``I
allowed these spirits through my own ignorance to control me. The
murder and mayhem was a result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few police officers, a former district attorney in Queens and
several journalists subscribe to the cult theory. But some
detectives, like Joe Coffee, who worked the case and who listened
to Berkowitz's confession, say the theory is ludicrous. They say
the confession had details only the killer could know.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about the cult, Berkowitz refused to be
specific. ``I knew some people, yes, there was satanic influence,''
he said. ``I would rather not talk about that. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   He was eager, though, to talk about his two Christian videos,
which have been distributed to schools and prisons around the
country and which warn young people to avoid his satanic mistakes.
One video is called ``Son of Sam/Son of Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz writes several letters a day to ``my Christian
friends'' around the world. Last week, he showed off a picture of a
Tanzanian baby named David Wandamba, who he said was named after
him by a grateful father to whom he has been sending Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of some of his victims do not believe the conversion is
genuine. ``I don't want to hear that,'' Mrs. Moskowitz said. ``Show
me one person that goes away for murder who doesn't turn to
religion. I heard that someone named his son for him. I think that
it is utterly, utterly so sick.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had not been a serial killer, Berkowitz said he probably
would have ended up ``married with a wife and kids in the suburbs,
making a living, working in the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted anything special,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: DELAY'S POWER PLAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   That was one embarrassing week for Dennis Hastert. When the
House blocked tough gun control legislation and then could not
muster the votes for the pathetically weak measure that was left,
the speaker was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough to have to explain why his promise of ``common
sense'' gun control legislation flamed out as the House surrendered
to the gun lobby. Had he appeared in public, he also would have had
to explain why he surrendered control of the House to Tom DeLay.
George W. Bush and others, take note. DeLay _ fund-raiser, friend
of lobbyists and nasty culture warrior _ has become the main voice
of the GOP in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control issue is instructive for those studying the
contours of politics in Washington as it approaches the most
competitive election year in a long time for both Congress and the
presidency. For all that, the Republican congressional leaders are
oddly passive. While the country yearns for centrist politics _
something that helps to explain the success of Bush in the
presidential field _ the top congressional Republicans have yielded
to the fire-breathing ideologues who drove the House to impeachment
last year and seem determined to make their hatred of the life
choices of many Americans the center of their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the skill that Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, brought to the impeachment trial earlier this year has
deserted him. Hastert is the accidental house speaker who owes his
job to DeLay and has all but handed over the speakership to him.
While Hastert sputters platitudes about inclusiveness, DeLay has
called the shots all year on campaign finance reform, Kosovo, the
budget and now guns.
</P>
<P>
   As a front man, Delay reached out to John Dingell, an old
Democratic bull who has served 44 years in the House, to do the
bidding of the National Rifle Association and gut the provision for
waiting periods on gun purchases at gun shows. That weakening
amendment passed early Friday morning, but by later in the day, the
House may have heard about the public's reaction to the tears of
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, who made guns her cause after her husband
was murdered by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad. The House has
now defeated the entire watered-down bill that DeLay arrogantly
thought would fool the public into thinking something had been done
to curb guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the culture wars, you can credit DeLay for turning a major
political axiom upside down. It used to be an article of faith for
conservatives that Americans need to take more individual
responsibility for their actions. But now, thanks to DeLay, we
learn that violence perpetrated by gun owners is really the product
of larger forces. What might those be?
</P>
<P>
   According to the Republican whip from Texas, nothing less than
``broken homes,'' day care, television, video games, birth control,
abortion and, unbelievably, the teaching of the theory of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The gun vote revealed something else about Congress. In the
pivotal vote on gun shows, scores of Democrats defected to the
Republicans and scores of Republicans defected to the Democrats. It
was almost as if a third party had emerged from the other two. It
is made up of lawmakers from districts so competitive they actually
have to listen to their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   In the months ahead, the Party of Vulnerable Incumbents will be
emerging as a volatile swing vote. The debacle over gun control can
be reversed, but only with concerted lobbying in these swing
districts. Clinton must also make it clear that he will veto any
juvenile justice legislation that does not contain tough gun
control measures. A veto threat, and an appeal to the conscience of
the centrists, can bring sanity back to the House and provide the
ultimate rebuke to DeLay.

EDITORIAL: FATHERLY CONFUSIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those tickets to ``Death of a Salesman'' were the wrong
Father's Day present after all. Get him what he really wants, the
ads all say, but does he even know what that is, and if you gave it
to him could he open it over breakfast in front of the family?
Every possible present seems to carry the wrong message. Tie,
wallet, belt, after-shave _ the customary gifts _ imply that Dad is
something of an accessory. In fact, a strange obliquity often
emerges when dads open their Father's Day presents, as if Pandora's
box contained not a world of trouble but soap-on-a-rope.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, bewildered thanks is the leading sentiment on this
day of dadness, the bewilderment, as well as the thanks, flowing in
both directions. What makes the spirit of Father's Day hard to
internalize is the sound evolutionary intuition that fathers have a
smaller biological commitment to their offspring than mothers do _
that and the sense that this is a holiday dreamed up by shirt and
golf ball manufacturers. Just perceptible through the Father's Day
advertising blitz is the hint that there is also something
inherently comical about fatherhood itself, once the kids reach the
age of irony, that is, which comes much earlier now than the age of
reason ever did.
</P>
<P>
   No man is a hero to his valet, and most fathers manage to be an
unequal blend of all three _ man, hero and valet. That is one of
the things that infuse the official celebration of fatherhood with
its slightly awkward aura. The other thing, of course, is the
natural grace of mothers, who accept gratitude and love as their
simple due on Mother's Day and any other day of the year. They know
how, and who knows where they learn it, to make even the most
absurd gift, including no gift at all, seem like the very thing
they were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   For men, it is all very different. Father's Day is the one day
when being a father feels odd, unless you can persuade your
children, as mothers so effortlessly do, that they are still and
will always be gift enough. &QL;

CLINTON REACHES OUT TO RUSSIA AFTER DEAL TO JOINTLY PATROL KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ President Clinton and leaders of the world's
most powerful industrialized democracies moved Saturday to repair
strained relations with Russia over the Balkans by prying open
their checkbooks to reward Russia's cooperation with the West in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals for financial aid were presented to Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin, just hours after American and Russian
negotiators ended a bitter week-long impasse to clear the way for
3,600 Russian soldiers to join the 50,000-member international
security force in Kosovo under the command of the U.S.-led
19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet Sunday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
after the adjournment of the annual summit among the leaders of the
top seven industrialized democracies: Germany, France, Italy,
Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first face-to-face meeting with Stepashin came amid
reports from Moscow that the mercurial Yeltsin was in a ``fighting
mood'' as he prepared to meet Clinton but senior White House
officials said they were uncertain what Yeltsin had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   White House National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger
said the allies were reaching out to Russia to ease strains caused
by NATO's 11-week bombing campaign that forced Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the murder or expulsion of ethnic
Albanian Muslims from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is an ally of Milosevic's.
</P>
<P>
   Berger suggested that the allies were trying to stem the wave of
anti-western nationalism gripping Russia and threatens to influence
the outcome of Russia's presidential election next June.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have a ``strong interest in trying to help Russia
stay on the path of recovery, reform and democracy,'' Berger said.
``It makes a big difference whether Russia is able to strengthen
its economy, maintain its democracy, continue to head in the basic
direction of openness and reform _ or whether Russia reverts back
to some kind of nationalist or inward looking leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The allied air campaign against Yugoslavia has frozen relations
with Russia in recent months, jeopardizing cooperation in a variety
of aras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Stepashin agreed at their meeting that it was time
to end the chill in U.S.-Russian relations, according to Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some desire to discuss, to go back and discuss
the events of the past 90 days,'' Berger said. ``But I think the
larger thrust here is to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the allied incentives outlined for Russia offered the
prospect of a fresh infusion of sorely needed western currency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his colleagues signaled greater flexibility on
Russia's repayment of $69 billion in Soviet-era debt in response to
Stepashin's promise that the Kremlin would complete economic
reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund. Clinton
indicated that an IMF loan for $4.5 billion in emergency debt
assistance would be approved next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Stepashin immediate satellite launch contracts
with American firms as Russia implements stiffer export controls on
missile-related technology to countries such as Iran. Clinton also
vowed to proceed with a $4.2 billion, five year U.S.-funded program
to help Russia improve nuclear weapons safety.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed ways to reopen the U.S. market to greater
imports of Russian steel in the wake of a U.S. crackdown on Russian
``dumping'' of steel at prices below production costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration responded to Russian entreaties to
offer some flexibility on the definition of emergency
``humanitarian assistance'' that will be provided to Yugoslavia by
the 19-nation NATO alliance and the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and some U.S. allies have stipulated that western
development aid will not be sent to Yugoslavia as long as
Milosevic, an indicted war criminal, remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia wants western humanitarian assistance to reach
Yugoslavia's Serbs. As Stepashin put it Friday night: ``The conduct
of one man must not penalize 10 million Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said allies concur on providing ``humanitarian'' aid to
``the Serbian people'' while withholding broad ``reconstruction''
assistance until Milosevic steps down.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction between the two types of assistance may be
blurred, Berger conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is getting the electric lights back on (in Serbia) for winter
humanitarian or is it reconstruction?'' Berger said. ``Where that
line is, is obviously something that is going to have to be
established.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States would participate in humanitarian relief to
the Serbian people ``if the need is great in Serbia, particularly
as winter comes on and there's need for food and medicine and basic
human needs,'' Berger said.

</P>
<P>
   Another gesture to the Kremlin was the allies' readiness to deal
with Russia on security-related matters at the Group of Eight
summit where Russia enjoys equal footing with the industrialized
democracies, the G-7.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to deal on security-related issues involving
Kosovo through NATO where Russia is merely a subordinate,
nonvoting, consultative partner to the 19-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin told Clinton that the Kremlin is now prepared to
resume working-level contacts between the prime minister and Vice
President Al Gore. The twice-a-year meetings of the Cabinet level
commission had been suspended. Resumption of the sessions offers
Gore a prominent foreign policy stage in his 2000 presidential
campaign.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are moving to capitalize immediately on
the failure of the Republican-controlled House to pass even modest
gun-control legislation, and promising to take the issue to the
forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a short, blistering radio address delivered Saturday from
Europe, President Clinton took the House and the National Rifle
Association to task and set the tone for the coming campaign.
``Time and again, the gun lobby has used every weapon in its
arsenal to defeat any effort to strengthen our gun laws, no matter
how sensible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives gutted our bill in the dark of
night _ literally, after midnight _ because the gun lobby didn't
want common-sense gun legislation to see the light of day,''
Clinton said. ``That is unacceptable. We can't allow the gun lobby
to rewrite our laws and undermine our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, the two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,
also excoriated Republicans for the House's failure. But it was
mostly Democrats who killed the final package, saying that it was
too watered down to be effective and that they did not want to give
the Republicans bragging rights for passing even modest gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that Democrats killed the package so that they
could exploit the gun issue both in the presidential campaign and
in their eagerness to try to win back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were campaigning in California, a state where
shootings over the last several years have increased sentiment for
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the Congress doing?'' Gore asked incredulously. ``Why
don't they just wake up and respond to what the American people
want?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who pollsters
say is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, took the opposite tack. On Friday, the day of the House
vote, he signed into law a bill passed by the Texas Legislature
that would bar local governments from suing gun manufacturers to
recover damages from gun violence, putting him on the side of the
National Rifle Association. Texas is the 14th state to enact such a
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Austin, his office said: ``Governor Bush
does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product should be held
responsible for the criminal misuse of that product.''
</P>
<P>
   This dovetails with a pervasive Republican view that cultural
factors, such as moral decay and a loss of faith _ not the
availability of firearms _ are responsible for disasters like the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo. As Rep. Tom DeLay, the Texas
Republican who is the majority whip, put it, the issue is ``God,
not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off that theme, and providing a counterpoint to the
contentious gun legislation, the House did pass, easily,
legislation urging states to allow the Ten Commandments to be
posted in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This had the apparently unintended consequence of embodying the
Republican response to Littleton in one person, Charlton Heston,
the actor who played Moses in the 1956 movie of ``The Ten
Commandments'' and who is now the most visible spokesman for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The actions by the House, and the mixed signals from Democrats,
many of whom come from conservative gun-supporting districts, may
only have confused the public while catapulting the issue into the
hands of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control is moving increasingly from the legislative venue
to the electoral venue,'' said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group based in
Washington. ``It will increasingly be fought out at the
presidential level, because essentially these House members voted
their districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to play down the discord in their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it wasn't the cleanest of political hits,'' Jim
Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,
said of the House votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordan said, ``what matters less is specific votes than
overall impressions that political events create.'' He added:
``It's not just that Republicans shut down the government or just
that they impeached the president against the wishes of the public;
it's not just that they criticized a legitimate war effort in
Kosovo, and it's not just this gun vote. It's a series of events
over and over that solidifies an image of being bitter and partisan
and nasty and out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it was the combined actions of Bush in Texas and the
Congress in Washington that provided Democrats with instant grist
for the campaign mill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, addressing a high school audience in Los Angeles, said of
Bush, ``The stakes are too high for any presidential candidate to
stand on the sidelines.'' Since Gore officially declared his
candidacy on Wednesday, he has been warning his audiences that Bush
would sign a bill that would ``protect gun manufacturers'' and that
he himself would not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, countered by suggesting that
Gore appeared to be promoting litigation as a solution. ``If Vice
President Gore wants to take the side of frivolous lawsuits, which
cost jobs and clog the courts and delay justice for people who need
it, we'll fight that fight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has until now preferred to speak in broad thematic
generalities about his candidacy. But on Friday night he advocated
several specific gun-control measures that he wants to enact, at
the same time assuming a lofty tone that suggested both parties in
Congress were tied in partisan knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end up with a shrill and stale debate that offers false
choices and little hope of reducing the carnage in America,'' he
said at a dinner in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a culture that he said was so permeated with violence
that there are more gun dealers than gas stations and grocery
stores, Bradley said he supported limiting gun purchases to one a
month per person, requiring those who own handguns to pass a basic
safety course, banning pistols known as Saturday night specials,
increasing the license fees for gun dealers and requiring dealers
to have photographs and fingerprints taken when they make
applications to sell guns. He said he also wanted to restrict
federal firearm licenses to businesses situated in commercial
zones, banning them from residential areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that guns alone among consumer products had generally
escaped regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks were softer than his campaign's earlier
suggestions that he believed handguns should be banned altogether,
and he couched his call for restrictions in language that was
sympathetic to gun owners, noting that as a boy he had gone
target-shooting with his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a subtle dig at Clinton for not doing more. He said
that much of the national conversation about guns was based on
polls and focus groups. ``Why should our leaders self-censor their
proposals on gun violence to what they think Congress might be
willing to pass, as opposed to what might work?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this month that he had tempered his anti-gun
proposals out of a realistic sense of what would pass the Congress.
``Let's join the real world here,'' Clinton said when ABC's Charles
Gibson had asked him on ``Good Morning America'' why he had
proposed such relatively modest measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, for example, that he wanted to require people to
register their guns just as they are required to register cars, but
that he knew Congress would not accept this.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded his radio address Saturday by appealing to the gun
lobby to help Congress pass measures to increase the time for
background checks on gun buyers and close loopholes on buying guns
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to be hurt by this legislation,'' he said of
proposals to close gun-show loopholes. He added: ``The American
people understand that common-sense gun laws don't infringe our
rights; they protect our lives. It's that simple.''

VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES FACING NEW SCRUTINY

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Shortly after turning on his computer,
Alfredo Lambour, 15, shot and killed the same zombie six times, saw
countless gallons of blood splatter, and ran among the decapitated
heads and other body parts that littered a fortress floor in the
video game Quake II.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo spends nearly two hours a day in his living room, here
in this Los Angeles suburb, looking down the barrel of a gun as he
roams dimly lit corridors in search of monsters. On a recent day,
Alfredo played the role of a marine, outfitted with body armor,
fatigues and a weapon called a blaster that he fired at anything
that moved, using his computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can just split people in half,'' he said of the blaster.
</P>
<P>
   Video games have come under increased scrutiny after the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., that left
15 people dead. The students who carried out the attack, Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, have been described as playing Doom, a
violent video game released in 1993 that is not considered to be
realistic compared with newer games, but still includes ample
amounts of blood and numerous explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown whether the gory scenes in the game influenced the
minds of the Columbine shooters. But the issue of the violent
influence of video games has been seized upon by many politicians
and members of the public who believe that such entertainment is
inappropriate for minors and needs to be toned down.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton singled out video game advertising as being
particularly excessive when he announced the beginning of two
federal investigations June 1 into whether the entertainment
industry is marketing violence to children. A proposal by Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to prohibit the sale of all violent
entertainment, including video games, to children under 17 failed
in a House vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While video game enthusiasts generally concede that some of the
games sold in stores have violent content, they are adamant that
the games do not encourage players to imitate what they see on
screen. To them, fighting animated enemies is merely thrilling
competition and no more harmful than football, professional
wrestling and cartoons in which characters like Wile E. Coyote
battle the Roadrunner with anvils and dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wouldn't be a lot of people foaming at the mouth over
video games if Littleton didn't happen,'' said Jon Dempster, a
video game enthusiast from Grand Rapids, Mich., who sometimes plays
games like Quake II with his twin 11-year-old boys. ``As long as
children can separate fantasy from reality, they leave any
aggressive thoughts behind once they turn off the computer. It has
no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, video game boxes have been printed with
ratings as part of a voluntary program by software publishers.
However, even games that are rated as ``mature'' like Postal, which
says on the box that it is so realistic that ``your victims
actually beg for mercy and scream for their lives,'' can be legally
sold to children of any age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most video games are actually bought by adults, according to
the Interactive Digital Software Association, the video game
industry's trade group. If parents are not already aware of the
contents, most soon learn, and judging from the widespread use by
children, do nothing to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ratings are completely neglected,'' said Dave Sparks,
owner of Interact, a computer video game store in Pasadena, Calif.
``Maybe one out of a hundred Moms pay any attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many video game enthusiasts blamed the media and political
opportunists for the bad reputation their hobby has received
lately. The recent rash of school shootings, they said, was more a
consequence of action movies, news reports about crime, bad
parenting and children who were mentally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Matulewicz, 15, from near San Jose, Calif., said that
reducing the violence in the games he plays would not diminish his
interest in them because he does not stop to admire the dead
bodies. But he added that the reduction is not necessary because
thousands of people play video games every day without hurting
others _ proof that some other factor must be responsible for the
violence like that at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   That the federal government is focusing attention on the video
game industry is generally met with skepticism by video game
players. Steve Merz, a longtime video game enthusiast from Forest
City, N.C., who has two small children, said the content of video
games and the age of the people who play them is none of the
government's business.
</P>
<P>
   Merz said parents should be the ones to decide what children
play. Dismissing the violence in video games as inconsequential, he
allows his 7-year-old son, Danny, to play games like Quake, but not
ones with foul language, satanic imagery and nudity because those,
in contrast, he believes can be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents support strengthening video game ratings, which
are being reviewed by the industry trade group. They also want more
manufacturers to install switches in video games that would allow
parents to block parts of the game.
</P>
<P>
   David Lepore, a 30-year-old computer analyst in Tacoma, Wash.,
is among those parents who encourage the industry to adopt some
voluntary changes. For now, his two boys, ages 5 and 10, are not
even allowed to watch the screen when he, for example, assumes the
role of a horrific creature that has invaded a space colony in the
game Aliens Versus Predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases these games may lead to violence,'' he said,
``I'm not taking any chances.''

SAMPRAS BACK ON FIRM GRASS AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The ritual gets more momentous every year.
Each June Pete Sampras makes a private pilgrimage to Center Court,
the famed swatch of lawn that shines, on sunny days, like a
square-cut emerald and will, after a two-week trampling, come to
resemble a dust bowl. He pays his respects and prays that it will
be his sneakers, seven rounds hence, that grind Wimbledon's
best-loved lawn into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just a tennis tournament to me,'' Sampras
said last week, parked on the sofa of his customary rental manse on
the fringes of Wimbledon village. ``This is the granddaddy of them
all, and when you step onto that court, the world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to get too deep here, but I feel a connection
to this place. When I look around Center Court and remember the
matches I've won there, it feels like a cathedral. It's almost
surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, alone in the stands of the abandoned Center Court,
Sampras conducted his solo seance, communing with the ghosts of
Wimbledons past. For the most part, they have been friendly to him;
his five championships in the last six years are proof. But he has
reasons for wanting to feel more simpatico than ever with the
doomed grasses of Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, whose 11th and most recent Grand Slam event was won
here last year, would establish a glut of historic footnotes if he
captured a sixth Wimbledon. Not only would he equal Roy Emerson's
career record of 12 Grand Slam titles, but he would become the
first man in 110 years to conquer the world's most celebrated
tennis tournament six times, and he would surpass Ivan Lendl's
record of 270 weeks with the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sit there in the stands and soak it all in,'' Sampras
said. ``I think about how the court will look when I play on
Monday, new and green and untouched, and then I think how it looked
last year in the fifth set against Goran, like a battleground, with
no grass left at all, how that's what makes the tennis that much
more threatening. It's all part of the charm of the place. Of
course I would love to win again. That's rhetorical. But I don't
feel pressure to do it; pressure is the wrong word.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure was the right word for the way Sampras concluded 1998,
on a frantic six-week tour through Europe designed to give him
sufficient match victories to finish the year at No. 1 for a sixth
consecutive season. Another record.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras went 14-4 during that stretch, which began with a title
in Vienna but included a first-round exit at Stockholm and a
final-round loss to Greg Rusedski in the Paris Indoor that almost
drove him into psychiatric care. ``I began asking myself how would
I ever recover if I didn't do this thing,'' he said. ``I was solely
consumed by the thought of winning matches, and by the end of the
year I felt like I was fighting for my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't like failing at a Slam, where you at least have
the next one to look forward to,'' Sampras said. ``This was now or
never. I knew it was one record that won't be touched, and I had to
prove to myself that I could do it. Was it worth it? Yeah. It
was.''
</P>
<P>
   His success _ aided by the injuries that took Marcelo Rios and
Patrick Rafter, his rivals for the ranking, out of the year-end ATP
World Championships _ broke his tie with Jimmy Connors in the
record books, but it almost broke him, too. His hair fell out in
clumps, and eventually his relationship with the actress Kimberly
Williams was another casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two people with two demanding careers, and when it comes
right down to it, that opens itself to problems,'' he said. ``I
couldn't be there for her the way she needed me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it selfishness, but Sampras found out he wasn't ready to
put romance ahead of records. ``It's not like we did anything
wrong, but neither one of us was going to make career sacrifices we
might end up regretting or resenting. Who knows what may happen in
the future, but for now, we're broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of that break-up, Sampras _ who skipped the
Australian Open this year and spurned Davis Cup because the hunt
for No. 1 had left him ``at the end of my rope'' _ turned his
attention to winning the French Open, the only Grand Slam event he
has not won. He obsessed about Roland Garros from February on,
changing his diet from spontaneous to spartan and embarking on a
gladiator's training regimen. But, still, Sampras lost in the
second round, and lost ``badly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I put all this into it and I didn't even come close,'' he
said. ``I wanted it too much, which sounds like an irony. I play my
best tennis on instinct. Next time, I'm going into it like any
other tournament. If I don't ever win it, that won't totally
diminish my career _ but we all want to have a perfect career,
don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Sampras' new take on the perfect career includes Davis
Cup. During a spring of soul-searching after his monomaniacal chase
of the year-end top ranking, Sampras decided the final three or
four years of his career should consist of big events with tangible
outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   He is, he said, looking for ``the arena, and when I watched Jim
Courier and Todd Martin win the first round of Davis Cup against
England, for the first time I was kind of outside looking in.''
</P>
<P>
   He realized he wanted to be in on Davis Cup, especially in this
centennial year. ``So I swallowed my pride and offered to play just
doubles in the second round,'' he said. ``Really, I wanted Jim and
Todd to know I was serious about this commitment and wouldn't join
the team unless it was OK with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also felt a stab of recognition when Wayne Gretzky
retired this spring, sandwiched between the swan songs of Michael
Jordan and John Elway. ``I realized that it wasn't about the number
of Stanley Cups he won, it was about everything else he did and
meant to his sport,'' Sampras said. ``I don't want to sit here and
say that I'm tennis the way he is hockey, but it did make me think
of his role in his sport; it kind of opened up the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate picture is Wimbledon, the Grand Slam
tournament he reveres the most, and the achievements a title there
would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's won it six times, not in modern times;
as for Emerson's record, to even be in the position to tie it is an
effort and achievement in itself,'' said Sampras, who for the
moment is confining his ambitions to beating Scott Draper in the
first round. ``It's ridiculous to put pressure on myself to get the
record here. But if and when I do tie it, then I'll start having
dreams about breaking it.''  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will dominate the weather over the northeastern
quarter of the nation, bringing mainly dry conditions. Sunshine and
warmer air will cover eastern New England while clouds gather over
the northern Appalachian Mountains where isolated afternoon showers
may form. Onshore winds from the Middle Atlantic coast to the
Southeast will draw moisture from a stalled offshore front back
into the Piedmont plateau. As a result, thundershowers will dampen
the coast and a few storms should form over the southern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical moisture will continue to interact with a stationary
front over Florida. Clusters of heavy thunderstorms will deposit
several inches of rain in the southern sections. A large
disturbance over the southeast Bahamas will drift toward the state
enhancing the wet weather.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of hot and humid air into the Plains will trigger
several areas of thunderstorms. Large thunderstorms will form in
the Dakotas and move into Minnesota and Iowa. Another cluster of
storms will generate over eastern Oklahoma or northeast Texas and
progress into Arkansas and Louisiana. A few thundershowers will
dissipate as they move into the Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air circulating around high pressure at 15,000 feet over
the Rockies will trigger afternoon thundershowers mainly along the
southern and eastern peaks. A few storms will reach into Arizona.
Cooler, moist air from the North Pacific will sponsor clouds and a
few showers on the Northwest coast. Much of California will be
bright and hot over the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: First Pacific Storm
</P>
<P>
   The first tropical storm of the season in the eastern Pacific
formed on Friday. It was named Adrian. With steady winds of nearly
60 mph, Adrian was situated very close to the west-central Mexican
coast. Conditions favor a strengthening to hurricane status by
Sunday morning. The hurricane season began more than a month ago in
the eastern Pacific. Indeed, it is unusual for the Atlantic to see
a named storm before the Pacific, but such is the case this year.
Usually about 15 storms form in the eastern Pacific each season;
there were a record 24 in 1992.

ITALIANS CELEBRATE AN UPSET, AS TURIN IS AWARDED 2006 WINTER
GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea, June 19 _ Handing the Olympics to a city as
famed for its culture as for its ski slopes, the International
Olympic Committee on Saturday chose Turin, Italy, to host the 2006
Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was really a dream,'' Valentino Castellani, the
ebullient Mayor for the 1.3 million people of Turin, said in an
interview here after defeating the favored Swiss town of Sion, in a
59-36 vote. ``This is great for my city and for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Swiss, who were shocked at the decision, it seemed the
realization of their worst fears. Even before the vote, Sion
officials had worried that their bid could fall prey to a backlash
targeted at Marc Hodler, a veteran Swiss IOC member who blew the
whistle on corruption at the IOC meeting last December. His
comments led to an investigation into Salt Lake City's bid for the
2002 Winter Olympics and the ensuing scandal left the IOC battling
a perception that it is a corrupt organization whose members sell
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sion wasn't the loser; Sion was a victim,'' Denis Oswald, a
member of the Swiss delegation, told reporters. ``Today, the IOC
was the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler also expressed frustration, telling reporters: ``It's
unfair. For Sion, it's really unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he took the podium at the end of the general
assembly meeting to congratulate Turin and pledge to help make the
2006 Winter Games a success.
</P>
<P>
   Turin, a baroque Italian city that is the home of the Fiat car
maker, had portrayed itself as an Olympic city of the future, a
metropolis near the Alps surrounded by churches and castles, by
museums and mountain peaks.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time bidder for an Olympics, Turin will become the first
Italian city in 46 years to be host to the Games. Cortina
d'Ampezzo, Italy, was the site of the 1956 Winter Olympics, and
Rome had the 1960 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   As the biggest city near the Alps, Turin and its surroundings
have been the home of many skiers, teachers and Olympic trainers,
and it had the added strength of having a relatively strong city
network of transportation, culture and cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   This was Sion's third attempt to be host of a Winter Olympics,
and each time, its bid had become stronger and better scripted.
This time, the image of the Swiss was similar to the concept
fashioned by the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in 1994,
and it won praise from the committee in the early stages of the
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Sion had also bid against Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter
Olympics, but it had lost. At the time, Sion's group was told by
the committee that the ski slopes were too far from the Olympic
village, so it reworked its layout and in its bid this time, almost
all the sites would have been only about 30 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sion's concept was very good, but also very traditional,''
said Marco San Pietro, a spokesman for the Turin bid committee.
``Our bid was much more in the future, in the 21st century. This
was really the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's selection vote was the first since the IOC expelled
six of its members and adopted new rules designed to prevent the
kind of gift-giving that had sometimes consumed the cities that had
campaigned in the past. In the past, cities wooed committee members
by sending them on tours, paying for golf outings, garden parties
and even tuition bills for members' children. Japanese sponsors of
the Nagano Winter Olympics in 1998, for instance, donated $10
million to help the IOC construct a new building in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, under the new rules this year, bidding cities were
not allowed to invite the IOC members to view the potential sites
of the Games. Nor were they allowed to throw dinner parties for
them or take them on expensive and entrancing tours in the host
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Turin had prepared a budget of $5 million to $6 million
simply for entertaining 50 to 60 different Olympic Committee
members and other people who are part of the voting process. When
the rules were changed, Turin campaigners felt they were put at a
disadvantage, partly because few members knew anything about Turin,
much less visited the city. In contrast, many members were familiar
with Sion from its earlier bid.
</P>
<P>
   But using videos, compact disks and other materials, including
the 350-page bid book submitted to the committee, Turin was able to
convince the committee that a big city with a rich history and
culture could be part of a trend in future Olympics sites. In the
end, it spent about $10 million, according to San Pietro.
</P>
<P>
   Turin was the last city to join as a candidate in the Olympic
race, but it emerged as a relative underdog to beat the favorite,
the tiny and scenic Swiss hamlet of Sion, which has 28,000 people.
Even as delegates from six different cities gathered to hear Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the longtime president of the Olympic committee,
announce the winning city, there were whispers that Sion had won.
</P>
<P>
   But when Samaranch called out ``Turino!'' a surprised roar
erupted from the small band of supporters, and Champagne bottles
were uncorked.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler said he had no regrets about going public with his
allegations. Had he not, he said, ``It would have been
scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates to the meetings Saturday said that Sion's bid
could have been tainted slightly by its past participation in the
old-style selection process.
</P>
<P>
   The other bidding cities were Klagenfurt of Austria, Zakopane of
Poland, Helsinki of Finland and Poprad-Tatry of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to finish work on the selection rules
for host cities perhaps at its next meeting next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review everything from now until the end of the
year,'' said Chiharu Igaya, the Japanese delegate to the IOC and
the head of the committee evaluating the rules.  &QL;

HINGIS BECOMES THE NEWEST `BRAT' IN TENNIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ As an advertisement for herself, Martina
Hingis' petulant performance in the French Open final against
Steffi Graf two weeks ago gave cause for pause. Is the 18-year-old
Slovak-turned-Swiss-turned-Florida-resident trading in her
trademark precocity for pathology? Is she out to become the
brattiest No. 1 since John McEnroe made a habit, and a living, out
of on-court dysfunction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Her game may be mature beyond its years, but her behavior was
a very public temper tantrum, and her offenses were definitely
booable offenses,'' said Mary Carillo, a former French Open
mixed-doubles champion (alongside McEnroe), who now does television
commentary for CBS and HBO. ``She was the author of the atmosphere;
she turned a Grand Slam final into a Jerry Springer festival. She's
used to smiling her way out of anything; she's used to being the
one who jerks the chain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Paris, at the only Grand Slam event she hasn't won,
Hingis' own Mount Everest of an ego sabotaged her. She didn't just
play at fever pitch, she pitched a fever fit.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth game of the first set, she wrung her racquet like
the neck of a chicken, a bit of brutality that earned her a warning
and raised the hackles of the Roland Garros audience, which prefers
that its ladies' tennis finals be conducted in a ladylike fashion _
or at least with some facade of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Had a handy shower come along and transformed the red clay to
red mud, Hingis might have challenged Graf to a wrestling match
before trophy time. As it was, she was misusing racquets when the
score was still 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Later, she committed a rule-book taboo by invading Graf's turf
to argue a line call, a tantrum all the more ill-advised because
she held a 6-4, 2-0 lead at the time she chose to indulge herself
and denigrate the officials. Graf outwardly ignored the teen-ager's
histrionics and inwardly told herself: ``Hey, this kid is beating
me and she's cracking anyway. Better not count myself out just
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16,000 fans just saw Hingis' hissy fit as further reason to
boo her and clamber aboard the bandwagon of the then 29-year-old
Graf as she soldiered through her ninth and last French Open final.
</P>
<P>
   After sulking through a third set comeback by Graf, the
frostiest rival to rise above an opponent's transgressions since
Bjorn Borg used to sit back at the baseline and watch McEnroe
detonate himself, Hingis produced the shot that drove the crowd to
a frenzy of condemnation. At match point for Graf, Hingis unfurled
an underhanded serve, and when it worked, she tried another on
Graf's second match point. That one didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chris Evert, Hingis' chosen mentor on the WTA Tour,
has decided that the underhand serve ``was just an act of total
desperation because she was trying at that point to do anything to
throw off Steffi's timing,'' Pam Shriver, another Grand Slam
champion turned television commentator, saw a darker side to the
shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underhand serve can be a tactic; I've seen people revert
to it before,'' said Shriver, noting that the most famous case was
the cramping Michael Chang during his improbable French Open
campaign of 1989. ``But in Hingis' case, it seemed like it was like
the parting shot of her breakdown; it's like she used that serve
out of spite because she didn't want to see Steffi win the title in
the normal way. She acted like a defiant teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   Or like a furious toddler who has been denied a coveted toy. In
defeat, Hingis did everything but lie on her back and kick and
scream and call for her mother _ wait a minute, she did that, too.
After slapping away the arm of the WTA Tour representative who
attempted to console her and remind her of her responsibilities on
the podium, Hingis raced from the court and into the arms of her
mother/coach, Melanie Molitor.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis later admitted she wouldn't have returned to absorb her
ultimate punishment _ the runner-up plate instead of the trophy _
if her mother hadn't reminded her that ``great champions'' have to
make consolation speeches just like any other loser in a Grand Slam
final.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting back on the loss, Hingis was dry-eyed and not in a
particularly redemptive mood. ``I don't think my behavior was too
bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About the disputed forehand in the second set, she maintained
her shot was good and that Graf knew it but elected to steer clear
of the fray. As for her underhand serves, she termed them a
strategy wrought of frustration: ``I just used anything I could
use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bart McGuire, the chief executive officer of the women's tour,
said Hingis' French Open theatrics were her black eye to bear, not
the tour's, but he added, ``She's got some fence-mending to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued McGuire: ``There are things she's done and said that
don't present her in an attractive light, and certainly she
succeeded in creating a hostile crowd in the French final, but I
see it as more of a competitive judgment issue than a sportsmanship
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I condone what she did? No. But I hope and believe she'll
learn from this, and as for it having an adverse effect on women's
tennis, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis earned a $1,500 fine for the automatic point penalty she
received for crossing to Graf's territory, but worse than the fine
was the aftertaste of her tantrum. It suggested a champion who not
only believes she can beat everybody, but who also believes she's
better than everybody.
</P>
<P>
   But not better behaved. And not, when push came to shove on June
5 on center court at Roland Garros, better than Graf, who has spent
15 years working for her 22 Grand Slam crowns and definitely felt
slighted last year when Hingis dismissed her as over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a professional athlete is a total learning curve,'' said
Billie Jean King. ``Right now Martina's anger is coming out
sideways. In time, things will change.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, the women's tennis tour has a built-in villain at
No.1. &QL;

OPPOSING CAMPS SQUARE OFF AT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ABOUT DRUG
LEGALIZATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Calif., Colo., Fla., Ind., Ga., Md., Nev.,
N.Y., Ore., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress seldom meets a hearing that it doesn't
like, but the one that Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., convened on
Wednesday raised quite a few hackles.
</P>
<P>
   Its topic: ``The Pros and Cons of Drug Legalization,
Decriminalization and Harm Reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, the first on the subject since 1988, was motivated
by suspicions on Capitol Hill that legalization of drugs is the
ultimate goal of people who actively promote marijuana as a
medicinal palliative or advocate giving sterile syringes to heroin
addicts to prevent them from contracting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing illustrated Congress' reluctance to rethink the war
against drugs, on which the federal government spends nearly $18
billion a year. And it presaged the sort of discourse about drugs
bound to surface in next year's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a politically risk-free area,'' said Eric E. Sterling, a
former counsel to the House Judiciary Committee who helped draft
the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts passed in 1986 and 1988. Sterling, who is
president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, attended the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No member of Congress is going to lose a vote because they're
tough on drugs,'' he said. ``And it attracts media attention. I
suspect pollsters would tell members of Congress that this is a
very good area to be outspoken in.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing itself drew protests from opposing camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have hearings called `The Pros and Cons of Rape,'''
said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who is on the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   And Ethan A. Nadelmann, the director of the Lindesmith Center, a
New York-based group working to change drug policy, dismissed the
hearing as ``an effort to smear the many moderate proposals for
drug-policy reform with the broad and false brush of radical
legalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was largely prompted by voter initiatives to approve
medicinal marijuana in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Oregon, Nevada Washington and the District of Columbia. The
initiatives were financed in part by the billionaire investor
George Soros, who has also reportedly contributed about $10 million
to the Lindesmith Center and the Drug Policy Foundation, two groups
spearheading the effort to change the way that Americans view
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that one side was doing all the talking
and there really needed to be a congressional response to this,''
said Bobby Charles, the chief counsel for the Subcommittee on
Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, which held the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired general who is the White
House's national director of drug control policy, put it more
bluntly. ``We're getting rolled in the public arena by very clever
people,'' he told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, McCaffrey described a campaign of deception
and half-truths to erode society's disapproval of marijuana and
harder drugs, to which 4.1 million Americans are now addicted.
While 82 percent of the public oppose making illicit drugs legal,
he said, there is ``a carefully camouflaged, well-funded, tightly
knit core of people whose goal is to legalize drugs in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann did not attend the hearing, contending that the
subcommittee had disinvited him. ``They might have held hearings on
whether current federal drug policies are doing more harm than
good,'' he said. ``Instead, they decided to hold a hearing on the
`drug legalization movement,' which is essentially a figment of
their imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles said none of the subcommittee members wanted to legalize
drugs themselves. But Mica, he said, believed ``that an open and
honest debate only serves the cause of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other subcommittee members expressed unhappiness that the
hearing was even taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalization is a surrender to despair,'' said Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, Republican of upstate New York. ``It cannot and ought
not be any topic of serious discussion in our nation's debate of
the challenges of illicit drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting the de., asked whether anti- racketeering laws could
be used to prosecute people conspiring to legalize drugs. McCaffrey
shot back that doing so ``would have a chilling effect on the right
of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey assured the subcommittee that ``I am not open-minded
about drug abuse in America.'' But afterwards, he said he wished
that there had been a fuller exposition of the legalization
argument. ``I want people to come out and say what they believe,
and be subject to cross-examination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Glasser, who testified before the subcommittee as executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said, ``I think
they are engaged in an effort to discredit and attack and
intimidate people who disagree with them.'' Glasser, who is also
president of the Drug Policy Foundation, said in his testimony,
``The government has demonized all drug use without
differentiation, has systematically and hysterically resisted
science and has turned millions of stable and productive citizens
into criminals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,
which wants marijuana legally available, said they were excluded.
Charles said there was not enough room for everyone. ``I think
there will be future hearings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann was one of several people whom McCaffrey accused of
advocating drug legalization. McCaffrey quoted Nadelmann as having
said in 1990, ``Personally, when I talk about legalization, I mean
three things: the first is to make drugs such as marijuana, cocaine
and heroin legal.'' The rest of Nadelmann's sentence, which was
omitted at the hearing, said `` ... under fairly restricted
conditions, but not as restricted as today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann said he was quoted out of context. ``My secret agenda
is not the legalization of drugs,'' he said. ``It's the creation of
a drug policy based upon common sense, science, public health and
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Edolphus
Towns of Brooklyn, urged their subcommittee colleagues to consider
helping the victims of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution is that we have a humane society so people don't
grow up feeling they have to do these things,'' Cummings said.
``And when they do these things, they need appropriate treatment.''

THE KNICKS, WOUNDED AND WEARY, FEEL THE PRESSURE TO AVOID A SWEEP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcus Camby was moving with the wobbly and awkward steps of a
newborn colt as he drove into the paint and nearly fell down while
twisting and turning, all in an effort to get off a shot that would
find the net before David Robinson and Tim Duncan found it.
</P>
<P>
   The two Spurs did not have to work hard on this late-game
occasion Friday night. The shot squirted into the air like a bar of
soap that got away and landed on top of the backboard before
kissing the shot clock. But this is what Robinson and Duncan do.
They make a fool out of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was trying. So was Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas and Chris
Childs. But they were a combined 5 for 26 in the Knicks' Game 2
loss to San Antonio, and they made for a shaky support group for
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure on Allan and Sprewell to score,''
said Mario Elie, who continually funneled Houston inside on the
baseline where Robinson and Duncan were waiting for him. ``Those
guys are terrific players, but I always say that two can't beat
12.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell and Houston have to keep playing on their own _ as
they did in Game 2 to finish a combined 17 for 42 from the field _
the Knicks will be in a potentially devastating situation when they
play Game 3 of the four-of-seven-game National Basketball
Association finals on Monday at Madison Square Garden. Even as the
crowd filtered out of the dome Friday night, there were chants of
``Sweep'' by the Spurs fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys on this team have a lot of pride,'' Camby said. ``We
don't want to get swept, and I don't think that's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Down two games to none, the Knicks maintained a feisty good
spirit on the surface, but they have to find some points from
alternate sources to give themselves a chance against the Spurs.
Although they are banged up, the Knicks can tap a few options. The
obvious one is Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 2, he was as alone on the perimeter as a scarecrow
in a field but on a sprained knee he had little lift when he
launched 7 3-pointers and hit just 1. With two days of rest, he may
feel better for Game 3 and get a hit of adrenaline from the home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Childs could also be a threat. He was able to dart inside for
open looks on runners but missed when he noticed Robinson and
Duncan closing in on him. He finished 2 for 8. If he can spot up
and knock down a 3-pointer, Childs _ or Charlie Ward, for that
matter _ could give the Knicks a little boost. If Houston and
Sprewell can drive-and-kick the ball out, Childs poses much more of
a threat outside, than going inside against the Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great lane intimidation as far as making each shot
in the paint difficult,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I thought we
had some good looks in there. But nothing comes easy with those two
guys there.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier on themselves, the Knicks could run a
pick-and-roll now and again and be less predictable. So far,
Robinson and Duncan have been able to lurk in the background and
await the one-on-one drives of Sprewell and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Thomas could diffuse some of that predictability
with his ability to nail a base-line jumper. Thomas was 1 for 6 in
Game 1, but if the mood hits him, he is capable of scoring in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just need a third or fourth guy to help,'' Elie said.
``Larry is not 100 percent. Kurt is a role player. Maybe Camby, but
he just does a great job giving them energy on the offensive
boards. We can't let Allan or Sprewell beat us. We've got to try
and make Kurt Thomas, Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has stepped forward so far. Camby was the X factor in the
Knicks' Indiana series, but has had trouble staying out of foul
trouble when matched against Robinson. He has had difficulty making
a shot without wondering when and if it'll be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two guys in there like they have, you worry
about them blocking shots and altering the shot,'' Camby said.
``It's tough to get into the lane. But then when you get to the
lane, you still have to face two intimidators inside and try to
shoot over them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Camby, those shots are usually putbacks. With the quickness
of Duncan, those second-chance shots can end up partly blocked. In
Game 3, Camby may have more plays run for him, and may be more
effective down the stretch if he can avoid early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It's that final stretch that has been the melting point for the
Knicks. As the games have worn on, Houston and Sprewell have begun
to wilt under the Spurs' 48-minutes of defensive pressure. In the
fourth quarter of Games 1 and 2, Houston was 1 for 7 and Sprewell
was 4 for 13. They've fallen into the Spurs plan to wear out the
Knicks by the fourth quarter in an effort to steal their energy for
a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made some mistakes at the end, like dribbling off their
foot or trying to make something happen,'' Robinson said. ``You can
see those type of things starting to take affect after a long
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another long night ended Friday. The Knicks were left to wander
off the court with visions of Robinson and Duncan still fresh as
new wounds in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are right now, we have to be efficient and get some
unexpected scoring, as we did the other night from Kurt,'' said Van
Gundy, referring to Thomas' 13 points in Game 1. ``We have to have
some other guys who are going to put the ball in the basket,
especially when they come to block shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will come.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley played just 13 minutes in Game 2 with a bruised
elbow that limited his mobility throughout the game. Dudley is just
another in a line of banged-up Knicks. The team dressed 10 players
for Game 2, but have just 8 of them playing healthy. ``Obviously,
you'd like to have your full complement,'' Jeff Van Gundy said.
``But the one thing I've learned in the NBA is that there's no
mercy. Nor should there be. As I've told our team, it's not about
who we have or don't have, it's who we have to play. We have to
play better.''  &QL;

   GRAND CANYON, Ariz. _ Mass tourism to the Grand Canyon started
in 1901 with the construction of a Santa Fe Railroad spur to the
south rim. Now, at the century's twilight, the canyon is returning
to its mass-transit roots, breaking ground recently for the first
light rail in a national park.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched in the decades between was the National Park
Service's love affair with the automobile _ scenic drives,
drive-through overlooks, acres of parking and, outside the south
entrance, the kind of development symbolized by a two-story statue
of Fred Flintstone calling out ``Yabba-dabba-doo'' to motorists
looking for a campground.
</P>
<P>
   While work starts this summer on the $100 million light rail
system, which is intended to cut vehicle traffic by 80 percent,
Grand Canyon National Park is innovating on a different front:
refurbishing its tacky commercial gateway.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare collaboration between developers and
environmentalists, nine environmental groups have endorsed a $330
million plan to build a gateway to the park that would include
1,220 hotel rooms and 250,000 square feet of commercial space. In
July, the Forest Service is expected to approve a land swap that
would allow the developer, Canyon Forest Village, to exchange 2,200
acres of private land scattered around the Kaibab National Forest
for 272 acres next to the terminus of the light rail line. There,
trains will leave every seven minutes for the south rim, 8.5 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen what the marketplace has done around the Grand
Canyon _ junk, strip malls, sprawl. We are not interested in seeing
any more of that,'' said Brad Ack, program director of Grand Canyon
Trust, a regional environmental group. Noting that during five
years of negotiations, environmentalists and Indian tribes have won
major changes in the project, he said, ``It's a pretty interesting
approach to environmentalism. Instead of saying no, and losing, we
say yes and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to draw nearly 5 million people this year, the Grand
Canyon is one of the nation's most visited parks. The turn to mass
transit here presages a larger shift in how Americans will visit
their most popular parks in the 21st century, park officials
predict. Over the last 30 years, the number of visitors to American
national parks has nearly doubled, hitting 287 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the big parks, our goal is not to limit people, but to
limit their cars,'' Jackie Lowey, a deputy director of the Park
Service, said recently from Maine, where she was preparing the June
21 inauguration of free shuttle-bus service from Bar Harbor to
sections of Acadia National Park.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Utah, Zion National Park is buying a fleet of buses
that run on clean-burning fuels. Next spring, park officials plan
to close Zion Canyon to cars, shuttling visitors in and out by bus.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, at Denali National Park and Preserve, almost all
motorized access is by van or bus. In Wyoming, at Yellowstone
National Park, and in California, at Yosemite National Park,
officials are studying ways of using buses to reduce traffic. In
announcing the Yosemite study last December, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt said, ``At times, the valley reminds you very much of
being in Times Square in midsummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 40 of the nation's busiest parks, including the
Grand Canyon, have some form of mass-transit system. Here, a steam
railroad continues to take tourists to the canyon and shuttle buses
transport them down West Rim Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors should ``have a park experience, not a parking
experience,'' Robert Arnberger, the Grand Canyon's superintendent,
said at the April 23 groundbreaking for the hub of the new light
rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing down into the mile-deep depths of what some Indians call
the House Made of Dawn at times inspires mystical feelings. But a
one-hour search in 100-degree heat for a parking spot can inspire
fist fights. On a busy summer day, 6,000 vehicles dispute 2,400
parking space in the park's south side, the destination for 90
percent of the park's visitors. The roads and parking lots were
built in the 1960s, when the park had about 1 million visitors a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than building six-lane freeways and multistory parking
garages, park officials have opted for a parking lot for 3,500
vehicles around the transit center at the park's southern entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time for people to embrace this new way of
seeing national parks,'' said Bradley Traver, the park's chief
planner.
</P>
<P>
   At the rim's edge, where tour bus drivers now idle engines to
keep air-conditioning running, a maximum of 4,200 people an hour
will arrive by train, then shift to bicycle and pedestrian trails
or to buses powered by electricity or natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we run diesel-belching monsters for buses, we are part of
the problem,'' Traver said. Air pollution has cut visibility at the
canyon to an average of 110 miles, from 140 miles at the start of
the century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another effort to reduce the mark of man, Interior Department
officials support the Canyon Forest Village development, which
would be built eight miles from the canyon in the Kaibab National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, the Parks Service would demolish substandard
worker housing in the park and build up to 500 housing units in the
new development. Thomas De Paolo, the developer, believes that the
park's high school and medical center can also be moved into the
development.
</P>
<P>
   With a host of new hotel rooms at the park's edge, the Park
Service will demolish two boxy, 1960s lodges on the south rim.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups like the proposal because it calls for
importing water by train and pipeline from a section of the
Colorado River on the Arizona-California line. Hotels in the
gateway town of Tusayan now pump well water from an underground
aquifer, which environmentalists argue robs water that is vital to
the canyon's delicate ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any project that relies on groundwater pumping is
unacceptable,'' said Dave Simon of Albuquerque, regional director
of one watchdog group, the National Parks and Conservation
Association. ``We are going to have one master-plan development in
one area that is already developed, instead of three or four
developments that will smear the problem over a big area,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three Indian tribes of the Colorado Plateau have endorsed the
Canyon Forest plan, largely because the developers promise them
jobs, market space for their wares and a museum that gives weight
to Native American views of the Grand Canyon. Although tourism
injects nearly $1 billion a year into the canyon area, the
surrounding county, Coconino, ranks among the 10 poorest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ack, one of the environmentalists, said from Flagstaff, ``For
the first time, the tribes have been asked to be part of the
economic engine of the Grand Canyon, other than selling trinkets by
the roadside.''

POLITICAL BRIEFS: PHILADELPHIA MAYOR; HOUSE TERM-LIMITS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Philadelphia Star May Shine Wider  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After decades of being mired in urban doldrums, Philadelphia has
resurged and prospered under the guiding hand of Mayor Edward
Rendell. He is now ranked among the nation's best city leaders, one
seemingly with a bright political future should he choose to shoot
for higher office after he completes his present City Hall tour
this year.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Rendell, a moderate Democrat, have in mind?
</P>
<P>
   He has always said that if he seeks elective office again _ and
he insists he has not made up his mind _ his most likely target
will be the governor's office, which will be up for grabs in 2002
when the incumbent, Tom Ridge, a Republican, completes his second
term.
</P>
<P>
   But some national Democratic leaders think they have a better
idea. They want Rendell to run for the U.S. Senate next year when
Pennsylvania's junior senator, Rick Santorum, a conservative
Republican, comes up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, who squeaked into office in 1994 with just 49 percent
of the vote, is generally considered one of the most vulnerable
Republicans in the Senate. As Democratic election strategists
scheming ways to recapture the Senate see it, a strong Democrat
like Rendell might just be able to take Santorum in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, three leading Senate Democrats _ Robert Torricelli
of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, along with Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate
minority leader, and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts _ are
urging the mayor to jump into the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell has told them he will ``think about it.'' But in his
heart, he says, he would rather hold executive office than
legislative office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, should he jump into the Senate contest, he
would have to jump very soon to guarantee he would have enough time
to raise the $10 million or so required to run a good race. Such a
fund-raising effort, he says, would not leave him much time to run
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, should Rendell hold off and run instead for
Governor, he would by no means be assured victory. His first
hurdle, and maybe his highest, likely would be the Democratic
primary, in which his toughest opponent most probably would be
State Auditor General Robert Casey Jr., the son of former Gov.
Robert Casey, one of Pennsylvania's most popular and powerful
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Breaks Promise, Pays a Price  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After months of maybe-maybe not pondering, Rep. George
Nethercutt of Spokane, Wash., finally made up his mind last week.
He will seek a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision did not mark the end of his struggle over
whether to renege on his 1994 campaign promise to serve no more
than three terms. Anything but.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense, the real struggle for Nethercutt, a
conservative Republican, is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   He does not have a Democratic opponent yet. But he has an
opponent nevertheless _ U.S. Term Limits, the leading term-limits
advocacy group and once his leading supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-dozen or so members of the House who so far this
year have broken or are thinking about breaking promises to
voluntarily limit their tours on Capitol Hill, Nethercutt is
perhaps the best known. When he initially made his promise back in
1994, U.S. Term Limits rushed to adopt him as its poster child and
worked mightily to insure his narrow, upset victory over House
Speaker Tom Foley, a 15-term veteran of Congress and a passionate
opponent of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nethercutt's resolve to stick with his promise began to
crumble earlier this year, U.S. Term Limits, embarrassed, had a
change of heart. It took to the Spokane airwaves with ads that
demanded, first humorously but eventually stridently, that he keep
his word.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of that campaign has strengthened the resolve of
U.S. Term Limits to stay on Nethercutt's case. Rather than cancel
the campaign now that the Nethercutt promise lies shattered in
pieces, the organization sees the ad effort as more crucial than
ever to the future of term limits and says that an extra $1 million
will be poured into spots.
</P>
<P>
   A number already are running, some on television, some on radio,
some in newspapers. All were designed, according to Term Limits
officials, to educate voters about term limits and politicians who
``cynically'' break promises to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   In one television spot, a parent asks: ``When a politician
clearly gives his word, then breaks it, how do I explain that to my
children?''
</P>
<P>
   In a radio spot, a Term Limits official labels Nethercutt ``just
another career politician who'd say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper ad says that the word ``Nethercutt'' can now serve
as a verb meaning ``to go back on one's word,'' or ``as an
adjective with its usage synonymous with `hypocrite,' `opportunist'
and `dishonest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is fighting back with his own ad campaign, telling
voters in his district, the Washington 5th, that he feels his work
on Capitol Hill is unfinished and that he made a ``mistake'' five
years ago by promising to limit his time in office.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not without an important ally in the coming fight.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee, deeply worried
about a possible Democratic takeover of the House in 2000, has
promised to do ``anything we can'' to help him hold his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush or Gore, But Who Cares?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like the presidential campaign of 2000 is in full
swing, given all the hoopla about Al Gore and George W. Bush
hitting the campaign trail. But consider what the Pew Research
Center, a major public policy study group, found when it sent its
polltakers out a few days ago to test the nation's political pulse:
</P>
<P>
   Two out of three voters said they were paying little or no
attention to Election 2000 at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Or to quote from the Center's analysis of its findings:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all background noise to the average American voter. Just
1 in 10 Americans are following election stories very closely.
Fully one third are totally tuning campaign news out.''  &QL;

PAST KNICKS PRAISE AND CRITICIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was home in New Jersey, in more or less 3-point range from
Manhattan, after recently having undergone back surgery, and so
could hardly have been in the New York Knicks' lineup. Then again,
he hasn't been in a Knicks' lineup since he retired from basketball
19 years ago, in 1980. But the memories of having been a part of a
championship Knick team for Earl (the Pearl) Monroe, as well as for
his teammates, remain vivid, and have been rekindled with the
appearance of the current Knick team in the National Basketball
Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Frazier and Monroe, who has been involved in business
ventures including the record industry since his retirement,
comprised one of the most exciting and effective backcourts ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Monroe and Frazier _ along with the other starters,
Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere and Willis Reed, and the bench of
Henry Bibby, Dean Meminger, Dick Barnett, Jerry Lucas, John
Gianelli and Phil Jackson, and coached by the late Red Holzman _
won the Knicks' second, and last, NBA title. Those '73 Knicks have
kept an eye on the '99 version.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that they've done so well, since I think
they have the talent to be where they are,'' Monroe said, ``but I'm
just surprised that after all that has gone on in the season that
they're still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe cited the injuries to Patrick Ewing and, most recently,
Larry Johnson, and the organizational upheavals from the demotion
of General Manager Ernie Grunfeld to the controversies surrounding
the playing time of Marcus Camby and a starting role for Latrell
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once Patrick got hurt,'' Monroe said, ``the other
players no longer thought they'd have to defer to him in the
post-up game and guys were allowed to now play their game. They had
been in a system that was not suited to them. And Sprewell came in
and his speed opened up eyes. I thought Johnson started playing a
lot freer. But they also drew inspiration from Patrick's
determination to play when he was in such pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Knicks beat San Antonio? ``The Spurs are a problem
because they are so big and so athletic,'' Monroe said. ``But the
biggest thing the Knicks have going for them is that Houston and
Sprewell can turn games around. If you have two good guards, you
can always be in a position to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Bibby, the third guard in 1973, and now the
coach at Southern California, observed that ``somebody, or
somebodies, has truly brought this Knick team together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's happened is that Jeff Van Gundy has shown his
true colors as a leader and coach,'' Bibby said. ``And maybe it was
Van Gundy who has made this team go from that point. Or Patrick as
an inspirational leader. Or one of the players, Sprewell or Houston
or Camby. And yet it hasn't been just one guy who you can point to.
Everyone on a different night has come up with a big game. You
wonder, when did the light come on for them?''
</P>
<P>
   From Strawberry, Calif., a town of 150 in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, Gianelli, a substitute center in 1973 who now works in
the family business of repairing farm equipment, was impressed with
the Knicks' defense. ``I like how they double-team and rotate,'' he
said. ``Looks to me like they're all on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, the center on the 1970 and 1973 championship teams,
and now an executive with the Nets, said: ``Earlier in the year, I
said that if this team could learn to play together, it could be
very successful. The addition of three new players _ Sprewell,
Camby and Kurt Thomas _ has made a huge difference, and Van Gundy
has learned to coach this team. This group of players has come to
believe in each other, and to accept their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, the Knicks' television analyst, has marveled at the
team's resurgence. ``They remind me of the 1973 team in that we had
injuries to key players _ Willis was out for a while, Earl and Dave
were, too _ and we didn't have a great regular season, either. But
we came together in the playoffs. And guys started to step up, as
they have with the current team. Chris Childs is one of them. I
think he was the catalyst in the Indiana series, the way he held
down Mark Jackson, especially at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   How would the '73 team match up against the '99 group?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd do very well,'' Monroe said. ``We'd be a much smarter
team than, say, Indiana. We wouldn't have let Camby jump over
people. We would have put a body on him. And we had a whole team of
shooters. And we had all veteran players. And we could be more
effective in the half-court offense. The half-court offense was our
forte.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said: ``Not to take anything away from the current bunch,
but we had five starters who were all-pro, plus Lucas and Barnett
who had been all-pro, and I think that Jackson and Gianelli and I
could have started for most other teams. In the finals, I think we
would have beaten them in five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said: ``They are different eras. . . . But we always think
we're better than the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, who died last October at age 78, wrote an
autobiography, ``Red on Red,'' with Harvey Frommer, in 1997. In it,
Holzman said the 1973 team was better than the often more
celebrated 1970 championship Knicks because it ``had a little more
size, depth, dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman's players invariably had a high regard for him, and for
his approach, with its emphasis on defense, seeing the open man and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expected everyone to act as a responsible adult,'' Bradley
has said, ``and he treated players accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   After the team won its first title, in 1970, the owner Irving
Felt ended his remarks at a team party with, ``If Red Holzman
doesn't come to see me tomorrow about changing his contract, then
he's not as smart as I think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman wrote: ``Winning that championship was wonderful.
There's no feeling quite like it, but the way Felt acted was icing
on the cake. It showed his character, appreciation and generosity.
He really didn't have to make that gesture in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, I was in his office the next day.'' &QL;

FOR DEMOCRACY IN UNIONS, PAIR DEFIES LABOR LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In what could be a showdown between union leaders and
rank-and-file members here, Jamie Newman insists that a referendum
she and another bus driver hope to have placed on the state ballot
this November _ a measure that would instill more democracy in
unions _ is ``as American as apple pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a Web site and a network of friends to spread the word and
collect signatures, the two bus drivers are marshaling their forces
for what they consider nothing less than a crusade, saying that
their proposal would get workers more involved in their unions and
ultimately strengthen the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is lighting a fire,'' said Ms. Newman, a
piano tuner who became a bus driver nine years ago. ``Many people
just don't get involved in union matters because there's so little
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But many union leaders view the proposal as a poison pill,
convinced that it will fuel factionalism more than democracy and
will weaken unions' ability to stand up to management. The
proposal, Initiative 702, has alarmed labor leaders not just in
Washington State, but across the nation because they fear it could
spread to other states and even be pushed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For unions and union locals based in Washington state, the
proposal would guarantee members the right to vote on contracts and
pick their officers through direct elections _ rights many union
members do not enjoy. The proposal would also require
government-employee unions to do something that Federal law
requires of private-sector unions: make their financial reports
available to members.
</P>
<P>
   There is one especially contentious provision that many union
leaders say would make factionalism run rampant: any union grouping
that can demonstrate the backing of 5 percent of members could at
its own expense and whenever it wants send out a mailing to all
members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newman and her co-sponsor, Johnny Jackson, an equally
intense, equally brash bus driver, were surprised by organized
labor's vehement reaction to their proposal. The state AFL-CIO
issued a leaflet calling it ``unnecessary, dangerous and illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus drivers, members of the Amalgamated Transit Union,
insist that many union leaders oppose the referendum because
increased democracy could loosen their grip on power and end their
near-monopoly over information sent to members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't require anything that any good unions wouldn't be
doing anyway,'' Jackson said. ``I don't buy that this is destroying
unions. This is going to build unions. What's destroying unions is
totalitarian leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newman and Jackson came up with the proposal after growing
angry at their union's president, who reached an agreement that
they thought was too sympathetic to their employer, King County's
Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The two drivers say they have a simple vision: many unions have
become too bureaucratic and unresponsive, and that has helped cause
labor's membership and influence to shrink. Give union members more
rights, they say, and workers will invigorate their unions.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Initiative 702 say there is a good chance that Ms.
Newman and Jackson will not obtain the 200,000 signatures needed to
get the referendum on the ballot. Confident that the proposal will
win if it gets on the ballot, the two say that if they do not
collect enough signatures this year, they will try again.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also counts on some support in Congress. Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, one of Congress' fiercest critics of labor, told
them that he might introduce a bill containing their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders have seized on these Republican overtures as
evidence that the referendum will undermine the labor movement. Why
else, they ask, would labor's foes in Congress embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state AFL-CIO president Rick Bender said the drivers
were misguided in wanting the public to vote on regulations
affecting unions. ``If you have problems with your local union or
parent union, then convince a majority of the rank and file to
change it,'' he said. ``We don't want to see this go to all the
voters, many of whom know little about how unions function and many
of whom would like to damage unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserving his harshest words for the rule that would allow
mailings whenever dissident groups wanted, Bender said, ``It would
cause a lot of disruption and make it difficult for local unions to
function.'' Some union officials maintain that measures like
Initiative 702 can bring too much democracy into a union, similar
to the way the government of Italy had so many parties and factions
that it could not rule effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newman and Jackson, however, insist that many union leaders
dislike democracy and care little about union members' rights
because they fear that an empowered membership would drive them
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in the civil rights movement, and basically my
upbringing is one about getting rights,'' said Jackson, who grew up
in Florida and Georgia. ``There is very little difference between
workers rights and civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would accept support for Initiative 702, even
from anti-union Republicans, because he was confident his proposal
would strengthen, not sabotage, the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say this is anti-union, my comeback is, which part
is anti-union?'' he said. ``If bringing democracy into unions is
anti-union, something is wrong.''

 &HT;    A REFUGEE'S DIARY: ONE WOMAN'S JARRING RETURN TO KOSOVO
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ One week ago, Florie Topanica began the
jarring emotional passage that more than one million Kosovar
Albanians will make in coming weeks, returning to uncertainty,
sadness and a hard new beginning that will be too daunting for some
even to attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Flora, as she is called, is my translator and now my friend, a
brave young woman who came with me to Kosovo on the day NATO troops
opened the border from Macedonia. Not knowing what awaited beyond
that border, this slight, pretty 25-year-old managed to swallow her
fear of the menace she had left behind in Pristina, when her family
boarded a train on April 3 and became refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was frantic to learn what happened to her home, to her
friends and _ we discovered later _ to her boyfriend, who had been
imprisoned since 1995 for belonging to an illegal political
organization, one agitating for Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her story:
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, June 12 -- Flora called at 8 a.m. as arranged. I had a
surprise. ``Can you be ready at 8:45? We'll go to Pristina today.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious shopping for water, towels, food, a rack for the car,
and we were on the road. The Macedonian driver and another woman
journalist, an old friend from Moscow days, completed the team.
</P>
<P>
   Soon another surprise. The border guard was a Serb, not a NATO
soldier as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian soldiers had hounded Flora's neighbors the day her
family left Pristina, giving them ten minutes to leave or face
death. They had taken her boyfriend Liburn four years earlier. They
had killed some friends and harassed others. Of course she was
scared.
</P>
<P>
   The border guard summoned her from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' said Flora. He started questioning her, but we
intervened. He had no right to stop a journalistic team in a NATO
military convoy with NATO credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He wilted, and we soon advanced into a surreal world of burned
and shattered villages, homes with no families, fields with no
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God. Look at that. Look, there is no one,'' she said
again and again, pointing to roofless houses or gutted stores.
</P>
<P>
   Exhilarating moments when people finally appeared _ ethnic
Albanians joyously greeting our convoy of NATO tanks and trucks _
were followed by near panic once we hit Pristina. We lost the
convoy when we had stopped to talk to villagers, and now we were
alone in the twilight hours in a city thick with armed Serbian
soldiers and police. There was shooting. And no NATO presence in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were at the Grand Hotel, we had heard, but it had
been a Serbian social spot where ethnic Albanians like Flora hadn't
dared go for years. We drove past, and luckily found a NATO tank
and armed soldiers guarding it. One intervened when a Serb driver
yelled at us for parking in a spot he was saving.
</P>
<P>
   Flora was shaken _ as were all of us _ by the time we walked
through the rain into the jammed lobby and up to a mezzanine media
center. Correspondents and hangers on were everywhere, mixed with
Serbian guys in uniforms just hanging out. I linked arms with Flora
and stayed close.
</P>
<P>
   No rooms available, so we slept on the mezzanine floor along
with dozens of other new arrivals. It seemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, June 13 -- In daylight we drove around Pristina,
listening to Belgrade radio play patriotic songs, watching the
mostly Serbian pedestrians glower at us as we passed.
</P>
<P>
   Between news tasks, we went to Flora's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my house,'' she said, as we reached her apartment
building on the main Pristina drag. ``These are our flowers,'' she
said, pointing to the plants on the fourth floor stairs. ``This is
our door.'' It was number 15.
</P>
<P>
   But the key didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Children could be heard somewhere. Was it behind her door, or
another? ``I think there are people inside,'' she whispered. But no
one answered either then or later when we returned.
</P>
<P>
   Then another bad sign. Flora went to the flat of a girlfriend,
and found the gypsy neighbors who had been left the key for
safekeeping had stolen valuables and trashed the place. It was so
filthy that Flora vomited.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a further troubling moment. ``Oh, I think that is my car,''
Flora said, pointing out a red four-door. Her family car, as most
others left behind by refugees, had been stolen. We followed and
watched four big guys get out after they parked by an apartment
building. Maybe it could be pursued later.
</P>
<P>
   A last stop at the International Committee of the Red Cross for
an interview, and Flora added her own question. Did they have lists
of prisoners, especially men transferred from Kosovo prisons into
Serbia as she believe Liburn had been. Sorry. They couldn't help
yet.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY, June 14 -- A morning stop at a headquarters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrillas who fought for independence,
turned up several old buddies, none of whom had news about Liburn.
</P>
<P>
   On the way out a young doctor told us about deep needs for
medical help in this neighborhood. He took us to patients who
included seven emaciated men in four different locations, some
badly injured, all of whom the Serbs suddenly had released from
prisons on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Flora did not have to explain her pale face or subsequent
silence after she translated their stories of prison life _ the
beatings, the filth, meager food, overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Liburn must be like these men, she said, if he is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY, June 15 -- With a Red Cross food convoy we drove to a
mountain town about an hour to the west, where Kosovar Albanians
were returning from hideouts higher up in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   The vexing problem Flora kept pondering: how to break into her
family's apartment without getting blown up, if it's boobytrapped,
or shot, if it's occupied by Serbian squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we re-visited a returned refugee who had watched in
frustration on Monday the Serbian troops going in and out of his
house that they had taken over in April. Children who got into the
gated compound said the soldiers were filling their trucks with his
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Serbs had pulled out, and he returned to find utter
devastation. Flora was so disturbed that she almost got sick again.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY, June 16 -- Suddenly a stellar day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful news!'' Flora said. She had learned that her
brother, here as a translator for NATO troops, had broken the lock
on the family apartment. No one was inside, but all their
possessions were. Someone must have tampered with the lower lock,
perhaps trying to get in while the family was in refuge in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   She found the apartment exactly as her family had left it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my desk. These are my books,'' she said, touching them
as though they were treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a double header.
</P>
<P>
   Later we drove up to the hillside neighborhood that was the site
of her father's small plastic bottle factory. He is an economist _
as Flora is studying to become _ but lost his job in a government
institute after Yugoslavia's Serb-dominated government withdrew
Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 and installed a Serbian provincial
administration. Without the factory, he worried, the family would
have no income.
</P>
<P>
   Their luck was phenomenal. The one-room factory also was intact,
the machinery we saw through a busted window seemed complete, the
building not grenaded or shelled as so many there had been.
</P>
<P>
   We needed to talk that day to Serbs who were becoming the next
round of refugees, but we didn't even ask Flora to translate for
us. She still felt the Serbs hated her, and she knew she held no
liking for them. She agreed with most Kosovar Albanians that Kosovo
would fare best without a Serbian population.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, June 17 and beyond -- Devastation is everywhere.
Nothing much works. Thousands of people are missing or in prison.
Flora has a small, but whole apartment for her family. She has no
permanent job. And the man she loves is still in danger, if, as she
said, he is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The numbing reports of atrocities by Serb forces are being
joined now by increasing numbers of stories about KLA fighters and
other angry ethnic Albanians exacting retribution through
kidnappings or shootings.
</P>
<P>
   One day we passed a wrecked car, whose Kosovar Albanian driver
had been shot as he traveled down the street. The next day we
passed ethnic Albanian men being detained by NATO troops on
suspicion of murdering a Serbian civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Flora is disturbed about what these acts portend, but she tries
to be positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are confused now. They only think, 'Oh, look what
happened to me,''' she said. ``Things will calm down. It will get
better.''
</P>

OPPOSING CAMPS SQUARE OFF AT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ABOUT DRUG
LEGALIZATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: RESTORES dropped words in 18th graf: Suggesting the...) 
(ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Calif., Colo., Fla., Ind., Ga., Md., Nev.,
N.Y., Ore., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress seldom meets a hearing that it doesn't
like, but the one that Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., convened on
Wednesday raised quite a few hackles.
</P>
<P>
   Its topic: ``The Pros and Cons of Drug Legalization,
Decriminalization and Harm Reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, the first on the subject since 1988, was motivated
by suspicions on Capitol Hill that legalization of drugs is the
ultimate goal of people who actively promote marijuana as a
medicinal palliative or advocate giving sterile syringes to heroin
addicts to prevent them from contracting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing illustrated Congress' reluctance to rethink the war
against drugs, on which the federal government spends nearly $18
billion a year. And it presaged the sort of discourse about drugs
bound to surface in next year's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a politically risk-free area,'' said Eric E. Sterling, a
former counsel to the House Judiciary Committee who helped draft
the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts passed in 1986 and 1988. Sterling, who is
president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, attended the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No member of Congress is going to lose a vote because they're
tough on drugs,'' he said. ``And it attracts media attention. I
suspect pollsters would tell members of Congress that this is a
very good area to be outspoken in.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing itself drew protests from opposing camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have hearings called `The Pros and Cons of Rape,'''
said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who is on the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   And Ethan A. Nadelmann, the director of the Lindesmith Center, a
New York-based group working to change drug policy, dismissed the
hearing as ``an effort to smear the many moderate proposals for
drug-policy reform with the broad and false brush of radical
legalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was largely prompted by voter initiatives to approve
medicinal marijuana in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Oregon, Nevada Washington and the District of Columbia. The
initiatives were financed in part by the billionaire investor
George Soros, who has also reportedly contributed about $10 million
to the Lindesmith Center and the Drug Policy Foundation, two groups
spearheading the effort to change the way that Americans view
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that one side was doing all the talking
and there really needed to be a congressional response to this,''
said Bobby Charles, the chief counsel for the Subcommittee on
Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, which held the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired general who is the White
House's national director of drug control policy, put it more
bluntly. ``We're getting rolled in the public arena by very clever
people,'' he told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, McCaffrey described a campaign of deception
and half-truths to erode society's disapproval of marijuana and
harder drugs, to which 4.1 million Americans are now addicted.
While 82 percent of the public oppose making illicit drugs legal,
he said, there is ``a carefully camouflaged, well-funded, tightly
knit core of people whose goal is to legalize drugs in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann did not attend the hearing, contending that the
subcommittee had disinvited him. ``They might have held hearings on
whether current federal drug policies are doing more harm than
good,'' he said. ``Instead, they decided to hold a hearing on the
`drug legalization movement,' which is essentially a figment of
their imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles said none of the subcommittee members wanted to legalize
drugs themselves. But Mica, he said, believed ``that an open and
honest debate only serves the cause of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other subcommittee members expressed unhappiness that the
hearing was even taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalization is a surrender to despair,'' said Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, Republican of upstate New York. ``It cannot and ought
not be any topic of serious discussion in our nation's debate of
the challenges of illicit drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting the depth of hostility toward the notion of legal
drugs, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., asked whether anti-racketeering laws
could be used to prosecute people conspiring to legalize drugs.
McCaffrey shot back that doing so ``would have a chilling effect on
the right of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey assured the subcommittee that ``I am not open-minded
about drug abuse in America.'' But afterwards, he said he wished
that there had been a fuller exposition of the legalization
argument. ``I want people to come out and say what they believe,
and be subject to cross-examination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Glasser, who testified before the subcommittee as executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said, ``I think
they are engaged in an effort to discredit and attack and
intimidate people who disagree with them.'' Glasser, who is also
president of the Drug Policy Foundation, said in his testimony,
``The government has demonized all drug use without
differentiation, has systematically and hysterically resisted
science and has turned millions of stable and productive citizens
into criminals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,
which wants marijuana legally available, said they were excluded.
Charles said there was not enough room for everyone. ``I think
there will be future hearings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann was one of several people whom McCaffrey accused of
advocating drug legalization. McCaffrey quoted Nadelmann as having
said in 1990, ``Personally, when I talk about legalization, I mean
three things: the first is to make drugs such as marijuana, cocaine
and heroin legal.'' The rest of Nadelmann's sentence, which was
omitted at the hearing, said `` ... under fairly restricted
conditions, but not as restricted as today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann said he was quoted out of context. ``My secret agenda
is not the legalization of drugs,'' he said. ``It's the creation of
a drug policy based upon common sense, science, public health and
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Edolphus
Towns of Brooklyn, urged their subcommittee colleagues to consider
helping the victims of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution is that we have a humane society so people don't
grow up feeling they have to do these things,'' Cummings said.
``And when they do these things, they need appropriate treatment.''

SERB POLICE EXIT JOKING, BUT MENACE LINGERS ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The Serb special policemen _ all over 6
feet tall, thickset, dressed in green camouflage bearing the
double-headed eagle of Yugoslav forces and unit patches _ were
relaxed, joking, their automatic rifles propped against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, their withdrawal from Kosovo appeared fairly
painless. Cooperation with NATO is smooth. ``We are professionals,
and they are professionals,'' said one policeman. ``But the French
troops are very small, at least a head smaller than us,'' he added,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the studied relaxation and the jokes, there was a sense
of lingering menace here. None of the policemen would give their
names, saying they were not permitted to give interviews. But they
enjoyed chatting, peppering the jokes with aggressive boasts and
unprintable language, relishing their aura of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians on the street Saturday gave a wide berth to the
apartment buildings that these policemen have used as a base and
that are the only buildings on the street not to bear the scars of
war. The Albanians stayed on the other side of the street, picking
their way through broken glass and tiles, heads down.
</P>
<P>
   The division of the two populations was stark. Serb civilians
were loading belongings into cars and said they planned to leave
with the police. One Serb man, the only resident of the building
who had opted to stay, sat beside the police.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that they accepted the peace deal as a political
decision and that it was their job to obey.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO will have its hands full with the Albanians _ they are
wild people,'' said one policeman in a canvas sun hat. ``If NATO
cannot do the job, we will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the policemen were from Mitrovica and said they did not
know where they were going now; they were awaiting orders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they thought of President Slobodan Milosevic, one
policeman did not hesitate. ``He is a good man, I hope he lives
until he is 100 years,'' he said. ``And I will be on the first
train to kill him.'' That drew laughter from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their commander, who spoke English, was more reflective.
``People are feeling bad,'' he said. ``They are joking about
everyday things, but no one feels good about leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb state was obliged to fight the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, he said, acknowledging, however, that the rebels
were already back in large numbers. ``This is Serbia,'' he said.
``We had to fight the extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe it's time to try a peaceful way,'' he added, looking
at the looted and burned Albanian stores opposite. ``I do not know
what happened here, but NATO bombed, and this was the revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought hard about whether Kosovo would become an Albanian
entity. Serbs will leave western Kosovo, on the border with
Albania, he predicted, but maybe return to northern towns, like
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are not going to be any help to Kosovo's Serbs, he
added. ``That they came here and took the airport was only good for
them, not for the Serbs,'' he said. ``It was just to score a
political point.''

LEE AND THE IBF MAY FACE CHARGES BY U.S. GRAND JURY

 (ATTN: Mexico, Venezuela, N.J.)  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make

(DW) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, Robert W. Lee Sr. quietly formed the International
Boxing Federation. If the announcement lacked both drama and
publicity, Lee did not lack for ambition: the IBF, he pledged,
would be built from scratch with the idea that it would objectively
rank the world's top fighters and create its own set of legitimate
championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of a new boxing organization, one that claimed it
wanted to clean up a sport rife with wrongdoing, Lee was a curious
candidate to play the part of maverick reformer.
</P>
<P>
   He had never been a serious boxer or trainer or promoter, having
spent most of his professional life as a homicide detective in
Hudson County, N.J. More odd, however, Lee, at the very moment he
was creating the IBF, was deputy commissioner of the New Jersey
Athletic Commission, a governmental agency charged with monitoring
boxing in the state. Federal agents investigating corruption in
boxing in the early 1980s had said they had evidence that Lee
accepted illegal payoffs in his job with the state commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, none of it _ a lack of experience, a possible
conflict of interest, a brush with the FBI _ mattered. Lee founded
the IBF (originally calling it the U.S. Boxing Association
International), and within months staged its first championship
fight. For the last 16 years, the IBF, along with the World Boxing
Council and the World Boxing Association, has functioned as one of
the sport's three sanctioning organizations, and thus as one of its
most powerful forces.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF has anointed champions, but it also has been sued by
fighters who have claimed, among other things, that its ranking
system was fixed. It has made millions of dollars, but has also
been at the center of some of the sport's great embarrassments _
most recently when the performance of a judge it appointed in the
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight March 13 set off a New York
City criminal investigation into whether the bout was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lee and the IBF, and with them another layer of boxing's
credibility, seem to be in additional peril.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Newark, in a broad grand jury
investigation that predates the Holyfield-Lewis debacle, have been
submitting evidence of possible criminal conduct by the IBF, which
is based in East Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is looking into whether the IBF accepted payoffs
in return for ranking certain fighters. Over the last year, the
organization's financial records have been seized; promoters,
managers and boxers have been questioned about a variety of
improper schemes, and the promoter Don King, who has worked closely
with the IBF over the years, has said he believes prosecutors have
targeted Lee and the IBF in an attempt to ultimately indict him.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has denied any wrongdoing, saying he believes he is being
investigated because prosecutors have failed in their attempts to
go after the WBC and the WBA, which are based in Mexico and
Venezuela, respectively. ``I'm an easy target because I'm in the
United States,'' Lee said a few weeks ago. ``I'm here, and I'm
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   King, whose business offices in Florida were raided by federal
agents this month, said before the raid that he expected to be
indicted, but also predicted that he would be exonerated. According
to people who have testified before the grand jury, prosecutors
have focused on him because they are interested in seeing whether
he might have used his influence over Lee to turn the IBF and its
titles into his own fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're trying to get Bob Lee,'' King said, ``but it
always ends up with me. I've been indicted all my life. But I'm not
going to deal with smokescreens and hypotheticals, and I'm not
going to give up my most basic right _ the presumption of
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing's sanctioning organizations have long drawn criticism.
The WBC and the WBA operated as fringe groups in the sport until
the early 1960s, publishing rankings of fighters and designating
their own sets of champions, but being all but ignored by the most
powerful promoters and fighters. That changed in the late 1970s
when television networks, reacting to repeated scandals in boxing,
turned to the two organizations in an attempt to create a credible
mechanism for ranking fighters and staging legitimate championship
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having been enlisted to help the networks and the sport,
the newly powerful organizations were soon criticized for their own
alleged misdeeds _ manipulating their rankings, extracting enormous
sums of money from fighters, establishing alliances with promoters
that called into question the integrity of both fights and
champions.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee on governmental affairs conducted the most
recent U.S. Senate investigation of boxing in 1992, it did not look
into the sanctioning organizations and their ranking systems, so
convinced was it of their illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so universally accepted that they're arbitrary and
subject to manipulation that we didn't think it would serve any
purpose to spend six months looking into them,'' said Paul Feeney,
a legislative aide to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz..
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was a scandal involving how boxers were
ranked that lifted the sanctioning organizations to positions of
real influence. In 1977, during a boxing tournament televised by
ABC Sports, it was revealed that the rankings of the boxers
involved, then set by The Ring magazine's experts, were flawed, and
that the records of some boxers were bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, ABC turned to the WBA and the WBC, which had been
formed decades before. The organizations took over the ranking of
the top boxers, deciding who would fight whom and when.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations, which made occasional nods toward the
interests of fighters _ establishing safety regulations such as
shortening the lengths of championship fights _ became the
beneficiary of television's effort to, in effect, purchase
credibility. Executives from ABC and other networks paid the
organizations for the right to broadcast a sanctioned fight, and
fighters gave up a piece of their purse for the privilege of having
a shot at a sanctioning organization's title.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, a dynamic of widespread coziness took hold.
</P>
<P>
   The interests at work in this dynamic were easy to see. One one
hand, television executives eager to offer the viewing public a
reliable product came to depend on at least the surface seriousness
of, say, a W.B.C.-sanctioned championship, one to be fought for by
boxers whose rankings said they were deserving. On the other hand,
the promoters ingratiated themselves with the sanctioning bodies,
recognizing that title fights meant more money. And the sanctioning
bodies set fees for their championships, often taking as much as
three percent of each fighter's purse.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long, then, for people in boxing to conclude
that in using the sanctioning bodies to name champions, set
rankings and strip fighters of their titles if they did not box
designated opponents, one scandal had simply replaced another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Bob Arum, a longtime promoter, claimed in a magazine
article that a WBA official, Pepe Cordero, had extorted $500,000
from him in order for Arum's fighter, Ray Mancini, to gain a
championship fight. Arum repeated the charge in a recent interview.
Cordero, who was never charged or disciplined as a result of the
allegation, died years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, made similar allegations. In the end, the FBI's
early-1980's study did not result in the prosecution of major fight
figures, but investigators nevertheless formed some conclusions
about the sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They collect percentages of a fighter's purse in sanctioning
fees every time he fights,'' Joseph Spinelli, a former agent who
led the investigation, said. ``No one knows where it goes or who it
goes to. They're not accountable to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many promoters are quite frank about their efforts to get close
to the sanctioning organizations. It has been a ritual for years,
for example, for promoters to underwrite the costs of the
organizations' annual conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everything else,'' said the promoter Butch Lewis,
whose records on his dealings with the IBF have been subpoenaed by
the FBI in the current investigation. ``You go to the conventions,
put on a cocktail party, you make donations to the conventions.
That's what you do to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marley, a former publicist for King who now manages a
number of boxers, agreed that the relationships between promoters
and sanctioning organizations could look suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always hints being dropped,'' Marley said of
rankings being put up for sale. ``If you're a discerning manager
you see them. I can't give you any evidence. I don't have any
receipts. I don't think guys are bringing bags of cash and handing
them out to these organizations. But they do things like buy
wedding presents for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing always has attracted eclectic characters _ from the
heroic to the criminal, the comic to the sad. Thus the story of Bob
Lee and his rise within boxing is not entirely difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who at 67 is among the most powerful people in the game as
the head of the IBF, was not much of a boxer as a youth, a broken
finger cutting short his career after four fights. He served as a
detective with the Hudson County Police Department, later lost an
election for sheriff in Union County, and then took up a
bureaucrat's job in the New Jersey consumer affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, though, Lee was assigned to assist Althea Gibson, the
former tennis great, in her job as the state's athletic
commissioner. Part of his job was helping attract boxing events to
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, questions were raised about Lee's
conduct. In 1980, the FBI, then conducting its initial
investigation into boxing, said an undercover agent had made an
audiotape that recorded Lee's acceptance of a bribe as payment for
granting a promoter's license. Though the investigation did not
result in indictments, the agents gave information on Lee to the
New Jersey authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has maintained that the bribery claim is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   State officials did not take action against Lee on the bribery
accusation, but four years later they did force his removal from
office. Lee, it turned out, had worked for the WBA, and later
formed the IBF, while he continued to work at his state job
overseeing boxing. In 1984, after an investigation by the state
attorney general's office, Lee was forced by the New Jersey
Investigation Commission to give up his state job because of what
were termed ethical misjudgments. Among the findings was that Lee
had solicited funds for the IBF from the very boxing people he was
regulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he saw his role as more boosterism than regulator,''
said James Morley, who headed the state investigation. ``Most of
those guys thought they were there to find ways to get more boxing
in New Jersey, not to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woodworth, the manager of Roberto Garcia, the IBF's junior
lightweight champion, said Lee's unusual route to becoming the head
of a sanctioning organization was a damning commentary on the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there's something wrong with these organizations when
Bob Lee can go from being fired as a state commissioner to being
president of a sanctioning organization,'' Woodward said. ``But
this is the business of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At least one boxing manager, Ron Weathers, said he had told the
grand jury in Newark that part of that business involved direct
payoffs to the IBF Weathers said in a recent interview that he had
told prosecutors of ``several occasions'' on which he had made
improper payments in order to get his fighters ranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' Weathers said of the IBF and the other
sanctioning bodies, ``you could only do business with these
organizations if you paid them.''
</P>
<P>
   One fighter, William Guthrie, gave a sworn statement two years
ago claiming that the IBF's tactics could involve tools other than
money. Guthrie, a former IBF lightweight champion, sued King,
alleging that in using his influence with Lee, King had told Lee
not to grant Guthrie a title fight if Guthrie decided to sign with
a different promoter. Guthrie said Lee had told him that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt what they were saying was true,'' Guthrie said
in an interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he has been singled out for criticism and punishment
because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two predecessors, Abe Greene and Joe Maloney, who were both
white, they had done the same thing I did,'' Lee said. ``I copied
what they did. Yet they never found them to be in ethical
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the state attorney general's investigation, Lee continued
to be haunted by his past. In 1992, he was called before the Senate
committee and was asked to answer questions about the FBI's claim
that he had taken a bribe in 1980. Lee repeatedly invoked his Fifth
Amendment privilege and declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the stuff they were talking about,'' Lee said
recently, ``nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Much, though, was happening with the IBF. Marvin Hagler fought
in its first championship event in 1983. Larry Holmes soon became
one of its champions. Its conventions attracted all the major
promoters. Lee's son, Robert W. Lee Jr., became a senior officer.
The organization's coffers filled with cash, as it took a greater
percentage of a fighter's purse than any other sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of fighters who have come through here and have
been world champions, I'm happy about that,'' Lee said as he sat in
the IBF's offices. ``If you think about it, we've put a lot of
money in the pockets of these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBF has only five full-time employees, and its finances are
not subject to any kind of independent oversight. According to
people who have testified before the grand jury in Newark,
prosecutors are looking into the question of whether improper
payments to IBF officials were made through the overcharging of
sanctioning fees.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about how the IBF has conducted its business have
certainly been widespread for years. Arum, the promoter who claimed
he was required to pay off a WBA official for a prize fight more
than a decade ago, said that his early optimism about the IBF
quickly dissipated, and that he has given testimony before the
Newark grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were American guys who weren't going to be corrupt,''
Arum said he once thought. But, he said, ``I began hearing rumors
as early as the end of the 1980s that guys were paying for
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The current federal investigation of the IBF, according to law
enforcement officials, grew directly out of a lawsuit brought
against the organization by Michael Moorer, a former heavyweight
champion. In his 1994 suit, Moorer argued that he had been wrongly
denied the IBF's No. 1 ranking, and had instead been leapfrogged by
two less-deserving boxers, including Francois Botha, a King fighter
who moved from No. 4 to No. 1. Moorer said he had been told by Lee
that he was not fighting frequently enough to merit the top slot.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case, Moorer and his lawyers obtained the
testimony of managers and television executives. The promoter Dan
Duva, then president of Main Events, said in an affidavit that the
IBF official in charge of rankings, Doug Beavers, had told him that
Lee ordered that Botha be ``unilaterally'' moved to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most provocative testimony came from Seth
Abraham, president of Time Warner-HBO Sports. He said in a sworn
statement that King had outlined for him how he would have Botha
moved ahead of Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is indeed what happened,'' Abraham said in a recent
interview. ``There is no secret Don knows how to use the
organizations better than anyone I know. But quite frankly all the
promoters do what the organizations allow them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was settled, and, according to John Davimos,
Moorer's manager, the fighter received $3 million and a promise
that he could fight for the IBF title in the future. He fought for
the title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But according to lawyers involved in the suit, as well as a
number of people who have testified before the grand jury,
prosecutors were intrigued enough by the allegations in the case to
start their own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of promoters, including Butch Lewis and Cedric Kushner,
have either testified before the grand jury or turned over many of
the financial records of their dealings with the IBF
</P>
<P>
   King and others have said that they believe the government's
case has been helped by the work of Beavers, the former IBF
rankings official, who they say worked as an informant for
prosecutors over the last year or more. Beavers, who has since left
the IBF, did not return repeated telephone calls seeking a
response.
</P>
<P>
   George Foreman, who once held the IBF's heavyweight title, also
testified before the grand jury. He said he was questioned
extensively about knowledge of kickbacks for rankings. Foreman said
he told prosecutors he had no direct knowledge of such payoffs, but
that he believed such schemes existed.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the promoters as well as the sanctioning organization
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard the old expression, `Can two walk together
unless they agree?''' Foreman said. ``I believe that's the way it
works.''

LAUTENBERG REJECTS PARTY'S PLEA TO OPPOSE WHITMAN FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Fearing that they don't have a candidate who can
defeat Christie Whitman and retain a Senate seat their party has
held for almost two decades, Democrats from President Clinton on
down urged Sen. Frank Lautenberg last month to cancel his plans to
retire and instead run for re-election, Democratic officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But Lautenberg, 75, said Friday that after considering the idea,
he told party officials he would not run again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision that I plan to stick by,'' said Lautenberg,
who was reluctant to discuss the details of his talks. ``Frankly,
it's flattering to hear lots of these comments. I don't know where
they were before I had said I wasn't going to run.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lautenberg unexpectedly announced that he would not
seek a fourth term, prompting Whitman, a Republican, to declare her
candidacy and setting off a struggle among Democrats in New Jersey
to determine their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The front-running Democrats are former Gov. Jim Florio, who lost
a re-election bid to Whitman in 1993, and Jon Corzine, the former
co-chairman of the investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., a
political newcomer who is virtually unknown outside the financial
world but has a personal fortune estimated at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The party has been sharply divided between Florio's loyalists in
southern New Jersey and those who have banded together behind
Corzine because they fear a Whitman-Florio rematch would end
disastrously for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Committee chairman Thomas Giblin has been
trying to minimize the differences between the Florio and Corzine
factions of the party and has scheduled a meeting for Monday at
which Florio, Corzine and the five other potential Senate
candidates will meet with the 21 county leaders. But Giblin
conceded that there are few signs that they will reach a consensus
on a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls have shown Mrs. Whitman with a
substantial lead over Florio, who became widely unpopular after he
pushed through the largest tax increase in state history within six
months of taking office in 1990. The governor also leads Corzine,
who has no political track record and little name recognition. But
Lautenberg pointed out that with 17 months until Election Day,
there is still plenty of time for either of the leading Democratic
contenders to overtake Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is writing off the candidacy of Jim Florio or Jon
Corzine,'' Lautenberg said. ``I think they are good people. But
it's a question of how secure they can be in a race against a
fairly popular governor. Folks have encouraged me because they
think it's possible to beat her. We'll have to wait to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders began lobbying Lautenberg in early May, when
Hillary Clinton, who was in New Jersey to visit the Kosovar
refugees who had just arrived at Fort Dix, asked him to reconsider.
The next day, according to a Democrat who is familiar with the
effort, a group of senior Democratic senators invited Lautenberg to
a more formal meeting, where he was again urged to run and was
promised financial support.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 days that followed, Lautenberg was lobbied by
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and at least one member
of the Cabinet, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Each of the Democratic leaders argued that, as an
incumbent, Lautenberg would stand the best chance of retaining the
seat for the Democrats and helping the party make inroads into the
Republicans' 55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was not
involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But before Congress adjourned for its Memorial Day recess,
Lautenberg told party leaders that he would not be persuaded to
enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   Giblin said he fears that a deep split over the Senate candidate
could damage the party's chances to retain the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job,'' he said, ``is to make sure that if there is a
primary, it doesn't end up so heated that the person who loses''
refuses to back the winner in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have their own worries about the race. Despite
having run three statewide races _ including a 1990 loss to Sen.
Bill Bradley _ Whitman has never won more than 49 percent of the
vote and in 1997 was nearly defeated for re-election by Democrat
Jim McGreevey. The 2000 Senate race will also be run during a
presidential election, when voter turnout in heavily Democratic
urban areas is traditionally high.

FRANCINE EVERETT, STAR OF ALL-BLACK MOVIES, IS DEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)   By MEL WATKINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Francine Everett, a singer, dancer and actress who
was one of the stars of the all-black cast ``race'' movies of the
'30s and '40s, died at a nursing home in the Bronx on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   She gave her birth year as 1920, however by 1933 she was already
appearing with the Four Black Cats, a nightclub variety act.
Shortly thereafter, she began acting with the Federal Theater in
Harlem, which was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying the actor Rex Ingram, she moved to Hollywood in
1936. Upon her arrival, she is said to have turned down a part as
one of the angels in the Warner Brothers all-black spectacle
``Green Pastures,'' in which her husband starred as De Lawd, and
she later refused to accept the stereotypical roles of servants
that were offered by the studios.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Ingram ended in divorce in 1939, and Ms. Everett
returned to Harlem. She quickly became a familiar face as a lead in
low-budget, independently produced black films like ``Keep
Punching'' (1939), which starred the boxing champion Henry
Armstrong; ``Big Timers'' (circa 1945), which featured Moms Mabley
and Stepin Fetchit, and ``Dirty Gerty From Harlem U.S.A.'' (1946),
which was directed by Spencer Williams Jr., who later portrayed
Andy in the ``Amos 'n' Andy'' television series.
</P>
<P>
   Among her Hollywood film credits were bit parts in ``Lost
Boundaries'' (1949) and in Sidney Poitier's first film, ``No Way
Out'' (1950), which was her final appearance on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment historian Henry T. Sampson said that Ms.
Everett and Edna Mae Harris were the last of the leading ladies of
the all-black films. The cultural historian and lecturer Delilah
Jackson said that Billy Rowe, an editor of The Pittsburgh Courier
and writer for The Amsterdam News in New York, called Ms. Everett
``the most beautiful woman in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   The former actor and award-winning filmmaker and producer
William Greaves said that Ms. Everett ``was a true legend of black
film and theater, one of the top stars of the '40s race movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``She would have been a superstar in Hollywood were it
not for the apartheid climate in America and the movie industry at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her arresting looks may not have benefited her career as a
Hollywood player at a time when black actresses were rarely
portrayed as glamorous, but they served her well as a model and
singer.
</P>
<P>
   As a vocalist, Ms. Everett appeared in more than 50
``soundies,'' short musical films featuring the most renowned jazz
and popular musicians of the 1940s. One was the 1947 release
``Ebony on Parade,'' which starred Dorothy Dandridge, Cab Calloway
and the Count Basie band. She was also a popular print model who
appeared in clothing and cosmetic advertisements in the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by an aunt, Lucy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Everett retired from show business in the 1950s. She held a
clerical job at Harlem Hospital until her retirement in 1985. But
she maintained a keen interest in black film and entertainment. She
was a member of the Negro Actors' Guild and often lectured and
participated on panels and in seminars sponsored by the
International Agency for Minority Artists Affairs, which promotes
black films.

N.Y. COLUMN: LAST RESORT, AND ROUNDUP, FOR THE GEESE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   LAKE CARMEL, N.Y. _ They are to the suburbs what pigeons are to
the city, only bigger, meaner, hungrier and dirtier. They are
Canada geese, and here in Putnam County, the turf war between folk
and fowl is about to get down to the pinfeathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried everything else,'' said Annmarie Baisley,
supervisor of Kent, a town of 13,000 that includes Lake Carmel. A
former county auditor, she knows how to add the facts to reach the
truth, however distasteful. ``We've tried growing the buffer up and
we've tried mowing the buffer down and we've tried treating the
eggs. Now we're going to try this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next two weeks or so (``Can't tell you when,''
Mrs. Baisley said. ``Secret.'') wildlife specialists will surround
the flock of about 150 geese that inhabit Lake Carmel, herd them
into pens and ship them off to a meatpacker as food for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly unbroken chain of geese-flecked suburbs stretching
from Boston to the Outer Banks, it will be only the second time an
East Coast municipality has resorted to the ultimate step in goose
management: a federally authorized roundup and slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a comfortable decision,'' said Kathy Doherty, who has
been handling the details in Lake Carmel's goose wars. ``But it's
the only thing left for us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Clarkstown, in Rockland County, became the
first town in New York to get the state and federal permits to
catch and kill geese. It captured and slaughtered a total of 452
birds in 1996 and 1997, and the number of nests in the town's
parks, once about 200, declined to 168. But the outcry from
protesters was so fierce that the town gave up on future roundups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do it again because three members of our town board
caved to the pressure, and I think `caved' is the right word,''
said Clarkstown Supervisor Charles Holbrook. And now the number of
nests is up to 187.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Lake Carmel's residents believe they have found the
right combination in Mrs. Baisley and Mrs. Doherty to make the case
for the goose roundup here. Mrs. Doherty, 44, who describes herself
as a housewife _ her husband is an electrical contractor _ is the
volunteer chairwoman of Lake Carmel's advisory committee. She has
worked the phones, the fax and the copying machine to sound out the
experts, weigh the alternatives and secure the necessary permits
for the roundup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baisley, the elected supervisor with a no-nonsense attitude
and an unflinching gunfighter's gaze, does not offer her age _ ``I
have a son in high school and I don't want his friends to find out
that I'm old enough to be his grandmother,'' she said. It has been
her job to muster the votes on the Town Board and to deflect the
accusations of murder and worse from animal rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the point guy; she's the brains,'' Mrs. Baisley said. What
the two have in common, besides each being the mother of four sons,
is the sense that the 200-acre, artificial lake they live by is
being choked by goose droppings, while the jogging paths, bathing
beaches and grassy borders of the lake are encrusted with guano.
</P>
<P>
   Five years of ``addling'' the goose eggs _ killing the embryos _
failed to limit the goose population, they said, and the
alternatives to the roundup have no appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkstown, for example, is spending $36,000 a year to rent
border collies to chase the birds from its parks, but Lake Carmel
is a residential colony set around the water, where barking dogs
would be as much a nuisance as the geese.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting them, with the houses so close, would be illegal. So
now, in late spring, most of the Lake Carmel geese are so heavily
molted that they will soon become flightless. At the right moment,
the roundup crew will move in and Lake Carmel will find out what it
gets for the $8,000 it is paying to have the geese captured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Doherty continues to work as a kind of Mother
anti-Goose to municipalities up and down the Hudson River,
including Bronxville, Yonkers, Putnam Valley and East Fishkill,
that have called for her packet of how-tos on goose removal. ``The
protesters are saying we're going for the easy answers, but this
isn't easy,'' Mrs. Doherty said. ``All we're trying to do is
restore a little balance.''

WASHINGTON'S TEEN-AGER CURFEW TO START SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With school out for the summer, teen-agers
nationwide can look forward to two months of freedom and carefree
summer nights. But not here in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday that teen-agers do not
have an unrestricted right to roam the streets late at night and
that a youth curfew is constitutional. The law, an effort to reduce
crime, bars those under 17 from being in a public place
unaccompanied by a parent or guardian between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Monday through Thursday, and midnight to 6 a.m. Friday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that the Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 does not infringe on the
rights of children or the rights of parents to raise their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling lifts an injunction that has
prevented Washington police from enforcing the law since 1996.
Supporters of the curfew said enforcement was likely to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the curfew could result in 25 hours of community
service for young offenders. Parents could be ordered to pay fines
up to $500 for allowing children to disobey the curfew. There are
eight exceptions to the law, including errands sanctioned by
parents or guardians, emergencies and certain kinds of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lawrence Silberman wrote the opinion that was joined at
least in part by eight others on the 11-member court. It found that
although young people are generally afforded the same
constitutional guarantees as adults, the state must account for
their ``unique vulnerability and immaturity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ecstatic, vindicated and pleased,'' said Harold Brazil,
a Democrat on the District Council, who sponsored the original law
four years ago. ``We have given police another tool to fight crime
and protect youngsters. It is very timely in the wake of all this
youth violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other council members, however, did not share Brazil's
enthusiasm. ``I am a little bit disappointed,'' said Phil
Mendelson, another Democrat on the council. ``As a government, we
have to be circumspect about laws that curtail freedom. If we want
to cut crime we need to deal more with the problems associated with
crime, not people being out of their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Henig of George Washington University, who specializes
in urban policy and directs the university's Washington Area
Studies Center, says that the success of the law lies in the
enforcement. ``If the police choose to use it as a tool, it could
have some positive effects,'' Henig said. ``But having a law on the
books with spotty and erratic enforcement could be worse than
nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is critical of the law,
viewing it as an infringement of free movement. In addition, the
ACLU contends that the law intrudes on parents' rights to raise
their children as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people are not acting illegally and irresponsibly
and they have their parents' permission, then they should be
allowed to move freely,'' said a former ACLU president, Robert
Plotkin. ``The curfew presumes that all parents are making bad
decisions and bad choices as a blanket rule.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This was at one of those off-day news conferences in San Antonio
the other day, the coach of the Knicks being asked, once again, if
he felt personally vindicated by making it all the way to the NBA
finals after being one Miami bounce of the ball from the
unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy tried to say the right thing, to be the polished
diplomat, but the longer he went on, the more the victim lurking
inside him cried out to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you get used to, if they can get you on results,
they get you on results,'' he said. ``If they can't get you on
results, they get you on relationships. So they're going to get you
on something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the front row, without intending to, I found myself
blurting out, `Who is `they?'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy suddenly looked like the napping kid in the back of
the class, called on to explain the theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in general,'' he stammered. ``I mean, whoever _ just to
be _ whoever is being critical of you. We'll just leave it at
whoever. That sounds better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it sounded absurd.
</P>
<P>
   With all this talk of people out to ``get'' Van Gundy, does he
not yet get what has happened here? Nobody got him and nobody
except Tim Duncan and David Robinson is going to. Whether or not
the Knicks can rally in this series against San Antonio after
losing Game 2, 80-67, Friday night, Van Gundy is walking out of
this season with the Life of Riley, with a huge financial score for
making the finals, with the highest of leaguewide profiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, on the other hand, have no enviable coaching option
to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Gundy's band played on, Paul Silas was re-signing in
Charlotte, Doc Rivers was taking over in Orlando and Phil Jackson
was ditching O'Hare for O'Neal, Bradley for Bryant. The way this
tumultuous National Basketball Association season has unfolded is
reminiscent of a messy Bill Clinton script.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has come out of the pileup of organization egos
looking clean and starched, like his former boss. Everyone else has
been indicted for something, except Ernie Grunfeld, who was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Van Gundy was just an insecure coach with an
unfamiliar cast. Dave Checketts and Grunfeld might have saved
themselves big trouble by telling Van Gundy he was not going to be
judged on what he did with new players in a short season.
Nonetheless, the way it has worked out, Grunfeld is the only one
here with the right to say, ``If they can't get you on results,
they get you on relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the good corporate soldier, Checketts fired his ``close
friend'' over dinner and then publicly threw himself to the news
media wolves for not telling the truth about a meeting he had to
take with Jackson. Marcus Camby has convinced himself that Van
Gundy cost him millions on the contract he signed during his
too-soft exile, and maybe he's right. Even Patrick Ewing has lost
out while Van Gundy gained. Ewing was overworked early when he was
out of shape, because the coach wasn't about to let the general
manager ``get'' him for losing games with players he didn't trust,
or want.
</P>
<P>
   If he wasn't pushed in February, maybe Ewing is out on the floor
now, defending the low post, pump-faking Duncan into a few early
fouls and making this series a fairer fight. Through it all, Ewing
remained a Van Gundy man, forgetting that Checketts twice unloaded
bundles of cash into Ewing's account when he might have taken a
harder negotiating tact.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has done a splendid job, steering his team through the
post-season. No argument there. He beat Pat Riley and Lenny
Wilkens, then coached the legend right out of Larry Bird. He was
right on using Latrell Sprewell off the bench, no matter how
reasonable Sprewell sounds promoting his point. But Van Gundy was
better cast last season as the underdog from the fast-food
drive-through, when Riley slandered him in a fruitless attempt to
fire up his troops. Now Van Gundy is a big-time coach. He has
confided to people that he isn't terribly proud of the political
games he has played this season, but he did play them, and played
them well.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld lost. Van Gundy should junk the conspiracy line.
Checketts is boxed in. Camby and Sprewell are under contract.
Whatever they are saying privately, at least they have been perfect
gentlemen when reporters have asked about the coach. Van Gundy
sounds more like a myopic player when he answers ``whoever'' to the
``who is they'' question.
</P>
<P>
   Players will admit they made the wrong defensive read, a foolish
pass, but when they look at the big picture, they mostly see what
they wish to. The coach should know better. Next season is not the
issue right now but it eventually will be, perhaps by the end of
the week. It wouldn't kill Van Gundy and wouldn't hurt his standing
with Camby, to name one Knick, if he just once came out and
admitted that he didn't cover himself with glory back in February
and March. Even if the Knicks go out in four or five against the
Spurs, Van Gundy has won. Now all he has to do is act like a
winner. &QL;

PAEAN TO PEANUT BUTTER: A RESTAURANT GIVES LUNCH TIME A LUNCH BOX
FLAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Aberasturi, the chief financial officer of a
midtown textile company, and an associate, Matt Pfeufer, recently
grabbed a taxi to lunch downtown. They wore conservative suits, as
is their custom on work days. The men, both from Long Island, were
as clean-cut as choirboys on Christmas Day. Successful, serious,
suburban types.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were at Peanut Butter and Company, a new
restaurant in the West Village that serves, with rare exception,
peanut butter sandwiches _ creative, innovative peanut butter
sandwiches, but peanut butter sandwiches nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Aberasturi devoured a white-chocolate peanut butter and orange
marmalade sandwich, while Pfeufer wolfed down the Elvis, a grilled
peanut butter sandwich crammed with sliced bananas and drizzled
with honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been here once before, and I had such a good time I had
to bring my associate,'' Aberasturi said unabashedly. ``It seemed
like a funky New York kind of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe only in New York, where everybody is always looking for
something new, could a restaurant that serves fancy peanut butter
sandwiches find a place in the heart of the public. These days, New
Yorkers are flush, and it seems they will spend, spend, spend on
practically anything that seems trendy _ at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that focus on a single kind of food are the latest
wrinkle in the apparently boundless food business here; think
pricey soup joints and pommes frites places.
</P>
<P>
   The peanut butter theme, or so say the restaurant's customers,
has touched a chord with adults looking for the comforts of their
salad days. (Most of the diners there tend to be the
over-12-year-old type.)
</P>
<P>
   But at what price comfort? Aberasturi, who washed his sandwich
down with apple juice, paid $8 for his lunch ($5.50 for the
sandwich and $2.50 for his juice), and Pfeufer, who also ordered
apple juice, plunked down $8.50 for his midday meal ($6 for the
sandwich).
</P>
<P>
   Did they have any qualms about shelling out more than $5 for a
peanut butter sandwich that might cost, say, 20 cents to create at
home? ``Are you kidding?'' Aberasturi said. ``This is Manhattan.
This is a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peanut Butter and Company opened in December _ offering its
peanuts ground freshly on the premises and freshly baked bread _
there was a waiting list to get in on weekends, said Lee Zalben,
the restaurant's 26-year-old owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get celebrities coming in,'' he added, refusing for
privacy's sake to make their names public.
</P>
<P>
   Just then a waitress walked over to see whether Messrs.
Aberasturi and Pfeufer were happy with their meals, which came with
carrot sticks and potato chips, just like Mom used to pack in lunch
bags and boxes. Pfeufer answered with a hand, making an O with his
thumb and index finger, because his mouth was stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Raymond, a graduate student at Columbia, stopped in with a
friend, Tanya Chartrand, a former graduate student at New York
University, for a Fluffernutter, made with peanut butter and
marshmallow fluff. Asked her age, Ms. Raymond said 25. ``Did I say
25?'' she said, laughing. ``I meant 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of her sandwich, $5, was ``a little ridiculous,'' she
added. ``But so is everything else in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalben said the restaurant is meant to evoke childhood memories:
bright yellow walls are adorned with old advertisements; shelves
are full of old tin cans touting peanut butter; food is served on
Fiesta ware, and customers sit in Windsor chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Zalben, a Vassar graduate who majored in urban studies, sold
advertising and did media analysis for publishing companies and
advertising agencies before he opened the restaurant. ``I woke up
one morning and I just got disenchanted,'' he recalled. ``I said,
`Is this what you want to do with your life?' I always thought that
a restaurant devoted to peanut butter would be a great idea, so I
tucked it in the back of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Why peanut butter, which is high in protein but also laden with
fat calories?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I chose peanut butter,'' Zalben said, smiling.
``Peanut butter chose me.'' He said it was a staple when he was
growing up in Philadelphia. ``I'd eat it from the jar, and there'd
be this imprint of an index finger left behind,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In college his passion for peanut butter did not dwindle. ``My
roommates and I would be up late at night banging out papers and
drinking coffee,'' he said. ``Then we'd have these contests: who
could make the craziest but best-tasting peanut butter sandwich? I
always won.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the sandwich offerings include peanut butter and cream
cheese; peanut butter with bacon, lettuce and tomato, and spicy
peanut butter with grilled chicken and pineapple jam. There is also
a sampling of different kinds of peanut butter (smooth, crunchy,
chocolate chip, white chocolate, cinnamon raisin and spicy) with
crudites. And, of course, the menu includes the classic peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough to satisfy a customer's sugar craving, he
or she can choose desserts ranging from peanut butter tiramisu,
chocolate peanut butter pie, yogurt and peanut butter, and peanut
butter cookies. The truly intrepid can try a heart stopper aptly
labeled ``Death by Peanut Butter,'' which includes peanut butter
Cap'n Crunch, three scoops of ice cream, freshly ground peanut
butter, peanut butter Reese's Pieces and peanut butter chips.
</P>
<P>
   What about the waistline?
</P>
<P>
   ``The catch phrase here is selective indulgence and personal
nostalgia,'' Zalben said. But since he opened the restaurant,
Zalben has grown increasingly uncomfortable with his own expanding
girth. How much weight has he gained? He is mum on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of adding inches does not seem to deter his
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a muscular singer and musician who goes by the
name of Goat leisurely savored a peanut butter and strawberry jam
sandwich, which cost $5. ``I'll eat my spinach tonight,'' he said.
``If I made this at home, I'd eat two.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Brennan, a slim 33-year-old actress, writer and yoga
teacher, made a peanut butter pit stop last week, ordering takeout:
a chocolate-chip peanut butter and strawberry jam sandwich. ``I
think peanut butter is good for you,'' she said. ``You need protein
and some fats in your diet. Plus the caffeine in chocolate makes
you happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Mohlman, a 38-year-old research psychologist at Columbia,
was looking for a place to live when she spotted the restaurant.
``I'm going to tell everyone about this,'' she said. ``They care
about the details here; the Fiesta ware, the music all remind me of
my childhood.'' Ms. Mohlman, a (lapsed) vegetarian, ordered the
Elvis _ with bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't eaten meat in five years until this,'' she said.
``It's thrilling, absolutely delicious. I think if you're going to
blow it, you might as well blow it big time.''

BOB BRINER, 63, INNOVATOR IN TENNIS AND TELEVISION

<P>
   Bob Briner, a pioneer professional tennis administrator and
later a television sports executive, died Friday night in his home
in Greenville, Ill. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   He learned last September that he had abdominal cancer, his
company, ProServ, said.
</P>
<P>
   Briner was a key figure in bringing television and sponsor
dollars to tennis. The sport's open era, in which players could
compete for prize money, began in 1968. Prize money for the first
professional tour totaled $400,000. Now, first-place money in a
Grand Slam tournament exceeds that.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1971, Briner was an executive of the new World
Championship Tennis. With Jack Kramer and Donald Dell, he founded
the Association of Tennis Professionals, and as its executive
director from 1975 to 1979 he supervised the Grand Prix tournament
tour and helped bring together the warring governing bodies of
men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he left the ATP and, with Dell, a lawyer and former
Davis Cup captain, founded ProServ Television. In 1986, he and
Arthur Ashe won Emmys for the program, ``A Hard Road to Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Briner became the first Western sports executive to
enter China after the Cultural Revolution and introduced NBA games
to television there. He developed major tennis tournaments in
Israel, Iran, Cuba, South Africa and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Albert Briner Jr. stood 6 feet 4 inches and weighed more
than 300 pounds. He was born Aug. 28, 1935, in Dallas. In 1956, he
earned a degree in business and English from Greenville College.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a high school football and cross-country coach in
Kansas, a college sports administrator in Ohio and Michigan, a
promotions executive for the Miami Dolphins football team and a
general manager of the Dallas Chaparrals basketball team, which
became the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, he married Marty Jacobs of Oil City, Pa. He is survived
by his wife; a son, Rob of Evans, Colo.; two daughters, Lynn Briner
of Dallas and Lee Ganton of Spring Arbor, Mich., and three
grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he retired as ProServ president. Before and since, he
spoke in churches and on college campuses and wrote seven books,
focusing on Christianity.

DOUGLAS SEALE, BRITISH DIRECTOR AND ACTOR, DIES AT 85 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Canada, France, Ohio, Calif.)   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Seale, a British producer, actor and director
whose 65-year career on both sides of the Atlantic brought him to
the stage, films and television, died last Sunday at St. Vincent's
Hospital here. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Seale's most recent appearance was as Billy Rice, the fading
vaudevillian father of Archie Rice in the 1996 Classic Stage Co.
revival of John Osborne's play ``The Entertainer.'' He was perhaps
best known to Broadway theatergoers as Selsdon Mowbray, the drunken
actor who missed his every cue in the 1983 production of Michael
Frayn's comedy ``Noises Off.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance brought him a Tony Award nomination for featured
actor in a play.
</P>
<P>
   Seale, whose career as an actor led him to films like
``Aladdin'' (as the voice of the Sultan), ``Ghostbusters II'' and
``Amadeus;'' to television shows like ``Cheers'' and ``Rags to
Riches,'' and plays like ``The Dresser'' and ``Frankenstein,'' also
won praise for his work as a director and producer.
</P>
<P>
   Classically trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he
produced Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra'' at the Birmingham
Repertory Theater; Shakespeare's ``King John'' at Stratford-on-Avon
and Stratford, Ont.; ``Henry V'' in Stratford, Conn., and ``King
Lear'' at the Old Vic.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, he staged such plays as ``King Lear'' for the
Marin Shakespeare Festival in San Francisco; ``A Doll's House'' and
``Look Back in Anger'' in Cleveland, and ``The Winslow Boy'' in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   His animated direction of ``King John'' at the Stratford, Ont.,
Shakespeare Festival in 1960 prompted Brooks Atkinson of The New
York Times to begin his review by writing: ``If you decide to put
on one of Shakespeare's dull plays, send for Douglas Seale on the
double.''
</P>
<P>
   Seale, who displayed youthful talent as an artist, was impelled
toward a career in the theater by a schoolmaster who encouraged him
after seeing him in a school play. He made his professional debut
in ``The Drums Begin'' in London in 1934 and served in the British
Army from 1940 to 1946, when he returned to civilian life and
joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theater Company for two seasons at
Stratford-on-Avon.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Toulouse, France, and
Timothy, of London, and two grandchildren.

   PINEHURST, N.C. _ With a different look and a different finish,
this is a different U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   With the Open at Pinehurst No. 2 for the first time, the pros
need more touch than titanium. If their approach shots slide off
the sloping turtleback greens into grassy hollows, they must hit
delicate chip shots close to the hole if they are to save par. But
every so often their chip is too delicate.
</P>
<P>
   That's when this Open has a different look _ a pro watching his
chip shot roll back to his feet, if not beyond, as if he were
playing miniature golf and had missed the clown's nose.
</P>
<P>
   In other Opens, the look has usually been that of a pro slashing
his ball out of rough deep enough to hide his shoes. Or of his ball
plopping into a pond. Or a putt sliding 6 feet past. But whatever
the pros do or don't do in Sunday's final round, they will be
creating instant Open history here in the Sandhills where the pines
stand tall.
</P>
<P>
   In other years, the Open has usually been blessed with the
memory of what happened before at that year's course. How Jack
Nicklaus won at Baltusrol or Pebble Beach. How Ben Hogan won at
Merion or Oakland Hills. How Bobby Jones won at Winged Foot or
Interlachen. How Arnold Palmer won at Cherry Hills, or how he lost
at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   But however the winner wins in Sunday's final round, it will be
unique to Pinehurst No. 2, no relation to any other Open anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   And with two par-3 holes among Pinehurst No. 2's last four
holes, the finish will be different from that on any of the usual
Open courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different,'' said Payne Stewart, the 1991 Open champion
at Hazeltine who finished second last year at Olympic, alluding to
the two short holes. ``Then you've got a par 5, I mean a par 4,
that you play in between those two par 3s.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who shared the 36-hole lead with David Duval and Phil
Mickelson, was referring to the 489-yard 16th hole, the longest par
4 in Open history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stand there on the tee at 15 and 17,'' Stewart said, ``and
you think, `I've got a par 3, it's going to be easy.' You've still
got to hit the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And each tee shot must be precise. The 15th hole is 202 yards to
a severe turtleback green with two gaping bunkers on the right. The
17th is 191 yards with a somewhat flatter green but with swales
that funnel an imprecise tee shot into any of five surrounding
bunkers _ one to the left, one to the rear right and three on the
front right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15th is not easy,'' Tiger Woods said. ``Friday it was
gusty and I ripped a 5-iron and didn't get there. And the 17th is
probably the easiest of the par 3s here because at least you have
some room to hit to.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the dreaded 18th awaits: 446 yards slightly uphill, its
fairway left to right. For other PGA Tour and amateur events here
in the past, the traditional ``Sunday'' hole location on the par 4
has been rear left.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first round on 18,'' said Stewart, ``I drove it in the
left rough and hit a really good 6-iron out of there and it ran up
on the front of the green and then it came back off the green, like
it's supposed to do. And then I just didn't hit my first putt hard
enough from the collar.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the Atlanta Athletic Club had a similar 3-4-3-4 finish.
With a birdie 2 at the 15th and a birdie 3 at the 18th after a
fabled 5-iron to within 3 feet, Jerry Pate won that Open by 2
strokes over Tom Weiskopf and Al Geiberger. In 1909, the Englewood
Golf Club in New Jersey had a 3-4-4-3 finish as George Sargent won
by 4 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the Atlanta club's only Open (as a bicentennial
favor to the late Bobby Jones), and it's not likely to get another.
Englewood, dug up two decades ago for a condominium complex, never
had another Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes Sunday,'' said David Duval, ``a par on 15 is
going to be very valuable, as well as on 16. But you have more of
an opportunity to make birdie on 17. The 18th is a difficult hole,
but if you hit a good drive, you can access all the difficult pin
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, the left-handed swami of the short game, thought
the two par 3s favored the leader going into the final four holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have an opportunity to put a 3 on your score
card, that's the goal,'' he said. ``It's going to be very difficult
to make up shots to par on those two holes. Par on those two short
holes will be a good score. If you have to make it up with the
leader, you're going to hope the leader falters rather than trying
to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, it will be a different finish to a
different Open with a different look.

HOUSTON JUGGLES RATTLES AND THE SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allan Houston's main chore in the last week has been figuring
out how to shake free from Mario Elie, the relentless San Antonio
swingman who keeps tugging at Houston's jersey and his confidence.
The playoffs being about adjustments, it is easily the
second-toughest job the Knicks' shooting guard has this
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The first: 2 a.m. feedings.
</P>
<P>
   After a week without being with his newborn daughter, Remi-Jean,
Houston was planning to celebrate his first Father's Day in his
Greenwich, Conn., home on Sunday with his wife, Tamara, and their
first child.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably not have a tremendous impact on his performance
in the National Basketball Association finals or help him cope with
Elie and the Spurs any better than he and Knicks already have
through two games.
</P>
<P>
   But it has helped him further strike a balance between his
professional and personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you first get married and you have to go on the
road, that's kind of an adjustment,'' Houston said. ``But then,
when you have a baby, and then you go on the road to the NBA
finals, that's like, you've just got a lot of stuff going on in
your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston telephoned home often in the last week, usually getting
the standard response: ``I'm feeding her. I'll call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Remi-Jean was born the day after Houston's phenomenal Game 6
performance against Indiana _ a game Tamara attended before labor
was induced the next day. Before Game 2 against San Antonio, he was
looking forward to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone went out and got her a Knicks uniform,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the emotions he felt watching his daughter being
born, he added: ``To be honest, I don't know what in the world I
was feeling. It's an emotion that I had never experienced before.
Obviously, joy was a lot of it. But it is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my sister last night, and I said, `You better call
me on Father's Day.' And she was like, `Man, that sounds funny.'''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston, new father. Kind of takes the sting away from
those 7-for-17 nights, no?
</P>
<P>
   The Don Nelson Connection
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his messy divorces with the Knicks and Golden State,
Don Nelson is credited with being one of the game's modern-day
innovators, a man who would put a 7-foot-6-inch center behind the
3-point line if he thought it would help his team's chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson presided over very good teams in Milwaukee and lackluster
teams in the Bay Area before contentious power struggles with Chris
Webber and Patrick Ewing tarnished his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson has never got to the NBA finals as a coach. Even so,
as perhaps the only connecting thread between Jeff Van Gundy and
Gregg Popovich, he is not envious that two of his former unheralded
assistants got the opportunity this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve it,'' Nelson said from his home in Dallas, where
he serves as the Mavericks' coach and general manager. ``They're
the kind of guys you wouldn't mind being in a fox hole with. Pop is
a little more military than Jeff, but there are a lot of
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that neither Van Gundy nor Popovich played
in the league, and therefore had to work harder to gain respect
among their players than many coaches. They have also been on the
firing line recently, with Popovich's job in question after the
Spurs' 6-8 start and Van Gundy weathering two attempts made at
relieving him of his duties during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Nelson points out, the largest common denominator may be
their knack for getting emotional about their relationships with
their peers. In the macho culture of the NBA, Van Gundy and
Popovich have no trouble expressing their sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is closer to Popovich, having worked with him for four
seasons at Golden State. But Van Gundy also endeared himself to
Nelson during the 59 games he coached in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nelson was fired by the Knicks in March 1996, the first
person to console him in his Philadelphia hotel room was Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't crying, but Jeff came to my room in tears,'' Nelson
said. ``I felt worse for him than I did for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became pretty close,'' he added. ``I really appreciated
that he and Don Chaney would come up to my room to spend some
quality time with me that day. That's the kind of people they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich became the victim of one of Nelson's greatest pranks
while they were with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Popovich was an art lover, Nelson procured a
portrait of an American Indian from an artist Popovich once coached
with at the Air Force Academy. The artist did not charge Nelson for
the painting, but instead gave it to him as a gift for Popovich's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson then took the painting to the owner of an art gallery he
knew in San Francisco. He had the gallery owner mount and display
the painting for $25,000, then brought Popovich into the gallery
with the other coaches after a lunch at Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Hey, Pop, isn't this the guy you used to work
with?''' Nelson said. ``And he just went wild. `That's him! That's
him!' I said, `Why don't you buy it?' He said, `Oh, no, I can't
afford that.' I told my friend to put it on my bill and wrap it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the assistant coaches, who were in on the gag, were
about to break the news to Popovich when he suddenly got emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He starts bawling,'' Nelson said. ``He says: `I can't believe
you guys did this for me, a $25,000 piece of art painted by this
guy I know. This is really something.' At that point, we're all
feeling bad. We got him hooked in so good. That's probably as good
as I ever hooked anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why Are the Nets Stalling?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have not yet asked the Knicks for permission to speak
with Jeff Van Gundy about becoming New Jersey's next head coach,
and who knows if the team will. Any attempt to sway Van Gundy
toward the Meadowlands would most likely involve a concession of
draft picks and cash shipped to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer the Nets go without hiring the interim coach Don
Casey on a permanent basis, the more they are open to speculation
that the club is merely waiting to see what happens with Van
Gundy's future. What must Casey be feeling?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have already offered Phil Jackson a reported $21
million for three seasons, an offer turned town three weeks ago by
Jackson's agent. Rumors of Mike Fratello's returning to his
Hackensack roots are also circulating.
</P>
<P>
   If Nets owner Lewis Katz continues to bide his time with the
interim coach, one wonders if Van Gundy's shadow is going to become
as ominous to Casey's future as Jackson's shadow once was to Van
Gundy's.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Van Gundy's agent, Rod Ades, has been Casey's
personal friend and lawyer for 30 years. If Van Gundy was in the
running, the first thing he would have to do is pick up the phone
and make a courtesy call to Casey, who in turn would finally
realize the truth about his once-noble profession: coaching is now
an incestuous, shady, off-season business in which people respect
their peers while trying to make sure they first cut the best deal
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the Front Office
</P>
<P>
   After all the early season criticism, it is now clear that the
deposed general manager Ernie Grunfeld and Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts made some hard but ultimately wise
decisions when it came to trading away aging veterans in the off
season for an infusion of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby were on the
verge of being declared busts, it is hard to say that they are
long-term cures for the franchise's future. But without them, the
Knicks do not embark on this nice little post-season run.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one wonders how different the Knicks would look in the
championship round with a decent big man coming off the bench. Herb
Williams has been invaluable to the locker room this season during
troubled times and it is admirable that the club has shown that
kind of loyalty to the NBA's elder statesmen, but it is hard to
envision him being a 20-minute role player at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can be done about Charles Oakley, whom the Knicks needed
to move to get Camby. Or Buck Williams, who retired, and Terry
Cummings, who was trade bait for Sprewell. But somewhere, anywhere,
the Knicks could have used a body for the stretch run. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
ON BASKETBALL COLUMN: DUNCAN A NO-FRILLS GUY BEYOND HIS YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On most road trips, Tim Duncan packs the toys of choice for the
Y2K pro athlete: a DVD movie player and a Sony PlayStation. He
likes current cinema and mindless video games, often killing time
on the team plane with young reserve point guard Antonio Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every so often, an elder teammate will test his 23-year-old
frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, veteran center Will Perdue recommended
that Duncan and Daniels check out a sappy basketball movie made in
the mid-1970s: ``One on One'' starring Robbie Benson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like, `What's `One on One' and who's Robbie
Benson?''' Perdue said. ``So we brought it on the plane flying to
Minnesota. And they were like, `Hey, that was pretty good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, nobody got shot. Nobody got killed,'' Perdue said. ``And
they didn't wreck 50 cars.''
</P>
<P>
   They merely played basketball. What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is dominating these NBA finals, playing the game that
time forgot. He uses power dribbles to move closer to the rim. He
faces up his defender from 18 feet away on the wing and uses the
glass to bank in shots. He uses his reach to pass to teammates
cutting through the lane. He has this pretty little jump hook that
is beginning to look Waltonesque.
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting dichotomy: the old-school mind controlling
and nurturing a Generation X body. There are no frills to Duncan's
game, no death stares after a blocked shot and no scowls after a
monster dunk. In San Antonio's victories against the Knicks in the
first two games, and all throughout the playoffs, he has used an
economy of movement and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Through circumstance and constant work, in two remarkable years
he has become the game's best player. It is the kind of achievement
that would usually establish a player as the example by which to
emulate: the lanky kid from the Virgin Islands who decided to stay
at Wake Forest for his senior year instead of entering the NBA
draft early.
</P>
<P>
   And yet at a time when Commissioner David Stern is considering
an age requirement for players entering the NBA _ and 19-year-old
Lamar Odom is confused about whether to stay or go _ Duncan is
still an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers still want the money they have been told is owed to
them by their needy support groups and families. Simply, the chance
to be the Kevin Garnett of today outweighs the patience and reward
of being the Duncan of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The single largest problem in the NBA today is that young kids
enter the league with a sense of entitlement, the idea that they
are owed something because their university used their number on a
jersey at the campus bookstore and they were not compensated for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan did not attend an Adidas or Nike camp for gifted
basketball players when he was 15 years old. He did not participate
in the cattle call that most American kids are in each summer for
the college and pro scouts that are salivating over their talent.
He was not treated better than most kids his age.
</P>
<P>
   He swam in high school, took up basketball late and decided to
enjoy the fruits of college rather than go to work right away. And
when he did finally enter the NBA, he worked harder on his game
than on his image.
</P>
<P>
   This is the player he has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's guard or forward or center, I have yet to see a
guy in this age of the game that's come into the league with such
fundamental soundness,'' Perdue said. ``A lot of teams, they draft
the best athlete and work on their games. In Tim's case, he was the
best player and the best athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   In this lockout-scarred season, some of the best reasons to
celebrate the game rather than denigrate it has been the
transformation of young, disconnected knuckleheads into fearless
competitors with passion and purpose. Whether it's Allen Iverson in
the East or Jason Williams and Chris Webber out West, their
scintillating play has forced Stern to view them as bona fide stars
for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, standing taller than the rest, leads the contingent. As
Year 1 of the post-Michael era ends, Duncan is displaying all the
qualities that made people once pay incredible attention to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, marketing kinks to work out in the future.
Duncan is as quiet and introverted as he is good. Some of his
teammates have taken to calling him the silent assassin. At the
moment, he is not inducing any bidding war for his likeness on
Madison Avenue. Maybe another week in the national spotlight and a
title can change that.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he is keeping amazing perspective during heady
times. According to Perdue, while Duncan has been helping save the
league with his old-school game, he has also managed to keep his
Gen-X priorities in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be very grounded,'' Perdue said. ``I've been with
him for over two years now, and he never seems to get overjoyed
about anything _ except about maybe kicking somebody's behind in
Sony PlayStation. He does take a lot of pride in that.''

REDS FACE A MONTH-LONG TEST IN WILD-CARD QUEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ariz., Texas, Md., Calif., Fla, Ill. Wis., Canada)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds are giving Jim Bowden, their general
manager, ``every reason to believe they can play with the wild-card
teams.'' In the next two weeks, though, the upstart and unheralded
Reds will let him know if they can play with the division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday night, the Reds, who have been in the middle of
a wild-card race that commands little attention now, play 14
consecutive games against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the National
League West leaders, and the Houston Astros, the Central leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The eight games against the Astros figure to be more
enlightening for the Reds, because they play in the same division.
But the two-week span over all will provide Bowden with an idea of
what he might be doing later in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come July 31, we'll know a lot better where we are,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for making trades without waivers, and it's
a key date for the Reds. When Bowden made off-season trades that
brought high-priced Greg Vaughn and Denny Neagle to Cincinnati, he
said that if the Reds were not in contention for something by the
deadline, he could trade the players to teams that were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to find out,'' he said. ``I always keep an
open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the Reds were a game and a half
behind San Francisco in the wild-card race, with the Mets in
between. They were in second place in the division race, four games
behind the Astros. They have been as close as one and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Reds in these positions? Weren't they supposed to be
more at home in the lower standing?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, their young first baseman, is one reason the Reds
have become a first-half contender. He took a league-leading .377
batting average into last night's game, and he led the team in runs
batted in with 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' defense, especially up the middle, is another reason.
Pokey Reese, their young second baseman, has teamed well with the
veteran Barry Larkin and had made only 1 error in 61 games. He was
hitting well, too, with a .287 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get spoiled watching guys like him,'' Jack McKeon, the
Reds' manager, said. ``He has great range, great hands, great
instincts and a strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster, Mike Cameron, performs a similar role in
center field. ``He catches everything in center,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the unexpectedly competitive Reds has been
their relief corps, a group of no-name pitchers who have made
themselves the most effective bullpen in the major leagues. The
Reds would not be where they are without Scott Williamson, Danny
Graves, Gabe White, Scott Sullivan and Dennis Reyes, who among them
had seven years of major league experience when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's 2.72 earned run average is the only bullpen era in
the majors below 3.00. The .211 batting average the relievers have
allowed opponents is the only average below .225. Their effort has
been season-saving because the Reds' starting pitchers have
averaged only five innings a start, making them the
shortest-working starters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to get it done,'' McKeon said. So the
relievers have had to get the job done. Sullivan, Graves and
Williamson began the weekend with more innings in relief than
anyone in the league except Brian Edmondson of Florida. Williamson,
who in his third year as a professional throws a fastball 96 to 98
miles an hour, leads National League relievers with 6 victories,
and his 1.39 era and 54 strikeouts are second.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and McKeon appreciate what the bullpen has done, but they
know they can't expect to get that kind of production for the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our starters to pitch well or we'll burn out the
bullpen,'' Bowden said. ``We could use another starting pitcher or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who is on the disabled list strengthening his left
shoulder, has won no games this season. Brett Tomko, who was
demoted to the minors briefly earlier in the season, has won two
games. The Reds had counted on 15 victories each from Neagle, Tomko
and Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is on the prowl for starters who might be available in
trades but said: ``Thirty clubs can't agree on a salary cap,
revenue sharing, realignment, the designated hitter or Astroturf,
but I found one thing they all agree on. All of them want starting
pitching and none of them wants to trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it will be up to McKeon to navigate the team through
the hazardous waters filled with Diamondbacks and Astros. Trader
Jack noted that the Reds beat each team two out of three in earlier
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure we're not intimidated by them,'' he said.
``It's a good test for us. If we want to stay where we are, we have
to at least split with them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINE'S ALTERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine feels he is a marked man, but the Mets' manager
invites scrutiny and retaliation. In the past few weeks, Jack
McKeon, the Cincinnati manager, has questioned Jason Isringhausen's
glove and the shirt Pat Mahomes wore under his uniform, forcing the
Mets to alter the glove and Mahomes to change the shirt. It was
McKeon's turn in the art of baseball gamesmanship. He acted after
the Mets' grounds crew applied an excessive amount of water in
front of home plate before a game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watered the field down purposely,'' McKeon said, speaking
of Valentine. ``Someone overheard him say it the night before to
the groundskeepers.'' The start of the game was delayed as the
grounds crew, at McKeon's request to the umpires, put down a
substance to soak up the water. ``I was worried about getting
Piazza hurt,'' McKeon said with a straight face, referring to the
Mets' catcher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RIPKEN BIDS FOR RETURN
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken was on the disabled list earlier this season _
recovering from a chronic back ailment, dealing with his father's
death and facing a .179 batting average and 5 errors in 8 games _
he brushed off suggestions that he was just about finished as a
productive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to arm yourself with your tools and go out there and
find out,'' he said, discussing the ability that might remain.
``Then you'll know yourself. You're being judged in front of all
these people, but nobody can make that judgment except you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others' rush to judgment has suffered a setback. Since his
return from the disabled list, Ripken was hitting .363 (45 for 124)
with 24 runs batted in, 8 home runs and 2 errors in 31 games before
last night. His rejuvenated performance will help the Orioles take
an important step with greater ease.
</P>
<P>
   They must decide by July 13 if they want to exercise the $6.3
million option in Ripken's contract for next season or pay him a
$2.5 million buyout. Although club officials have not talked about
their plans, they are prepared to pick up the option.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ripken should play only part-time next year, the Orioles
figure they can pay him the high salary for what he has done for
the franchise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HOMERLESS RACE
</P>
<P>
   On successive days last week, the race for most times at bat
without a home run underwent a dramatic change. Last Monday, Tony
Womack of Arizona relinquished his lead in the race with a home run
against Ryan Dempster of Florida in his 227th at-bat. A day earlier
Mike Caruso of the Chicago White Sox, in his 216th at-bat, hit his
first home run of the season against Rick Aguilera of the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Their exit from the race left Luis Castillo of Florida all alone
at the top. Entering Saturday's games, he had batted 231 times
without hitting a home run. Rey Ordonez of the Mets was a distant
second with 189 at-bats, and Kevin Stocker of Tampa Bay was next at
183.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl probably cannot understand their power problem. The
Milwaukee pitcher has only 29 at-bats in his 14 starts this season,
and he has hit two home runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A BLUE JAY! IT'S FERNANDEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people might swear that Tony Fernandez stepped into a
telephone booth last Aug. 1, but all he did, really, was move from
second base to third base. Since that day, however, American League
pitchers have suffered from Fernandez's transformation. Not even
balls made of Kryptonite can get him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a phenomenon this year,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto
general manager, said. ``You go back to last August, when we moved
him from second to third. He didn't have to worry about a lack of
range. He seemed to take off offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   A .282 career hitter for his first 14 years in the majors,
Fernandez was hitting .287 when the month of July ended last year.
The next day he began playing third, and he proceeded to hit .381
in his last 67 games, finishing with a .321 average, just one point
below the career-high .322 he batted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a fairly good hitter,'' Ash said, ``but he's
moved into another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Fernandez, before Saturday's game, was batting a
league-leading .407. When the first phase of interleague play began
June 4, he was hitting .383. In 14 games since, he amassed 25 hits
in 51 at-bats. Besides catapulting him beyond .400, his torrid
stretch placed Fernandez two career hits away from Julio Franco's
2,177, most ever by a Dominican Republic native.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work ethic, his concentration and, I think, his comfort
level all play a role in it,'' Ash said of Fernandez's remarkable
late-life improvement as a hitter. ``I've never seen anybody, and I
underline anybody, work like this guy works. Pre- and post-game, he
conditions himself. He sets a work tone second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who will turn 37 on June 30, is in his third tour of
duty with the Blue Jays, with whom he has spent nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has always been a hard worker,'' Ash added, ``even when
we had him as a youngster. He always had dedication. Everybody
talks about the pressure that comes with hitting .400. He's a guy
who has the ability to shut it out. That doesn't seem to bother
him.''

DRAFTED BY THE CUBS, A SHORTSTOP CHASES HIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jim Deschaine could not help thinking about the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Just the chance of being selected in the major-league baseball
draft on June 2 thrilled Deschaine, the Brandeis University
shortstop. He did not want to get his hopes up. Brandeis is, after
all, known more for its brains than its baseball. He was just
hoping for an opportunity to play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   When the call finally came _ the Chicago Cubs made the junior
infielder their 10th-round selection _ Deschaine became the first
player from Brandeis to be drafted since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really psyched about being drafted,'' he said. ``It is
definitely a special feeling. I knew that there was a possibility
that I would be selected, but I wasn't counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Deschaine, 21, led Brandeis in hitting with a .448 average this
season and set school records for home runs (18), RBIs (70), hits
(78), and runs (70). The Judges (33-10) qualified for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Division III World Series, but were
eliminated when they lost to Cortland State, 12-5, on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with Chicago on June 5, Deschaine was immediately
assigned to the Cubs' practice facility in Mesa, Ariz., with the
other draftees and nondrafted free agents. Then, last Tuesday,
Deschaine reported to Chicago's Class A team in Eugene, Ore., in
the Northwest League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is an extremely versatile player,'' Brandeis coach Pete
Varney said of the 6-foot, 180-pound Deschaine. ``That versatility
is going to help him make it to the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   For a period last season, however, it appeared that Deschaine
would not play ball again in college, let alone professionally.
During his sophomore year, on April 22, 1998, Deschaine was hit in
the face by a baseball on an attempted steal of third base. Five
minutes later, Deschaine regained consciousness to the news that
the left side of his face was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   At the Eye and Ear Institute, a division of Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, a team of three doctors _ an
ophthalmologist, a plastic surgeon and an ear, nose and throat
specialist _ performed surgery, inserting four plates into the left
side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to play the waiting game was the worst for me,''
Deschaine said. ``I didn't know if I would ever play baseball
again. Watching my team go on and continue to play games without me
and knowing that I could not play with them was very tough for me
to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Deschaine was back on the field by the summer of 1998, playing
with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod League. He says there are no
lingering mental or physical effects from the injury, and actually
claims to be stronger than he was previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the game a little more than I did before the
injury,'' he said. ``Now I feel blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were Deschaine's favorite team when he was growing
up in Bristol, Conn. And more recently he has made a habit of
watching the many talented young shortstops now in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is coincidental that I am starting off my career in an age
when the shortstop position is being revolutionized,'' Deschaine
said. ``Between Nomar, Rodriguez and Jeter,'' he said, referring to
Nomar Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox, Alex Rodriguez of the
Seattle Mariners and Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, ``there
are a lot of great shortstops in the majors right now that I can
learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Varney, his college coach, who played professional baseball
himself from 1971 to 1978, including four years as a catcher with
Atlanta and the Chicago White Sox, believes that Deschaine's
biggest challenge will be adjusting to the mental aspects of
playing baseball on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players going from college to the pros have to realize that it
doesn't matter whether you get four hits or strike out four times
in a game,'' Varney said, ``because you are going to have to play a
new game the next day. Jimmy will do well because he has something
you can't teach: a love for the game of baseball. When he is on the
baseball field, he always has a smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Deschaine had another year of eligibility left at
Brandeis and says he will return at some point to complete his
bachelor's degree in American studies, he does not regret his
decision to leave school early and pursue his dream. ``I want to
make it to the major leagues,'' he said.

SPURS SAY LETDOWN IS UNLIKELY AT GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The San Antonio Spurs have three players with at
least two NBA championship rings, two players who spent years
moiling in the minor leagues before seizing the big stage, and
accomplished college graduates with degrees in finance,
mathematics, computer information systems and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   With a roster full of such experienced, persistent and
intelligent players, the Spurs' coach, Gregg Popovich, is not the
least bit worried about his team becoming overconfident and making
a misstep because of its 2-0 lead over the Knicks in the NBA
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this group of guys, they don't need any speeches from
me,'' Popovich said after his club's 80-67 victory Friday in Game
2. ``They know what the deal is. You've got guys that have been
there before and some guys that haven't been and want it badly. So
they don't need me to give them a speech or talk about
distractions. They'll be ready to go on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who visit Madison Square Garden for Game 3 on Monday
night, have been in this position before, having swept the Los
Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers en route to winning
the Western Conference title. After taking command of those series,
they stormed the opponents' home court and played better than they
had in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   After edging the Lakers by three points in Game 2 in San
Antonio, they won by 12 and 11 points, respectively, in Games 3 and
4 at the Forum. Then, after needing a last-gasp 3-pointer by Sean
Elliott to defeat the Blazers at home, they whipped Portland by 22
points at the Rose Garden before clinching the series with a
14-point victory two nights later.
</P>
<P>
   These Spurs, who have won an NBA single-season record 12
consecutive playoff games, are indeed better away from the spacious
Alamodome. They are 6-0 in other teams' buildings, and their only
loss in 13 post-season games came at home.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, they have shot better from the field, from 3-point
range and from the foul line, outrebounded their opponents after
being beaten on the backboards at home, given out more assists,
made more steals and won by an average of 13.4 points, more than 10
points higher than their average victory margin in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the hostile Garden crowd, with its
close-to-the-court seating and superstars in the front row, is not
likely to faze them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relish being on the road,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie said.
``We seem to play better and our level of concentration seems to be
higher. Sometimes in this big, ole dome, it's hard to shoot because
the depth perception makes it hard to see the rim sometimes. But in
a regular arena, you get good looks at the basket and that's why we
seem to shoot better and play better on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, who grew up five minutes from the Garden, is more excited
than anyone. Though he played at the Garden in the 1995 finals with
the Houston Rockets, he was a bit player on that squad. But this
time, he will start and be responsible for holding one of the
Knicks' chief offensive threats, Allan Houston, in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine o'clock Monday night's going to be exciting, hitting that
Garden floor, seeing Jerry Seinfeld and Spike Lee,'' Elie said.
``New York fans are the best fans in the world. The atmosphere at
the Garden is just terrific. We call it the Mecca. That's one of
the best places in the world to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning the first two games of this series by a combined
25 points, the Spurs feel there is room for improvement. They were
disappointed in their 43 percent shooting in Game 2 and said their
spacing on the perimeter was horrible at times.
</P>
<P>
   They also admitted to getting confused by the Knicks' sporadic
double-teaming of Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the post. And
for the second straight game, they were outrebounded by the smaller
Knicks, particularly on the offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   With so much erroneous play to reflect on, the Spurs refuse to
contemplate sweeping their third straight opponent in the playoffs,
even though they could not help but hear the 39,554 fans at the
Alamodome chanting for that Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried about what people say,'' Duncan said.
``We're very focused on what we have to do. We haven't played real
well over these last two games and we want to play better. So we're
not thinking sweep. We never think sweep. We think one game at a
time, no matter how cliche that sounds. We're worried about the
next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the most reserved young superstar in the league, is the
one with the degree in psychology.

CONNECTICUT SENATOR MARRIES VICE CHAIRMAN OF EXPORT-IMPORT BANK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat, was married Friday night at his home in East Haddam to
Jackie Marie Clegg, the vice chairman and chief operating officer
of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clegg and Dodd had dated for about 10 years, his office
said, and she accompanied him during his successful campaign last
fall for a fourth term. The engagement and wedding were a well-kept
secret and only a few relatives and friends attended the service,
held on a bank of the Connecticut River. The ceremony was performed
by Judge Robert N. Chatigny of U.S. District Court in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate honeymoon is not planned, and Dodd expects to be in
his Capitol Hill office on Monday, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Export-Import Bank, Ms. Clegg was a
legislative assistant for 10 years to Sen. Jack Garn, a Republican
from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Orem, Utah, and received a master's degree in
national securities studies from Georgetown University and an
undergraduate degree from Southern Utah University. She is the
daughter of Carl B. Clegg and the late Grace Meacham Clegg.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, 55, the state's senior senator, was divorced after a brief
marriage early in his career. He was born in Willimantic, Conn. His
father, the late Thomas J. Dodd, also was a U.S. senator from
Connecticut.

REAL ESTATE: IN CHICAGO, 3 LAKEFRONT MUSEUM PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a burst of energy that recalls another a century
ago that led to the building of elegant structures for many of the
city's premier cultural institutions, Chicago is once again seeing
a boom in new lakefront museum construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   One institution _ the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the city's
oldest museum _ is abandoning the landmark Beaux-Arts structure in
Lincoln Park it has occupied since 1893 and is moving to a new home
farther north in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, the John G. Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium
and Astronomical Museum, both of which are part of a museum campus
the city has created in Burnham Park, are significantly expanding
and restoring their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   All three museums make the point that the idea of what a museum
should be has changed so dramatically over the course of the
century that the original buildings _ many of which are now beloved
landmarks _ are as much burdens as assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As wonderful as it is, the old building is very constricting
in terms of what we can do with exhibits,'' said Paul Bluestone,
vice president of planning and design for the Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became obvious that if we wanted to do something radical,
it was unlikely we could do it in that building,'' said Colin
Silvester, chief operating officer of the Academy of Sciences,
referring to deliberations that led to abandoning its longtime
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy has made the most dramatic change and, in the
process, has nearly tripled in size to 73,000 square feet. The new
building, which will be finished this fall, overlooks a pond at the
corner of Fullerton Parkway and Cannon Drive. The Academy's
previous home, which is known as the Laflin Building after a
benefactor of the museum, has been renovated and turned into
administrative offices for the nearby Lincoln Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The new building was designed by Ralph Johnson, a principal with
the architectural firm of Perkins &AMP; Will. Johnson is also the
architect for the new Shedd Aquarium project.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy building, which is constructed of cream-colored
stone, is unusually shaped _ basically two trapezoidal wings
connected by a soaring glass and brick atrium. ``I don't think
there's a right angle in the entire building,'' said Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   According to Johnson, the building is meant to suggest a sand
dune, which is what was on the site until the park came into being
in the late 19th century. He added that he also wanted to strike a
blow for modernism in a park known for its many classically
inspired structures. ``I wanted to hit the right millennium,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The building is costing $33 million, $4 million of which is
coming from Richard Notebaert, chief executive of Ameritech Corp.,
a regional telephone company is based here. The donation is an
anniversary gift to his wife, Peggy, who is vice chairwoman of the
Academy's board of trustees. The building will be known as the
Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is using the building as an opportunity to both
raise its profile and redefine itself. ``We're not taking any of
the exhibits from the old building,'' said Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the new building will be a 4,300-square-foot
butterfly haven that will house several dozen indigenous butterfly
species. The haven, as well as the other exhibits, is being
designed by Lee H. Skolnik Architecture &AMP; Design Partnership, a New
York based firm that specializes in creating exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The Shedd project is a similarly bold reimagining of the
nation's oldest and largest indoor aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The Shedd consists of an elegant 1929 Beaux-Arts structure
designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst &AMP; White and a modern addition,
the Oceanarium, that was finished in 1990. The new project involves
both restoring and reconfiguring the original building and adding
two new partially underground wings.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project, the restoration of the museum's
soaring entry hall and skylit central rotunda, opened in early May.
The rotunda contains one of the museum's most popular exhibits, a
90,000-gallon tank swarming with barracudas, stingrays, moray eels
and other life native to the Caribbean. The tank has been totally
rebuilt and reconfigured in a way that makes it possible to isolate
some of the smaller species. ``This way, the big fish don't eat
them,'' said Bluestone.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase, which involves connecting and partially gutting
two of the building's galleries and installing an elaborate
walk-through diorama of life along the banks of the Amazon River,
is currently under way and is expected to be finished next June.
</P>
<P>
   Ground will be broken shortly for the final phase, the two new
30,000-square-foot wings on the north and south sides of the
building. The south wing, which will contain a 350,000-gallon shark
tank and several smaller tanks that will approximate life in a
Philippine Islands coral reef, will be finished in 2002. The north
wing, which will consist of life indigenous to the Great Lakes
area, will follow at a date yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The project _ minus the projected Great Lakes wing, which is at
an early stage of development _ will cost about $85 million and is
being driven by a fundamental shift in the way aquatic life is
displayed in modern aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, marine life was grouped by water temperature and
salinity. Thus, all animals that lived in warm, salty water
anywhere in the world were in the same gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach is to focus on specific geographic regions and
replace rows of individual aquariums with spectacular, interactive
exhibits that usually involve large tanks and an expanded animal
population. The overall effect owes as much to Walt Disney as to
Jacques Cousteau.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Amazon exhibit alone,'' said Bluestone, ``we're going
to have birds and monkeys, a marmoset, a sloth, a 30-foot anaconda
and other land animals. We're becoming a place that is part
aquarium, part botanical garden, part zoo and part museum of
natural history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adler Planetarium also is doing a top-to-bottom renovation
of its original 1930 Art Deco building. The building, which has 12
sides adorned with astrological signs and is topped by a dome, was
designed by Ernest Grunsfeld Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Adler opened a new $20-million wing that curves
around the original building like a glass collar and contains a new
virtual reality theater, as well as several exhibits and a
restaurant. The current $10-million renovation, which will be
finished this fall, aims both to correct some past remodeling sins
and to update the museum's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adler originally was a planetarium with a few exhibits
people could look at while they were waiting for the show to
start,'' said museum president Paul Knappenberger. ``What we're
doing now is creating a full-fledged astronomy museum with 45,000
square feet of exhibition space and state-of-the-art exhibits.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main exhibits being added are an introduction to the
universe and a history of mankind's view of the universe that will
include objects from the Adler's extensive collection of
astronomical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Adler also is restoring the building's original main
entrance, which has been closed since the '70s. It was replaced by
an odd glass box in front of the building that contained an
escalator and required visitors to enter through the building's
basement. The box has been dismantled and ``visitors will now be
able to enter through the original grand entrance,'' said
Knappenberger.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOMATON, Ala. _ It was a scene straight out of a Hollywood
disaster thriller, an emergency manager's worst nightmare: traffic
gridlock on a huge network of highways as a Category 5 hurricane
bore down on a heavily populated stretch of coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worried drivers fumed behind the wheel in bumper-to-bumper
traffic, their cars packed with kids, grandmas, pets and precious
possessions, unable to move as the skies darkened behind them. The
scene was all too real in dozens of small towns just north of the
Gulf Coast in October 1995 as Hurricane Opal blossomed overnight
into a killer storm, prompting a pell-mell, late-hour evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the storm lost punch just as it roared ashore and
the thousands of evacuees stranded in their cars weren't thrown
about like toys facing nature's overpowering wrath.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson wasn't lost on the towns of Flomaton, Brewton,
Century and Milton, where exhausted officials scrambled futilely to
unclog the roads and find a place to put frightened people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened every shelter we could and some we couldn't even get
permission for,'' said Brewton Mayor Ted Jennings. ``It was a bad
experience. As a mayor I don't guess I've ever had that tremendous
a responsibility, with so many lives depending on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The scare has prompted a flurry of proposals to improve the road
systems leading away from the booming Gulf Coast, where the
population of the Pensacola metro area alone is expected to double
to 750,000 by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Alabama, construction has already begun on a new
bridge and northward route from the Gulf beaches in Baldwin County.
In Florida, two unusual alliances have formed _ each spanning the
Alabama-Florida state line _ to lobby for better routes away from
northwest Florida beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some Florida officials are so worried they are even proposing
their state pay to build roads in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida money is typically used on Florida roadways,'' said
Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who lives in Escambia County
and supports one of the routes. ``But if you don't ask, you won't
know if there is an opportunity for funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Long road to improvements
</P>
<P>
   But it could be years before the routes from Florida connecting
to I-65 in Alabama are improved. Highway officials in both states
say the projects aren't yet on their work lists and the lead time
for such projects typically takes years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those plans are not in our five-year program,'' said Regina
Battles, a Florida Department of Transportation official who works
in the panhandle. ``First, local officials have to give us their
priorities and then the projects would have to work their way up
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials vow to lobby long and hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opal really showed us the necessity,'' said Escambia County
Commissioner Tom Banjanin. ``We heard a lot of horror stories about
people trapped on the roads for 20 hours. It's a humanitarian
project.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal study in the early 1990s found there was a need for an
interstate highway spur to connect I-65 and I-10, the major,
controlled-access highways through the region. But the $500 million
price tag has been too steep and no federal funding has been
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves local officials scrambling to upgrade existing
routes.
</P>
<P>
   In Banjanin's county, four-lane U.S. 29 leads 40 miles north out
of Pensacola to the Alabama state line, but there it hits a
bottleneck in Flomaton. Drivers must work their way north to I-65
on two-lane Ala. 113, or go east or west on U.S. 31, which is part
two-lane, part three-lane and part four-lane. Banjanin has allied
with Flomaton officials calling for the four-laning of 14 miles of
113, the shortest, straightest route to I-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it bad,'' said Flomaton Mayor Joe Brantley. ``That
storm in '95 came real close to being a big disaster. I'd feel a
whole lot better if we already had it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Flomaton-Pensacola alliance isn't the only cross-state
effort under way.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east in Santa Rosa County, Fla., mayors from Milton
and Gulf Breeze have joined their counterparts from Brewton and
East Brewton in a push to four-lane about 40 miles of Fla. 87 and
Ala. 41, which lead into Brewton. They also want to four-lane U.S.
31 north from Brewton to I-65.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would boost our economy and make hurricane evacuation
easier,'' said Milton Mayor Guy Thompson. ``We've been yelling
about this for years, but now with our growth, we need it badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials are aware of the problems and
also hope the roads will be built, but they have no say in
highway-building decisions. Instead, they have tried to learn from
the Opal near-disaster, hoping to be more precise and timely with
evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   States cooperate
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials now include Alabama emergency managers in the
conference telephone calls when evacuation decisions are made, and
also have traffic counters who estimate the cars headed north, said
Jim Loftis, a Florida Division of Emergency Management spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuing process of awareness and education,'' Loftis
said. ``But the bottom line is that every person needs to have a
plan for their family that is based on where they live and the
information they get from their local emergency managers.''
</P>
<P>
   While emergency officials once worried that not enough people
would heed evacuation orders, they now realize that a mass exodus
can be equally dangerous. In Florida, officials urge residents who
live in flood zones or mobile homes to evacuate to local shelters,
while those who live in sturdy, upland homes are urged to stay in
their homes except in catastrophic storms.
</P>
<P>
   While the Florida groups are just organizing, their neighbors in
Baldwin County, Ala., are already beginning construction, thanks in
part to another unusual partnership.
</P>
<P>
   A private bridge company run by the sons of former Alabama Gov.
Fob James is building a new toll bridge across the Intracoastal
Waterway from Orange Beach, a densely-packed stretch of beach 10
miles away from the only current waterway bridge, Ala. 59 in Gulf
Shores.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also build 6 miles of road to connect with a
7.5-mile section of four-lane the city of Foley is constructing to
help relieve traffic on Ala. 59, which in summer months is packed
with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin County is also planning a 13-mile stretch that would
connect to the Foley road and carry travelers to I-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real safety issue,'' said Foley Mayor Tim Russell,
whose city got a federal grant for its section of the new highway.
``We've just got tremendous growth here and we've got to have a way
to get these people out of here if there's a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, officials insist the Escambia and Santa Rosa
projects aren't competing; instead, both groups pledge to support
the other because they believe both projects are needed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Escambia project may have an advantage: 40 miles of
four-lane is already in place on U.S. 29 in Florida, and the
Alabama Department of Transportation already owns the right-of-way
for four-laning the 14 miles of 113, Banjanin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no major bridges to build, either,'' he said. ``The
estimate is about $28 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alabama officials say the project isn't in their plans,
although they are four-laning U.S. 31, which runs east-west between
Brewton and Atmore and could help ease the evacuation crunch. They
also have improvement projects under way farther east on roads
leading into Florida. But the 113 project may have trouble getting
funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of prioritizing our resources,'' said Paul
Bowlin, assistant director of Alabama's DOT. ``Frankly, except
under an evacuation situation which might only come up once every
few years, the traffic on that road wouldn't justify it. We'll
certainly listen to any proposal, but it always comes down to
priorities.''

 &HT;    Sad squirrel tale: Gray variety falling prey to potent pox
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mutant squirrels are popping up in
backyards, ravaged by a pox not seen in Florida since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   So far, between 300 and 500 squirrels riddled with crusty brown
tumors _ some covering 90 percent of the body _ have been reported
in eight counties including Palm Beach County and the Treasure
Coast. Pathologists studying the epidemic at the University of
Florida suspect thousands more are infected with the disease. It is
specific to squirrels and cannot be contracted by other wildlife,
pets or humans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a pox particularly potent.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitted by mosquitoes, the disease almost always attacks the
eyes, leaving its little victims blind and unable to plunder bird
feeders, their eyes swollen ``as big as marbles,'' said Florida
Game and Freshwater Fish Commission biologist Timothy Regan.
</P>
<P>
   As it progresses, it ravages the body with tumors so severe that
in some cases limbs have sloughed off. The critters eventually
starve to death or die from bacteria infecting tumors. There is no
treatment or preventive vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a hospital, it's difficult for us to watch something like
this and we understand it's difficult for some people. They're cute
and hop around in the yard and people put out peanuts,'' said Dan
Martinelli, director of the Treasure Coast Wildlife Hospital in
Hobe Sound, which has received about a dozen pox-infested
squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   (For those with a more culinary interest in the squirrel, the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources reports that the pocked
carcasses are safe for consumption: ``The tumors are confined to
the skin and are removed when the animal is skinned.'')
</P>
<P>
   Technically called squirrel fibromatosis, the pox first appeared
near Melbourne in the fall when the Florida Wildlife Hospital and
Sanctuary there started receiving calls about mutant squirrels.
Between November and March, 38 disfigured corpses were brought to
the center. In March, the University of Florida's veterinary
college began receiving calls from wildlife clinics and vets, said
pathologist Dr. Scott Terrell. The lab identified the disease as
squirrel pox, which has been documented in Florida only once
before, on Amelia Island in February 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is commonly found in Northern states. However,
outbreaks usually occur with far less severity and in much smaller
numbers. Florida's 1974 outbreak involved only a few squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to happen in such huge numbers is unusual. That's what
we're trying to figure out is if it's a new virus or if it was
introduced to a particularly susceptible population of squirrels,''
Terrell said. ``We're trying to survey the whole state.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pox has appeared in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie,
Indian River, Okeechobee, Brevard, Osceola and Orange counties,
attacking gray squirrels, Florida's predominant species, Terrell
said. Nothing can be done but allow the disease to play itself out,
he said. A certain number of squirrels will die, some will develop
a resistance and some will be naturally immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate instance of nature having to run its
course,'' Martinelli said. ``We tell people almost everyday this is
going to be a rough year for squirrels. That's the bottom line.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Berkowitz, the serial killer known as the Son
of Sam, wept in prison last week, grieving over the coming release
of a Spike Lee movie called ``Summer of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Mona Lisa half-smile that spooked the nation after
his arrest 22 summers ago. Gone, too, was the unblinking stare that
unnerved detectives when the pudgy postal clerk cheerfully
confessed how he shot six people to death and wounded seven others.
He took orders, he said then, from a black Labrador retriever owned
by a neighbor named Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Now 46 years old, still pudgy, and going gray, Berkowitz walked
briskly last week into a cramped visiting room in the Sullivan
Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in southeastern
New York state. He carried a Bible and smelled pleasantly of talcum
powder. In a green polo shirt, white Nikes and blue prison pants,
the most publicized murderer in New York history had the crisp,
slightly officious bearing of a camp counselor _ until he began to
cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This madness, the ugliness of the past is resurfacing again _
all because some people want to make some money,'' said Berkowitz,
who agreed to be interviewed because of his distress over Lee's
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy superintendent for security at the prison describes
Berkowitz as an ``exemplary'' inmate whose good behavior has made
him a role model for other prisoners. The murderer who once taunted
police with notes about hunting in Queens for ``tasty meat'' says
he is a born-again Christian. He works as a helper and peer
counselor in the prison's mental health unit.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz said that from prison he monitors ``everything there
is'' about Spike Lee and his family. ``I pray for Spike Lee and his
family, his wife, Tonya, his two children, Jackson and Satchel,''
he said. ``God does not want me to be angry with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures will not release the
movie until the first week of July, ``Summer of Sam'' is already
jarring loose memories _ some of them extraordinarily painful _
inside the circle of New Yorkers whose lives were fundamentally
changed by the Son of Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of young people killed by Berkowitz are enraged by
the movie. They accuse Lee of callously cashing in on their misery.
For the police who struggled to find Berkowitz and for the
journalists who made reputations covering him, the movie, which has
been screened for a few people in New York, has become an occasion
to meditate on a singularly riveting episode in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the movie shows a corpulent Son of Sam
character stalking the boroughs of New York at night, firing his
.44-caliber revolver into the faces of young people, most of them
women in parked cars. The murder scenes are unflinching,
blood-splattered and harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz said the movie will cause needless pain for families
of his victims, while reminding America of what is better
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just so sorry that this movie is coming out,'' he said.
``I am so sorry that, you know, this pain doesn't seem to end. I am
disappointed in Hollywood and the Walt Disney company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' zeroes in on what Lee has called an ``insane''
season in the history of New York. ``I was attempting to put
madness on film,'' he said at the Cannes Film Festival last month.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1977 was maddeningly hot and sticky. An electrical
blackout triggered looting. The city teetered near bankruptcy.
Police seemed powerless to stop a mysterious white man from
killing. Periodically, the killer teased the city with chillingly
literate notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that because you haven't heard from me for a while
that I went to sleep,'' Berkowitz wrote to Jimmy Breslin, then a
columnist for The Daily News. ``No, rather, I am still here, like a
spirit roaming the night. Thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest;
anxious to please Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslin, who appears as himself in Lee's movie, said,
``Berkowitz is the only murderer I ever heard of who knew how to
use a semicolon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two murders occurred within a mile of where Breslin lived in
Forest Hills, Queens. His daughter, Rosemary, was the age of the
victims. Afraid that his daughter might be a target, Breslin sent
his family to live with relatives in East Hampton and accepted
police protection for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dreadful summer,'' said Breslin, now a columnist at
Newsday. ``My family was away. I was drinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   People unable to move out of the city devised ways to elude the
Son of Sam, who was rumored to prefer longhaired brunettes. Many
hundreds of young women had their hair cut short and dyed blond.
Thousands more simply stayed home at night. Many nightclubs and
restaurants in the Bronx and Queens were all but empty that summer.
</P>
<P>
   For police and for the news media, it was a season of lucrative
overtime and neglected families, soaring television ratings and
record newsstand sales, professional jealousy and shameless
gimmicks to milk the story. Editors at The New York Post, which had
recently been purchased by Rupert Murdoch, were said to be furious
that Berkowitz chose to write to The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murdoch was screaming, `Why can't we get a letter from this
blighter,''' said Breslin, who remains puzzled as to why Berkowitz
singled him out.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Berkowitz was captured, The Daily News sold 2.2
million copies, 350,000 more than usual. After its famous one-word
banner headline _ ``CAUGHT!'' _ circulation at The New York Post
jumped for a day from 609,000 to 1 million. At its core, though,
the hunt for the Son of Sam was ghastly, soul-crushing work. Hordes
of detectives and reporters periodically spent long nights
inspecting the bullet-mangled bodies of innocent young people and
then weeks hounding heartsick families.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of those families remain heartsick. They are also furious
about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee feels that murder is entertainment, which, No. 1, it
is not,'' said Michael Lauria, 67, a retired bus mechanic in the
Bronx. His 18-year-old daughter, Donna, was Berkowitz's first
murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee is making the families relive this all over again,''
said Lauria, who protested last summer when the movie was filmed in
the Bronx. ``He is making money off my sorrow and my family's hurt.
He has got no compassion. They should have come to the families and
asked for permission. Let me tell you something, Walt Disney must
be turning over in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Neysa Moskowitz, 66, whose 20-year-old daughter, Stacy, was the
last to die, said she does not want her daughter ``to be remembered
all bloody and shot by a lunatic.'' A scene of her daughter being
shot to death in Brooklyn is depicted in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike Lee was out there to make a buck, but he could have been
much, much nicer to the families,'' said Mrs. Moskowitz,
interviewed by telephone from her apartment in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the pain of the victims' families, Lee said:
``I made a statement on that at the beginning. You will have to do
some fact checking.'' He ended the phone interview after less than
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   At Cannes in May, Lee told reporters: ``I feel deeply for the
parents of the victims of Son of Sam. At the same time, I'm an
artist, and this is a story I wanted to tell. Even if I didn't make
this film, that was not going to bring their daughters, their loved
ones, back. They got buried by a psychopath. We do not feel that
the film is a glorification of David Berkowitz.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berkowitz was arrested and confessed to the murders, a
handful of the 200 detectives assigned to the investigation were
promoted. Joe Coffee, a sergeant in charge of the weekend night
shift when Berkowitz committed most of his murders, was among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a $5,000-a-year raise,'' said Coffee, 61, who retired
from the police force in 1985. ``But I think the case has taken at
least 10 years off my life. I quit smoking three years before I got
called in on Son of Sam. But I started again after I saw what he
did to Virginia Voskerichian, and I never stopped smoking since.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Voskerichian, 19, a Barnard College student, was shot in the
face and killed, a scene that is depicted in Lee's movie.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer who profited most from working on the case is
Bill Clark, now an executive producer of the television drama
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do make more money than the police commissioner,'' said
Clark, 55, who credits his 1992 move to television, after a 25-year
police career, to contacts he made with reporters while working on
the Berkowitz case. Clark lives in a large house in Santa Monica,
Calif., and owns four cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fair bet to say had I not met Dick Schaap and Jimmy
Breslin, I probably would not have ended up out here,'' Clark said
in a phone interview. Schaap and Breslin worked together on a novel
based on the shootings called ``.44.''
</P>
<P>
   At the extreme end of the Son of Sam continuum is Berkowitz
himself. He is serving six consecutive life sentences that total
more than 300 years. An inmate at Attica slashed his throat in
1979, and the wound required 65 stitches. For fighting with the
many inmates who taunted him, he was often confined to his cell in
Attica and other prisons. The fights ended with his transfer 12
years ago to Sullivan Correctional Facility, where he says he
converted to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be released from prison,'' he said last week. ``I
deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life. I can accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz prefers not to talk about, as he blandly puts it,
``the things that happened in my case.'' But when pressed, he
blames the murders on Satan. In a television interview two years
ago, he said he belonged to a satanic cult when he was the Son of
Sam. He committed only three of the six murders to which he pleaded
guilty, he said, while other cult members committed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely convinced without a shadow of a doubt that I
was demonically possessed and controlled,'' he said last week. ``I
allowed these spirits through my own ignorance to control me. The
murder and mayhem was a result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few police officers, a former district attorney in Queens and
several journalists subscribe to the cult theory. But some
detectives, like Joe Coffee, who worked the case and who listened
to Berkowitz's confession, say the theory is ludicrous. They say
the confession had details only the killer could know.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about the cult, Berkowitz refused to be
specific. ``I knew some people, yes, there was satanic influence,''
he said. ``I would rather not talk about that. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   He was eager, though, to talk about his two Christian videos,
which have been distributed to schools and prisons around the
country and which warn young people to avoid his satanic mistakes.
One video is called ``Son of Sam/Son of Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz writes several letters a day to ``my Christian
friends'' around the world. Last week, he showed off a picture of a
Tanzanian baby named David Wandamba, who he said was named after
him by a grateful father to whom he has been sending Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of some of his victims do not believe the conversion is
genuine. ``I don't want to hear that,'' Mrs. Moskowitz said. ``Show
me one person that goes away for murder who doesn't turn to
religion. I heard that someone named his son for him. I think that
it is utterly, utterly so sick.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had not been a serial killer, Berkowitz said he probably
would have ended up ``married with a wife and kids in the suburbs,
making a living, working in the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted anything special,'' he said.

RIVER GUARDIANS CONFER ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. _ Billy Joel took the helm of his new
65-foot-long boat, the Redhead, and with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., at
his side in the pilot's seat, led 50 environmentalists who keep
watch on the nation's waterways on a tour of Peconic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're heading in from Block Island, you can
almost imagine how pristine it was here when the first explorers
arrived hundreds of years ago,'' Joel said as he maneuvered the
Redhead away from the dock at the Sag Harbor Yacht Club early
Friday, gave a warning blast on the boat's horn and headed out into
the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Joel, long an advocate for the dwindling number of commercial
fishermen and bay men on Long Island's East End, helped win
congressional approval of the bay as a national estuary in 1993,
providing it with protection from pollution under the Clean Water
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by Congress a quarter-century ago, the Clean Water Act
gave citizens broad powers to enforce environmental laws through
private lawsuits. It led to hundreds of suits filed by citizens
that produced millions of dollars in penalties paid to the
government and scores of court orders to stop pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, more of the suits are being turned back by
rulings by the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, greatly
diminishing the power of environmentalists like the 50 members of
the Water Keeper Alliance aboard the Redhead.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the alliance, all grass-roots river and bay activists
from across North America, gathered Thursday at the Southampton
College of Long Island University for a four-day conference to
discuss their legal rights and to form a strategy to respond to the
legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized by Kennedy, a founder of the Water
Keeper Alliance, an umbrella group of 35 keeper programs in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The keepers, including Kevin McAllister, the Keeper of Peconic
Bay and a host aboard the Redhead, cast themselves among the most
aggressive and litigious members of the environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no current legal action involving Peconic Bay,
groups like the San Francisco Baykeeper and the Hudson Riverkeeper
maintain more than 40 lawsuits against environmental polluters at
one time, according to Kennedy, who also is the supervising
attorney for the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic at the Pace
University School of Law in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper in Georgia
recently won a $1 billion judgment against the city of Atlanta for
violating clean-water laws at its sewage-treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent losses in court, he said, were the primary
concern at last week's conference on Long Island, which included
Joel's boat tour, a clambake on the beach at Cow Neck on Friday
night and the South Fork annual dinner dance on Saturday night, and
is scheduled to end Sunday morning with a farewell breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past decade, right-wing jurists have eroded or
dismantled many of the environmental protections and citizens'
rights that Congress wrote into the environmental statutes passed
after Earth Day in 1970,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions are being written just as many of the nation's
rivers and beaches are recovering from decades of abuse and are
being reopened for fishing and swimming,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first Keeper program was started on the Hudson River by a
coalition of commercial and recreational fishermen who came
together in 1996 to reclaim the river, Kennedy said. Since its
incorporation in 1984, Hudson Riverkeeper has brought more than 150
successful lawsuits against river polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the Hudson inspired similar keeper groups from
Cook Inlet in Alaska to St. John's River in Florida, and from San
Diego Bay in California to Casco Bay in Maine. Kennedy said he
christened the 35th riverkeeper and the first Canadian keeper
program a week ago on the Petitcodiac River in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the keepers, buoyed by encouragement from a
rock 'n' roll legend, were back at work at the Southampton campus
absorbing the finer points of gaining legal standing in a court of
law from a lecture by Karl Coplan, a lawyer with the Pace
Environmental Litigation Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Congress has said in the Clean Water Act that
any person can sue, the courts are now saying there are
limitations,'' he said. ``The courts are now saying you have to
show an actual injury that you can point to and perceive. It may be
true that a plant may be putting pollution in water and breaking
the law, but when you get to court you have to point to something
tangible that proves the water has been affected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he referred to a ruling June 2 by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Columbia, S.C., in a suit brought by
Friends of the Earth, a citizens environmental group, on behalf of
the operators of a canoe-trip company, against Gaston Copper
Recycling Corp., which sits aside Lake Watson in Gaston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing, as they
failed to prove that the canoe business had suffered because the
recycling plant had once discharged lead and copper into the lake.
The canoe company argued that it could sell more trips if the water
did not have a history of pollution. The court said this was not
good enough, Coplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get standing, the courts are insisting that we get very
personal and specific about how we are affected by pollution, and
this can be tough to litigate,'' he told the keepers.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SHUFFLING THROUGH THE STAR WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial observer for Sunday,
June 20:
</P>
<P>
   White Americans make up about 80 percent of the population
today. But people who identify themselves as ``white'' are a
steadily shrinking majority, losing ground to Americans of Latin,
Asian and African descent. The inevitable ``browning'' of America
is happening fastest among school-aged children, where nonwhites
will become the majority by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry as a whole was slow to recognize the
broadening market for black, Latin and Asian characters who
transcended the customary marginalism and stereotypes of Hollywood.
But futurists and science-fiction producers were another story.
They embraced multicultural themes more than 30 years ago and drew
heavily on the work of writers like Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le
Guin and especially the ``Star Trek'' developers, Gene Roddenberry
and D.C. Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek'' televised one of the first interracial kisses _
between Capt. Kirk and Lt. Uhura _ in 1968, well before Hollywood
had the nerve. At a time when most black movie actors were confined
to roles as pimps, prostitutes and illiterates, ``Star Trek''
conceived a future where minority actors could play intellectuals,
military officers _ and eventually star ship captains and space
station commanders, like Benjamin Sisko on the ``Star Trek''
spinoff ``Deep Space Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of futurism as a matter of gadgets. But in
``Star Trek,'' the most ``futuristic'' aspect was its depiction of
whites, blacks, Asians _ and Vulcans _ working with mutual respect
toward a common goal, unencumbered by the racial hostilities that
have poisoned the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   This ethos seems to have triumphed in science fiction _ except
in the mind of George Lucas, the ``Star Wars'' king. The first
``Star Wars'' film in 1977 had a great many white actors speaking
with British accents, but no black faces on the screen. The lone
black actor, James Earl Jones, was the voice of the villain, Darth
Vader. Stung by critics, Lucas drafted Billy Dee Williams into
``The Empire Strikes Back'' but made him a token with no real
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would have proceeded cautiously after all the
grumbling. But Lucas has run into race-related controversy yet
again with ``The Phantom Menace.'' The characters who most resemble
Asians here are greedy, rapacious and disturbingly similar to Asian
hordes in the 1940s serials. But the main trouble centers on Jar
Jar Binks, a digitalized alien who speaks in an exaggerated West
Indian patois and lopes along in a combination shuffle and pimp
walk. Binks is by far the stupidest person in the film. His
simple-minded devotion to his (white) Jedi masters has reminded
people of Hollywood's most offensive racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   David Ansen of Newsweek likened the character to Stepin Fetchit,
the grinning, shuffling character who defined the black presence in
film well into the 1940s. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe
Morgenstern compared Binks to Butterfly McQueen, Miss Scarlett's
feather-brained maid in ``Gone With the Wind.'' The Rasta alien has
been torched on the Internet, primarily by a group calling itself
the Society for the Extermination of Jar Jar Binks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Lucasfilm responded that nothing in ``Star
Wars'' was ``racially motivated'' and dismissed racial
interpretations as ``absurd,'' offering the lame excuse that Binks
was a fantasy. But so were the black characters in ``Birth of a
Nation'' whose eyeballs popped grotesquely from their heads when
they saw Klansmen clad in white sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Binks did not spring full blown from the forehead of the
universe. The filmmakers drafted a dancer from the show ``Stomp.''
Then they instructed him on how to speak and move in a way they
found amusing. Finally, they replaced the human dancer with a
digital version of an amphibian creature they had created from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   To put it plainly, Lucasfilm built this fantasy plank by plank
and nail by nail. Instead of casting aspersions on Binks' critics,
Lucas and his friends need to examine the contents of their own
minds.

 &HT;    COHEN TOURS KOSOVO, AND CLINTON MAY NOT BE FAR BEHIND
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia Defense Secretary William Cohen Saturday
led a coming parade of Western leaders eager to plant their foot on
the soil of Kosovo and thank the NATO occupation troops
</P>
<P>
   for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton is expected to visit troops in the
American occupation zone of Kosovo on Tuesday or Wednesday, said
two staff officers who have been assigned to make arrangements for
a planned Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   There were also signs of a visit in the next few days to Kosovo
by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, following the weekend summit
meeting of G-8 industrialized nations in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally indebted to all of you for what you do day in
and day
</P>
<P>
   out,'' Cohen told Army paratroopers and tank crews gathered in
the city
</P>
<P>
   square. ``The courage, the discipline, the commitment, the
patriotism
</P>
<P>
   everything that you demonstrate day in and day out says why
America is
</P>
<P>
   Number One.''
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly intended as a pep talk for the troops from Fort
Bragg,
</P>
<P>
   N.C., and from Germany who landed in Albania in early April,
expecting to go to
</P>
<P>
   war, and have now been ordered here for a tour of peacekeeping
duty that
</P>
<P>
   could last into October.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Urosevac has been the scene of a panicky
exodus of
</P>
<P>
   more than 4,000 Serbian civilians who fled north to Serbia after
a wave of
</P>
<P>
   about a dozen kidnappings of Serbians, many from prominent
families.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how important it is for Western leaders to
</P>
<P>
   arrange for the departed Serbs to return to Kosovo, Cohen said:
``We are
</P>
<P>
   neutral on this subject. We are not taking favorites, we want
everyone to
</P>
<P>
   stay. What we want is a peaceful environment. To the extent that
the Serbs
</P>
<P>
   can be assured that they are going to be secure, we want that as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House staff has disclosed plans for Clinton to greet
American
</P>
<P>
   troops across the border in Macedonia but has said nothing about
a possible trip to
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo. However, the two officers said that Clinton tentatively
plans to helicopter here from Macedonia to visit peacekeeping
troops of the Army's 82d Airborne Division and the Marines' 26th
Marine
</P>
<P>
   Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's visit to the city square of this largest Kosovar town
under
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army control provided a preview of the kind of adulation
Clinton can
</P>
<P>
   expect should he tour the American zone.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was serenaded by chants of ``USA, USA, USA'' from a
delirious
</P>
<P>
   cluster of Kosovar Albanian onlookers who happened to turn up in
the city
</P>
<P>
   square when Cohen and NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark stepped
out of an
</P>
<P>
   Army Humvee. Army sharpshooters were stationed on rooftops, and
the square
</P>
<P>
   was sealed off by machine-gunners aboard Humvees.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of Cohen's security detail, one burly Kosovar
man
</P>
<P>
   enveloped Cohen in a bearhug, then kissed him on both cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen and Clark were greeting troops, NATO negotiators were
in the
</P>
<P>
   last stages of working out an ``understanding'' with the general
staff of the
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Liberation Army that is expected to result in an
agreement for the
</P>
<P>
   KLA to lay down its arms.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a prelude to the broader agreement, the
commander of
</P>
<P>
   82d Airborne troops in Kosovo, Lt. Col. Joe Anderson, said he
had obtained
</P>
<P>
   an agreement from a KLA brigade commander to turn over a sizable
stockpile
</P>
<P>
   of KLA arms to American troops on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This followed the KLA's release of five Serb hostages Saturday,
</P>
<P>
   as demanded by the 82d Airborne commander in a face-to-face
</P>
<P>
   meeting with KLA officials 24 hours earlier.

   Fans who stayed late last Sunday to see Cal Ripken finish his
6-for-6 night at Turner Field in Atlanta will never forget it, but
Ripken has been carrying on like that for a month. Emotionally
exhausted with back pain and forced on the DL April 19, Ripken in
his first 29 games back hit .375 with seven homers and 24 RBIs
while improving his season average 159 points to .338. ``I had a
little bit of a break from the baseball action, and I actually
distanced myself from the ballpark and gave myself a chance to heal
mentally,'' he said, referring to the death of his father. ``I came
back with a little bit sharper focus. Physically, I'm pretty sound,
and I'm enjoying the results.'' This is a ticklish time for the
O's, who have until the All-Star break to pick up the option year
for next season on Ripken's expiring contract. It is worth $6.3
million. Ripken turns 39 in August.... The Devil Rays are stocked
if the NFL ever buys them. The Rays just came to terms with
second-round pick Carl Crawford, who has signed with Nebraska to
play quarterback. He joins three other quarterbacks in the system,
including pitcher Jason Standridge, who turned down Auburn, and
pitcher Maquis Roberts, who turned down Fresno State. Kenny Kelly,
hitting .392 in Class A, is the starting quarterback at the
University of Miami.

   There is bad karma in the Twin Cities, where three Twins went
down within seven days after inopportune encounters with the
baseball. Right fielder Matt Lawton took aa fastball to the face
from Cincinnati's Dennys Reyes. Doctors haven't even let him jog,
because the broken bones around the socket of his right eye might
slip when jostled. Next up was pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who took a
grounder off his kneecap against Milwaukee last Saturday. Three
nights later, it was pitcher Brad Radke's turn, taking a line drive
off the shin. The club is trying to blame outfielder Marty Cordova,
who one day asked Lawton if he had ever been on the disabled list.
Lawton went down a few nights later, triggering the sequence. ``I
left all kinds of nasty messages on his phone,'' Lawton said.
``That was my ticket to the disabled list.''... The Kansas City
bullpen is chasing history after blowing 13 of the club's first 24
save opportunities. No team has ever finished a full season with
more blown saves than saves, although the Dodgers managed it _ 20
saves, 21 blown saves _ in strike-shortened 1994.... On the average
weekday, the White Sox ticket office handles 1,000 orders for
future games. On the Monday after the Sox swept the Cubs, the
office handled 6,200.

   Anaheim lost yet another Angel, this one after just seven
innings in the majors. Outfielder Mike Colangelo collided with
Reggie Williams and sustained a concussion and torn thumb
ligaments. Colangelo is the 12th Angel to land on the disabled
list, leaving embattled manager Terry Collins to wonder what he
might have done differently. ``You say to yourself, `What can you
change? What are we missing?''' Collins said. ``But when you look
back at all these injuries, they're not through a lack of training.
With the exception of (Gary) DiSarcina's, which was a fluke (he
broke a forearm bone when hit by coach George Hendrick's fungo
bat), they're because of aggressiveness. (Tim) Salmon and (Jim)
Edmonds dive for balls, and even if we had a railing up in front of
the dugout, Mo (Vaughn) would have crashed into it. I wouldn't want
those guys to change.''... When Oakland lost a two-run lead in the
ninth and fell to Cleveland on Wednesday night, the A's told
manager Art Howe to wait outside the clubhouse while the players
held a meeting. Howe's curiosity was answered the next night when
Cleveland staged a five-run seventh and won 10-6.

   Bruce Benedict had managed just eight Class AAA games since
leaving the Braves organization in 1995 to work the New York Mets
system. He was so nervous Wednesday night when took over during
Bobby Valentine's suspension that Benedict forgot to wear a hat.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally found one, it was a nylon style the Mets use
only for batting practice, and it was the fourth inning before
someone fit him with the right one. The Mets beat Cincinnati 5-2,
and the whole night was a little calmer. New York starter Masato
Yoshii said, ``The only thing I noticed was that it was real quiet
in the dugout. That's when I noticed Bobby wasn't there.''... With
Craig Counsell dealt to Los Angeles, only three players remain with
the Florida Marlins from the 1997 title team _ Antonio Alfonseca,
Livan Hernandez and Cliff Floyd; Alex Fernandez was on the DL. The
Dodgers now have four players from that team: Counsell, Gary
Sheffield, Devon White and Kevin Brown.... Montreal right fielder

   The Cubs are getting an unwanted reputation for mishandling
their arms. Jeremi Gonzalez, a promising rookie two years ago now
recovering from elbow surgery, has quit throwing at Class AAA Iowa.
He charged that the club demoted him illegally and said his arm
still hurts. Gonzalez also says he was advised by one doctor to
have a complete ``Tommy John'' ligament transplant, although the
club opted for an ulnar-nerve tranposition. Gonzalez's complaints
could be characterized as the frustrations of one young pitcher,
except that Rod Beck charged last month that the team delayed in
approving his elbow surgery for elbow deposits. Although he was in
pain during spring training, surgery was finally done in mid-May.
And there is still some criticism about the way the club monitored
Kerry Wood's elbow, which began troubling him in mid-1998. So, what
was Cubs general Ed Lynch looking at during the eight years he
pitched in the majors?... Ray Lankford's knee, operated on during
the offseason, still hasn't stabilized so that he can play center
field every day. Manager Tony La Russa will keep him in left for
the duration.

   No sooner did the Los Angeles Dodgers flop to fourth place last
week than every horn sounded in the front office. Within two days,
the team benched catcher Todd Hundley and sent him to ``catcher
school'' with bullpen coach Rick Dempsey; dropped former
first-rounder Darren Dreifort from the rotation for Braves
flunk-out Jamie Arnold; and acquired second baseman Craig Counsell
from Florida, although he walks into a deeper personnel jam than
the one that forced him away from the Marlins. The Dodgers lost 11
of 15 entering the weekend and haven't been in first since the
seventh day of the season. Asked how this mess gets straightened
out, left fielder Gary Sheffield said, ``I don't know. I'll let
Malone figure that out.'' That would be general manager Kevin
Malone, who said, ``I'm at my wit's end.''... Coors Field has
yielded 109 homers in the season's first 27 games. That's a
327-homer pace. The record is 276, set three years ago.... Barry
Bonds feels wanted. San Francisco's left fielder can tell a
difference, now that he's fighting back after elbow surgery. ``I
haven't gotten booed on the road,'' he said. ``In Seattle, they
were cheering and saying they're happy I'm back.... It's a change
for me. I didn't even know people liked me that much.''

 &HT;    All-Star Game streak ending for Atlanta
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most charming aspect about the All-Star game is
how the public is invited to select the lineups, which of course is
also the worst possible thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ardent supporter of the hometown team,'' humorist Robert
Benchley wrote, ``should go to a game prepared to take offense, no
matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans play favorites, hold grudges, display incredible ignorance
and abuse their ballot just as much as the managers or the media
would, if it were up to them. But as popular voice is held so
dearly by this nation, the All-Star vote has become the best way to
judge how big a moron the guy next to you is when taking your seat
at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Yet baseball followers across the country are saying something
different this summer, different at least to a sentiment that has
reigned across the game during this decade. They are tired of the
Atlanta Braves, and they want them to go away.
</P>
<P>
   When the All-Star teams are announced this week, the Braves will
not have a starting player in the NL lineup for the first time
since 1991. The same franchise that in the last three years has had
12 players make 19 All-Star appearances might have a couple added
as reserves for the July 13 game in Boston, Brian Jordan and
Chipper Jones; Javy Lopez and John Rocker are long shots. But
that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fair? Not particularly for Jordan, Atlanta's most
productive hitter, whose 55 RBIs entering the weekend ranked third
in the league. He was running eighth in the last voting update
released last week, behind Andruw Jones, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, justice is being served. Chipper Jones had drawn
more votes than any Brave but still trailed Arizona third baseman
Matt Williams, who is having a better season a half-dozen different
ways. Lopez was third among catchers behind New York's Mike Piazza
and Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall, which sounds about right.
</P>
<P>
   What makes any of this suspicious is that the All-Star vote,
stripped to the core, is just a popularity contest, and all signals
say the Braves remain immensely popular. They were the first NL
team to crack the 1 million mark this season. On the road, their
hotels are mobbed as if Ricky Martin just checked in.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris Poll released last week found the Braves to be the
game's most popular team for the seventh year in a row, ahead of
the New York Yankees by a healthy margin. TBS has plenty to do with
it, but that's how the poll business works.
</P>
<P>
   So how can one of the game's best-drawing teams, one that was
just judged to be the most popular in the country, be banished from
the starting lineup? Is ballot-stuffing, the All-Star game's sweet
science, a lost art? What Chicago precinct boss is tabulating the
vote?
</P>
<P>
   All of that means two things. These 1999 Braves, even as they
flirted with the league's best first half, have overwhelmed no one,
and, as individuals, no one deserved to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   But secondly and more poignantly, as the All-Star team often has
little to do with statistical reality, America is also saying,
enough already. The Atlanta Braves have been calling the tune for
their decade. The fans just punched fast-forward.

 &HT;    Let's make a deal
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With midseason just a couple of weeks away, clubs in need are
posturing for that one precise trade that will make all the
difference in the second half. Or so the thinking goes.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest interest is in Toronto's David Wells, who has drawn
considerable attention from Cincinnati. The Cleveland Indians also
have inquired, but the Reds, who fancy themselves one starter short
of a load, seem most anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the team to win our division or the wild card if we
can add a starting pitcher or two,'' Reds general manager Jim
Bowden said. ``We're really more interested in young pitchers that
we can keep and build with, and Toronto has four or five of them.
I'd think because of the situation they are in, they have to try to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rumblings:
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Louis covets Chicago White Sox right-hander Jamie Navarro
but wants no part of the final season of his $20 million contract,
which expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ex-Braves player Michael Tucker fits Kansas City's need for a
first baseman, but getting him out of Cincinnati might be
impossible. Bowden wants pitching, and the Royals' fragile future
is based on their young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Detroit is scouting Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado, and
the Blue Jays, worried that talks over a long-term deal for their
captain have turned stale, are listening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tampa Bay is pleading for someone to take DH-1B Paul Sorrento.
Please.
</P>
<P>
   Home sweet . . . oops
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen Mariners were given a sneak peak at Seattle's
Safeco Field, the club's new $517 million home starting July 15.
The amenities were exquisite. The gaps were _ less so.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who hit have hit more homers than anyone the past
three seasons, including a major-league record 264 in 1997, found
during a quick batting practice that the ball does not carry as it
does in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult in the gaps,'' designated hitter Edgar
Martinez. ``In left center, it seems you really have to hit it
hard. On my last swing, I really hit it hard, and the ball just hit
the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions are about the same at Safeco _ a foot deeper in
the left power alley at 390, six feet deeper in the right power
alley at 386 _ but the outdoors and the heavy northwest air are
going to make the M's a different team.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Jay Buhner gushed about the luxury suites, the
seating, the hitting background, the retractable roof and then
added, ``I'd be lying if I (said I) didn't want the fence moved in
about 5 feet or so.''

 &HT;    Wrongly convicted, free man rejoins life after 16 years
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAPEVILLE, Ga. _ Two days out of prison, Calvin C. Johnson Jr.
found himself an instant celebrity. The 41-year-old sat on a
threadbare couch in his father's cramped suburban Atlanta
apartment, sparring on the telephone with irascible radio host Neal
Boortz and awaiting a call from Johnnie Cochran's TV talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Boortz tried to goad Johnson into saying something
controversial, but the soft-spoken ex-inmate demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 16 years with con artists and crooks, people trying to
con you out of your locker box. I've dealt with worse than Neal,''
said Johnson, who made international news last week after being
released from a life prison sentence for a 1983 rape he did not
commit.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing, performed on semen stains that were stored away in
evidence files, showed Johnson had been wrongly accused.
</P>
<P>
   The scene Tuesday in Clayton County Superior Court was a
tear-jerker: a black man, sent away for life after trial by a white
prosecutor, white cops and an all-white jury, was now getting the
apology he had dreamed about. He talked frequently about the Lord
and even shook District Attorney Bob Keller's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make mistakes,'' Johnson said, simply.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of court records and interviews with law
enforcement officials show Johnson wasn't arrested merely because
he was a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he became the target of a rape inquiry in 1983 at least
in part because he had pleaded guilty to a burglary charge two
years earlier after police caught him inside a College Park
apartment with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   That same arrest led to charges against him in connection with
sexual crimes in College Park in 1981. In addition to the burglary,
he was accused of rape, attempted rape, aggravated sodomy and armed
robbery. Johnson denies committing those crimes and the charges
were dropped. ``The only thing I ever did was the burglary,''
Johnson said. ``I take responsibility for what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   But police and prosecutors suspected him of more. He understands
that himself. ``You know, police get upset when things don't go
their way,'' he said. ``I kept telling them I'm the wrong man. And
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, handsome, college-educated and from a loving family,
grew up in the Cascade Heights neighborhood, an area where
Atlanta's black power structure was rooted. He played football at
Southwest High School and was well-liked by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southwest area was the creme de la creme of the black
community and the Johnson family fit right in,'' said Eric Wyatt, a
high school friend of Johnson's. ``His arrest was a rude awakening,
the same old things from Jim Crow. It showed us the past isn't
really the past.''
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson graduated from Clark College, now known as Clark
Atlanta University, he found work with Delta Air Lines and drove a
canary-yellow Trans Am. But his father said his son started to
change. ``I told him he was in the wrong crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson himself said he committed the 1981 burglary to get
money. After he pleaded guilty to the burglary and possession of a
concealed weapon, the other charges were dropped. He was sentenced
to 12 years _ eight in prison, four on probation. Johnson
understood eight years was a stiff sentence for burglary. ``I
went,'' he said, ``with the advice of my lawyer. He said, `They're
acting funny. Take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, the county's first
black D.A., was then an assistant D.A. and was the prosecutor who
made the plea bargain in Johnson's case. Howard said the sex
charges against Johnson were dropped because of problems with the
investigation. He declined to elaborate, but said prosecutors
demanded the relatively lengthy sentence ``because we knew, our
feeling was, that he was, in fact, responsible. We tried to embody
that responsibility in the burglary charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson served only 15 months in prison. In December 1982,
Johnson was released because he was a ``non-violent, first-time
incarcerate'' and prisons were overflowing, said Katherine
Browning, spokeswoman for Board of Pardons and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 weeks later, in March 1983, two women were raped in
their College Park apartments. One lived on the Fulton County side
of the city and the other on the Clayton County side. Police
quickly zeroed in on Johnson, recognizing him from his 1981 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   College Park detective Lewis Harper got a search warrant on
March 14, 1983, for Johnson's home. ``This officer is personally
familiar with Calvin Johnson, having arrested Johnson in April 1981
for similar type crimes and that Johnson did enter a plea of guilty
to some of the charges as a result of this arrest,'' Harper wrote
in requesting the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   By then, police had shown both rape victims photo lineups that
included Johnson's picture. One pointed to Johnson's photo as that
of the man who had raped and sodomized her. The other didn't
recognize his photo, but identified him in a live lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we just snatched him off the street,'' Harper,
now College Park's acting police chief, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's case in Clayton County went to trial that November.
Keller contended that Johnson slipped into the 30-year-old woman's
apartment, choked her with a belt as she slept, covered her with a
towel and then raped and sodomized her.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker turned on the light. She said she saw his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw everything,'' she testified. ``I know he was black and
didn't talk like a Southern black. And he didn't talk street jive.
(He) was smooth, smart and soft-spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, under Georgia rules that allow prosecutors in some
circumstances to show jurors evidence of ``similar transactions''
in order to prove a defendant's pattern of conduct, another woman
testified that Johnson had walked into her home while she showered.
A third testified that Johnson had flashed her. Finally, the Fulton
County rape victim testified that Johnson had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the witness stand, the Fulton County woman lunged
at Johnson as she walked by his table, either spitting at him or
throwing a punch at him, depending on the person remembering the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Akil Secret, Johnson's attorney, said the woman's emotional
attack put an exclamation point on an already one-sided contest. He
thought the incident warranted a mistrial. None was granted. Later,
Secret presented testimony from a GBI agent who said the pubic hair
found in the victim's bed did not come from Johnson, but jurors
weren't swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clayton County (in 1983) was a redneck, racist county and had
a reputation as such,'' said Secret, who says the case convinced
him to keep his emotional distance from his clients. ``Everyone at
the prosecution table was white, the victim was white, the
witnesses against him were white. It was the opposite for Calvin.
He was black, I was black and his alibi witnesses were black.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he feared the worst. ``I had a bad feeling; I just
saw it in the jury's eyes,'' he said. ``They looked at me like I
was some kind of monster.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors deliberated a couple of hours before finding Johnson
guilty. Five jurors said this week that race played no part in
their decision. The victims, juror Keith Butts recalls, ``were very
convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two or three girls they paraded in had no doubt in their
mind that Mr. Johnson raped them,'' he said. ``One girl basically
attacked him. There was no doubt in her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts call eyewitness identifications notoriously
unreliable and say interracial identifications are among the most
difficult to make. ``It is the case that people do worse in
identifying people from other races,'' said Irving Biederman, a
professor of cognitive neurology at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles who has researched police line-ups and
eyewitness identifications. The next year, Johnson was brought to
trial in Fulton County on a rape charge involving the woman who had
identified him during the Clayton trial as a rapist. This time, a
racially mixed jury acquitted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson already was doing life.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne State Prison, one of five where he served his time, was
the toughest. Hard manual labor in unceasing heat was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 200 men there, half were lifers,'' recalled
Johnson. ``You'd go out and cut bushes in water up to your knees
with snakes. We'd have a bossman who carried a shotgun and a pistol
and chewed a big wad of tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his family weekly and looked forward to their visits.
They usually came every other month. ``I never felt forgotten,'' he
said. ``My family was always there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His faith deepened. ``I decided to put my life in God's hands,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fiancee, Kaye Loney, stood by him through his 1981
incarceration, the 1983 trial and the start of his life sentence.
She always believed he was innocent. Johnson told her to move on
but she stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But finally, I couldn't hold out any longer,'' she said. ``I
was just so tired. I wanted to have kids and didn't know how long
it would be. I didn't see any light.''
</P>
<P>
   She married in 1987 and has two children, who once visited
Johnson in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A ray of light shone Johnson's way when a family friend told him
about the Innocence Project, a New York-based group founded by two
lawyers best known as members of O.J. Simpson's defense team. The
project, staffed by law students and volunteers, handles cases
where a defendant claims to have been wrongly convicted of rape or
murder and in which DNA tests can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence in the Clayton County case was tested in November.
Johnson was transferred to Clayton County jail this year as
prosecutors decided what they would do. Johnson got a call from
Innocence Project lawyer Peter Neufeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I got some news, they're not going to fight it.
You're going home,' '' said Johnson. ``I started telling all the
guys, But later I sat there wondering, `Is this real? Did I dream
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. But the damage had been done. He had spent 16 years
in prison and friends and family members say the ordeal nearly
destroyed his family.
</P>
<P>
   About a year after his 1983 conviction, Johnson's mother, JoAnn,
suffered a stroke. She has had recurring heart problems since. Once
a prosperous couple living in a fine house, Calvin Sr. and his wife
now live in a cramped, ground-floor apartment. A wheelchair sits
empty in a corner of the living room. JoAnn Johnson has been
hospitalized for the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their family resources, mentally and financially, have been
wrapped up by this case,'' said Charles Jones, Calvin Jr.'s cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Johnson, once a state senator in Ohio, moved to
Atlanta to start a business that never took off. He boards MARTA
each day to visit his wife at Vencour Hospital in Midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As a free man, the younger Johnson has simple goals. ``Once I
get settled, get a job, spend some time with my family, then I'll
consider spending time with a lady. I'd like to have some
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He can seek compensation from the state, but hasn't decided
whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He's never used a personal computer and looks forward to
learning to surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His father thinks of what's to come, when the celebrities stop
calling and the television trucks depart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still up there,'' his father said, motioning toward the
sky. ``I'm waiting to be holding his hand when you're all gone.
He's got to have his period of depression. That'll be the trying
time.''

CONDE NAST MAGAZINES MOVE TO TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the coordination of an invading army, Conde Nast
has begun moving its glossy fashion magazines into a new home at 4
Times Square, the first skyscraper built in New York City since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, workers began trundling 50 truckloads of computers,
printers, files, photographs, fashion accessories and sports gear
for Bride's, House and Garden, and Women's Sports and Fitness from
their old office at 350 Madison Ave. to the 1.6 million-square-foot
tower on Broadway, between 42nd and 43rd streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 employees will sit down Monday in their new modular
offices. And over the next two months, they will be joined by 400
more truckloads of equipment and 1,800 colleagues from Vanity Fair,
Allure, Glamour, Self, GQ, The New Yorker and the other magazines
that make up the Conde Nast empire.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Conde Nast will inhabit floors four through 23 in
the 48-story office tower in a once-seedy district that is now home
to Viacom, Bertelsmann AG and Morgan Stanley. (Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, the largest law firm in the city, is
scheduled to take over the top half of the tower by Thanksgiving.)
For the first time in decades, S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of
Conde Nast Publications, has brought together the 17 sleek and
sometimes fractious magazines that chronicle the culture and the
well-paid and carefully coiffed people of our times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all preparing to live in harmony,'' said James Truman,
the Conde Nast editorial director, ``or at least under the same
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate and construction experts estimate that Conde Nast
spent $100 million on its new space. Investment banks usually set
the gold standard for lavish decor; for example, when Salomon
Brothers moved into 7 World Trade Center in the early '90s,
estimates of its spending ran to $250 a square foot. Newhouse
averaged half that figure, although he pulled out all the stops
when it came to the company's cafeteria, where, executives said,
spending exceeded $400 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse hired the architect Frank Gehry to design a highly
stylized cafeteria, with wavy walls of blue titanium and cloudlike
Venetian glass panels that enclose seating areas. Gehry and the
glassmakers spent a year figuring out how to bend and stretch the
glass in three dimensions. Four private dining rooms and an 85-seat
auditorium adjoin the cafeteria, which will not open until early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since Conde Nast signed a deal for the building nearly three
years ago, Times Square has become one of the most sought-after
commercial neighborhoods in the city. Reuters recently started work
on its new headquarters across from 4 Times Square, and Ernst &AMP;
Young, the accounting firm, is close to a deal to build its own
tower nearby. ABC's ``Good Morning America'' plans to open a
street-front studio in September at 1500 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast will be moving from its old-money environs on the
East Side, within easy reach of Brooks Brothers, Paul Stuart and
Patroon, to the hurly-burly of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vital area that has the kind of energy we associate
with our magazines,'' Newhouse said. ``The ambiance of that
neighborhood suits us just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Douglas Durst, the developer of 4 Times Square, who
persuaded Conde Nast to make the move. In 1996, Durst put together
the land for the project and gambled that if he built the first
office tower since the recession of the early 1990s, it would
quickly fill up.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, the editorial director, said Conde Nast had a choice of
either leaving its longtime home on Madison Avenue for a year while
the space there was renovated, or moving permanently to a new
building. The company chose to bring the magazines, scattered among
six buildings, into the same tower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said he and the design firm of Mancini Duffy briefly
considered the kind of alternative office pioneered by accounting
firms in which each employee is assigned a personal locker, a
portable telephone and a computer on wheels. Instead, they decided
on what Truman described as a democratic approach to space that
would encourage teamwork and provide an element of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The design might better be described as an architectural version
of George Orwell's ``Animal Farm,'' in which some people are more
equal than others. Instead of giving all the window space to
ranking executives, the company has decided to let many employees
labor at metallic blue workstations near the windows.
</P>
<P>
   At the next level up the ladder, most editors and writers who
were not relegated to workstations were consigned to interior
offices with glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 conference rooms, wooden bookcases, Italian plaster
walls, perforated metallic blue office furniture from Italy, and an
open ceiling with exposed pipes that has a neoindustrial look.
Newhouse's office is in the middle of the Conde Nast space, on the
11th floor rather than the 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   But the publisher and editor in chief of each magazine still get
the trappings of rank: a spacious corner, or near-corner, office
with windows.
</P>

   Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair whose current offices
at 350 Madison Ave. are the envy of the company, brought in his own
architect, Basil Walter, to insure that his new space will look
exactly like his old office, which was renovated by the same
designer four years ago. He then insisted on a feng shui ceremony
to improve the spiritual environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors and writers complained about the corporate look of
the decor at 4 Times Square and the glass doors on their offices.
One top editor has refused to even visit 4 Times Square before
moving in. Another expressed trepidation about moving to a building
that has been plagued by construction accidents, including a
scaffolding collapse last summer in which an elderly woman was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   But many employees of the newer magazines embraced the
opportunity to join their colleagues under a single roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Lucy Danziger, editor in chief of
Women's Sports and Fitness, which will be leaving cramped quarters
on Madison. ``There's a gorgeous art department and space for
kayaks, bikes and the other stuff we have.''

JACKIE, KING KONG KELLER AND NOW, THE STATEN ISLAND YANKS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They will play minor league baseball Sunday on Staten
Island, something that may seem new or even quaint for a place like
New York City, the avowed capital of all things big league.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Yankees affiliate that opens its season on
Staten Island Sunday is the first recognized minor league team to
play in the city of New York this century. These Staten Island
Yankees will also become the only minor league team to currently
share its city limits with a Major League Baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But minor league baseball in the metropolitan area is anything
but new and anything but uncelebrated. The Staten Island team
honors a long and rich tradition of minor league baseball in the
urban settings of the region. It's a story not exactly untold, but
perhaps a bit unseen.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that New York's major league history is so big that
it has a way of blotting out quieter accomplishments, especially
those played out beyond the city's core and off its biggest stages.
Ruthian heroics, after all, cast a mighty shadow, like an Empire
State Building of sports landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of the lesser known, though hardly minor,
baseball achievements in the metropolitan area occurred on April
18, 1946, in Jersey City. A small plaque beneath a wooden gazebo
next to what is now a condominium development graces the site on
Newark Bay. The plaque carries a simple, dignified sentence:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, at the former Roosevelt Stadium, Jackie Robinson broke
`organized' baseball's color barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in a minor league game. Robinson took the field with
eight white teammates, playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers'
International League team, the Montreal Royals, on opening day
against the Jersey City Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper accounts of the day estimate the attendance at 50,000,
twice the normal crowd. Robinson hit a three-run home run in his
second at-bat, but later unleashed a display of speed, skill and
basepath guile that would become a trademark of his Brooklyn days,
which began the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson beat out a bunt, stole second base, then bluffed his
way to third base when a confused outfielder threw behind him.
Stalking home plate, Robinson then pestered the Jersey City
pitcher, Phil Oates, into a balk and scored.
</P>
<P>
   If Robinson's appearance in Jersey City was the single most
important minor league game in the metropolitan area, then the
season compiled by the 1937 Newark Bears was the most eventful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, the Yankees' owner, Jacob Ruppert, decided he was going
to build a minor league system for his major league team, and the
franchise in Newark was to be the showpiece of the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears won the International League championship in their
first season under the Yankees' wing. In 1937, the Bears, led by
Charlie ``King Kong'' Keller, finished their season with a 109-49
record, winning the league pennant by 25{ games. They batted .299
as a team.
</P>
<P>
   They swept through the International League playoffs, defeating
along the way Syracuse pitcher Johnny VanderMeer, who was less than
a year away from pitching back-to-back no-hitters in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the Little World Series against the pride of the famed St.
Louis Cardinals' minor league system _ the Columbus Cardinals led
by Enos Slaughter _ the Bears lost the first three games of a
best-of-seven series at Newark's Ruppert Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four games were in Columbus, Ohio. The Bears won
all four.
</P>
<P>
   Every player in Newark's 1937 regular lineup went on to play in
the major leagues, which was unheard in an era of just 16 major
league teams. Included in that group: Joe Gordon, who played second
base alongside Frank Crosetti and Phil Rizzuto; Babe Dahlgren, who
was best known as the man who replaced Lou Gehrig at first base in
1939; pitcher Spud Chandler, who still holds the Yankees' career
record for winning percentage with a 109-43 record; and Keller, who
led the Yankees in home runs four times and played on six World
Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears remained in Newark until 1950, with a host of future
Yankee stars passing through, most notably Yogi Berra. He now has a
minor league stadium named after him in nearby Montclair, one of
the many suburban or small municipalities throughout the country
that have attracted a second generation of minor league teams.
</P>
<P>
   A year before the Bears disbanded, another Newark team, though
hardly a minor league team _ the Newark Eagles of the Negro
National League _ had also dissolved. The Eagles, along with the
New York Black Yankees and other Negro National League franchises,
saw crowds dwindle as the number of young black players signed by
major league teams increased. Jackie Robinson had not only opened
the door, he had held it open.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Newark Bears, the Newark Eagles were a team of
legendary accomplishment. Monte Irvin, later a New York Giants
outfielder, was the shortstop, with Larry Doby, who would be the
first African-American to play in the American League, at second
base. Don Newcombe pitched for the Eagles, as did Leon Day. Willie
Wells, who hit .403 during the 1930 season, also played for the
Eagles, as did third baseman Ray Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, Doby, Day, Wells and Dandridge are in the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if baseball has flourished outside New York's major
league locales for more than a century, and appears to at least be
operating into the next century with the debut of Staten Island's
team, it's really not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to remember how the game got its start.
Choosing a precise date for the first game played in America by the
appropriate rules is a sure way to start an argument, but most of
baseball's scholarly research puts the genesis of the game in the
New York area around 1845-46 (even if Cooperstown is deservedly
baseball's cosmic home).
</P>
<P>
   The teams that played then were the first semipro teams,
ancestors of the major leagues formed in 1876. They congregated in
Manhattan clubs but had little space for games on the already
crowded island. There was ample room in Hoboken and in Brooklyn,
and there was an easy way to get there: by ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how America's first baseball players traveled to the
earliest games.
</P>
<P>
   So think of New York's latest baseball team in that context.
It's just another place New Yorkers can ferry to find their
baseball.

THEY COULD BE DANCING, AND THEY ARE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Sport:Pucci, with no space after colon, cq) 
(rk) 
 By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still sweaty from a day of practice, they gathered in
a semicircle beside Peter Pucci, focusing on him as if his last
name were Lombardi. But instead of blowing a whistle and barking
his final commands, Pucci hugged and kissed the men and women as
they left.
</P>
<P>
   The guess is that Vince Lombardi, the legendary coach of the
Green Bay Packers, never ended practice this way.
</P>
<P>
   The perception is that dance is as different from sport as is
the approach of its coaches. But Pucci, who used sport as a way to
leave the mean streets of Baltimore before being seduced by dance,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he plans to prove it. ``Pucci:Sport,'' the
choreographer's latest show, in which sports and dance collide,
premieres Tuesday at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan (through June
27; tickets cost $30).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very physical relationship in sports and dance,'' said
the 44-year-old Pucci, who, at 6 feet and 180 pounds, looks like a
point guard or a wide receiver. ``People have an inherent, innate
need to move. An instinctual need to move. Some people choose
athletics, others dance, others something else. But when you talk
about dance, the demands in the dance world are as high as in the
athletics world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Lewis, one of the dancers, added: ``It's like when
someone does a double play. They'll tag the bag, do a pirouette in
the air and throw the ball. Look at all that movement. It's total
dance. Those guys are flying in the air, spinning, just like we do
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pucci:Sport'' salutes badminton, basketball, baseball, boxing,
Frisbee, hockey, surfing and tennis. It is a show filled with wit
and cleverness, power and elegance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the hockey segment, one woman plays a puck
and dances with the hockey player who never gets the puck. A love
story. A sports story.
</P>
<P>
   During another part of the show, baseball players dive and slide
across the stage in a reckless physical display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting challenge to market something like this,''
said Noel Hayashi, a marketing consultant for ``Pucci:Sport.'' ``We
very much wanted to highlight the sports, de-emphasize the dance
and introduce this to people in sports and fitness. It's different
from what's thought of as American dance. It has the potential to
be quite popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Pucci spent six months auditioning dancers for the performance.
He needed versatile people who had experience in both dance and
athletics. He even took chances on athletes with limited dance
experience. Among the cast is Tony Gugliett, a former star hockey
player at New York University who is now an assistant coach for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more tiring quicker,'' Gugliett said of dancing. ``I
spend a half an hour here, and I'm as tired as I'll get in a
two-hour hockey practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pucci, who has danced with the Joffrey Ballet and with the
Pilobolus Dance Theater in addition to composing works himself,
knew nothing about the arts while growing up, unless it was about
the art of avoiding conflict, or the art of staying focused amid a
swirl of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   At 8, Pucci began playing football. By high school, he had added
baseball, basketball and track to his athletic resume. He earned a
scholarship to run track at Towson State and was a member of its
all-America mile relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at his girlfriend's urging, Pucci took a dance
improvisation class at the school. He loved it so much that he
changed majors _ from physical education to dance _ three weeks
before he was to get his degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in an umpire class, and we were learning how to say
you're safe and you're out,'' Pucci said. ``At that moment, I
realized that I wanted to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to dance. While he was on the baseball field that day,
Pucci looked up, and could see the Towson State dance department.
The sun glinted off its windows. It was beautiful. It was
intriguing. It was where he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some flak for it at the beginning,'' Pucci said of his
change from athlete to artist 25 years ago. ``It was different
going from an almost all-male environment to all female. But it was
very natural for me to move and make up movement. It's called
choreography. I didn't know that then.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the rehearsal, three ballet dancers who were
practicing at a studio across the hall peaked in on Pucci's
dancers. The hockey performance was being rehearsed. The girls
giggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sport is this?'' one girl whispered as she wiggled her
way into the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey,'' two other girls whispered.

FROM ZEN GARDEN TO PIAZZA, A PLAZA GETS A NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 25-year-old plaza at the foot of the World Trade
Center has reopened after an 18-month renovation to give it what
its designers say is a warmer and more inviting look.
</P>
<P>
   The five-acre Austin J. Tobin Plaza, the largest of its kind in
the world, was long viewed as a civic disappointment, with cracked
marble paving, an assemblage of tree boxes and few places to sit.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new plaza, designed with an Italian piazza in mind,
was remodeled to lure the downtown resident and tourist alike, said
Cherrie Nanninga, director of real estate for the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center. A
celebration featuring a series of entertainers will be held Sunday
to mark the reopening of the plaza, where other performances will
also be held throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The $12 million refurbishment has brought upscale food kiosks
with outdoor tables and chairs, clay-colored benches spiraling out
from the vast central fountain and elegant lighting atop high metal
stanchions.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant is the flooring, said Ms. Nanninga _ 40,000
pieces of North American granite in two tones, a warm brown and
burnt red, replacing the white Italian marble that weathered poorly
in the harsh city climate.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza, open and intended for use 24 hours a day, attracted
an array of curious visitors on Saturday, some of whom work in the
area and had been waiting for it to reopen. A surprising number,
however, found the plaza still lacking, and seemed more pleased
with the weather than the space.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza had originally been designed as a ``contemplative
space'' or ``zen garden,'' where harried businessmen could find
some tranquillity in the midst of a busy workday, World Trade
Center officials said. The result, they said, was a sterile space.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, however, was to inject a sense of vitality into
the 233,000-square-foot plaza, which is actually the roof that
covers a large shopping mall, six subway lines and the PATH trains
to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And consultants for the project said that it was completed in a
hurry, under a 22,500-square-foot air-supported ``tennis bubble''
to allow for winter work. One unfinished project is the globelike
bronze statue in the center of the black marble fountain.
Originally designed to rotate once an hour, it has sat dormant for
a decade. A consultant for the renovation said it would be moving
again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such marvels of urban architecture, New Yorkers and even
some tourists still found the plaza short on espresso and sun
umbrellas and long on empty space.
</P>
<P>
   By the Cosi sandwich bar, Geraldine Noon, a British tourist, sat
in one of the chairs, sipping some Poland Spring water. ``It's
brilliant, it's just lovely, to sit here,'' she said, though she
added that she was desperate for an espresso and there was none to
be had. An Italian piazza with no espresso?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think they can make it a piazza,'' she said.
``Not in New York, with these huge buildings looming.'' She went on
to propose some shade umbrellas and a slight redesign for the Cosi
awning.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Beach, a Merrill Lynch employee who lay sprawled on a bench
with his shirt off, said that he was just glad the plaza had
reopened. As to the renovation, he expressed indifference. ``It's
not much different than before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Benjamin, who works in the World Trade Center, was
pleased with the new granite floor as well as the sandwich shops
and chairs. But as his 3-year-old daughter sat by the fountain,
mesmerized by the play of water, Benjamin laughed about the notion
of an Italian piazza. ``I wouldn't go that far,'' he said. ``To me,
it's still work.''

SCHOOLS CHIEF WORKS OUT DETAILS OF MANAGEMENT OVERHAUL

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew is spending the weekend
making final decisions about the broadest housecleaning in the
history of the New York City school system, and neither school
superintendents nor Board of Education members have yet been
briefed on whose jobs are in jeopardy, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kovaly, the head of the city's superintendents'
association, said that he and his group's members were eager for
more specifics about who might be fired and why, while insisting
that students' poor test scores alone should not be grounds for
dismissal, particularly since new standardized tests were
introduced this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make conclusions on this test as to whether somebody went
up or went down, I don't think you can do that,'' Kovaly,
superintendent of District 11 in the Bronx, said Saturday. ``That's
like comparing how long it took me to run around the block this
year to how long it took you to run around the block last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovaly said that the right of superintendents to appeal their
ouster depends on when they signed their contract, but that ``if
someone chooses to challenge it, the association would likely
support them.'' But, he added, ``At this point, I haven't heard
names, I haven't heard what the reasons are, so it's purely
academic.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said last week that more than five superintendents of local
districts will be ousted or urged to retire, and his spokeswoman
said Saturday that several dismissals will be part of a larger
restructuring likely to involve the creation of some new
administrative posts.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a more detailed announcement by Wednesday, members
of the Board of Education said the shake-up was the inevitable
other shoe dropping after state legislation expanded the
chancellor's authority over personnel matters in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think it is larger than you've seen before?'' asked
William Thompson, president of the Board of Education.
``Absolutely. No one has ever had the authority to do it before.
All of us believe that this needs to be a very performance-driven
system. You try to reward people for good jobs. At the same time,
there are people who are not doing good jobs. There have to be
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the new governance law expanding the chancellor's
authority went into effect, eight of the city's 32 districts have
had changes at the top based on performance, said Chiara Coletti,
Crew's director of public affairs. In two of those cases, the
chancellor and the superintendent came to a ``mutual agreement''
for early retirement; in others, Crew fired superintendents or
refused to continue their tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impending dismissals are significant because they
will be the broadest one-time change, and come at a critical time
for the city schools, as Crew faces pressure from City Hall to
boost performance and demand greater accountability from
administrators for poor test scores.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that he had
not been told which superintendents were on the way out. And
Anthony Coles, the mayor's senior adviser on education, said in
statement: ``The mayor has urged the chancellor to present a plan
for radical reform of the education bureaucracy, including holding
administrators accountable, and we look forward to being briefed on
the chancellor's plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coletti said that between now and Wednesday, when the school
board next meets, Crew would be talking to a variety of people,
including those likely to be fired or reassigned. ``There's a
certain amount of restructuring he wants to do,'' she said. Some
superintendents, she added, ``for a variety of reasons may be more
useful in other roles.''
</P>
<P>
   While she would not specify which superintendents are in danger,
Ms. Coletti said people who have been in their jobs for only a year
are unlikely to be let go, as they have not had time to prove
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   New superintendents are selected through a process in which
community school boards screen candidates, but Crew has the power
to reject their choices. Ms. Coletti said that her boss would seek
candidates both within the system and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would be open to that approach, looking beyond New
York City,'' she said. ``It's happened before, but it hasn't
happened very often.''

 &HT;    Anderson bonus can mark cap long-term
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As talks aimed at extending the contract of Falcons
running back Jamal Anderson continue, it has become obvious that
the biggest hurdle is the signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wants more than the Saints gave draft pick Ricky
Williams and the Indianapolis Colts are expected to give Edgerrin
James. Anderson has $10 million in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are thinking around $6 million, which is what
quarterback Chris Chandler got with his extension last season.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the biggest problem with big signing bonuses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like with any company, it's cash flow,'' Falcons general
manager Harold Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick refresher on the workings of the cap:
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson signed a five-year contract with a $10 million
signing bonus, the NFL would divide the amount of that bonus
equally over the years of the contract. In each of those five
years, $2 million would count against the cap, before Anderson's
annual salaries or bonuses would be added.
</P>
<P>
   That method works well for the team in the first year, because
extensions with large bonuses usually come with minimum first-year
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But once those annual salaries start accelerating, and they
almost always do, the salary cap takes another big hit.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth year of Anderson's contract, he probably would
have a salary of more than $4 million, which, with the $2 million
annual charge for the bonus, would make the total cap charge more
than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   For highly paid players, some teams pay much of the salary in
lump sums each year but call them signing bonuses, in order to
stretch out the effect on the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons already have done it with Chandler by giving him $3
million of his $3.5 million salary and spreading the effect of the
$3 million over the next four seasons. That created $2.25 million
in cap room for this season.
</P>
<P>
   But when a player gets to the last couple of years of his
contract, retires or is cut, teams are on the hook for huge money.
Denver will carry several million dollars in cap charges for John
Elway this season and next, even though he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Big signing bonuses ``start the slide down the slippery slope,''
Richardson said. ``Cap charge jumps at a much greater percentage
than the cap limitation each year, which is why, if you do a bunch,
it's a never-ending deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, though, remains an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big contract, and teams never give up that kind of
money easily,'' he said. ``But it will get done.''
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, when asked if the Falcons would trade a player on
the request of his agent: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting busy
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Jeff Paulk, the team's third-round draft choice, became
the first Falcons draftee to sign a contract, a three-year deal
worth $1.09 million, including a $340,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight draft choices probably will begin signing next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jam
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said one of the questions in training camp will
be whether to keep four tight ends instead of the usual three.
</P>
<P>
   Tght end Rod Monroe, who was activated from the practice squad
last year for the final two games, has improved so much, Reeves
said, that he, O.J. Santiago, rookie Reggie Kelly and Brian
Kozlowski all possibly could make the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean more one-back sets,'' with two tight ends,
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the team kept four running backs and a fullback. When
fullback Bob Christian got hurt and Kozlowski took his place it
hurt the offense.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the team drafted Paulk _ to back up Christian. But if
the Falcons carry two fullbacks, will they reduce by one the number
of running backs?
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith has been slowed by a strained
hamstring, but it is not considered serious.... Reeves will visit
hospitals in Washington, Chicago and Nashville next week to speak
to heart patients.... Passing camp resumes Monday.... The Falcons
will scrimmage the Jaguars on Saturday, Aug. 8, at Furman
University in Greenville, S.C. The scrimmage will be open to the
public.... Third-year quarterback Tony Graziani has switched from
No. 13 to No. 7. He offered his old number to newcomer Danny
Kanell. ``It was for less than $10,'' Graziani said, ``but I can't
disclose what, because the IRS will get involved.''

 &HT;    Linebacker father finds wife's cancer is also a defining moment
for him
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He quickly learned the value of paper plates over another sink
full of dirty dishes. He learned to play Pretty Pretty Princess
with his 5-year-old daughter, Maddie, and, after a few big-glass
spills, discovered Noah, now 3, drank best with his ``sippy cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned that Maddie won't eat the different foods on her
plate if they touch and that when it came to styling her hair, he
had the tonsorial touch of a ... well, a linebacker. As for Noah,
forget combing his hair, he didn't even like it washed. And neither
of the kids thought much of his scrambled eggs or the way he cut up
their apples. He just didn't do it like Mom.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was privy to the proud recountings of a daughter
learning to tumble in her gymnastics class and he marveled at each
new word mouthed by a son still learning to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, there was the loving realization that his
31-year-old wife, Stefanie _ the girl he first got up the courage
to telephone for a date when he was 17 and she 15 _ had ``more
strength, more courage, more character'' than anyone he has known.
</P>
<P>
   All these lessons have come to Chris Spielman in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why today _ at a time when so many pro athletes show
themselves to be amateur parents _ the Cleveland Browns linebacker
gives us a Father's Day tale full of the same passion and intensity
that got him pictured on the Wheaties box as a high school player
in Massillon, Ohio, won All-America honors and the Lombardi Award
for him at Ohio State and four times has made him a Pro Bowl
defender in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Spielman _ who at age 5 broke his
grandmother's nose with a hard tackle _ made his name as one of the
fiercest competitors in pro football. Now, he's also shown himself
to be one of the finest dads.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of how Mr. Macho became Mr. Mom.
</P>
<P>
   It began last July, just as the 6-foot, 250-pound Spielman was
finishing nine months of rigorous rehab and preparing to return to
the Buffalo Bills after breaking his neck in an NFL game in late
October 1997. At the same time, Stefanie was three months pregnant
with their third child.
</P>
<P>
   During her pregnancy, Stefanie noticed a lump on her right
breast, though she dismissed it as a cyst. But after a miscarriage,
she mentioned the growth to a doctor. A biopsy determined the lump
was a non-spreading form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   During surgery to rid the mass, another pea-sized malignant
tumor was discovered. Stefanie's right breast was removed, as were
21 lymph nodes on her right side. After that came six months of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night _ after a day of individual workouts at the
Browns training camp in Berea _ Spielman recalled first trying to
cope with the cancer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we were driving to the doctor's office to set up
some surgery and I said, `Man, I can't believe all this. I break my
freakin' neck and now you got cancer. What a raw deal.' That's when
my wife looked at me and said, `How can you talk like that? Look at
all the blessings in our life! Don't you ever say that again!' I
felt very small, very selfish. She made me realize what a weak
person I was. I saw her strength and I was in awe. Right then, her
words changed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing what was most important in life, he decided last July
24 to sit out the NFL season so he could care for his wife and
their two small children.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanie was stunned and tearfully tried to convince him to
change his mind: ``He had trained so hard to get back to football I
didn't want to be the one who stopped his comeback. I knew just how
much football means to Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand what she's talking about, consider:
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Spielman trudged around football-frenzied Massillon in
the summer wearing combat boots and carrying old tires slung over
his shoulders to get in shape. When he married Stefanie, he showed
up for their honeymoon cruise with his weight-lifting gear. To prep
for the summer heat at preseason NFL camps, he's been known to
drive around in his truck with the windows up and the heater on. As
for Buffalo's brutal winters, he supposedly prepared by sleeping in
in the nude in front of an air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he played an entire game for Detroit with a torn right
pectoral muscle. He finished that fateful October 1997 game for
Buffalo _ making a game-high 13 tackles _ even though he was
experiencing numbness in his legs and later was found to have
damaged two vertebra in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   As for Grandma's broken beak, she had opened her arms to give
him a hug, but he thought she was getting ready to tackle him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while he'd spent a lifetime molding himself into an
unparalleled football player, he soon realized what he did away
from the game was most important:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always preached about being a husband and father first and
this was my defining moment. For 10 years, Stef had supported me _
without condition. It had all been about me and now I had to hold
up my end. I had to take my wedding vows literally. If I would have
played last year, I'd have been a fraud, a phoney. I wouldn't have
been a man. I had to be there to hold her hand when she was sick to
her stomach. I had to take her to her chemo, to care for her and
care for our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielman tackled Stefanie's cancer with the same intensity he
uses in football. ``It's the only approach I know,'' he said.
``When there's adversity, you've got two choices_ fight or fold.
Just like in football, you learn everything about the enemy. You
learn the weaknesses and exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   He set up a vitamin regimen for Stefanie, laying out 36 pills a
day. Discovering sugar and carbohydrates can feed cancer cells, he
rid the house of sweets. He administered the painful Neupogen shots
to bolster his wife's immunity and, when needed, he gave the pep
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'd get down,'' Stefanie said, ``Chris would say, `It's
been proven that positive thinking can boost your immune system. So
no negatives.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spielman was at his best with the kids. ``We were pretty
up-front with them,'' he said. ``We explained Mommy had a boo-boo
inside her that had to be cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the chemotherapy took its toll, Stefanie decided to have her
head shaved during a backyard picnic. That afternoon, Chris had his
head shaved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to seem normal to the kids that a parent had a
shaved head,'' he said. ``And I figured since I'm recognizable in
the area, if I showed up at 250 pounds with a shaved head, I'd draw
the attention away from my wife when we were out. But it was just
the reverse because Stef took a proactive approach and didn't try
to hide anything. She wanted women to know its OK to be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stefanie decided to wear a hat, she and Chris had a hat
party with the kids. As Dad played CDs, Mom and the two children
danced and tried on every hat they could find in the house. ``From
something awkward, we wanted to find a little fun,'' she said.
``It's all about finding the good in a situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielman said that while the next several months were tough _
and in private he often prayed his wife would not die _ he learned
some valuable lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned things a lot of fathers don't get to learn about
their families,'' he said. ``Before I just followed orders like
most husbands. For the kids, I was just there to play. But I
learned being a stay-at-home mom is the most important, the
toughest job on earth. With kids you can never be tired. You get no
breaks. I had no time to sit down and watch the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefanie's last chemo was in January, and two months ago she was
told she was ``cancer-free.'' She and Chris now give talks about
coping with breast cancer and they have started the Stefanie
Spielman Breast Cancer Research Fund (James Cancer Hospital, Office
of Development, 300 W. 10th Ave., Suite 519, Columbus, Ohio, 43210,
telephone (614) 293-3744). Spielman said all the money _ they've
raised $350,000 and hope to reach $1 million in a year _ is going
``purely for breast cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   While this ordeal has driven him to help others, Spielman said
it's also helped him. In February, he was traded by Buffalo to
Cleveland and these days, as he drives from the family home in
Columbus to the Browns training camp, he can't help but notice the
changes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a different attitude. The grass seems greener this
year, the flowers seem brighter and everything seems to have more
sunshine on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he couldn't wait to leave the Browns' camp for
Fathers Day: ``We're not doing anything extravagant. It's just that
I feel like I truly have my family back again. So we'll go to
church in the morning and then come home and have something to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time, by everyone's vote, Stefanie will be back cooking
the eggs.

 &HT;    Ravens poor, losing talent
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desperate to upgrade the wideout spot, Baltimore coach Brian
Billick once dreamed of getting ``franchise'' free agents Carl
Pickens of Cincinnati or Terrell Owens of San Francisco, or trading
for Minnesota's Jake Reed. Instead the Ravens signed Webster
Slaughter, who has eight catches the last two seasons, Cowboys
reject Billy Davis and Qadry Ismail, who hasn't had a reception
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster moves signaled that Art Modell again is the NFL's
most cash-strapped owner. A day after the Davis signing, that
circumstantial evidence was bolstered when Modell conceded he is
looking for a minority partner.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumblings that Modell is $190 million in debt and
asked league owners to forgive the $20 million relocation fee he
agreed to pay when he bolted from Cleveland. Word is Modell missed
one of his loan payments to Fleet Bank and had to hustle off to
Boston to make things right with his principal creditor. Modell
long has been one of the NFL's most accessible owners.
Unfortunately, he also has been the least fiscally responsible.
Even the Baltimore media, which chose to ignore Modell's financial
woes for a long time, concluded last week that the problems are
real.
</P>
<P>
   Despite denials by Modell, player agents around the league
insist that Ravens personnel director Ozzie Newsome lacked the
ready cash to sign high-profile vets. The Ravens lost guard Wally
Williams, offensive tackle Orlando Brown, defensive tackle James
Jones and tight end Eric Green in free-agency and swapped
quarterback Jim Harbaugh to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have either signed or re-signed 14 unrestricted free
agents. But most of the signings _ running backs Steve Broussard
and Errict Rhett, tight ends Greg DeLong, Frank Wainwright and
Aaron Pierce, fullback Charles Evans, defensive end Fernando Smith
and safety James Trapp _ are not the kind to excite the fans.
</P>
<P>
   And it's clear that the franchise is operating on the cheap.
Eight of the 14 players signed contracts that included no signing
bonus. Only Evans and offensive tackle Harry Swayne got upfront
cash of more than $250,000. Swayne accounted for $5 million of the
$6.5 million that the Ravens spent on signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Billick may be a great offensive mind, but with few standouts,
and the tandem of Scott Mitchell and Tony Banks at quarterback, he
had better be a miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   The team managed to extend the contracts of two young stars,
linebacker Ray Lewis and wide receiver Jermaine Lewis, in 1998. But
in the long run, Modell probably won't be able to keep such
All-Pro-caliber performers as offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden and
defensive end Michael McCrary from exiting.
</P>
<P>
   Feuding
</P>
<P>
   It won't help the Ravens that new Washington owner Daniel Snyder
last week pirated away David Cope, who markets Baltimore's sale of
luxury suites, club seats and sponsorships. Modell has filed a
grievance, and league vice president Joe Browne said it will be
considered. But Cope was a noncontract employee. Modell, who said
there was, ``a sense of morality lacking'' in the hiring, might
have problems winning this battle with with new neighbor Snyder.
One Baltimore insider likened the loss of Cope to having a scout
switch teams on the eve of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Means to an end
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi is discussing an
extension that would pay defensive end Michael Strahan $8 million a
year. It's good news for Falcons end Chuck Smith and bad news for
general manager Harold Richardson. If agent Tony Agnone lands that
deal for Strahan, the price for free-agent ends will escalate
leaguewide. Smith and fellow starter Lester Archambeau can become
unrestricted free agents in the spring. In an otherwise weak
free-agent market, there could be quality ends such as McCrary,
Robert Porcher (Lions), Tony Brackens (Jaguars), Simeon Rice
(Cardinals), Phillip Daniels (Seahawks), and Regan Upshaw
(Buccaneers).
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   He lacks size, but Atlanta rookie wide receiver Rondel Menendez
isn't short on ego. A No. 7 pick and the 247th overall player in
this year's draft, Menendez last week fired Richard Katz, claiming
that the agent wasn't paying enough attention to him. Of course, it
might have been that $13,000 signing bonus the Falcons offered that
kept Katz from completing a deal. Maybe new agent Frank Myles will
heed Menendez's needs better.... Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin
will serve as his own offensive coordinator in '99. But with two
former Jags coordinators, Steelers offensive coordinator Kevin
Gilbride and Browns head coach Chris Palmer, in the same division,
Coughlin has changed all the terminology in his playbook.... The
new six-year contract Philadelphia tailback Duce Staley signed
recently has been rejected by the league. Agent Brantley Evans and
Eagles vice president Joe Banner are shuffling the numbers to make
them comply with NFL guidelines.... With ABC televising Super Bowl
XXXIII, look for Disney execs to lobby Jim Steeg, league vice
president for special events, for major input into the halftime
show at the Georgia Dome.... Lions coach Bobby Ross is wasting
little time getting his pair of first-round picks into the lineup.
Chris Claiborne already is starting at weakside linebacker and
Aaron Gibson at offensive right tackle.... In the preseason
ratings, the National scouting combine lists the top quarterback
prospects in this order: Chris Redmon (Louisville), Chad Pennington
(Marshall), Tee Martin (Tennessee).... The days are numbered for
linebacker James Francis in Cincinnati. For the third year in a
row, he failed to get in enough offseason workouts to collect a
$250,000 bonus, and he's lost his starting job to Steve Foley....
The Jets are trying to extend the contract of standout linebacker
and former Georgia star Mo Lewis.... Rams offensive tackle Orlando
Pace has been a frequent no-show in the offseason and blew off a
workout bonus of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina finer
</P>
<P>
   Credit Carolina coach George Seifert and director of personnel
Jack Bushofsky for making the most out of very little in this
year's draft. The 1998 signing of defensive tackle Sean Gilbert,
and this spring's trade for quarterback Jeff Lewis and signing of
restricted wide receiver Patrick Jeffers, left the Panthers without
first-, third- and fifth-round choices. Instead of making excuses,
the club made solid selections with its five picks. Former Georgia
standout Chris Terry (No. 2a) could win the starting job at
offensive left tackle. Mike Rucker (No. 2b) of Nebraska might get
significant playing as a pass-rusher. Tony Booth (No. 7), a former
James Madison safety being used at cornerback, looks like one of
the steals of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Learning curve
</P>
<P>
   One reason Cleveland selected Tim Couch over Akili Smith was
that the Kentucky star had a one-month advantage reporting to camp.
Although he still trails Ty Detmer for the starting job, Couch has
benefitted from being with the club since May 16. Because Oregon
commencement exercises weren't until last Sunday, Smith couldn't
report to the Bengals until the next day. Cincy coordinator Ken
Anderson sent out daily Federal Express shipments to Smith with
video of every practice, but the rookie still looked lost in last
week's workouts and likely won't challenge starter Jeff Blake for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia freedom
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles might be no better in the first full
year together for director of operations Tom Modrak and coach Andy
Reid, but they will be different. Since the end of 1998, the team
has released, traded or decided not to re-sign eight former
starters: offensive guard Ian Beckles, offensive tackle Richard
Cooper, wide receiver Irving Fryar, running back Charlie Garner,
wide receiver Jeff Graham, quarterback Rodney Peete, linebacker
James Willis and strong safety Michael Zordich.

 &HT;    Emerging Kosovars enjoying the little freedoms
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FERIZAJ, Yugoslavia _ For several days now, Fatmir Demiri has
walked into the center of town and stood near a small outdoor
market selling peppers, lettuce and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   He comes, he says, for ``the joy of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go home,'' says Demiri, a 38-year-old grocery
wholesaler. ``I am enjoying this freedom very much.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a joy that, perhaps, only someone who has survived a
brutal war _ who has hidden in a cellar for many days and who has
seen his home firebombed, as Demiri has _ can share.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not so devastated, Demiri's town could pass for one
of those county seats in the American South with red brick
buildings around a square.
</P>
<P>
   But this town is in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, who until recently controlled the government and
police, called the place Urosevac. The ethnic Albanians like
Demiri, who have long made up the vast majority of its people, call
it Ferizaj.
</P>
<P>
   Ferizaj will likely be its name in the future because only a few
Serbs, too old to leave, are still here. But those who departed
left a legacy of the hatred that spilled over between the Serb and
Albanian communities. A half block from where Demiri stands, a row
of a dozen shops were burned and bulldozed. Storefronts have been
smashed. Windows are broken in most buildings. Some entire blocks
have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb police and paramilitaries who, townspeople say, caused
all the damage, are gone. But NATO tanks manned by machinegunners,
survey the scene from street corners and uniformed Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas lounge in many doorways.
</P>
<P>
   The town is about 35 miles from Macedonia's capital of Skopje,
over green mountains covered with rocks and scrub. But to get here
from Macedonia is an ordeal that can take hours on roads jammed
with NATO convoys and masses of refugees either returning home or
leaving Kosovo to bring back loved ones who have fled.
</P>
<P>
   One of those convoys traveling Saturday was a team of CARE
International workers, part of the huge humanitarian contingent
pouring into Kosovo. Ferizaj, or Urosevac, and the surrounding
villages will be one of the principle areas in Kosovo where CARE
will operate, and it will have its work cut out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Homes will have to be made livable in time for the cold winters
in this region, and food is the most pressing need, townspeople
say. Prices are quadruple their rates before the Balkans conflict,
and 50 people were standing in line for bread at one store
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have flour for baking bread. We don't have oil for
cooking,'' says Esad Sabani, 63. ``Yes, there are plenty of hungry
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Isak Mehmeti, 62, a farmer from the village of Kastanievo, which
he says is ``four hours away by foot,'' says farmers' tools barns
and houses were destroyed by the Serbs and nothing has been
planted. ``No, we can do nothing this season,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, he is also fearful of landmines.
</P>
<P>
   Bob MacPherson, of Atlanta-based CARE U.S.A., is part of the
team that went into Kosovo from Macedonia on Saturday, and he will
be looking carefully at the mine problem. Marge Tsitouris, another
Atlanta-based CARE staffer, who is serving as CARE International's
interim Balkans coordinator, said others on the team, led by Marcus
Oxley of CARE Australia, will focus on the area's food and shelter
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for your help,'' Mehmeti said. ``If the world
is not helping us, we cannot survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Demiri, who has been listening, nods in agreement, then puts his
hand on his friend's shoulder and adds: ``But the freedom is the
main thing. It doesn't matter if we don't eat for three days.''

police, called the place Urosevac. The ethnic Albanians like
Demiri, who have long made up the vast majority of its people, call
it Ferizaj.
</P>
<P>
   Ferizaj will likely be its name in the future because only a few
Serbs, too old to leave, are still here. But those who departed
left a legacy of the hatred that spilled over between the Serb and
Albanian communities. A half block from where Demiri stands, a row
of a dozen shops were burned and bulldozed. Storefronts have been
smashed. Windows are broken in most buildings. Some entire blocks
have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb police and paramilitaries who, townspeople say, caused
all the damage, are gone. But NATO tanks manned by machinegunners,
survey the scene from street corners and uniformed Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas lounge in many doorways.
</P>
<P>
   The town is about 35 miles from Macedonia's capital of Skopje,
over green mountains covered with rocks and scrub. But to get here
from Macedonia is an ordeal that can take hours on roads jammed
with NATO convoys and masses of refugees either returning home or
leaving Kosovo to bring back loved ones who have fled.
</P>
<P>
   One of those convoys traveling Saturday was a team of CARE
International workers, part of the huge humanitarian contingent
pouring into Kosovo. Ferizaj, or Urosevac, and the surrounding
villages will be one of the principle areas in Kosovo where CARE
will operate, and it will have its work cut out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Homes will have to be made livable in time for the cold winters
in this region, and food is the most pressing need, townspeople
say. Prices are quadruple their rates before the Balkans conflict,
and 50 people were standing in line for bread at one store
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have flour for baking bread. We don't have oil for
cooking,'' says Esad Sabani, 63. ``Yes, there are plenty of hungry
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Isak Mehmeti, 62, a farmer from the village of Kastanievo, which
he says is ``four hours away by foot,'' says farmers' tools barns
and houses were destroyed by the Serbs and nothing has been
planted. ``No, we can do nothing this season,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, he is also fearful of landmines.
</P>
<P>
   Bob MacPherson, of Atlanta-based CARE U.S.A., is part of the
team that went into Kosovo from Macedonia on Saturday, and he will
be looking carefully at the mine problem. Marge Tsitouris, another
Atlanta-based CARE staffer, who is serving as CARE International's
interim Balkans coordinator, said others on the team, led by Marcus
Oxley of CARE Australia, will focus on the area's food and shelter
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for your help,'' Mehmeti said. ``If the world
is not helping us, we cannot survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Demiri, who has been listening, nods in agreement, then puts his
hand on his friend's shoulder and adds: ``But the freedom is the
main thing. It doesn't matter if we don't eat for three days.''

   BUSH-PROFILE _ AUSTIN _ Many Americans seem to like Texas
governor George Walker Bush very much and believe that the first
election of the 21st century is his to lose. However, they don't
seem to know him very well. After all, he has strenuously spent at
least the last year not running for president. Last weekend,
though, during a trip to Iowa and New Hampshire he finally declared
he's in the race. And now the nation will start getting to know who
this son of a former president really is. (Beach Austin

   KOSOVO-DIARY _PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ One week ago, Florie
Topanica began the jarring emotional passage that more than one
million Kosovar Albanians will make in coming weeks, returning to
uncertainty, sadness and a hard new beginning that will be too
daunting for some even to attempt. Flora, as she is called, is my
translator and now my friend, a brave young woman of 25 who came
with me to Kosovo on the first day NATO troops got the border open
from Macedonia. Not knowing what awaited beyond that border, Flora
ate her fear of the menace she left behind in Pristina when her
family stepped on a train April 3 and became refugees. This is her
story. (Kunstel, Cox News Service) MOVED. WITH PHOTOS.

   KOSOVO-DATELINE _ FERIZAJ, Yugoslavia _ For several days now,
Fatmir Demiri has walked into the center of town and stood near a
small outdoor market selling peppers, lettuce and tomatoes. He
comes, he says, for ``the joy of it.'' It is a joy that, perhaps,
only someone who has survived a brutal war _ who has hidden in a
cellar for many days and who has seen his home firebombed, as
Demiri has _ can share. (Graham, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   RUSSIA-BALKANS _ MOSCOW _ For Russia, winning isn't everything.
These days, with its economy in shambles and its president ailing,
winning isn't even possible. But being in the game is. Moscow's
diplomatic vexing of the United States and its Western allies
seldom prevails, but it cannot be ignored. Rushing troops into
Kosovo ahead of NATO's peacekeepers is the most recent and intense
example of an approach which, by design or default, has given
Moscow a prominent role in determining the future of the Balkans
province. It is an important achievement in Russia, where
nationalists are suspicious of NATO's expansion and distrustful of
America's intentions in a region once under the thumb of the Soviet
Union. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS _ SAN CRISTOBAL de las CASAS, Chiapas, Mexico _
Murder, rape, subjugation and emancipation _ this is the tough
stuff that infuses the drama of Mayan Women's Strength, an unusual
theater and social-service group in the southern Mexican city of
San Cristobal de las Casas. These are also the themes that sum up
the personal experiences of the two Mayan Indian women who founded
the group as a refuge for themselves and other women. As children,
both of these women were forced to become domestic servants and
they had to struggle long and hard to learn to read and write.
Today they write plays that reflect some of their experiences,
including the subjugation of women by men in their own Indian
communities. They also run a home that offers childcare and where
Indian women who have left or been expelled from their communities
can become literate, learn sewing and other skills. All become
involved in plays that are regularly performed in Indian villages
here. The group has also performed in the United States and
Australia. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   ANTIGUA-STANFORD _ ST. JOHN'S, Antigua _ This tiny island has
become a big battlefield in America's war to reshape the regulation
of offshore banks, which Washington says hides dirty money for
criminals and drug dealers. Caught in the middle is a wealthy
Houston businessman named Allen Stanford. Stanford has taken this
island by storm in recent years, opening up the nation's largest
offshore bank, as well as a daily newspaper and a development
company. He also has plans to build a hospital, a shopping mall,
and an airport. U.S. officials want to know why Stanford has such a
keen interest in this island of 64,000 people. In April, the U.S.
Treasury Department issued an advisory to U.S. banks, only the
second one in history, urging them to scrutinize all transactions
with Antigua. The advisory resulted, in part, because of U.S.
concern that Stanford was named to sit on a new board to supervise
the offshore sector, which seems a conflict of interest. Now
Stanford says he is helping Antigua to clean up i ts image. U.S.
officials aren't so sure. (Emling, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   TRICARE _ WASHINGTON _ In a year when concern for military
personnel has been trumpeted on Capitol Hill, defense spending
bills approved by the House and Senate reinforce a Pentagon policy
that lets military health care contractors refuse to pay for
skilled medical care for severely disabled spouses and children who
are cared for at home. Although two courts have disputed the
policy, the Pentagon says ``custodial care,'' which its Tricare
health benefits program doesn't cover, includes care by specially
trained nurses. That is driving some families to Medicaid to pay
the exhorbitant cost of providing essential care.

   FLA-ALA-CONNECTOR _ Two groups are organizing with competing
proposals to build a connecting highway from Florida's beaches to
Interstate 65 in Alabama. Both groups say the four-lane road is
critical for hurricane evacuation, and point to 1995's Hurricane
Opal, which saw massive gridlock on all escape routes with some
motorists still stuck in traffic when the storm hit. Transportation
officials haven't given either route the OK, and officials in the
competing counties even say they hope both are built because both
are needed. Meanwhile, a new private bridge and a proposed toll
road are being pushed in neighboring coastal Alabama for the same
reasons. We examine the routes and their potential impact.

   FREE-MAN _ ATLANTA _ Calvin Johnson went from being a well-liked

to the prime suspect in a series of rapes in and around an Atlanta
suburb. He was arrested in 1981, plea bargained his way out of
sexual assault charges and served 15 months in prison for burglary.
A few months after he was released, police started looking at him
in a series of rapes. He was arrested again, acquitted of one
attack and convicted of one. Now DNA evidence shows he didn't
commit that rape and he has been freed after 16 years in prison.
This week, he was an instant celebrity. (Torpy/Boston/McDonald,

   SQUIRREL-SICKNESS _ A weird strain of squirrel disease that has

<HEADLINE>
A LOFT LAW'S PURSUIT OF LOFTY GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old loft space _ not even all that extensive at
1,800 square feet _ is now worth a lot more than it was back in
'78; and, amid all his video equipment, Mike is wondering whether
there is a sizable chunk of profit to be made by selling now.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't live there any more; it's just his studio now _
really! Not like in the old days when the landlord looked the other
way while the couch was carried in and the freight elevator was an
adventure; when Asian women still bent over their sewing machines
next door and the streets downtown were plastered with those
``SoHo's Being Co-opted'' stickers. And certainly way before all
those chic boutiques dotted the block.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is a fictitious character, and his loft _ with its internal
Doric columns, sprinkler pipes, ersatz walls and raw-lumber loft
bed _ is, in reality, a walk-through exhibit currently at the New
Museum of Contemporary Art on Broadway, just south of Houston
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But while the exhibit is a product of the imaginings of two
installation artists, Joshua White and Michael Smith (down to the
created leak stain on the kitchen ceiling), it is certainly art
imitating life. And it is symbolic of the ongoing and, for some,
wrenching evolution of the loft market.
</P>
<P>
   It is an evolution that has seen some artists, like Kathy Arlt,
who lives in a former caviar warehouse on Greenwich Street in
TriBeCa, metamorphose from tenants to owners by way of arduous
financial and legal combat. And one in which many landlords, like
Diana Agostini of Greene Street in SoHo _ in the face of old,
demanding industrial buildings and reluctant lending institutions _
are joined in constant struggles to make the numbers add up.
</P>
<P>
   It was 17 years ago that the Loft Law _ more precisely Article
7c of the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law _ first legalized
what had been the clandestine tenancy of artists already occupying
commercial spaces downtown, while also mandating that landlords
bring their buildings into housing-code compliance.
</P>
<P>
   And with a five-year renewal of the Loft Law, which is to expire
at the end of the month, up for a vote in Albany (the Assembly has
already passed its version), partisans in the continuing
contentiousness between landlords and tenants are assessing the
effectiveness of legislation that, though directly affecting only a
sliver of the market, served as a wedge for the creation of a whole
new source of housing in a city long plagued by limited supply.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment is relevant, however, not just for the 835
buildings registered under the Loft Law _ 460 of which have, so
far, achieved code compliance or are in the process of doing so _
but for an estimated 2,600 other loft buildings scattered about the
city.
</P>
<P>
   For in recent years, artists, artisans and others priced out of
the increasingly gentrified co-op and condominium loft market
downtown have been illegally slipping into spaces in long-fallow
manufacturing areas in the Greenpoint and Williamsburg sections of
Brooklyn, in the South Bronx and in the Long Island City section of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   And some tenant advocates, generally satisfied with a law that
has assured them legitimate occupancy and protection under rent
stabilization, argue that it should be extended to those
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law has worked insofar as protecting the tenancy of these
tenants,'' said William Hall, co-chairman of Lower Manhattan Loft
Tenants, a 700-member group. But there remains, Hall contends, a
core of landlords resistant to bringing buildings into compliance,
``and enforcement continues to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Loft Board, established in accordance with the
Loft Law, is charged with enforcing the statute's provisions and
deadlines, with writing the rules that govern the relationship
between landlords and tenants and with resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck DeLaney is the tenant representative on the nine-member
Loft Board. ``Everyone acknowledges that doing code-compliance work
in loft buildings with the tenants in place is a complicated and
delicate process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeLaney said: ``There are now several thousand legal,
code-compliant housing units in the city thanks to the Loft Law,
and many more in the pipeline. To me, that's a success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he said, ``is the real stubborn owner who
doesn't care about coming up to code, doesn't register and just
ignores the fines.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, ``illegal conversion has occurred in Brooklyn,
and a bit in Queens,'' DeLaney said. ``The city should enforce
against new illegal conversion, because if it turns its back, we're
going to see the same problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the glass-half-full, glass-half-empty debate, however,
landlord representatives describe the law as ineffective, pointing
out that, after 17 years, 375 of the 835 registered buildings
remain out of compliance. The law is unfair, they argue, because it
fines them for failing to comply, but offers them little help in
finding financing to undertake the extensive renovations it
requires.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Catch-22, they say, that a building owner who cannot
obtain a loan for renovations because the banks are wary of a low
rent base is then punished by a law that allows tenants to stop
paying rents altogether because the renovations haven't been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loft Law has sentenced owners to perpetual illegality and
made them owners of unsafe buildings,'' said Thomas Berger,
president of the Association of Commercial Property Owners, a
400-member loft-landlord group. ``They cannot get financing because
the banks see no sufficient rental to cover the mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   The landlord representative on the Loft Board, John Lansden,
said the law ``should have taken into account that, for the most
part, these are small buildings where there is not a lot of income,
even after legalization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not professional landlords,'' Lansden said. ``Many
have businesses in the building and bought the property to ensure
the survivability of the business. And as a matter of financing the
legalization, they're just not equipped to do it. That's the nuts
and bolts of it. What we have is a highly technical, confusing
series of regulations that are more penalty than incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hall of the tenants group countered that the Loft Board has
a ``very liberal'' extension procedure. ``Any owner who can
demonstrate having made a good-faith effort to comply receives an
extension,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant leaders assert that the owners would simply rather see
their tenants leave, so they can go to market-rate rents or the
buildings can be converted to co-ops or condominiums _ even though,
in a blurring of the demarcation lines, some original loft tenants
have themselves banded together to partake of the conversion
possibilities. ``I would say that to whatever extent the
neighborhood has not become Disneyfied,'' Hall said, ``it's because
we are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the survivability not only of the loft pioneers, but
of succeeding generations of artists who, in the estimation of Dr.
Elliot Sclar of the Columbia University Graduate School of
Architecture, Planning and Preservation, are vital to the city's
continuing economic growth.

 &HT;    SUMMIT TO TACKLE ANGRY YELTSIN
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany President Clinton joined the leaders of six
other major industrial powers in planning a high-stakes
fence-mending session on Sunday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in the wake of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   With the conflict shifting from peacekeeping operations after
the 78-day bombing campaign, the White House announced Clinton
would visit Macedonia and Italy Tuesday to meet with U.S. troops
and visit a refugee camp. The trip follows a weekend of summitry in
this 2,000-year-old city on the banks of the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the president hopes to turn the page after months
of troublesome dealings with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a kind of elephant in the room, which is hard
to ignore,'' Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger,
told reporters here Saturday, referring to NATO's air war against
Serbia, a nation with whom the Russians have long been aligned.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the elephant gone,'' he said, ``it's possible to now deal
with a series of issues that are extraordinarily important.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's talks among the so-called Group of Eight, or G-8, were
to focus on ways the group could help Russia reduce its crippling
Soviet-era debt, safeguard its massive nuclear arsenal and prop up
its staggering economy all in an atmosphere of growing political
uncertainty in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is also certain to highlight remaining differences
between Russia and its G-8 partners over the Balkans, however, and
the difficulty Yeltsin faces in pressing forward with painful
economic reforms back home.
</P>
<P>
   The partners were forced to table - for the second day in a row
- a planned statement on Balkan reconstruction because Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin balked at language that would rule
out rebuilding assistance for territory controlled by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Even as White House aides stressed the need to restore
U.S.-Russian relations, Yeltsin was described as spoiling for a
tiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in a fighting mood,'' Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry
Yakushkin told reporters in Moscow. ``A major aim by Russia is to
secure its place in the world arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War ended a decade ago, but the Kosovo campaign sent a
decidedly frosty breeze blasting through U.S.-Russian relations,
already chilled by two years of contention over economic and
security matters.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO campaign highlighted Russia's waning global influence.
Moscow bitterly opposed the air strikes but was unable, despite
months of trying, to prevent them or to pursuade Milosevic to
accept a compromise that would have averted the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   After the air war began, Yeltsin pulled Russia out of its
partnership arrangement with NATO, a move Clinton wants Yeltsin to
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin told the German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview the
NATO action had threatened ``to drag us back into the stone age''
and added: ``In our eyes, an extremely dangerous precedent for
solving conflicts has been set.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing flap, Russia a fallen superpower with
more nuclear weapons than any other country except the United
States is both too dangerous and too important to be left out in
the cold by its G-8 partners: the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's cooperation is deemed essential to furthering key G-8
aims ranging from the reduction of nuclear weapons to the expansion
of the global trading system; from countering global terrorism to
combating organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference whether Russia is able to strengthen
its econmy, maintain its democracy and continue to head in the
basice direction of opennes and reform,'' said Berger, ``or whether
it reverts back to some kind of nationalistic or inward-looking
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who took office only last month after the latest in a
series of unexpected shake-ups in the Russian government, presented
the G-8 leaders with Moscow's version of its economic outlook
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was expected to be the prelude to a
multi-billion-dollar debt reduction program the G-8 partners plan
to announce Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting, Clinton urged Stepashin to press for the
Duma, Russia's legislature, to finally ratify the SALT II treaty on
nuclear arms reductions. It was negotiated by President Bush,
signed six years ago and ratified by the U.S. Congress two years
ago, but has been held up by the Duma, which isn't expected to act
on the measure before elections set for December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked his G-8 partners to put up more money to help
Russia safeguard its nuclear arsenal and to find civilian jobs for
Russia's nuclear scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent $1.7 billion on the effort over the
past seven years; Clinton has asked Congress for an additional $4.2
billion over the next five years for the purpose.

 NEW YORK: economic growth.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not just paint on canvas,'' said Sclar, who with a team
of students wrote ``SoHo: A Community at a Crossroads,'' a 1996
study. ``It's important to remember that creative people develop
the software, the images, the movies, the lights _ the culture _
that attracts other industries and individuals to locate here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole new media industry growing up around Times Square
now,'' Sclar said, ``is built on the backs of this world-class arts
community centered in Lower Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as ``Mike'' _ the archetypal loft resident of White and
Smith's exhibit at the New Museum _ seems to be asking: Can the
artist colony that begat the downtown residential boom survive its
own success, especially when it is so difficult for some of those
same artists to ignore the lucrative possibilities that their old
lofts now offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, he considered himself a loft pioneer,'' said Smith,
who looks remarkably like Mike in the videos stationed around the
exhibit that serve as tour guide, and prospective seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then he was trying to save SoHo for artists,'' Smith said
of his alter ego. ``He thought this neighborhood had integrity
beyond market value.'' But Mike also ``had to eat,'' Smith said,
and went into commercial art; most recently producing a
``point-of-purchase video'' for ``The Downtown Look'' _ a lip
definer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now 20 years have passed and Mike wants to test the market,''
Smith said. ``He's ambivalent about selling because the loft
represents a certain identity to him. But the market is so hot
right now that he wants to see what he can get for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit, apparently, according a recent survey of the price
trajectory of 289 co-op or condominium lofts downtown. The report _
prepared by the Mitchell Maxwell &AMP; Jackson appraisal company for
the Corcoran Group residential brokerage _ found that in TriBeCa
between 1988 and 1998, the average price for 1,700- to
2,500-square-foot lofts increased from $495,000 to $800,000, or 62
percent; and from $855,000 to $1,440,000, or 68 percent, for lofts
of 3,500 square feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   In SoHo, the report said, the average price for lofts of 1,700
to 2,500 square feet rose from $495,000 in 1988 to $820,000 in
1998, or 66 percent, while lofts of 3,500 or more square feet
jumped 164 percent, from $700,000 to $1,850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Arlt, a longtime loft-dweller, and 23 neighbors bought
their six-story, 34-unit building _ an old caviar company's
warehouse at Greenwich and Watts streets in TriBeCa _ in 1993,
after a long and bitter dispute with the landlord. Told of the
museum exhibit and its protagonist's inner conflict about selling,
she said, ``Sounds like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arlt, a writer who ran a typesetting business out of her
1,300-square-foot loft, moved in in 1978, when ``there was nothing
down here: no food store, no video store, no drug store, certainly
no doggy day-care like we now have.''
</P>
<P>
   Her initial rent was $350. ``But we all paid for everything
involved in operating the building,'' she said. ``If one of the
elevators broke, we would all pay a percentage; likewise taxes,
fuel bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The landlord bought the building in 1975 for $350,000. In 1981,
a year before the Loft Law was enacted, the leases expired and the
owner decided to raise Ms. Arlt's rent to $1,000 a month, twice
that for the larger units. ``But we would still pay all those
expenses,'' she said, ``so we went to court.''
</P>
<P>
   The landlord's position was that since the leases had expired,
he could go to market-rate rents before being channeled into rent
stabilization under the law. ``We prevailed,'' Ms. Arlt said,
``because we were still appealing before the law went into
effect.'' Rents were frozen. For years, claiming economic hardship,
the landlord did little to comply with the housing codes. And in
1990, the tenants went on rent strike.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties in converting factory space to residential use
are hardly insubstantial. Any conversion must comply with laws on
access for people with disabilities _ most expensively, the
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Many old factories do not have adequate rear yards to meet fire,
safety and air requirements, so it may be necessary to remove parts
of the building. Fire escapes must be installed; leftover
industrial contamination eliminated. Commonly, the buildings
require plumbing, electrical work, ventilation for kitchens and
bathrooms, sprinklers and smoke detectors.
</P>
<P>
   While the burden usually falls on the owner, in many cases the
original tenants paid for the renovations _ as well as improvements
like sanded floors, interior walls, appliances _ and then entered
legal combat over who was responsible for those modifications and
who would be compensated when the original tenant moved.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Arlt's building, the burden was eventually assumed by the
tenants.

 NEW YORK: the tenants.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1993, Ms. Arlt said, the landlord's widow ``decided she had
had enough, she wanted to sell.'' For $990,000, 24 tenants became
owners, ``and took out a loan for over $3 million,'' Ms. Arlt said,
to cover the renovation costs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, TriBeca ``is where everybody wants to live,'' she
said. ``It hasn't become SoHo yet, but it's getting there. And I'm
thinking of moving before the neighborhood gets to that point. In
two years, I think, it might be time to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arlt paid $22,000 for her unit, not including her share of
the renovation costs, and believes she could now get ``somewhere in
the vicinity of $400,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Agostini didn't really know what she was getting into when
she became a landlord. ``That's for sure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Peter Agostini, a sculptor, had bought the
six-story, century-old clothing factory on Greene Street in SoHo,
along with a partner, for about $250,000 back in 1972. Each used
one floor, and they leased the other units _ two commercial spaces
on the ground floor and seven residential lofts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Agostini's father died in 1993 and, because his partner
failed to pay real estate taxes for several years, the entire
burden of the building came down on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of coming up to code had started even when my dad
was alive,'' Ms. Agostini said _ but was never completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an architect,'' she said. ``I have my blueprints, my
permits. Everything's been approved by the Loft Board. But I
haven't been able to secure a loan big enough to pay off the
$300,000 on the back taxes, plus the $200,000 to come up to code.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ms. Agostini's tenants were struggling artists when they
moved in. Now, she said, they seem to be doing quite well _ one
makes shoes for Broadway shows, one owns a recording studio and a
restaurant, another owns another building in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Three times the tenants went on rent strike between 1990 and '95
_ over issues like lack of heat, the front door not locking and,
more broadly, whether they were required to pay rent while the
building was in tax arrears. ``I'm out $80,000 that I will probably
never collect,'' Ms. Agostini said. Currently, there is relative
peace in the building _ only one tenant is withholding rent.
</P>
<P>
   The tenant on the top floor pays $1,004 for about 3,000 square
feet. Those on lower floors each pay about $770 for 1,700 square
feet. And there is an art gallery and a jewelry designer in the
ground-floor commercial spaces. ``Thank God I have them because
their rents are like $3,300 each and they are good tenants,'' Ms.
Agostini said.
</P>
<P>
   Total rental income is $12,000 a month and operating expenses
come to $10,000. ``That does give me an extra $2,000,'' Ms.
Agostini said, ``but I've been paying legal fees and architect
bills for the renovation plans. And right now I have a cornice that
I have to fix. That's $5,000 I have to borrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So that extra $2,000 goes pretty quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Agostini would gladly complete the compliance process. ``I'm
not resisting coming up to code, I just don't have the money,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me is emotionally attached to it,'' she said. ``It's a
dream of my dad's that I would like to fulfill. And when you've
given so much blood and sweat, you just don't want to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every loft building is a cauldron of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Marks, creator of high-tech installations for museums
like the New York Hall of Science in Queens, has lived in his
1,600-square-foot loft in Chelsea for 30 years. When he sanded his
floors in the 1895 building on 28th Street, ``sewing-machine
needles came out of the cracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Loft Law, he said, ``has been a godsend, an imperfect
godsend, that has given me a legal standing and made for nice truce
conditions with the landlord.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's current owners _ the Chinese importers on the
ground floor _ ``are very close to complying,'' Marks said. And,
frankly, he is surprised it hasn't happened sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, for one, is aware of contradictions at work in a
residential loft market where finger-pointing is often based on
stereotypes _ who is the victim, who is the money-grubber and on
whom does the building hang like an albatross _ that are about as
valid as a cliche: overused.
</P>
<P>
   Marks thinks that those landlords rigidly holding out against
compliance _ ``hoping, somehow, it will go away,'' he said _ have
done so ``not in their best interests.'' Even if a building were to
go to market-rate rent or conversion, ``we would still have our
rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to state his rent, Marks pointed out that his landlord
would likely now be getting $2,000 a month from him had the
building achieved code compliance and, therefore, been granted a
residential certificate of occupancy. ``In a way, it works to my
benefit that he doesn't fully comply,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had fully legalized under the Loft Law,'' he said,
``eliminated the violations and got the C of O, then we would be
channeled into rent stabilization and I would have been paying
increases compounded on increases for the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact is I'd rather pay more,'' he said, ``and know
that everything is A-1 legitimate. It can really work beautifully
for both sides.''

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are moving to capitalize immediately on
the failure of the Republican-controlled House to pass even modest
gun-control legislation, and promising to take the issue to the
forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a short, blistering radio address delivered Saturday from
Europe, President Clinton took the House and the National Rifle
Association to task and set the tone for the coming campaign.
``Time and again, the gun lobby has used every weapon in its
arsenal to defeat any effort to strengthen our gun laws, no matter
how sensible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives gutted our bill in the dark of
night _ literally, after midnight _ because the gun lobby didn't
want common-sense gun legislation to see the light of day,''
Clinton said. ``That is unacceptable. We can't allow the gun lobby
to rewrite our laws and undermine our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, the two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,
also excoriated Republicans for the House's failure. But it was
mostly Democrats who killed the final package, saying that it was
too watered down to be effective and that they did not want to give
the Republicans bragging rights for passing even modest gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that Democrats killed the package so that they
could exploit the gun issue both in the presidential campaign and
in their eagerness to try to win back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association's executive vice
president, said the bill's defeat was a victory for freedom, and
vowed that the organization's fight would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it's going to go on to the 2000 election, the most
important election in the history of this country,'' LaPierre said
in a videotaped statement for the organization's Web page. ``And
we're going to be there in every district in every state to make
sure that freedom comes out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were campaigning in California, a state where
shootings over the last several years have increased sentiment for
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the Congress doing?'' Gore asked incredulously. ``Why
don't they just wake up and respond to what the American people
want?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who pollsters
say is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, took the opposite tack. On Friday, the day of the House
vote, he signed into law a bill passed by the Texas Legislature
that would bar local governments from suing gun manufacturers to
recover damages from gun violence, putting him on the side of the
National Rifle Association. Texas is the 14th state to enact such a
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Austin, his office said: ``Governor Bush
does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product should be held
responsible for the criminal misuse of that product.''
</P>
<P>
   This dovetails with a pervasive Republican view that cultural
factors, such as moral decay and a loss of faith _ not the
availability of firearms _ are responsible for disasters like the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo. As Rep. Tom DeLay, the Texas
Republican who is the majority whip, put it, the issue is ``God,
not guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off that theme, and providing a counterpoint to the
contentious gun legislation, the House did pass, easily,
legislation urging states to allow the Ten Commandments to be
posted in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This had the apparently unintended consequence of embodying the
Republican response to Littleton in one person, Charlton Heston,
the actor who played Moses in the 1956 movie of ``The Ten
Commandments'' and who is now the most visible spokesman for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The actions by the House, and the mixed signals from Democrats,
many of whom come from conservative gun-supporting districts, may
only have confused the public while catapulting the issue into the
hands of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control is moving increasingly from the legislative venue
to the electoral venue,'' said Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group based in
Washington. ``It will increasingly be fought out at the
presidential level, because essentially these House members voted
their districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to play down the discord in their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it wasn't the cleanest of political hits,'' Jim
Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,
said of the House votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordan said, ``what matters less is specific votes than
overall impressions that political events create.'' He added:
``It's not just that Republicans shut down the government or just
that they impeached the president against the wishes of the public;
it's not just that they criticized a legitimate war effort in
Kosovo, and it's not just this gun vote. It's a series of events
over and over that solidifies an image of being bitter and partisan
and nasty and out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in shaky re-election positions tried to distance
themselves from this interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., for example, who is already in
trouble in his district for pushing the impeachment of President
Clinton, bucked his party here and voted the stronger gun-control
positions. Afterward, he lamented that ``extremists on both sides
of this important issue'' had blocked the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other House Republicans reacted angrily to the president's radio
address, saying he had politicized the atmosphere after the
Littleton shootings and was trying to shift the blame for the
bill's failure away from Democrats. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
chairman of the House Republican Conference, said that the
president had doomed the bill by demanding all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, Watts said, ``walked away from a strong bill that
required trigger locks, a ban on the importation of high-capacity
magazines, prevented juveniles from possessing semiautomatic guns
and prohibited violent juvenile criminals from buying guns as
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The message that Republicans hope will prevail is the one put
forth by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., after the votes. ``The
vast majority of the Democrat caucus walked away when they had the
chance to walk forward for the good of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it was the combined actions of Bush in Texas and the
Congress in Washington that provided Democrats with instant grist
for the campaign mill.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore officially declared his candidacy on Wednesday, he
has been warning his audiences that Bush would sign a bill that
would ``protect gun manufacturers'' and that he himself would not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, countered by suggesting that
Gore appeared to be promoting litigation as a solution. ``If Vice
President Gore wants to take the side of frivolous lawsuits, which
cost jobs and clog the courts and delay justice for people who need
it, we'll fight that fight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has until now preferred to speak in broad thematic
generalities about his candidacy. But on Friday night he advocated
several specific gun-control measures that he wants to enact, at
the same time assuming a lofty tone that suggested both parties in
Congress were tied in partisan knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end up with a shrill and stale debate that offers false
choices and little hope of reducing the carnage in America,'' he
said at a dinner in San Francisco.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he supported limiting gun purchases to one a month
per person, requiring those who own handguns to pass a basic safety
course, banning pistols known as Saturday night specials,
increasing the license fees for gun dealers and requiring dealers
to have photographs and fingerprints taken when they make
applications to sell guns. He said he also wanted to restrict
federal firearm licenses to businesses situated in commercial
zones, banning them from residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   He said that guns alone among consumer products had generally
escaped regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's remarks were softer than his campaign's earlier
suggestions that he believed handguns should be banned altogether,
and he couched his call for restrictions in language that was
sympathetic to gun owners, noting that as a boy he had gone
target-shooting with his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a subtle dig at Clinton for not doing more. He said
that much of the national conversation about guns was based on
polls and focus groups. ``Why should our leaders self-censor their
proposals on gun violence to what they think Congress might be
willing to pass, as opposed to what might work?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this month that he had tempered his anti-gun
proposals out of a realistic sense of what would pass the Congress.
``Let's join the real world here,'' Clinton said when ABC's Charles
Gibson had asked him on ``Good Morning America'' why he had
proposed such relatively modest measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, for example, that he wanted to require people to
register their guns just as they are required to register cars, but
that he knew Congress would not accept this.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded his radio address Saturday by appealing to the gun
lobby to help Congress pass measures to increase the time for
background checks on gun buyers and close loopholes on buying guns
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to be hurt by this legislation,'' he said of
proposals to close gun-show loopholes. He added: ``The American
people understand that common-sense gun laws don't infringe our
rights; they protect our lives. It's that simple.''

those whose lives were altered by the Son of Sam killings 22
summers ago. ``I got a $5,000-a-year raise,'' says Coffee, who
retired from the police force in 1985. ``But I think the case has
taken at least 10 years off my life. I quit smoking three years

Forest Hills, Queens. His daughter, Rosemary, was the age of the
victims. Afraid that his daughter might be a target of David
Berkowitz, Breslin sent his family to live with relatives in East
Hampton and accepted police protection for himself. ``It was a

family was away. I was drinking too much.'' (Librado Romero/New

Friday, Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., along with other Democratic House
female members gathered on Saturday to protest the passage of
viable gun control legislation. Democrats are moving to capitalize
immediately on the failure of the Republican-controlled House to
pass even modest gun-control legislation, and promising to take the
issue to the forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign. (Shana

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ With the last Yugoslav forces streaming
out of Kosovo ahead of schedule, NATO commanders here have reached
a tentative agreement with leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army to
disband the rebel force gradually, NATO officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which must still be signed by both parties,
the rebels will withdraw from fortified positions held during their
civil war against Yugoslav forces, turn over their heavy weapons,
shed their uniforms and cease any organized military activities
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials led by a British officer, Brig. Gen. Jonathan
Bailey, have held meetings at undisclosed locations with various
commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has an opaque
leadership structure. NATO officials refused to disclose the
identities of the rebel commanders, saying they were being withheld
at the rebels' request.
</P>
<P>
   While they have reached a tentative agreement, the fractured and
sometimes competitive nature of the rebel command has complicated
the completion of the accord, NATO officials said. It also raises
questions about how smoothly any accord can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain,
is eager to initial the agreement, according to a NATO spokesman,
Maj. Jan Joosten. Once that happens, NATO's representatives in
Brussels, Belgium, are expected to move quickly to give it final
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would come into force tomorrow,'' a NATO official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement came as Yugoslavia's army and special
police continued to withdraw, turning over more and more territory
to NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, only 3,000 to 5,000 of the roughly 40,000
Serb-dominated forces deployed in Kosovo during the war remained.
NATO officials here said they expected the last would leave by late
Saturday or early Sunday, ahead of the midnight Sunday deadline
agreed to by Yugoslav generals on June 9. Their departure will
effectively end Serbian control over the province, considered to be
Serbia's cultural and historical cradle.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO officials have portrayed the withdrawal as smooth,
the task of moving such a large force _ including hundreds of
tanks, armored personnel vehicles and all other manner of military
vehicles _ proved overwhelming to the Yugoslav commanders. They
have left dozens of vehicles and weapons behind, providing NATO
with an inventory and asking permission to retrieve them later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was logistically impossible to get them all out,'' said
Joosten, the NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Yugoslav army would likely return for the vehicles
soon, under NATO escort. ``We don't want to get stuck guarding
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops, now 17,000 strong, have moved into every major city
in Kosovo and are slowly expanding their military presence. Late
Friday, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen reached an
agreement with Russian officials, including the defense minister,
Marshal Igor Sergeyev, to add 3,600 Russian troops to the
peacekeeping force, which will ultimately total more than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will deploy troops in the American, German and French
sectors in Kosovo and control the grounds of Pristina airport,
while leaving air control to NATO forces. The agreement resolved
the embarrassing impasse created a week ago when some 200 Russians
seized the airport west of Pristina hours before the first NATO
troops could arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met Saturday at the airport with the commander of the
Russian forces, Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, to work out how to
integrate the Russian soldiers into the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman here, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, said he expected
the airport to open within days.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO troops massing and the last Yugoslav forces leaving,
NATO is now focusing on expanding security. The presence of heavily
armed fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army has become as much of
a threat to public safety as the retreating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rebel's leaders have by and large cooperated with
NATO's peacekeepers, the group has taken over what passes for
political and civil authority in the battered province.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every town, including here in provincial capital,
the group's red-and-black flag flies from checkpoints and
``official'' buildings, guarded by fighters dressed in camouflage
or entirely in black.
</P>
<P>
   Their increasingly brash presence has prompted tens of thousands
of civilian Serbs to flee Kosovo, despite entreaties from NATO and
U.N. officials to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia began in March, the group
agreed to lay down their arms during peace talks in Rambouillet,
France, as part of a deal ultimately rejected by President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   With no agreement in place after the bombing stopped, NATO's
interaction with the KLA has been guarded and inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren, German troops quickly established a delicate
coexistence with the group that allowed them to keep their weapons,
mostly AK-47s and other rifles, but on Friday they arrested 25
fighters involved in beating Serbian civilians and Gypsies and,
beginning Saturday, have vowed to confiscate weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few miles to the east, U.S. troops began confiscating the
rebels' weapons from the start, disarming an entire company in the
village of Zegra on Thursday. A day after that incident, by
contrast, French troops allowed a large contingent to march,
heavily armed, into Srbica, northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren on Saturday, KLA weapons and nearly all the uniforms
seen on the streets in the past week disappeared overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in keeping with the agreement between the regional
KLA leader known as Cmdr. Drini and the Germans, the swaggering
presence of the victorious rebels evaporated abruptly at midnight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prizren seemed to be struggling to return to normal, with young
people _ now in civilian clothes _ thronging the square near the
old mosque and filling the outdoor tables at cafes. Shopkeepers
reopened, many of them busily replacing shattered plate-glass
windows. Somewhat inexplicably, stores displaying wedding gowns
appeared undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a quiet night and now the situation is quiet,'' said
Sgt. Maj. Johann Fritsch, a German military spokesman. ``We are
confiscating weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a long tradition in Kosovo of keeping weapons
at home, and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas may have simply put
their guns in safe keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were not carrying their guns. A few managed to
retain a big hunting knife or empty pistol holster, but even the
guards at the gate of the former Serbian officers' club were
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   At the town's main intersection, German infantrymen maintained a
roadblock, stopping cars driven by Albanian men in any remnant of
military garb, and searching for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part these exchanges seemed friendly, ending in
handshakes and thumbs-up signs. When something was found _ such as
an ammunition vest with pouches of AK-47 assault-rifle clips early
Saturday afternoon _ a German soldier recorded the find on a list
and wrote a receipt, which he courteously gave to the Albanian man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later what the receipt was for, the German soldier
shrugged, threw up his hands and rolled his eyes skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the return of Kosovo Albanian refugees continued in
huge numbers. On Friday, nearly 25,000 people crossed back over
into Kosovo, 14,500 from Albania and about 10,000 from Macedonia,
said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees. Four of the tent cities in Kukes, Albania, which only
a week ago were packed with crowds of refugees, have closed down.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 75,000 refugees have returned from Albania in the last
four days alone, and the pace from Macedonia appears to be picking
up.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials have been trying to slow the influx because of
worry about mines or booby traps _ and on Saturday the medical
charity Doctors Without Borders said it had documented six cases of
land mines or booby traps exploding. Near Srbica, one man was
seriously injured when he detonated a booby trap by taking laundry
off a clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agreement on disarming the KLA rebels is said by NATO
officials to mirror the one signed after much pressure from the
West by representatives of Kosovo's Albanians during the peace
talks in France in March. It would require the rebels, now thought
to number as many as 17,000, to disband within a month and start
training to become a police force for the province.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the agreement would require that the rebels
respect a cease-fire with the retreating Serbs. They would also
have to stay more than a mile from the main roads and from NATO's
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Within four days, the rebels would withdraw from the fortified
positions they held during the conflict. After seven days, the
rebels have to begin to turn over their heavy weapons, including
those of 12.7-mm or larger caliber. By the end of 30 days, they
must disband as an organized force, ceasing any operations and
shedding their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive sign that they're willing to allow NATO to be
the only military presence in Kosovo,'' Joosten said.

   Beginning Monday night, the Reds, who have been in the middle of
a wild-card race that commands little attention, play 14
consecutive games against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the National
League West leaders, and the Houston Astros, the Central leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The eight games against the Astros figure to be more
enlightening for the Reds, because they play in the same division.
But the two-week span overall will provide Bowden with an idea of
what he might be doing later in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come July 31, we'll know a lot better where we are,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for making trades without waivers, and it's
a key date for the Reds. When Bowden made off-season trades that
brought high-priced Greg Vaughn and Denny Neagle to Cincinnati, he
said that if the Reds were not in contention for something by the
deadline, he could trade the players to teams that were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to find out,'' he said. ``I always keep an
open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the Reds were 1 1/2 games behind San
Francisco in the wild-card race, with the Mets in between. They
were in second place in the division race, four games behind the
Astros. They have been as close as 1 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Reds in these positions? Weren't they supposed to be
more at home lower in the standings?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, their young first baseman, is one reason the Reds
have become a first-half contender. He took a league-leading .377
batting average into Saturday night's game, and he led the team in
RBIs with 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' defense, especially up the middle, is another reason.
Pokey Reese, their young second baseman, has teamed well with
veteran Barry Larkin and had made only one error in 61 games. He
was hitting well, too, with a .287 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get spoiled watching guys like him,'' Jack McKeon, the
Reds' manager, said. ``He has great range, great hands, great
instincts and a strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster, Mike Cameron, performs a similar role in
center field. ``He catches everything in center,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the unexpectedly competitive Reds has been
their relief corps, a group of no-name pitchers who have made
themselves the most effective bullpen in the major leagues. The
Reds would not be where they are without Scott Williamson, Danny
Graves, Gabe White, Scott Sullivan and Dennis Reyes, who among them
had seven years of major league experience when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's 2.72 ERA is the only bullpen ERA in the majors
below 3.00. The .211 batting average the relievers have allowed
opponents is the only average below .225. Their effort has been
season-saving because the Reds' starting pitchers have averaged
only five innings a start, making them the shortest-working
starters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to get it done,'' McKeon said. So the
relievers have had to get the job done. Sullivan, Graves and
Williamson began the weekend with more innings in relief than
anyone in the league except Brian Edmondson of Florida. Williamson,
who in his third year as a professional throws a fastball 96 to 98
mph, leads National League relievers with six victories, and his
1.39 ERA and 54 strikeouts are second.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and McKeon appreciate what the bullpen has done, but they
know they can't expect to get that kind of production for the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our starters to pitch well or we'll burn out the
bullpen,'' Bowden said. ``We could use another starting pitcher or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who is on the disabled list strengthening his left
shoulder, has won no games this season. Brett Tomko, who was
demoted to the minors briefly earlier in the season, has won two
games. The Reds had counted on 15 victories each from Neagle, Tomko
and Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is on the prowl for starters who might be available in
trades but said: ``Thirty clubs can't agree on a salary cap,
revenue sharing, realignment, the designated hitter or Astroturf,
but I found one thing they all agree on. All of them want starting
pitching and none of them wants to trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it will be up to McKeon to navigate the team through
the hazardous waters filled with Diamondbacks and Astros. Trader
Jack noted that the Reds beat each team two out of three in earlier
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure we're not intimidated by them,'' he said.
``It's a good test for us. If we want to stay where we are, we have
to at least split with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Alterations
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine feels he is a marked man, but the Mets' manager
invites scrutiny and retaliation. In the past few weeks, Jack
McKeon, the Cincinnati manager, has questioned Jason Isringhausen's
glove and the shirt Pat Mahomes wore under his uniform, forcing the
Mets to alter the glove and Mahomes to change the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was McKeon's turn in the art of baseball gamesmanship. He
acted after the Mets' grounds crew applied an excessive amount of
water in front of home plate before a game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watered the field down purposely,'' McKeon said, speaking
of Valentine. ``Someone overheard him say it the night before to
the groundskeepers.'' The start of the game was delayed as the
grounds crew, at McKeon's request to the umpires, put down a
substance to soak up the water. ``I was worried about getting
Piazza hurt,'' McKeon said with a straight face, referring to the
Mets' catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken Bids for Return
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken was on the disabled list earlier this season _
recovering from a chronic back ailment, dealing with his father's
death and facing a .179 batting average and five errors in eight
games _ he brushed off suggestions that he was just about finished
as a productive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to arm yourself with your tools and go out there and
find out,'' he said, discussing the ability that might remain.
``Then you'll know yourself. You're being judged in front of all
these people, but nobody can make that judgment except you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others' rush to judgment has suffered a setback. Since his
return from the disabled list, Ripken was hitting .363 (45 for 124)
with 24 RBIS, eight home runs and two errors in 31 games before
Saturday night. His rejuvenated performance will help the Orioles
take an important step with greater ease.
</P>
<P>
   They must decide by July 13 if they want to exercise the $6.3
million option in Ripken's contract for next season or pay him a
$2.5 million buyout. Although club officials have not talked about
their plans, they are prepared to pick up the option.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ripken should play only part time next year, the Orioles
figure they can pay him the high salary for what he has done for
the franchise.

   The Homerless Race
</P>
<P>
   On successive days last week, the race for most times at bat
without a home run underwent a dramatic change. Last Monday, Tony
Womack of Arizona relinquished his lead in the race with a home run
against Ryan Dempster of Florida in his 227th at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier Mike Caruso of the Chicago White Sox, in his 216th
at-bat, hit his first home run of the season against Rick Aguilera
of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Their exit from the race left Luis Castillo of Florida all alone
at the top. Entering Saturday's games, he had batted 231 times
without hitting a home run. Rey Ordonez of the Mets was a distant
second with 189 at-bats, and Kevin Stocker of Tampa Bay was next at
183.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl probably cannot understand their power problem. The
Milwaukee pitcher has only 29 at-bats in his 14 starts this season,
and he has hit two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Blue Jay! It's Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   Some people might swear that Tony Fernandez stepped into a
telephone booth last Aug. 1, but all he did, really, was move from
second base to third base. Since that day, however, American League
pitchers have suffered from Fernandez's transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Not even balls made of kryptonite can get him out. ``This is not
a phenomenon this year,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager,
said. ``You go back to last August, when we moved him from second
to third. He didn't have to worry about a lack of range. He seemed
to take off offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   A .282 career hitter for his first 14 years in the majors,
Fernandez was hitting .287 when the month of July ended last year.
The next day he began playing third, and he proceeded to hit .381
in his last 67 games, finishing with a .321 average, just one point
below the career-high .322 he batted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a fairly good hitter,'' Ash said, ``but he's
moved into another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, before Saturday's game, was batting a league-leading
.407. When the first phase of interleague play began June 4, he was
hitting .383. In 14 games since, he amassed 25 hits in 51 at-bats.
Besides catapulting him beyond .400, his torrid stretch placed
Fernandez two career hits away from Julio Franco's 2,177, most ever
by a Dominican Republic native.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work ethic, his concentration and, I think, his comfort
level all play a role in it,'' Ash said of Fernandez's remarkable
late-life improvement as a hitter. ``I've never seen anybody, and I
underline anybody, work like this guy works. Pre- and post-game, he
conditions himself. He sets a work tone second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who will turn 37 on June 30, is in his third tour of
duty with the Blue Jays, with whom he has spent nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has always been a hard worker,'' Ash added, ``even when
we had him as a youngster. He always had dedication. Everybody
talks about the pressure that comes with hitting .400. He's a guy
who has the ability to shut it out. That doesn't seem to bother
him.''

CLEANING A CARPET DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIFFICULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Pa.) (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding a carpet-cleaning service is as easy as looking for the
letter ``C'' in the Yellow Pages. But finding a carpet-cleaning
method that works for you might not be so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five different carpet-cleaning methods in use
today,'' said Kathryn Sellers, spokeswoman for the Carpet and Rug
Institute, an industry advocacy organization based in Dalton, Ga.
``All five work, as long as the person doing the cleaning knows
what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sellers explained that the five methods include hot-water,
dry or foam extraction; rotary shampoo and the absorbent-pad
method.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-water-extraction method _ what most people mean when
they say they are having their carpets ``steam cleaned'' _ uses a
machine that sprays a hot detergent solution onto the carpet, and
then immediately vacuums it out.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to the hot-water method, Ms. Sellers said, is that
if it is not done right, the carpet and padding can get soaked,
thereby providing a breeding ground for mold and mildew. Also, she
said, if too much detergent is used, or if all the detergent is not
removed, the carpet will get dirtier sooner. Detergent left in a
carpet, she said, serves as a magnet for new dirt.
</P>
<P>
   With the dry-extraction method, on the other hand, a powdered
detergent compound is brushed into the carpet with specially
designed machines. Soil particles in the carpet bond to the
chemicals and are removed by vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   The foam-extraction method, Ms. Sellers said, employs the use of
a foam instead of dry chemicals and the foam is vacuumed out of the
carpet while it is still wet.
</P>
<P>
   With the rotary-shampoo method, she said, the cleaning solution
is pushed into the carpet by a machine that uses rotating brushes
to work the solution into the fibers. The resulting dirt-filled
foam is then removed by wet vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Sellers said, there is the absorbent-pad, or
``bonnet,'' method. With this method, she said, chemicals are
sprayed into the carpet fibers and after they have had a chance to
work their magic by percolating the dirt up to the surface, the
chemicals are removed by a machine with a large round absorbent
spinning pad like the one on the bottom of a commercial floor
buffer.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrong hands, however, the spinning pad can turn your
deep-pile carpet into a puckered moonscape. ``The absorbent-pad
method should be used only by a properly trained cleaning
professional,'' Ms. Sellers said.
</P>
<P>
   And Phil Manwarren is just such a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cleaning method is so different from steam-cleaning and
shampooing that it isn't even funny,'' said Manwarren, the owner of
the ChemDry Northeast franchise in Clarks Summit, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   With the ChemDry method, he said, the cleaning solution is
sprayed onto the carpet where it begins to bubble, thereby
``emulsifying'' the dirt and lifting it to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like using club soda to get a stain out of your shirt,''
Manwarren said, explaining that for stains in the carpet, the
ChemDry company has a whole array of spot removers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have specialized spotters for just about every stain under
the sun,'' Manwarren said. ``And the best thing about our system is
that we use about one-tenth of the moisture used with
steam-cleaning and shampooing. And that means your carpet will be
dry in one hour instead of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Manwarren said that while prices vary among ChemDry franchisees,
his charge averages around 20 cents a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares Manwarren's enthusiasm for
carbonated chemical carpet cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemically cleaning your carpet is like eating spare-ribs and
then using a towelette to clean your hands,'' said Mel Land,
regional sales manager for Environmental Cleaning Systems, a
carpet-cleaning company in Valley Stream, N.Y. ``No matter how long
you rub, there's always a little grease left. A hot, wet towel
works better and soap and water works best.''
</P>
<P>
   Land said that when his company cleans a carpet it uses a
combination of the rotary-shampoo method and the
hot-water-extraction method. When using those methods, he said, it
is critical to apply only enough moisture to clean down to the
bottom of the fiber, but not so much that the carpet backing or pad
gets soaked. He also acknowledged that wet cleaning takes longer to
dry than chemical cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should take eight or 10 hours for the carpet to completely
dry,'' Land said, adding that drying can be accelerated by opening
the windows and using fans to circulate the air or by turning on
central air-conditioning if that is available.
</P>
<P>
   Most carpet-cleaning companies _ including his _ will not move
furniture, he said, but they should always put plastic pads or foam
disks under furniture legs to protect both the furniture and the
carpet itself while the carpet is drying. And he cautioned
consumers to beware of companies that advertise ``bargain rates,''
which may not be bargains at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see ads where they say they charge $7.99 a room for
steam-cleaning,'' he said. ``Then you find out that if you want
soap included, it's going to cost you an extra $2, and if you want
a `deep-cleaning' or shampoo, it will cost another $2 on top of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Land said that his company charged about 15 cents per square
foot for shampooing and steam extraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible, of course, to clean your carpet yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding more and more homeowners renting or buying
commercial-grade machines for use in the home,'' said Vince
Marchetti, president of Cherokee Equipment, a carpet-cleaning
machine distributor in West New York, N.J. ``You can save a couple
of hundred dollars a couple of times a year by cleaning your own
carpets.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchetti, who provides in-the-home demonstration and training
for customers who purchase his machines, said that if a homeowner
is careful, he or she can get the same results with a $600 machine
that a professional carpet-cleaning company can get with machines
that cost as much as $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, he said, homeowners will rent or buy
steam-extraction machines that have a sprayer and a
triangular-shaped plastic wand at the end of a hose that is used to
vacuum up the solution as it passes through the carpet fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to getting your carpet clean is pre-treatment,'' he
said. Pre-treatment, he explained, is generally needed to remove
individual stains and soiled areas from a carpet. ``Pre-treating
your carpet is like pre-soaking your dishes. It allows the cleaning
solution to eat through the caked-on dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Once stains have been addressed, Marchetti said, the carpet
should be cleaned using the ``aggregation'' approach _ that is, by
pushing and pulling the cleaning wand over the same area several
times, making sure to finish up by extracting as much moisture from
the carpet as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sellers, of the Carpet and Rug Institute, added one note of
caution for do-it-yourselfers: ``Most homeowners think that if a
quarter-cup of cleaning solution is good, then a half-cup is
better,'' she said. ``That is human nature, and it is totally
incorrect. It's one of the main reasons we don't actively encourage
do-it-yourselfers.''(BBOX)

PLAYERS SAY MARKET, WHILE NOT `FROTHY,' IS HEALTHY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - 2TAKES-NYT   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This time last year the real estate market was, in
the words of one executive, ``frothy.'' Aggressive Wall Street
firms were providing 90 percent financing for deals, reducing the
amount of equity a prospective purchaser had to provide. Deals were
plentiful and prices were climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Then the capital-market crunch hit in late August. Problems in
far-away places like Thailand and Russia shook the confidence of
bond market investors. Institutions that were backing investment
bankers' eagerness to lend by buying the loans packaged as
commercial mortgage-backed securities suddenly fled to the safety
of Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with loans it could not resell at a profit, the Wall
Street companies stopped lending or sought to readjust the terms of
their agreements. With uncertainty prevailing, transactions came to
a halt. Declining stock prices for real estate investment trusts,
or REIT's, sharply limited their ability to make additional
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the smoke has cleared, real estate finance executives
say that financing is available for property sales but that buyers
now need 25 to 30 percent equity. Several investment-banking firms
have left the real estate lending business or sharply scaled back.
The prices of publicly traded real estate companies, including the
REIT's, remain depressed, and the REIT's are no longer on a buying
spree.
</P>
<P>
   The experience left some veteran real estate executive amazed at
the pace of change in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market crashed in 1987, it took three years for
our industry to adjust,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of
Eastern Consolidated Properties, a Manhattan-based sales brokerage
company. ``Last year it happened in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company sells on average two buildings a week. ``We
didn't do anything for two months'' after the credit market crunch,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transactions have resumed and prices are at or above the level
of June 1998. But 90 percent loan-to-value financing has become
rare and both buyers and sellers are taking a more conservative
approach to structuring deals. Almost to a person, real estate
executives say this is a healthier state than the one that
prevailed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investments by REIT's have fallen sharply nationally. According
to figures compiled by Granite Partners, REIT's accounted for 53
percent of all investments in office buildings priced over $10
million in 1998. In the first quarter of this year the figure fell
to 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   But the REIT's still like Manhattan. In 1998 they bought $900
million of property and accounted for 30 percent of office building
investment in Manhattan. So far this year, they have invested $700
million but account for 41 percent of investments, as buying by
institutional and offshore investors has dropped from 20 percent to
6 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for property in Manhattan is pretty strong, but
it's not what you would call frenzied,'' said Robert M. White Jr.,
a senior vice president at Granite. Overall, Granite anticipates
that investments in Manhattan office buildings in the first half of
this year will be two-thirds of the $3 billion that was invested in
the first half of last year. Pricing is up slightly from last year
to an average of $147 per square foot, compared to $142 a square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``REIT's reached their historical high in the fall of 1997,''
said Dennis Yeskey, managing director of Deloitte &AMP; Touche's real
estate services group. ``The problem is that they were hyped as
growth stocks when in fact they were a dividend play. So they
dropped about 20 percent on average, while the overall stock market
went up 30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeskey said REIT stock prices have fallen so far that some
investors, notably Warren Buffett, are buying them as a value
investment. Yeskey said prices had gradually improved over the last
few months.
</P>
<P>
   New York office properties remain a solid investment, he said,
because of the good fundamentals of the market. ``Vacancy rates are
the lowest in the decade, at around 5 to 7 percent,'' he said. ``It
used to be when vacancy rates went below 15 percent everybody
started building like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that most of the commercial buildings going up, such as
the Reuters headquarters in Times Square or the Bear Stearns
project on Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets, are being
built to suit the needs of their major tenants, rather than on
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Because liquidity has come back, although on a more conservative
basis, more owners are testing the water by offering their
buildings for sale. ``We did a survey and found that $25 billion of
office property was for sale in Manhattan,'' said Howard Michaels,
chairman of the Carleton Group, a company specializing in complex
financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Today's deals are likely to be more complex than in the past
because of the wary attitude of many lenders. ``Last year, you
could make one phone call and do the deal,'' Michaels said.
``That's a lot less likely this year.'' He said there were a lot
more of what he called ``A, B deals'' in which one lender makes the
larger, senior loan, while another provides the rest of the funds
to complete a transaction, to spread the risk.
</P>
<P>
   He said the weak market conditions of the early 1990's were
providing opportunities for investors to buy buildings in which
tenants are holding leases with rents well below current market
conditions. ``Today you can find properties that were substantially
leased in the early 1990's that are $10 to $20 a square foot below
the current market,'' he said. ``They are being purchased in the
anticipation that the return on investment will increase as the
leases roll over and are replaced at current rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the spreads on loans, the amount of interest above the
rates on Treasury securities with similar dates of maturity, have
not declined to last year's pre-crunch levels, the slower rate of
investment activity so far this year could be good news for buyers,
said Carol D. Nichols, senior managing director of Insignia/ESG's
capital advisory group. ``Some lenders have not filled out their
programs for the year, which may mean there will be more liquidity
as the year goes on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say one reason the credit crunch was so
severe toward the end of last year was that the first half was so
busy that many lenders had placed as much money as they had planned
for the year when events went awry in August. As a result, they
simply headed for the sidelines while the turmoil was being sorted
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, real estate learned that liquidity was more
important than location,'' said Dale A. Reiss, head of the E&AMP;Y
Kenneth Leventhal real estate group's New York office. She said the
nature of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market has
changed as a result of bond market turmoil.

NEW YORK: market turmoil.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, mortgages
are pooled and divided into slices with different credit ratings,
with the lower rated parts _ those considered below investment
grade _ drawing the highest interest rates because of the greater
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are not the way they were,'' she said. ``You need
buyers for the lowest-rated pieces, and most of those buyers have
disappeared. It's hard to do securitization when you don't have a
buyer for the below-grade piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not seeing as many games with A, B, and C pieces,''
said William Shanahan, a senior director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield,
referring to the rating of the pieces of the commercial
mortgage-backed securities. ``Now we are seeing one big piece with
a small B piece.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some investment banks are still smarting from the
effects of some of the risky paper they bought while the market was
hot. ``Some of those shops are still holding B paper from last
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said borrowers are less able to leverage the income of
a piece of property. Last year, he said, if a property had $1
million in income, its owners could borrow as much as 11 times that
income. Today that multiple ratio is 8.5 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital markets are not as much fun as they were last
year, but they are much healthier,'' he said. ``Most of the pundits
are saying that we are in an environment that can last for a while,
and people can count on their lenders being there for them.''(BBOX)

ANGER DIRECTED AT WITHDRAWING SERBS

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The fires of revenge burned throughout
northern Kosovo as Serb forces sullenly made final troop
withdrawals before the NATO-imposed deadline of midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring months of ``ethnic cleansing,'' of fleeing for
their lives, of seeing loved ones gunned down and homes burned to
the ground, some Kosovar Albanians gave their Serb neighbors a
taste of the same Saturday, looting and torching homes on the heels
of the Serb retreat.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces face a daunting task trying to quell these flames of
vengeance, which first flared centuries ago near this green-brown
patchwork of lush farmland set amid craggy gray mountains.
Saturday, NATO peacekeepers seemed incapable of stopping many
ethnic Albanians from taking retribution on their Serb neighbors in
the rural pockets of Kosovo and back streets of towns.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the heavy presence of NATO troops in armored
vehicles and tanks, the soldiers also seemed unable to control
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas armed with pistols and grenades
who were telling Serbs to leave their homes and in some instances
overseeing the ransacking of Serb homes.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the main road that runs through Mitrovica, Yugoslav
Nasic, 64, and his wife were shaking in fear as a NATO armored
personnel carrier dropped them in front of their home.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb couple pleaded with NATO French peacekeeping forces,
which are responsible for the area, to protect them from KLA
soldiers, who they said had threatened to kill them if they
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Nasic said KLA soldiers burst into their home Saturday and
``seemed polite at first.'' Then he said one of the soldiers
wrenched his wife's left forefinger, apparently breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am too afraid now. I have to go. NATO cannot sit and wait
here in front of our house all night. We are going to have to go,''
said Nasic, his hands trembling, his wife wincing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will kill us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The French troops grew impatient and moved on. The Nasics then
left their home and walked away toward the Serbian forces on the
edge of town that were preparing to pull out. They took nothing
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, two KLA soldiers emerged from the elderly
couple's backyard. Sola Zahiti, a commander of KLA special forces
in the town, was dressed in full camouflage, armed with a pistol
and a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had forced the couple to leave their home,
Zahiti replied, ``Why not? Look what they did to their neighbors'
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the charred remains of ethnic Albanian homes that
dotted the neighborhood. Only those homes marked with a Serbian
Orthodox cross and symbol of Serb solidarity drawn in chalk were
left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian children picked cherries from the trees in the
well-groomed yards of the Serb homes while Albanian men and
teenagers entered the Serb homes and filled burlap sacks with alarm
clocks, radios, eating utensils, and glassware.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it to us,'' said one of the teenagers, looking
startled and ashamed that a reporter was watching him. ``Why
shouldn't we do it to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Zahiti led a reporter into several of the homes and pointed to
green uniforms worn by Serb paramilitaries who had been terrorizing
ethnic Albanians. One home, he said, was owned by Miki Vucinic,
whom he described as a local paramilitary leader who had
orchestrated the burning of ethnic Albanian homes and random
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping over empty liquor bottles, scattered fishing tackle,
and several pornographic magazines, Zahiti held up a uniform with a
patch that depicted the insignia of a tiger which he said was worn
by the notorious and murderous paramilitary unit known as Arkan's
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are murderers,'' Zahiti said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not directly answer when asked about the elderly
couple who had lived here and the role they could have played. ``We
need the houses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks were reported near the village of Belo Polje,
where three Serbs were killed Saturday and a fourth badly wounded _
each with a shot to the forehead. Near Gnjilane, where US
peacekeepers have their headquarters, Marines arrested a Serb for
allegedly killing one man and wounding two others in a sniper
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road from the Kosovo capital of Pristina to Mitrovica,
scores of Serb homes of stucco and red tile roofs were in flames.
Tractors and horse carts were seen on the road loaded with stolen
furnishings, beds, and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not stealing _ this is revenge,'' said Osman Majouni,
35, driving a tractor heaped with a washing machine, a hand-carved
cradle, an oak table, and bookshelves. He said he took the
possessions from a Serb neighbor in the village of Novo Sello.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors said the house belonged to Miroloup Lazic, a local
farmer and military commander of Serb forces in the area. The home
was stripped clean, except for a picture of a Serbian Orthodox
saint in a smashed glass frame, a broken jar of pickles, and piles
of schoolbooks and papers from the man's teenage children. In the
yard, a dozen pigs grunted and picked through trash _ the only
livestock left behind by the Albanian Muslims, who do not eat pork.
</P>
<P>
   Feizullah Musa, 56, said that he and others in the village
always got along with their Serb neighbors until the fury of Serb
nationalism took hold about 10 years ago, building to a crescendo
of hate in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always like this,'' he said, standing in an apple
orchard and watching as one of his Serb neighbor's homes crackled
in flames and charred roof beams collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian revenge came fast on the heels of the Serb retreat.
In Mitrovica, a convoy of Serbian forces prepared its final retreat
from the northern edge of town in the long shadows of the
 &UR; afternoon &LR; . French forces were working out the final details of
the withdrawal, which is called for in the agreement between NATO
and Yugoslav Army leaders that ended the nearly three-month war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old major of the Serbian special police forces, with
an automatic pistol, a 10-inch knife and a grenade strapped to his
Kevlar vest, stood with his arms folded just moments before a
convoy of buses filled with soldiers and armored personnel carriers
prepared to exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see if they protect the Serbs. If they don't we will
come back. This is our country and we will protect our people,''
said the major, who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the systematic campaign exacted for months
againt ethnic Albanians, he shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and now they are doing the same thing to us in Pec, in
Jakovic, in Klina, and everywhere. NATO does nothing to protect the
Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke he leered at the Globe's translator, an Albanian
woman. He smiled as his men made lewd gestures and shouted
obscenities at her.
</P>
<P>
   Then he studied the name on her press pass. ``We will have to
remember you,'' he said to her, ``when we come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed again about the nearly 1 million civilians who were
forced from their homes by the Serbian forces, he said, ``We didn't
burn the houses of the innocent, only the terrorists. They are all
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   With the buses idling and the armored personnel carriers
sputtering to a start, the major climbed atop a jeep with a machine
gun mount at the head of the convoy and waved his arm as the convoy
headed north for the 40-mile drive to the Serbian border.
</P>
<P>
   As the line of vehicles passed, a soldier shouted to a group of
Albanian women and children who silently watched on the roadside,
``Kosovo is ours. We will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of an avenue called Liberty, Shipi Koshie turned
to watch the convoy pass and the Serb soldiers making three-finger,
Serbian nationalist salutes. It was just after 5 p.m., and she was
walking home from her work at a technical engineering firm, a walk
that she made every day for 20 years with her co-worker and
neighbor Lila Borbaric.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she is ethnic Albanian and her neighbor is Serbian,
they walked together from work along Liberty Avenue every day, even
throughout the last three months of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, her friend, Lila Borbaric, pulled the shutters down on
her house and left for Serbia. The house with a neatly tended
garden of yellow lilies and pink roses was the only house not
blackened and bombed out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Koshie turned the key in her gate and walked into what is left
of her home, which was firebombed and ransacked on April 25 by Serb
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the attack, Koshie said that there had been
long, awkward silences as the two colleagues walked home. She
didn't know what to say to her neighbor, who offered her little
help. The walk had become a silent ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Lila,'' she said, standing in the charred rubble
of her kitchen. ``She was not courageous. She was afraid like
everyone else. I blame the forces that make people act this way.''

   Two weeks after former Defense Secretary William Perry traveled
to North Korea with a letter from President Clinton proposing a
path to reconciliation between the two countries, the North
responded by getting its fishing fleet and navy into a fire fight
with South Korean ships along a disputed border. The North Koreans
lost a ship and more than 20 sailors. America, though, may have
lost a chance to convince Congress that sanctions on the North
should be lifted in return for commitments from Pyongyang to give
up their missile tests and other threatening programs.

   In the biggest recall in Coke history, four European countries
ordered Coca-Cola products off store shelves after dozens of people
in Belgium fell ill after drinking Coke. By Friday, despite an
apology from Coca-Cola's chairman and an explanation that the
problem originated at two European bottling plants, a ban on Coke,
Sprite and Fanta remained in Belgium and Luxembourg. The
Netherlands banned products handled in Belgium, and France demanded
a recall of beverages from a plant in Dunkirk blamed for some of

   In an international study that offered new hope for delaying the
onset of breast cancer, risk of the disease was lowered by 76
percent among postmenopausal women who took an osteoporosis drug,
raloxifene, for three years compared to a similar group that took a
placebo. But because the duration of benefit is unknown and
raloxifene can produce unwanted effects, experts cautioned against
recommending it as an anti-breast-cancer drug except in clinical
trials.

</P>
<P>
   The Fine Arts Commission, the esthetic arbiter of the appearance
of what can be built in Washington's monument area, unanimously
approved the design of the Smithsonian Institution's new National
Museum of the American Indian. It will cost at least $110 million
and is to open in 2002 on the last available site on the Mall. The
museum's collection will include most of the holdings of the Heye
Foundation in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Indians played a major role in the design of the limestone
building. The land surrounding the museum will include forest and
wetland, and in the marshy area the cattails so essential to many
Indian rituals will be grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fabulous,'' said Emily Malino Scheuer, a member
of the Fine Arts Commission. ``It is a long overdue recognition of
native American culture.''

unusual flier on Burns when it committed to 10 years of

has been the sole corporate underwriter for ``The Civil War,''
``Baseball'' and Burns' newest, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The
Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' to be seen
on PBS in November. Now Burns, and many freelancers who work with
him, have some security and the luxury to explore projects in
advance.

MODERN-DAY `SCHINDLERS' SAVED NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Zhivko Martinovic had a dank, cramped,
concrete woodshed next to his home. It was the best he could offer
_ 5 by 7 feet, cluttered with chopped wood, paint cans, old soda
bottles, hammers, shovels.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three months, the Serbian man's shed served as
sanctuary for his two ethnic Albanian neighbors, a refuge from the
terrors of Serb paramilitary attacks and NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened his door and helped us,'' said 75-year-old Zymber
Buqaj at the doorway to the shed, ``because he knew they were doing
massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians call Serbs such as Martinovic the ``Schindlers,''
friends of theirs before the war who went out on a limb to become
their saviors when the ``ethnic cleansing'' began. Nicknamed after
Oskar Schindler, who saved Jews from Nazi slaughter, these Serbs
risked their own lives to protect Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Some warned Albanian families of a coming Serbian military
attack. Others appealed to Serbian soldiers to release men the Serb
militiamen were trying to pull out of a column of fleeing
Albanians. The bravest of Serb civilians offered their basements or
woodsheds as hiding places, hoping that the soldiers would not
search a Serbian home.
</P>
<P>
   Martinovic began helping his next-door neighbors by knocking
down a part of the stone wall between their houses, enabling the
Buqajes to sneak back in and out of their home at times without
detection from the street.
</P>
<P>
   While providing the shed, Martinovic had apologized for not
being able to take Buqaj and his wife into the comfort of his
house, saying that they might be seen by the Serb paramilitary,
``and if they saw you, they would kill you,'' Buqaj recounted.
</P>
<P>
   In a war that pitted neighbor against neighbor, both Albanians
and Serbs found their character tested. And the Schindlers were not
alone in crossing ethnic divides. So, too, were Albanians who
cooperated with the Serbian regime. Their ethnic brothers have a
nickname for them, too: ``Shiptar Te Shitur'' _ ``sellouts,''
roughly translated.
</P>
<P>
   These are the ethnic Albanians who decided long ago that it was
more profitable to cooperate with, or even assist, Serb
authorities, instead of suffering repression and, later, savage
attacks from Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the region surrounding Djakovica, Albanians speak with hatred
of one such family: the clan of Mush Ibrahimi, commonly called
``Mush Jakupi,'' or the children of Mush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were friendly with the Serbs. Serb police and
paramilitary would hold meetings here,'' said Blerim Saraqini,
gesturing toward the clan's office, next door to Saraqini's cobbler
business.
</P>
<P>
   The family ran an organization called the Popular Party of
Kosovo, once threatening to kill Saraqini if he did not make them a
leather sheath for a knife, Saraqini said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war began, Saraqini and others here said the Mush
Jakupi, who spoke Albanian, lured targeted Albanians into opening
their doors to Serb attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary ``used them. They called out in Albanian, and
when they answered the door, they were killed,'' said Zeja
Bejtullahu, a local resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were mercenaries!'' screamed Linda Nikolici, 26, whose
family's home was burned. ``We all knew all of them. If I saw them
now, I would massacre them, the way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Albanians were deeply disappointed to learn that some of
their Serb neighbors, people the Albanians thought were their
friends, turned on them in anger over the NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend was Serbian, and he threw a grenade into my
house, because I had had a Serb girlfriend,'' said Talat Nuhim, a
resident of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Blerim Hasi used to share meals regularly with a Serb friend at
a favorite restaurant in Djakovica. The friend, whom Hasi called by
the nickname of Qile, burned the restaurant himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot at me five times when I tried to stop the fire,'' Hasi
said, shaking his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these Serbs, along with their ethnic Albanian
sympathizers, are believed to have fled Kosovo, fearing retribution
by the Kosovo Liberation Army and civilian Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue army, which under the peace agreement is not
technically supposed to be operating as an army, has been rounding
up low-level Albanian co-conspirators for questioning, a KLA
soldier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating'' the Mush Jakupi and others, added KLA
vice commander Mehmetali Perolli. Most people here believe the clan
has fled to Montenegro or upper Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Schindlers are welcome here now, but many of them,
fearing an unpredictable future, have also fled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Prizren, the Bruti family had rented office space
from Serbs who lived upstairs. When the Serb soldiers were coming,
the Serbian family, headed by a man the Bruti family would identify
only as Stanislav, gave them advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, the Brutis considered running to Albania. Then
Stanislav's wife interrupted: ``Why are you going to Albania? Stay
here and come in our home,'' recounted Afradita Bruti, 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Brutis stayed, but when the war ended, Stanislav and his
family chose to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begged them to stay. We said, `You can come in our house
and be protected by us. We Albanians are not going to touch you if
you didn't do anything harmful,' '' Bruti said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb family fled during the Serb military pullout,
saying their knowledge that massacres were taking place left them
vulnerable to retaliatory attacks. ``I have no face to stay here
anymore,'' Bruti recounted Stanislav telling him. ``I know what the
Serb soldiers are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians worry about the fate of the Schindlers. Kosovar Serbs
are not well-liked in upper Serbia, where they are known as
``Albanian Serbs.'' Bruti and others are concerned that the people
who helped them will not find a truly safe home anywhere in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martinovic, who had offered his woodshed to save his
neighbors, could not be persuaded to stay, Buqaj said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Martinovic's sons had run a local restaurant and was
well-regarded by Albanians, but the other son had joined the
paramilitary, Buqaj said, presumably joining in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a sad Martinovic met Buqaj and turned over the keys
to his house. Buqaj sought to return his neighbor's brave favor to
him, and offered his own home as shelter for Martinovic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb man declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please take my keys. If your daughter returns, she can stay in
my house,'' Buqaj recalled Martinovic as insisting. ``I can't be
here anymore.''

SERB, ALBANIAN FARMERS SQUARE OFF IN TRACTOR DISPUTE

   ORALAVIC VALLEY, Yugoslavia _ Call it a tractor war.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the road that weaves through the farmland north
of Pristina is the Serb village of Grac.
</P>
<P>
   And on the other side is the ethnic Albanian village of Stanovc
I Ult.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Kosovars began returning to their homes Saturday after
hiding out in the mountains for months and claimed that their Serb
neighbors had stolen their tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Albanian farmers walked across the road armed with
shotguns and automatic rifles to get the tractors back, and soon
the crackle of gunfire echoed across fields of potatoes and
lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops moved in.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun was going down, there was a tense standoff with
nearly a hundred farmers from each side squared off along the road,
separated by a NATO tank and an armored personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians insisted they wanted their tractors, and the
Serbs, many of whom were Gypsies, insisted that the vehicles were
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeepers did their best to sort things out, and
finally several of the tractors were returned to the Albanian side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Serbs took the remaining tractors and loaded them with
their families and a few belongings and moved out of Kosovo. Many
said they knew they could no longer live with their Albanian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces escorted the Serbian tractor convoy out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole from us. They stole our tractors. And they are
getting away with it!'' complained Albanian farmer Imir Mendici,
34, who said he now has no vehicle to plow fields that have gone
untended for months during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Danic Milovan, a Serb farmer, driving a red tractor with his
family loaded into a trailer in back, responded, ``We are leaving
and we will never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever want you back!'' shouted an Albanian along the
road.

AN IMPORTANT TWO WEEKS FOR REDS  
 VALENTINE'S ALTERATIONS 
RIPKEN BIDS FOR RETURN 
THE HOMERLESS RACE 
IT'S A BLUE JAY! IT'S FERNANDEZ
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 (Eds: SUBS 2nd take on homerless race and Fernandez to UPDATE with
Saturday's game.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds are giving Jim Bowden, their general
manager, ``every reason to believe they can play with the wild-card
teams.'' In the next two weeks, though, the upstart and unheralded
Reds will let him know if they can play with the division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday night, the Reds, who have been in the middle of
a wild-card race that commands little attention, play 14
consecutive games against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the National
League West leaders, and the Houston Astros, the Central leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The eight games against the Astros figure to be more
enlightening for the Reds, because they play in the same division.
But the two-week span overall will provide Bowden with an idea of
what he might be doing later in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come July 31, we'll know a lot better where we are,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for making trades without waivers, and it's
a key date for the Reds. When Bowden made off-season trades that
brought high-priced Greg Vaughn and Denny Neagle to Cincinnati, he
said that if the Reds were not in contention for something by the
deadline, he could trade the players to teams that were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to find out,'' he said. ``I always keep an
open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the Reds were 1 1/2 games behind San
Francisco in the wild-card race, with the Mets in between. They
were in second place in the division race, four games behind the
Astros. They have been as close as 1 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Reds in these positions? Weren't they supposed to be
more at home lower in the standings?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, their young first baseman, is one reason the Reds
have become a first-half contender. He took a league-leading .377
batting average into Saturday night's game, and he led the team in
RBIs with 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' defense, especially up the middle, is another reason.
Pokey Reese, their young second baseman, has teamed well with
veteran Barry Larkin and had made only one error in 61 games. He
was hitting well, too, with a .287 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get spoiled watching guys like him,'' Jack McKeon, the
Reds' manager, said. ``He has great range, great hands, great
instincts and a strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster, Mike Cameron, performs a similar role in
center field. ``He catches everything in center,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the unexpectedly competitive Reds has been
their relief corps, a group of no-name pitchers who have made
themselves the most effective bullpen in the major leagues. The
Reds would not be where they are without Scott Williamson, Danny
Graves, Gabe White, Scott Sullivan and Dennis Reyes, who among them
had seven years of major league experience when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's 2.72 ERA is the only bullpen ERA in the majors
below 3.00. The .211 batting average the relievers have allowed
opponents is the only average below .225. Their effort has been
season-saving because the Reds' starting pitchers have averaged
only five innings a start, making them the shortest-working
starters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to get it done,'' McKeon said. So the
relievers have had to get the job done. Sullivan, Graves and
Williamson began the weekend with more innings in relief than
anyone in the league except Brian Edmondson of Florida. Williamson,
who in his third year as a professional throws a fastball 96 to 98
mph, leads National League relievers with six victories, and his
1.39 ERA and 54 strikeouts are second.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and McKeon appreciate what the bullpen has done, but they
know they can't expect to get that kind of production for the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our starters to pitch well or we'll burn out the
bullpen,'' Bowden said. ``We could use another starting pitcher or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who is on the disabled list strengthening his left
shoulder, has won no games this season. Brett Tomko, who was
demoted to the minors briefly earlier in the season, has won two
games. The Reds had counted on 15 victories each from Neagle, Tomko
and Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is on the prowl for starters who might be available in
trades but said: ``Thirty clubs can't agree on a salary cap,
revenue sharing, realignment, the designated hitter or Astroturf,
but I found one thing they all agree on. All of them want starting
pitching and none of them wants to trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it will be up to McKeon to navigate the team through
the hazardous waters filled with Diamondbacks and Astros. Trader
Jack noted that the Reds beat each team two out of three in earlier
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure we're not intimidated by them,'' he said.
``It's a good test for us. If we want to stay where we are, we have
to at least split with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Alterations
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine feels he is a marked man, but the Mets' manager
invites scrutiny and retaliation. In the past few weeks, Jack
McKeon, the Cincinnati manager, has questioned Jason Isringhausen's
glove and the shirt Pat Mahomes wore under his uniform, forcing the
Mets to alter the glove and Mahomes to change the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was McKeon's turn in the art of baseball gamesmanship. He
acted after the Mets' grounds crew applied an excessive amount of
water in front of home plate before a game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watered the field down purposely,'' McKeon said, speaking
of Valentine. ``Someone overheard him say it the night before to
the groundskeepers.'' The start of the game was delayed as the
grounds crew, at McKeon's request to the umpires, put down a
substance to soak up the water. ``I was worried about getting
Piazza hurt,'' McKeon said with a straight face, referring to the
Mets' catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken Bids for Return
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken was on the disabled list earlier this season _
recovering from a chronic back ailment, dealing with his father's
death and facing a .179 batting average and five errors in eight
games _ he brushed off suggestions that he was just about finished
as a productive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to arm yourself with your tools and go out there and
find out,'' he said, discussing the ability that might remain.
``Then you'll know yourself. You're being judged in front of all
these people, but nobody can make that judgment except you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others' rush to judgment has suffered a setback. Since his
return from the disabled list, Ripken was hitting .363 (45 for 124)
with 24 RBIS, eight home runs and two errors in 31 games before
Saturday night. His rejuvenated performance will help the Orioles
take an important step with greater ease.
</P>
<P>
   They must decide by July 13 if they want to exercise the $6.3
million option in Ripken's contract for next season or pay him a
$2.5 million buyout. Although club officials have not talked about
their plans, they are prepared to pick up the option.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ripken should play only part time next year, the Orioles
figure they can pay him the high salary for what he has done for
the franchise.

 UNDATED: for the franchise.

<P>
   The Homerless Race
</P>
<P>
   On successive days last week, the race for most times at bat
without a home run underwent a dramatic change. Last Monday, Tony
Womack of Arizona relinquished his lead in the race with a home run
against Ryan Dempster of Florida in his 227th at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier Mike Caruso of the Chicago White Sox, in his 216th
at-bat, hit his first home run of the season against Rick Aguilera
of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Their exit from the race left Luis Castillo of Florida all alone
at the top. Entering Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's games, he had batted 231
times without hitting a home run. Rey Ordonez of the Mets was a
distant second with 193 at-bats, and Kevin Stocker of Tampa Bay was
next at 183.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl probably cannot understand their power problem. The
Milwaukee pitcher has 29 at-bats in his 14 starts, and he has hit
two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Blue Jay! It's Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   Some people might swear that Tony Fernandez stepped into a
telephone booth last Aug. 1, but all he did, really, was move from
second base to third base. Since that day, however, American League
pitchers have suffered from Fernandez's transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Not even balls made of Kryptonite can get him out. ``This is not
a phenomenon this year,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager,
said. ``You go back to last August, when we moved him from second
to third. He didn't have to worry about a lack of range. He seemed
to take off offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   A .282 career hitter for his first 14 years in the majors,
Fernandez was hitting .287 when the month of July ended last year.
The next day he began playing third, and he proceeded to hit .381
in his last 67 games, finishing with a .321 average, just one point
below the career-high .322 he batted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a fairly good hitter,'' Ash said, ``but he's
moved into another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is batting a league-leading .409. When the first phase
of interleague play began June 4, he was hitting .383. In 15 games
since, he has amassed 27 hits in 55 at-bats (.491). Besides
catapulting him beyond .400, his torrid stretch has given Fernandez
a share of Dominican Republic baseball history. His two hits
Saturday gave him 2,177, moving him into a tie with Julio Franco
for most ever by a Dominican native.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work ethic, his concentration and, I think, his comfort
level all play a role in it,'' Ash said of Fernandez's remarkable
late-life improvement as a hitter. ``I've never seen anybody, and I
underline anybody, work like this guy works. Pre- and post-game, he
conditions himself. He sets a work tone second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who turns 37 on June 30, is in his third tour of duty
with Toronto, with which he has spent nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has always been a hard worker,'' Ash added, ``even when
we had him as a youngster. He always had dedication. Everybody
talks about the pressure that comes with hitting .400. He's a guy
who has the ability to shut it out. That doesn't seem to bother
him.''

RUSSIA WINS ROUND ON KOSOVO AID PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Russia, seeking to protect Slobodan
Milosevic's regime, blocked world leaders Saturday from completing
a multibillion-dollar Kosovo rebuilding plan that would have
excluded aid to a Serbia under Milosevic's control.
</P>
<P>
   A final declaration is expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and several of its allies had sought to
include in the document a statement that none of the reconstruction
money for states strained and damaged during NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign would go to Belgrade as long as Milosevic remains
president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin due to arrive here
Sunday for talks with President Clinton, American officials
acknowledged that the Kosovo issue had ``frozen'' US-Moscow
relations but said the focus now was on thawing them. They said the
statement was a consensus document and without the approval of
Russia, an explicit denial of aid to Serbia could not be included.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Yeltsin's visit, his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
quoted him as saying that he was coming to secure Russia's place in
the world, and was in ``a fighting mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said,
``There may be some desire to discuss . . . the events of the past
90 days. But I think the larger thrust here is to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House officials confirmed that the president
and Hillary Rodham Clinton will travel to Macedonia and to a NATO
air base in Aviano, Italy, on Tuesday. The president will meet with
political leaders of Macedonia and Albania, visit a refugee camp
and speak to US military personnel supporting the peacekeeping
effort in Kosovo. At Aviano, Clinton will visit troops that were
involved in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the timing of this year's summit of seven leading
industrial nations and Russia, known as the G-8, the Kosovo issue
has dominated the talks. Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin,
who took Yeltsin's place for the first two days of the meeting, has
shuttled from one meeting to another with Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In a Friday night session with French President Jacques Chirac,
Stepashin said that ``the conduct of one man must not penalize 10
million Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not raise the aid issue for Serbia Saturday
during his meeting with Clinton, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britian are resolutely opposed to economic
aid to Belgrade; the French also appear to be opposed, but US
officials Saturday said they were uncertain whether Germany and
Italy favored withholding aid to Belgrade as part of the aid
package to Kosovo and nations of southeast Europe which suffered
from the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States and the other nations do favor
providing humanitarian assistance to the region through the Red
Cross or the United Nations or some other international agency,
officials said. But they are unclear, at the moment, whether
humanitarian aid would include, for example, restoring electrical
facilities in Serbia knocked out by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that there should be a reconstruction program
for the Balkans, we would very much like it to include Serbia, but
not so long as Serbia is led by an indicted war criminal,'' Berger
said. ``And it's very difficult to imagine a major reconstruction
program in which the countries themselves didn't share the values
of democracy and tolerance and human rights, which were inherent in
the enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the United States and Russia over Kosovo
has ``kind of frozen things,'' Berger said. He said it's been
``kind of an elephant in the room, which makes it difficult _ which
is hard to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As strongly as we felt about Kosovo, I think probably they
felt as strongly that what NATO was doing was wrong, for a whole
series of reasons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia may not have gotten its way on Kosovo, the leaders
here seem poised to reschedule $69 billion of debt run up under
communist governments. Moscow has balked at paying the Soviet-era
debt, which includes money once owed by now-independent republics,
in addition to the huge amounts of financial help it has received
since communism crumbled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also has been the center of talks here among leaders who
have grappled with issues ranging from arms control and
non-proliferation issues to the Moscow's economy, even as US
officials asserted that the positioning to replace Yeltsin in
upcoming elections has affected business with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steinberg, Clinton's deputy national security adviser, said:
``Looking back over Kosovo, the fact that Russia has stayed engaged
with its partners in the West both contributed to the achievement
of peace and now in the implementing of the peace as a result of
the agreement . . . they can go forward. They have a lot of
interests in common.''

DISASTER-PLAN (KANSAS CITY) _ When Congress amended the Clean Air
Act in 1990, it created the new risk-management program, an attempt
to reduce chemical accidents in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal, India,
disaster, which killed almost 4,000 people. As a result, chemical

DADDY-LOVE (KANSAS CITY) _ The night didn't go well, Jesus
``Chucho'' Marquez says, as he prepares to leave the hospital. His
2-year-old son, Gabriel, born severely brain damaged and
quadriplegic, lies motionless. The day before, Gabriel's breathing,
always raspy, had been worrisomely strained, and he was running a
fever. Because of Gabriel's brain damage, the muscles in his throat
work poorly. In February and March, he was in the hospital for 24
days. In April, nine. In May, 10. Now it was June. Concerned,
Chucho and his wife, Elizabeth Uppman, admitted Gabriel to the
hospital for observation. As he always does and, Chucho says, as he
always will, he remained by his son's side. By ERIC ADLER. Two
takes. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
FREE-MAN (KANSAS CITY) _ Dennis Fritz was sentenced in 1988 to life
imprisonment in Oklahoma for a murder he did not commit. In April a
judge dismissed the charges. Now that Fritz is a out of prison, he
is striving to recapture the life he had as a free man. By MALCOLM
GARCIA. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
HEMINGWAY-CELEBRATION (KANSAS CITY) _ For Ernest Hemingway fans,
July will be a month of celebration. July 21 marks the 100th
anniversary of Hemingway's birth, and four events around Kansas

THESING. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
PLANE-SHOW (ST. FRANCIS, Kan.) _ The old Stearman biplanes, almost
as if by magic, appeared out the clouds and washed over the crowd
at the Cheyenne County Airport. What arrived was history,
specifically a footnote to World War II. What people found here was
an old-fashioned county airshow, akin to those gatherings years ago
that brought in farmers from their fields, townsmen from behind
their counters and kids with their dreams. By JIM FISHER. Story

DADDY'S HERE: A BRAIN-DAMAGED CHILD DOES NOT LACK FOR LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   ``The night didn't go well,'' a bleary-eyed Jesus ``Chucho''
Marquez says at 9:20 a.m., as he prepares to leave the hospital and
loops the red backpack he uses as a diaper bag over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He approaches the hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   His 2-year-old son, Gabriel, born severely brain damaged and
quadriplegic, lies motionless on his back and in his diaper on a
crisp, white sheet. Except for his long lashes and soft,
llama-brown eyes, he is a miniature of his dad, hearty and strong,
25 pounds, with a tiny barrel chest, a square likable face and the
dense dark hair of his Mexican ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Gabriel's breathing, always raspy, had been
worrisomely strained, and he was running a fever.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Gabriel's brain damage, the muscles in his throat,
like those of his arms, legs, neck, back and the rest of his body,
work poorly. His esophagus can't always stop mucus or other liquids
from his stomach from filling his lungs. So when a fever rises, the
fear is that he'll develop a dangerous pneumonia. In February and
March, he was in the hospital for 24 days. In April, nine. In May,
10. Now it was June.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned, Chucho and his wife, Elizabeth Uppman, admitted
Gabriel to the hospital for observation. As he always does and,
Chucho says, as he always will, he remained by his son's side.
</P>
<P>
   All night long, getting only three hours of sleep, the
38-year-old Overland Park dad remained near Gabriel's bed in the
pediatric unit at the University of Kansas Medical Center. All
night long, as Gabriel became restless, moaning, his arms, legs and
back stiffening into spastic arches, Chucho lifted him, cradled
him, kissed his temples and spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, Gabriel,'' he would say quieting him to sleep.
``Daddy's here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is,'' Chucho says.
</P>
<P>
   Chucho can't say that he doesn't wish it were different, that
Gabriel weren't so sick. You have children. A son. A daughter. You
want so much for them. Health. Happiness. And you have plans for
yourself and, until parenthood arrives, a notion of how it's going
to be.
</P>
<P>
   When Chucho first saw Elizabeth, he was living in St. Paul,
Minn., having come from Mexico to get his doctorate in plant
breeding at the University of Minnesota. Elizabeth, from Prairie
Village, settled in St. Paul after studying at Carleton College.
They sat near each other in a community choir. They began to chat,
date and, within two months, vowed to marry. In 1991, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth learned Spanish. Chucho finished his degree and, in
1993, they moved to Torreon, Mexico, where Chucho's scientific
career began flourishing. When, in 1994, they had Julia Maria, a
blond-haired, brown-eyed baby so perfect and healthy, she just
confirmed their plan to have more. Three. That was the number.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on May 15, 1997, Gabriel was born.
9:25 a.m.: Chucho, cradling his son like an infant, makes his way
out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Gabriel, time to go,'' Chucho says, relieved that whatever
was causing his boy's fever had passed. This time, no pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he calls to the KU nurses, stepping through
electronic doors that swish open and shut as he passes. If Chucho
hurries, he can get home, take a quick shower, change Gabriel and
get his son to a session of occupational therapy just after 10. He
kisses Gabriel again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outta here,'' he whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Chucho and Elizabeth are past casting blame or trying to discern
what caused their son's brain damage. Did it happen before birth?
During birth? Would it have been different had they been in an
American rather than a Mexican hospital?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter now. Nothing can change the facts: During
Elizabeth's labor, Gabriel's heart rate unexpectedly plummeted. By
the time he was born, his entire body was blue and slack. By the
time doctors revived him, his brain had been deprived of oxygen for
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deal with it,'' Elizabeth said. ``You deal with it OK. You
deal with it badly; then you deal with it OK again.'' But you deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
   All they know, they say, is the only thing they need to know:
Gabriel is their son.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to his brain, they know, is profound. He has the
basic brain functions to survive, but it's unclear how much higher
functioning he possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is unable to walk, his parents carry him. Unable to
eat, he is fed through a tiny tube in his stomach. Though he hears,
it's unclear whether he understands. Though he sees, he is thought
to be cortically blind, meaning the images that record in his mind
may make no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Chucho and Elizabeth stare into their son's brown eyes,
which glint hazel in the sunlight, ``He is in there,'' they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows our voices,'' says Chucho who, with Elizabeth,
refuses to limit his son's possibilities with dire predictions of
the future. When Chucho talks, Gabriel stares. And even if Gabriel
doesn't completely understand who's speaking, what of it?
</P>
<P>
   Chucho knows. He's his father.
9:44 a.m.: Chucho and Gabriel arrive home.
</P>
<P>
   The house is a ranch-style rental that Elizabeth found and chose
because it's close to her parents' place in Prairie Village and
just blocks from the Lee Ann Britain Infant Development Center, the
place Gabriel receives some of his many therapies: occupational;
physical; music; sight; aquatic; early stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing stuff all the time,'' Chucho says.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he strips down straight away and, with Gabriel held
naked in one arm, takes a shower. Out, dressed, - ``We're ready to
roll,'' Chucho says - and at the center by 10:14, occupational
therapist Linda O'Grady works with Gabriel, propped on his father's
lap.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour she massages and moves his joints and limbs to the
left, right, back, forth, side to side. She shows him lighted
objects to see whether he can follow. And, always, she talks to him
or _ as she did to the tune of ``Skip to My Lou' '' _ sings to him,
looking into his eyes for signs of a connection.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Gabriel, how are you?
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Gabriel, how are you?
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Gabriel, how are you?
</P>
<P>
   I'm so glad you're here today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes in here,'' Chucho says, ``he brightens up.''
</P>
<P>
   And, truth is, so does Chucho.
</P>
<P>
   Never did he think this is how his life would turn out. Never
did he think this would be his role. And never, for all the pain,
anxiety and tears that he and Elizabeth have shared, did he think
he would find it so rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   After Gabriel was born, the plan was never for Chucho to give up
his career, cook or clean, do the laundry and care for his son so
completely. In Mexico, where Chucho was raised the eldest of five
brothers, his mother did everything. He and Elizabeth planned that,
for the most part, that would be her role.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to return to Kansas City, where there would be both
family and the kind of progressive therapy Mexico lacked. Chucho
would get a full-time job; Elizabeth might get a part-time job.
They would work it out.
</P>
<P>
   But, instead, Elizabeth got a terrific full-time job as a
technical writer for Tidestone Technologies, a software company in
Overland Park. Since any job Chucho might get in his speciality,
alfalfa breeding, would probably take him out of town and pay no
more than Elizabeth was now making, it made more sense for him to
stay home.
</P>
<P>
   So he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as an opportunity not many fathers have. I was
willing to go for it,'' he says. Although he quickly points out
that what he's doing isn't any better or any different than what
Elizabeth would be doing were she at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't me, it would be her,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he points out, too, that as much as he loves and cares for
his son, what he does is no more special than what thousands of
other parents do for their own special-need children. Although even
the therapists at the Infant Development Center, who see devoted
parents every day, say that in Chucho they see something more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Noon to 12:45 p.m.: Chucho's home, feeding Gabriel a liquid meal
through the tube in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   1- 2:30 p.m.: Back to the Infant Development Center for infant
stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone,'' therapist Jean Kubiak said of Chucho, ``who's
given up his family, his country and his job to come here and take
care of this little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Chucho responds: What else is he supposed to do? Leave?
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought,'' he says, ``has never crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m.: Chucho and Gabriel drive to preschool to pick up
4-year-old Julia. Deadbeat dads. Fathers who bolt on their kids and
responsibilities. Sure, Chucho has known guys like that. His own
father was married three times. Yet, even then, he says, he always
knew where his father was and felt his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Chucho and Elizabeth struggled with the decision
to leave Mexico, it was Chucho's father who gave him advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your kids in the front,'' he told him. ``You follow.''
</P>
<P>
   So he has, amazed at where Gabriel has led him, including, for a
man who once considered himself an atheist, back to God.
</P>
<P>
   3:30 p.m.: Chucho gives Gabriel his medicines. One to help keep
his muscles from tightening, another to regulate his heart rate, a
third to ward off infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say children bring you back to church,'' Chucho says.
``He dragged me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Chucho admits that when Gabriel was first born, he hoped and
prayed to God for a miracle. Mexico is a country with a long
history of magic and mysticism. At times, though he is a scientist,
Chucho even fantasized about taking Gabriel to a medicine man and
pleading with him with to cure his son. But in the last two years,
he says, he has developed a deeper faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning it was like, can God do a miracle?'' he says.
``But now it's like I've got this big guy, God, behind me who loves
my son. That makes me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m.: Chucho begins dinner, hamburgers. He gives Gabriel
another feeding. They watch ``Arthur'' on PBS. Julia waters three
potted pea plants on the patio.
</P>
<P>
   Julia.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hard, when one child needs so much care, not to
forget, Chucho says, that ``at her age, she has a lot of needs,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think she's a little bit jealous,'' he says. ``She used to
get more attention. But we try.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the weekend before, he and Julia went to the park
together, all by themselves, where they played, and looked at rocks
and slugs. Julia rode her bike. They gathered the rocks in a basket
to take home. ``Treasures,'' her mother said, ``that she
gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't done that for a long time,'' Chucho says.
</P>
<P>
   5:30: Elizabeth arrives home. They eat dinner. For an hour it is
a bit easier, until once again, Chucho and Gabriel will head back
to the hospital for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Chucho and Elizabeth can't say what the future holds. It's
possible, they know, that they may forever be caring for Gabriel as
they do now, that he may never significantly improve. Every day,
every month, every year he is in therapy, however, they do believe
he makes tiny improvements: a stretch of the fingers; a smile of
recognition; a steady look of concentration that wordlessly says,
`I see.'
</P>
<P>
   In his dreamiest moments, Chucho looks at his boy with the hope
that one day he'll be healthy enough as an adult to decide, if he
chooses, to live assisted or in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   And should that day never come, Chucho says, that's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be learning his whole life,'' Chucho says. ``I'm
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   7:15 p.m.: Gabriel and Chucho arrive at the KU Medical Center
sleep lab.
</P>
<P>
   When he was sleeping, Gabriel's breathing rate used to slow so
much doctors feared it could further rob him of oxygen, hastening
damage to his brain. They put him on medications that seem to help.
The sleep lab test is to determine how much.
</P>
<P>
   The test continues through the night.
</P>
<P>
   All night long, Daddy's there.
</P>

KANSAS CITY TO CELEBRATE HEMINGWAY'S 100TH BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For Ernest Hemingway fans, July will be a
month of celebration.
</P>
<P>
   July 21 marks the 100th anniversary of Hemingway's birth, and
four events around Kansas City will commemorate the writer
throughout the month.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway moved to Kansas City in the fall of 1917 and spent
seven months as a police reporter for The Kansas City Star. He
returned to the area several times in later years to visit
relatives. Two of his sons were born in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A July 8 presentation by Michael Reynolds, Hemingway biographer
and National Book Award finalist, will begin the celebration.
Reynolds has written about Hemingway for 25 years and will have
copies of his latest book, Hemingway: The Final Years, at his
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The lecture is part of the Kansas City Public Library's Sosland
Series. The Fine Arts Theatre will present a special showing of
movies made from Hemingway's work July 10 and 11. Each screening
will be followed by a discussion.
</P>
<P>
   On July 18, The Kansas City Star will offer a talk on Hemingway
by Mark Zieman, editor and vice president of The Star. The talk
will be followed by a guided tour of landmarks related to
Hemingway's life and work in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration will culminate in a panel discussion and
birthday party July 21. Area writers and educators will debate
Hemingway's influence and achievements.

WORLD WAR II BIPLANES LEND THEMSELVES TO OLD-FASHIONED AIRSHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS, Kan. _ The old Stearman biplanes, almost as if by
magic, appeared out of last weekend's threatening clouds, ethereal
forms until the grumble of their radial engines washed over the
crowd here at the Cheyenne County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   What descended from the low sky was more than metal tubing,
blackened cylinders and goggled aviators in open cockpits. What
arrived was history, specifically a footnote to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For that, St. Francis and its airport just south of town were
ideal _ no concourses reaching to the horizon, no metal detectors
or any of the other annoyances of 1999 flight.
</P>
<P>
   Parking was wherever; 1,000 spectators sat on benches or
sprawled on the damp grass watching not only the Stearmans but also
dozens of other aircraft, hot-air balloons, sky divers and the tiny
ultralights with their shrieking engines.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unreal was that nobody had a hand out for money.
</P>
<P>
   In short, what people found here was an old-fashioned county
airshow, akin to those gatherings years ago that brought in farmers
from their fields, townsmen from behind their counters and kids
with their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   If even on a soggy day St. Francis was perfect, then the seven
Stearmans that came for the 17th annual Cheyenne County Stearman
Fly-In were sublime _ two wings, exposed spars and wires, fixed
landing gear, ugly engines, and garish paint schemes, most
chrome-yellow. The planes appeared closer to a Wright brothers
flying machine than to their sleeker cousins that went in harm's
way 55-plus years ago _ the Mustangs and Marauders, Hellcats and
Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   Outdated even during their production run as aerodynamic design
made a quantum leap forward just before and during the war,
Stearmans were an ugly duckling compared with that conflict's
snazzy fighters and bombers, planes that still draw crowds to big
airshows and attract millions to the endless aviation documentaries
on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stearmans had a special claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every World War II Army, Navy and Marine Corps pilot
learned to fly in one _ those who flew the P-51s that swept the sky
over Europe clean, the C-46 airmen who conquered the Hump, the
teen-agers who strapped themselves into B-17s for near-suicide
missions over Germany, and the young men who burned down Japan with
incendiary bombs dropped from their B-29s.
</P>
<P>
   All that flowed from a simple, Rube Goldberg-type aircraft with
a top speed of 124 miles an hour but with just enough bad habits to
initiate young pilots to the rigors of combat flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have had more here, but just look at this weather
today,'' said Richard Grace of the Grace Flying Service, the fixed
base operator at the airport just south of this town in this far
northwestern corner of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year 17 flew in, which was pretty good for us. Today
there're storms all around, so people have canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Stearman fly-in is on Labor Day in Galesburg, Ill.,
attracting more than 100 of the estimated 2,000 survivors. Between
its introduction in 1934 and the end of production in 1945, 8,584
of the planes were built by the Stearman division of the Boeing Co.
in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Also manufactured then were enough spare parts to build 2,000
more. The average cost of each aircraft _ formally named Kaydet,
for the cadet pilots that would fly them _ was about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Kaydet never caught on. A Stearman is a Stearman.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, where Stearmans show up, stories abound.
</P>
<P>
   Take John Grace, Richard's dad, and founder of the flying
service. In World War II he learned to fly in a Stearman, graduated
into the rakish P-38 Lightning and spent the war flying in the
Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   When John came home, he needed a job. Farmers were beginning to
spray their fields with the host of chemicals developed during the
war. John decided on crop dusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he went to a banker and borrowed $1,500, an awful lot of
money then,'' said his son. ``He bought some equipment, some
chemicals and a war-surplus Stearman for $800. He was in the
spraying business. I think he got $1.95 an acre.''
</P>
<P>
   From that modest investment and an old plane still kept in
impeccable condition by another son, Robert, has emerged a thriving
business, a state-of-the-art flight operations center, several
other planes, hangars, and an annual airshow that draws pilots from
as far away as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free,'' said Richard Grace. ``We don't make a dime off
it. Fact is, we lose money. But that's OK. It's for the town.''
</P>
<P>
   John Grace died in 1997. At the 1998 airshow four Stearmans flew
over the field in formation. Then one peeled off to create the
``Missing Man Formation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nice tribute to John,'' said Gloria Bracelin, who
runs the Chamber of Commerce in St. Francis. ``It was touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracelin said the annual show brings hundreds of visitors to St.
Francis, fills the local trailer park and motels, and means
business for the service stations and restaurants. That, she said,
is no small thing out in a remote part of Kansas that's closer to
Denver or Cheyenne, Wyo., than Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-the-way location and its openness, said Mike Baldwin,
a Stearman owner and pilot here from Evergreen, Colo., make it
perfect for a fly-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it's just visual flight rules to get over here,'' he
said. ``And it's a nice grass strip. How often do you get to do
that anymore? And it's fun. I think people flying now are the last
who are going to have fun with airplanes, you know _ enjoying
flying just for flying's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids these days don't seem really interested. They'll come out
for things like this _ they don't seem to have that fire in their
eyes. There's too much else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the bigger airshows with lots of fancy military hardware
around, such as F-15s and F-117s, Baldwin thinks the little
Stearmans somehow retain a magnetic appeal. Why? Because, he said,
the airplane looks as if anybody _ with a little instruction _
could fly it. Not so the newer aircraft, all computerized and with
a befuddling array of instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stearman's a pussycat once you get up,'' he said. ``But
it's an odd airplane. It's simple, but it handles like a much
bigger airplane. It can be unstable. It has its blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those things were designed into the plane. That's what few
people know. It was a primary trainer not that much different in
handling from a much bigger or higher performance airplane. So when
you got in a B-17 or a Corsair, there were no real surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   John Oshant, 70, formerly of Hays, Kan., but now a resident of
Tucson, Ariz., learned to crop-dust in a Stearman when he was 16
and had no problem becoming an Air Force pilot flying F-84s in
combat during the Korean War. He later flew F-86s and F-100s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great airplane,'' he said. ``But, you know, all of
us missed the boat. Right after the war, they were selling them for
$600 apiece in crates down in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   And the price of a Stearman now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Upper five figures easy, maybe more,'' said Oshant.

ALONE UNDER PAR, STEWART IS ALONE ON LEADER BOARD
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ After another torture test at the U.S. Open,
Payne Stewart was alone at the top Saturday and alone under par.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a final round that will be a test of patience,
pressure and perseverance, Stewart shot a 72 to end the third round
at one-under-par 209 for the tournament, one stroke ahead of Phil
Mickelson and two ahead of Tiger Woods and Tim Herron. David Duval,
Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker were tied for fifth place at two
over par, still very much in contention, while Billy Mayfair (three
over) and Jeff Maggert (four over) still had legitimate hope as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was an overcast day, with occasional rain, Pinehurst
Resort and Country Club's demanding No. 2 course continued to play
tougher than an overcooked steak, and shooting under par was almost
out of the question. Stricker was the only player who did, shooting
a one-under 69 that moved him from a 20th-place tie into striking
range of the lead. But many players sank faster than the Titanic,
unable to keep their approach shots on the sloping greens, unable
to save par and, in some cases, unable to save face.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the U.S. Open was won by someone above par was in
1978, when Andy North won with a one-over 285 at Cherry Hills
Country Club in Englewood, Colo. It would surprise no one if this
year's winner finished over par. After Saturday's round, many
players were just happy to have another round behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing, and the pin placements were borderline
sadistic,'' said Scott Verplank (seven over), who shot a 72
Saturday. ``You knew it was going to be incredibly hard when you
got to the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the contenders had their precarious moments. Woods began
his day with a double-bogey, while Duval shot a 75, including a 40
on the front nine. But good golfers have a way of rising to the
top. Both Duval and Woods, who shot a 72, recovered from early
struggles to shoot even par on the back nine, keeping alive their
chances and refusing to come unglued on a course that can unnerve
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got off to a rough start, but I knew there were a lot of
holes left,'' said Woods, who is trying to win his third
consecutive start, his second major and his first U.S. Open. ``I'm
really proud of the way I hung in there today. It was windy, it was
rainy, it was gusty, it was calm _ we had everything today, very
similar to a British Open. I'm focused and I feel good. My game is
a little bit better than it ever has been. Above all, I just have
to stay patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart found himself in a familiar place. Sunday will be the
third time this decade that he will begin the final round of the
U.S. Open in the lead. In 1991, Stewart won, defeating Scott
Simpson in a playoff. But last year, Stewart took a four-stroke
lead into the final round and lost by one stroke to Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   For Stewart, last year's Open was a potentially devastating
defeat, but he has shown his resiliency, winning this year's Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am and playing some of his best golf at age 42.
</P>
<P>
   Will Stewart win the Open again, as he did in 1991? Or will
another opportunity slip away at the national championship? He
looked ahead with no fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have crawled away and hid after what happened last
year,'' said Stewart, who will play in Sunday's final group. ``Or I
could build on what happened and use it to strengthen myself.
That's the avenue I chose to take.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How fitting would it be for Mickelson to win on Father's Day,
with his wife, Amy, expecting their first child on June 30?
Mickelson's caddie is carrying a beeper in his bag in case
Mickelson's wife goes into labor, and if she does, Mickelson has
vowed he will leave, no matter what. But Mickelson sounded
confident that he would be around Sunday, and confident about his
chances. At one point at No. 10, Mickelson held a three-stroke lead
over Stewart, but Mickelson bogeyed No. 11, No. 15, No. 16 and No.
17 before recovering to end the day with an 8-foot birdie putt at
No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make this my bad day and improve tomorrow, I should
be in good shape,'' said Mickelson, who shot a 73. ``I was sloppy
today and didn't play that well. But I don't think it's that far
away. I'm just a little off.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was worried about his wife going into labor before
Sunday's final round, Mickelson said: ``I just spoke to her and
things are going well. I'm not all that concerned. All the experts
say it should be another week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   If Duval does not win, he will lament shooting 5-over on the
front nine Saturday. It was very unlike Duval, as he hit poor iron
shots and wedge shots, leaving him in places where only a magician
could have saved par.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval righted himself after his bogey at No. 8, ending the
day with 10 consecutive pars. On this course, 10 consecutive pars
was solid golf. And all the contenders knew they had an even more
challenging day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall a whole lot of golf courses more difficult than
this,'' said Duval, the world's No. 1 ranked player, looking for
his first major championship. ``Whoever backs up the least amount
will win.''

A NEW DAY FOR NOMO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideo Nomo's victory this past week over Cleveland,
one of the teams to pass on him after a spring tryout, might be
proof he is back from all those 200-pitch games that ravaged his
arm in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, cut loose by the Mets and Cubs after his trade from the
Dodgers 13 months ago, has been successful with the Milwaukee
Brewers because he finally decided to stop trying to throw a
fastball that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made an adjustment,'' Brewers manager Phil Garner said.
``He's lost a little on his fastball, so he's throwing more
breaking balls early in the count. That's been a successful formula
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo left the Cubs after they insisted he make two more
minor-league starts. Nomo was guaranteed $1 million with Chicago.
He received $250,000 from Milwaukee. As it turned out, the Cubs
would have brought Nomo to the big leagues quickly because Jon
Lieber went on the DL. Instead, rookie Kyle Farnsworth got the
call. &QL; 
MAKING A PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Giants right-hander Mark Gardner entered Wednesday's game
against Colorado 0-5 with an 8.31 ERA. All he did was allow six
hits and two runs in pitching just the 27th complete game at Coors
Field during a 15-2 win. It was his first victory in 11 starts this
season and his first win since Sept. 23 against Pittsburgh. It also
came at a time when the Giants need production from Gardner and
left-hander Shawn Estes to stay close to Arizona. &QL; 
STUNG AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson, who pitched every fifth day
through his first 15 starts, left Monday's 2-0 victory after seven
innings with the stomach flu. The previous Friday he had an MRI
(negative) after reporting soreness in his lower back. He starts
tonight against the Braves on ESPN. With an off day Thursday,
manager Buck Showalter opted to keep his starters in rotation.
Despite their lead in the West, the Diamondbacks already have lost
No.2 starter Todd Stottlemyre to injury and have an unsettled
closer situation. ``I've been pitching a lot of innings. It will
give my back a chance to recoup a little,'' said Johnson, who had
back surgery that cost him most of the 1996 season. &QL; 
NOT SEEING STARS
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of right fielder Brian Jordan, there is not a
Braves position player deserving of All-Star selection. And
perennial All-Stars Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, who have been
named to the past three teams, won't be making the trip to Boston
this year either. Third baseman Chipper Jones, a three-time
All-Star, may be voted a starter by fans, but if Matt Williams is
the top vote-getter at third, Jones may not be selected by Padres
manager Bruce Bochy. Jones hit .309 with 21 homers and 69 RBI in
the first half last season. With 25 games remaining until the
break, his numbers were .287, 14 homers and 40 RBI. &QL; 
CRUNCH TIME
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the Dodgers' messy week was the head injury Pirates
catcher Jason Kendall suffered in the fifth inning Wednesday on a
home plate collision with Gary Sheffield. Two innings and one
strikeout later, he left the game with what a CAT scan revealed as
a severe concussion. The Pirates knew something was wrong with
Kendall when he asked relief pitcher Greg Hansell the same question
three times. Kendall, who reluctantly went to the hospital, told
the Pirates trainer that he didn't remember the collision, who hit
him or whether the call was safe or out. &QL; 
FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   Mets starters are 8-0 with a 2.51 ERA since pitching coach Bob
Apodaca was fired and replaced by Dave Wallace.... The defending
NL-champion Padres are awful, but they have their memories. When
highlights of Kevin Brown's Tuesday-night drubbing by the Pirates
were shown on the right-field scoreboard Wednesday night, the crowd
roared louder than at any point during the Padres' game against the
Phillies.

CHEMICAL PLANTS MUST GIVE GOVERNMENT THEIR DISASTER-CONTROL PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mike Wey doesn't like to imagine the worst.
But now he must.
</P>
<P>
   Wey is director of health, environment and safety at Bayer
Corp.'s large chemical plant in Kansas City's East Bottoms. The
plant is a complex web of pipes and vessels that produce herbicides
and other pesticides used on many food crops.
</P>
<P>
   The government now requires him to envision the most devastating
chemical accident that could occur at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Wey places a transparency on an overhead projector, showing
Bayer's model of such a disaster. On a map of the metropolitan
area, a plume of chlorine vapor more than 14 miles long bubbles
along the Missouri River from the plant toward Missouri City like
an aneurysm ready to pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, we don't think this is likely to occur,'' Wey says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just this type of computer modeling that is attracting
attention around the nation. An estimated 40,000 chemical and other
private and government-owned plants must submit to the federal
government, beginning Monday, new plans on how to deal with
chemical accidents that could occur at their plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the metropolitan area, about 100 plants are expected to file
such plans, area emergency planners say. Bayer, which operates one
of the largest chemical plants in the region, is among them.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, it created the
new risk- management program, an attempt to reduce chemical
accidents in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal, India, disaster, which
killed almost 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The program was among a number of right-to-know laws that
required companies to disclose to the public the emissions of toxic
chemicals, storage of hazardous materials and plans for their safe
handling.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical industry generally has opposed such requirements,
saying they are an unnecessary intrusion. Industry leaders have
advocated voluntary guidelines for safer plant operations.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists want the information made public. They
believe such disclosure will pressure companies to reduce the use
of dangerous chemicals in communities.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of the requirements _ modeling of the worst possible
chemical accidents _ has stirred a debate that focuses on the
balance between the public's right to know and a threat of
terrorism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the Environmental Protection Agency, fearing that
terrorists with overly easy access to the worst-case scenarios
would be better able to plan destructive acts, decided not to make
those plans available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the new risk-management plans will be available on
the Internet, probably this summer. In addition to the modeling of
chemical accidents, the plans include a company's five-year
accident history, any hazard prevention plans, its
emergency-response program and its management systems for
overseeing those programs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Internet will not be used, the EPA still intends
to make public the worst-case accident plans. How they would be
released has not been decided, and environmental activists in
Washington warned last week that a new lobbying effort may
essentially deny public access to the information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, under pressure from
chemical manufacturers, decided last fall not to make available to
the public on the Internet the worst-case accidents such as the one
Wey displayed for the Bayer plant. The agency cited concerns that a
terrorist surfing the Internet could use the worst-case scenarios
to better plan destructive acts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the new risk-management plans will be available on
the Internet, probably this summer. In addition to the modeling of
chemical accidents, the plans include a company's five-year
accident history, any hazard prevention plans, its
emergency-response program and its management systems for
overseeing those programs.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the plans that disclose the worst-case incidents is
supposed to be available from the EPA, but that mechanism still is
unclear. And environmental activists in Washington warned this week
that a new lobbying effort may essentially deny access to the
worst-case information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Orum of the Working Group on Community Right to Know says
legislation has been circulating in Congress that would restrict
the public's access to the worst-case plans, even after federal
officials distribute them to local police and other emergency
officials. Although the Chemical Manufacturers Association stressed
in a public statement Wednesday that it did not want to deny public
access to the worst-case plans, one portion of the proposed
legislation would impose penalties on any officials who released
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a last-ditch effort to restrict the ability of anyone
else from getting this information and disseminating it in any
convenient form,'' Orum said.
</P>
<P>
   This is an important point to activists such as Orum who long to
see reductions in the release and use of hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   They say that making companies disclose the amount and type of
chemicals they emit into the environment or store on site often
persuades them to reduce their emissions and uses of these
chemicals. Orum and others hope the risk- management program will
result in similar reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Sierra Club and the
Working Group on Community Right to Know released a report recently
that criticized chemical plants for not committing to reduce the
hazardous chemicals they're keeping on site.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of 175 chemical plants contacted by the environmental
groups had developed new goals and timetables for reducing their
use of hazardous chemicals, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked chemical companies what they plan to do to reduce
chemical disaster zones in our communities,'' said Allison LaPlante
of the Public Interest Research Group. ``Unfortunately the answer
is nothing, despite the fact that more than 250 Americans die every
year in chemical accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemical industry has maintained that voluntary programs
have been successful in reducing toxic chemical emissions. It
opposes further reductions of chemical usage without some
scientific basis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One upshot of the risk-management programs has been that Bayer
has been forced to make some new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically we haven't been as involved in our community as
we should,'' said Greg Coffey, the Bayer director of public
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   This year the company has been bringing in community members,
neighboring industry representatives and government officials to
show off their risk- management plans, including the worst-case
model.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also gone to community meetings and given
presentations on their emergency response plans and new efforts to
reduce the off-site effects of any future chemical accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer has committed $4.6 million this year to build a new
chlorine containment building. All transfers of chemicals from rail
cars to Bayer pipelines will be done inside that building,
decreasing the possibility of an off-site release.
</P>
<P>
   Wey and Don Leming, Bayer's vice president for manufacturing,
say the actual chemical accident scenarios were ones that the
company already had considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a scientist and engineer, you can't help but wonder: Why do
I have to do this?'' said Wey, explaining the many reasons that a
worst-case accident like the one modeled in Bayer's plan could
never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also given us the opportunity to go out and show
people that this is a safe plant.''

IS RAMON MARTINEZ STILL OF VALUE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ramon Martinez, whose long Los Angeles Dodgers career
ended last July when he underwent reconstructive surgery on his
right shoulder, begins a minor- league rehabilitation assignment
Monday night for the Boston Red Sox Class-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who topped out at 87 mph on the radar gun during a
recent simulated game at Fenway Park, hopes to join the depleted
Sox rotation around the All-Star break. Already this year, Boston
has lost right-handers Mark Portugal and Bret Saberhagen to
injuries and had to move Tim Wakefield to the bullpen when closer
Tom Gordon hurt his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez signed with the Red Sox in the spring after the Dodgers
failed to offer enough guaranteed money. The Dodgers' starting
rotation was set and even had a surplus with Dave Mlicki. Martinez
had torn his rotator cuff in each of the past two seasons and with
the overhaul at the top there was no one to recognize his clubhouse
value with Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Dodgers' staff is ineffective, except for Kevin Brown.
It's almost time to see if Martinez still has value as a pitcher. &QL; 
GOING DEEP
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco entered the weekend needing five home
runs to become the first player in major-league history to hit 30
or more home runs in a single season for four different teams
(Oakland, Texas and Toronto are the others). Teammate Fred McGriff,
who has 16 homers this season, could become the second.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco is the third-fastest AL player this decade to reach 25
homers. It took Canseco 63 games, while Ken Griffey needed only 55
games in 1994 and 56 in 1997. &QL; 
CHANGING SOX
</P>
<P>
   With their recent stretch of good play (winning 11 of 17 through
Tuesday) and a down stretch for the Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox
are thinking playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about catching Cleveland,'' said
right-hander Jaime Navarro, 3-0 with a 3.64 ERA and a consistent
95-96 mph fastball in his past five starts. ``I'm concerned about
getting the wild card. I think that's our goal. We can't worry
about what Cleveland is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trading veterans to contenders, as the Sox did in
1997 and '98, GM Ron Schueler foresees a scenario where he might
trade minor-leaguers for some stretch-run help. Schueler has been
shopping Navarro for at least a year, but now says he's off the
market. &QL; 
MORE STREAKS
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken ended his consecutive game streak last September
at 2,632 games, teammate Albert Belle became baseball's new iron
man. So what happened? Orioles manager Ray Miller became angry at
Belle and benched him last weekend after their dugout blowup. End
of streak, which had reached 392 games.
</P>
<P>
   The longest active streak then fell to Colorado's Vinny
Castilla, who held the distinction for exactly four days before
sitting out Tuesday night's game. The active record came back to
Baltimore and outfielder B.J. Surhoff with 228. At this rate
Surhoff needs to play only every game until 2014 to challenge
Ripken's all-time record. &QL; 
TRADE WINDS
</P>
<P>
   Given his status as one of the game's top players, the team's
chance to reach the playoffs and GM Woody Woodward's general
inability to pull the trigger on trades, Seattle shortstop Alex
Rodriguez is not headed to the Detroit Tigers for Tony Clark,
Justin Thompson and Deivi Cruz. That rumor was burning up the
Internet and talk shows in Detroit this past week....
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would love to bring back Cardinals left-hander
Darren Oliver _ a free agent after the season.... Wilson Alvarez
and Scott Erickson are also available.... The Royals would love to
trade Kevin Appier, but at the steep price of two premium
prospects.

GRASS-ROOTS APPEAL, TAILGATERS AND TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>
   (With SOC-U.S.-DENMARK, SOC-CHINA-SWEDEN) 
(nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They drove in on the shoulder of the
turnpike, past a traffic jam worthy of a Giants game or a Jets
game. Their chartered bus roared past the soccer moms, the soccer
dads, the orange-cone soccer players, the soccer freaks, which was
only right. There would be no game without the talent.
</P>
<P>
   The American players in the bus knew the numbers, the number of
tickets that had been sold, but still that did not prepare them for
the sight of tailgaters filling up the parking lots, hours before a
soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major stadium in the United States,'' said Brandi
Chastain, herself a major soccer player in that country. ``It is
known for its name. People know what happens here. Now soccer will
be remembered here, also.''
</P>
<P>
   They were part of a happening, part of a spectacle, part of an
only-in-America example of marketing. They were part of the largest
crowd ever to see a women's soccer game in history, 78,972, fans,
surpassing the 76,489 who attended the Summer Games final in
Athens, Ga., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a soccer-only crowd,'' Chastain said. ``It wasn't a
corporate, let's-go-to-the-Olympics crowd. These were soccer
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans would see the home team wear down Denmark, 3-0, in the
opening game of the 1999 World Cup, after which Brazil would run it
up over Mexico, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was a tribute to the sales skills of Yank
entrepreneurs, but it was also a sign that something is happening,
that there is an audience for good international soccer, male or
female. Flags sell tickets. National colors sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The American players were here to do business. They have been
waiting for this World Cup since that day in Sweden in June of 1995
_ in front of exactly 2,893 spectators in the Swedish town of
Vasteras _ when they lost to their archrivals, Norway, by 1-0 in
the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans prefer to forget that loss, bury it in the back
yard of their memories, but they all admit it festers there,
something to be avenged, something to be avoided, this time around.
</P>
<P>
   But they know how to ease into the big game. Chastain reported
that the day began with a dance party in the hallway of their
hotel, ``like 12-year-olds at camp,'' and painting their
fingernails in patriotic colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds goofy, but that's what we did,'' Chastain said.
</P>
<P>
   When they got to the stadium, they did not hide behind
sunglasses and a professional game face. They were human enough to
take snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and I saw little clusters of Brazilians,'' said
Briana Scurry, the goalkeeper, talking about the emotional center
of this sport. ``I saw another cluster from Denmark. The rest of
them were for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So they were, all these sport-utility vehicle families from the
Middle Atlantic and northeast states, with their soccer jerseys
displaying American players' names or their own names. (There was
one green jersey with ``Chrebet'' on it; do you think the poor fan
has been stuck in Giants Stadium since Jan. 10?)
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, known to her teammates as Hollywood for her
histrionics and pratfalls on the field, took the time to look up
into this crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually saw two people I know from California,'' Chastain
said. ``Our eyes locked. Just weird.''
</P>
<P>
   She was glad she had made the eye contact because she knew these
people were for her, that most of the 78,972 fans had paid good
money to root for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes your heart beat faster,'' Chastain said. ``You stand
a little taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, who actually lived up to television's craving for one
star, one focus, was raving about the crowd afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played in China, there were big crowds,'' Hamm said,
referring to the 65,000 for the World Cup finals in 1991. ``But I
can't tell you how proud I am of this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans who played in China and Sweden knew the 1999 World
Cup would be a different breed from either of the first two
tournaments. They knew that American marketing would fill up the
stadiums where the professional and college football players
normally cavort.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales were at 460,000 before Saturday's opener, perhaps
heading toward half a million. But when it happened, it was a joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of painted faces, heard a lot of drums,'' said
Marla Messing, the president of the organizing committee. ``To me,
this was a soccer crowd. This is what we were struggling to
achieve. To me, the 1994 World Cup aimed at ethnic groups and men,
but we aimed more for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Messing recalled the grass-roots program, sending mailings to
registered soccer players, ``literally setting up pop-up tents on
soccer fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work paid off Saturday, and will continue as the
talented teams like the Americans and the Brazilians work their way
toward the quarterfinals. The final at the Rose Bowl should draw
close to its 92,000 capacity. Saturday's record for a female soccer
match will probably last only three weeks.

 &HT;    Previewing NHL entry, expansion picks
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The expansion Atlanta Thrashers don't have a coach
yet, but they'll have a lot of players soon. Staff writer Jeff
Schultz offers some answers to a few of the most-asked questions by
Thrashers fans eager for the return of the NHL to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where will the Thrashers get their players?
</P>
<P>
   A: Players will come from four sources: deals such as Friday's
trade with Ottawa, for ``future considerations''; this Friday's
expansion draft; the entry draft Saturday; and free-agent signings,
with players allowed to sign with new teams after July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the expansion draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: The format of the expansion draft has changed since the NHL's
first expanded from six to 12 teams in 1967, but the objective is
the same: to help stock new teams with players from existing teams.
Twenty-six of the exisiting 27 are allowed to protect its core
players. Nashville, as a one-year-old franchise, is exempt from the
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many players can teams protect?
</P>
<P>
   A: Teams can pick from one of two formulas: one goalie, five
defensemen and nine forwards, or two goalies, three defensemen and
seven forwards. At least one defensemen and two forwards exposed
must have played a minimum of 40 games _ regular season and
playoffs _ this season or 70 over the last two. Teams protecting
two goalies must expose a goalie who has played at least 10 games
this year or 25 over the last two. Most teams will pick the
one-goalie formula, preferring not to lose a front-line defenseman
or forward. However, the teams that have two strong goaltenders
must risk losing one in the expansion draft. But teams can lose
only one player each. Also, first- and second-year players and
unsigned draft picks are exempt from the draft. Five teams are
exempt from losing a goaltender because they had one chosen by
Nashville in last year's expansion draft: Rangers, New Jersey,
Montreal, Anaheim and Los Angeles. Therefore, the Thrashers will
pick their goal-
</P>
<P>
   tenders from the other 21 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many goaltenders will the Thrashers draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: General manager Don Waddell must take at least three goalies,
eight defensemen and 13 forwards. But he said he will take the
maximum of five goal-tenders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the Thrashers will get 26 players from the expansion
draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not necessarily. Some teams might not have players fitting
the Thrashers' needs. Waddell has several options, including
``drafting'' an unrestricted free agent from a team's unprotected
list. If the player then signs with another team, even his original
club, Atlanta will receive a compensatory draft pick from the NHL.
For example, Nashville drafted Rangers free-agent goalie Mike
Richter, who then re-signed with New York. The Predators never had
any intention of signing Richter, who had expressed an interest in
remaining in New York. Signed players acquired in the expansion
draft also can be traded. The Predators stockpiled several draft
picks with trades.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the entry draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is the NHL's equivalent of the college or amateur drafts
in football, basketball and baseball. But it's a large pool of
players, including Canadian junior leagues, U.S. colleges and
European leagues. The draft is nine rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the Thrashers pick?
</P>
<P>
   A: They will pick second in every round, behind Tampa Bay, which
finished last in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the best players in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: The consensus top players this year are forwards, and all are
European natives, which is unusual: Patrik Stefan and Pavel Brendl
of the Czech Republic and twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Thrashers' first draft pick play for them next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe not. Hockey's draft is similar to baseball's in that
the players are young _ usually 18 or 19 _ and not yet ready
physically or mentally to compete in the NHL. The lone exception in
this draft might be Stefan, who has been competing as an amateur
for the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs against older, stronger players.
Scouts believe Stefan can step right in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Thrashers draft him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Possibly. Stefan suffered at least two concussions last
season, and there is uncertainty about any lingering effects. Also,
Tampa Bay might take Stefan first. Brendl probably is a year away
from playing in the NHL and the Sedins two years.

 &HT;    Isles trade machinations nixed
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _As Gary Bettman was attempting to enjoy the
Stanley Cup finals this past week, the NHL's second-most
embarrassing franchise (it's hard to top a team in bankruptcy)
continued to stick to the NHL commissioner like a fungus.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Islanders, who have been attempting to slash their
team payroll to roughly the cost equivalent of a Happy Meal, put
star forward Ziggy Palffy on the market. The crosstown Rangers, not
the Isles' usual trade partner, responded with a strong offer of
Niklas Sundstrom, Todd Harvey, the 11th pick in the draft, a
prospect and $2.5 million for Palffy and Rich Pilon.
</P>
<P>
   The teams agreed on the deal. Then Islanders owners Howard
Milstein and Steve Gluckstern decided to get cute.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing to the deal, the Islanders tried to squeeze
Cablevision _ which has financial ties to both New York teams _
into juicing up its television deal with the team. They also
wouldn't mind if the company lent a hand (or a wallet) in the
team's quest for a new arena. Cablevision's motivation for
agreeing: Palffy in Manhattan would be a hot property.
</P>
<P>
   But Cablevision balked, the Islanders started holding trade
talks with Los Angeles, the Rangers fumed and now Bettman has
stepped in and demanded that no deal involve any cash, for fear of
it looking like the Isles are merely selling off players.
</P>
<P>
   NHL vice president Colin Campbell, a former Rangers executive,
has been watching over the mess for Bettman. ``All I'm doing for
Gary is giving my humble analysis of the hockey aspects of the
trade,'' Campbell said. ``A couple of times we've had some
discussions, but Gary is wrestling with the bigger picture. There's
responsibility and accountability for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more unexpected than the Phoenix Coyotes' hiring
of Bobby Francis as coach was the Los Angeles Kings' selection of
Andy Murray. Murray has been an assistant for three NHL teams but
is known mostly for his coaching internationally and for the
Canadian national team _ at least, for those who know him at all.
Kings defenseman Rob Blake, who played for Murray in Canada, gave
him a strong recommendation to general manager Dave Taylor.
``Nobody should be surprised,'' Taylor said when asked about being
criticized for the hiring. ``In L.A. a lot of people aren't aware
of who the good coaches are. It's not a traditional hockey market.
A lot of people might say, `Andy Murray, who's that?' But if you
look at his resume and talk to people about him, you can't help but
be impressed.''... Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said he was
impressed with Francis, a Boston assistant, in interviews ``and I'm
not an easy guy to impress. Any time you hire a new coach, it's a
risk. But I like his approach, his intellect and his understanding
of the game.'' Francis is the son of former long-time NHL coach and
general manager Emile Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate (Part III)
</P>
<P>
   Orlando International Hockey League coach Curt Fraser, who
interviewed in Atlanta with Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
last week, doesn't believe his lack of coaching experience in the
NHL should be a handicap. Fraser played 12 years in the league,
then coached four years with Milwaukee of the IHL (two as an
assistant, two as a head coach), one in Syracuse and four in
Orlando (where was hired by Waddell). ``This has been a great
training ground,'' Fraser said. ``We've been an independent team so
we've covered the spectrum with players, from 20-year-olds to
35-year-olds. We've had winning teams every year. Atlanta is
starting with a clean slate. I feel I can grow with the
organization. I've already gone through a lot of growing pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Penguins bailout
</P>
<P>
   Mario Lemieux has enlisted singer Celine Dion among his
potential investors in the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins. Dion is
not from Pittsburgh but she speaks French and is wealthy, like
Lemieux.... The Washington Capitals may leave defenseman Dmitri
Mironov exposed in the Thrashers' expansion draft. But Mironov has
three years left on a deal that averages $2.875 million per
year.... Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix said he will speak
with Theo Fleury's agent before the free agency period begins July
1 but he would not say how interested he was in keeping the player.
Fleury went scoreless in the Western Conference finals loss to
Dallas.... Detroit defenseman Niklas Lidstrom said it will be at
least three weeks before he decides whether to re-sign with the Red
Wings or return to his native Sweden. Meanwhile, Wings general
manager Ken Holland has other problems. His offers of one-year
extensions have not been embraced by assistant coaches Dave Lewis
and Barry Smith, who want more security in case Scotty Bowman calls
it quits after next season. Holland is exploring the possibility of
two-year offers.... Bobby Carpenter, who has had an 18-year career
but never quite matched the expectations set up by a Sports
Illustrated cover story proclaiming him hockey's next great player,
might retire and go into coaching. New Jersey already has told him
he won't be invited back.

 &HT;    For Thrashers, drafts a whirl of deal-making
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Nashville Predators general manager David Poile
watched with amusement as Don Waddell moved from one area of a
hotel meeting room to another, wading through a sea of NHL
executives and media members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just follow Don around _ he can't go 10 feet without somebody
wanting to talk to him,'' Poile said after a recent general
managers meeting. ``That's the way it was for me last year. Now
nobody wants to talk to me; I can't help anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As general manager of the expansion Thrashers, Waddell is
holding all the cards these days. ``Let's see what we're holding
when we're all done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With the NHL expansion draft coming up Friday and the entry
draft a day after, Waddell's decisions on how best to shape this
franchise will be linked to deals or nondeals with 26 other clubs.
The only general manager on the outside is Poile, whose Predators
went through this process last year and are exempt from this year's
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to talk to you for whatever reason,'' Poile
said, ``either to ask who you're going to take from them, or to
tell you who'd they like you to take, or to tell you they don't
want to lose a certain player. Then it becomes, `Can we entice you
to take somebody else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Each team is allowed to submit a list of protected players,
choosing one of two options _ either one goalie, five defensemen
and nine forwards or two goalies, three defensemen and seven
forwards. The Thrashers will pick from the leftovers. But
sometimes, teams will persuade expansion teams to stay away from a
top young player, particularly a goalie, by making side deals with
them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Predators secured extra draft picks and players
from Los Angeles for not drafting goalie Jamie Storr and from St.
Louis for not taking goalie Jamie McLennan. Overall, they made
eight transactions on the day of the expansion draft. Some deals
are announced as involving ``future considerations,'' when in fact
they are ``past.'' Poile used his leverage to stockpile picks and
will have eight in the first three rounds of Saturday's entry
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' strategy will differ slightly, but the process
has been every bit as crazy for Waddell as it was for Poile. He
receives approximately 30 telephone calls a day about trades or
coaching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having conversations with 17 or 18 teams that are looking
to do things,'' Waddell said. ``We'll look at everything. Chances
are we're going to do things a little different from Nashville.
We're not looking to stockpile draft picks. But we are looking to
build the franchise the best way possible. . . . I anticipate
(this) week to be very, very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup finals have been bad for the Thrashers because
protected lists do not have to be confirmed until 48 hours after
the final game. If the series had ended earlier, Waddell would have
had more time to study the available players.
</P>
<P>
   But going into the weekend, this is what Waddell was looking at:
If Dallas and Buffalo played six games, all teams had until 5 p.m.
today to complete trades and until noon Monday to submit protected
lists. On a seven-game series, the trade deadline would be 2 p.m.
Wednesday, with the lists due at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything until we get the lists and we see who's
available,'' Waddell said. ``I can't tell a team, `Don't worry, I
won't take your goalie,' if I can't be sure the goalie I want from
another team isn't there. Once we get the list, then I'll have
something to work with. I'll know what my leverage is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Waddell would have committed to early deals, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only makes sense for me to wait as long as possible,'' he
said. ``The price will only go up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' scouting department already has done 12 mock
drafts, Waddell said, ``and I've probably done 50, because every
time I get on a plane I do another one. I haven't gotten to 100
(total) goals yet (among potential picks), though. Ninety-seven is
the record so far. My guess is our goal-scorers will have to come
from the entry draft or potentially some European players,'' signed
as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the expansion draft is goaltending. The Thrashers
have gotten a jump in that area by trading for Ottawa's Damian
Rhodes, who probably will be their starter. But Waddell still is
likely to spend the maximum of five expansion picks on goalies.
Detroit's touted backup, Norm Maracle, is among those likely to be
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft will take only about 10 minutes, because the
Thrashers are the only team in the expansion draft. All that
happens is that Waddell submits his list of players.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur draft, involving 27 teams for nine rounds, is an
all-day affair. Atlanta will pick second in each round, and Waddell
said it's extremely doubtful he will move up to the top spot --
occupied by Tampa Bay -- or down, although he has received several
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to start giving away draft picks and making
trades, that could make us really competitive right now,'' Waddell
said. ``But what's that do for us four or five years from now? If
we keep our draft picks, make good picks and build through it,
there's no reason we can't get good and keep it going for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Poile said there was only one thing he didn't enjoy about
Nashville's starting point: ``I wish there were better players
available in the expansion draft.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said, ``It was a neat thing. The one thing I've
talked to Don about is, you're starting something brand new. It's
your design. It's your team.''

 &HT;    78,972 join U.S. party in 3-0 win over Danes
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Pardon the U.S. women's soccer team for
indulging in an unusual post-match celebration after their
convincing 3-0 win over Denmark Saturday to open the Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For a no-nonsense team focused solidly on the bottom line _
nothing less than the championship on July 10 at the Rose Bowl _
the American players weren't above rejoicing on this historic
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   As they took laps around the Giants Stadium field, they
applauded and waved to a world-record women's soccer crowd of
78,972, a number that almost certainly will be surpassed _ as long
as they're in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we dreamed a World Cup should be,'' said forward
Mia Hamm, who had a goal and an assist before coming out with
cramps late in the game. ``We could hear each other but we couldn't
hear from one side of the field to the other. That's the kind of
noise we wanted to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. admitted to having butterflies in the opening
minutes, when the gritty Danes got their best scoring chances and
hammered them with a physical game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little bit nervous the first 20 minutes,'' said U.S.
goalkeeper Briana Scurry, who had the wind knocked out of her in a
mid-air collision with Denmark's Lene Jensen in the first half.
``They came at us with all they had. We knew it was going to be
that kind of match.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the Americans have done plenty of times before, they
simply wore down Denmark, which was outshot 24-9 and 15-4 in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which plays Nigeria Thursday at Chicago's Soldier
Field, still showed some defensive lapses that have been a concern
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted with the win, but can't get too overjoyed
here,'' said U.S. coach Tony DiCicco, who was trying to calm
himself down afterward. ``It's going to be a long road for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second minute of play, Lene Jensen found Gitte Krogh up
the middle with plenty of space, and she pulled out wide to unfurl
a cross that bounced through the goal mouth before a U.S. defender
could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 minutes gone, Jensen jumped for a long ball in the box,
her shoulder spearing Scurry in the stomach, but Denmark could not
reorganize to get a clear shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was loose and I was still down,'' Scurry said. ``I
don't even know if they had the ball or not.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scurry was gaining her equilibrium, Hamm soon found
operating room down the flank, and when Brandi Chastain served up a
high diagonal pass from the back in the 18th minute, the crowd rose
in anticipation. Hamm neatly brought down the deflected ball with
her right leg, and in a singluar motion whipped it high into the
net for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying to myself, `are you freaking kidding me?' ''
Hamm said. ``I never score goals like that. That's something that
Michelle Akers does.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Hamm set up the goal that signaled the
demise of the Danes by lacing a cross across the box to Julie
Foudy, who knocked home the shot with her left foot in the 74th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, DiCicco had pulled Kristine Lilly up front and
dropped Cindy Parlow back into midfield to turn up the pressure
even more. And the creative, left-footed Lilly quickly began
wreaking havoc. She uncorked an open shot that hit the crossbar and
then took a touch pass from Parlow and was all alone with only
Larsen to beat before sliding it wide of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Her Danish marker derisively whispered in her ear, ``Nice try,''
but Lilly exacted some sweet revenge. With a minute remaining, she
worked the right edge of the box, took a couple of dribbles to her
left and curled a hummer into the far corner of the net. And she
pointed toward the beaten Jeanne Axelsen while dancing
triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted that one to be for her,'' Lilly said.

 &HT;    `Amazing' atmosphere for opener
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Briana Scurry was sprawling at the edge
of the penalty box, feeling the full force of a Danish shoulder in
her upper torso.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough that the U.S. goalkeeper was feeling the same
nerves as her teammates in the early moments of their World Cup
opening match with Denmark that drew a women's soccer world record
attendance of 78,972.
</P>
<P>
   But with no score in the game and the Danes exerting strong
early pressure, Scurry didn't hesitate to challenge forward Lene
Jensen, who was nowhere near the ball when they collided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her entire body just went into me. I felt everything,'' Scurry
said. ``But especially I felt her shoulder going into my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark wasn't able to put together even two passes amid that
choas, and three minutes later the U.S. team got on the board first
with a Mia Hamm goal that seemed to loosen up the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of big crowds is not unusual for the U.S. team,
but the hype that has accompanied the World Cup has been
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole environment was just amazing,'' said midfielder
Kristine Lilly, who capped the 3-0 win with a goal in the final
minute of the game. ``I hope this game is going to have a snowball
effect throughout the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the kind of battering Scurry took is indicative of what the
U.S. team can expect the rest of the way, especially as they get
ready to face Nigeria and North Korea next week in their final two
group matches. Both are opponents the U.S. team has never met
before, and the Americans say they're taking no one for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough tournament, we know that,'' Scurry
said. ``Teams that usually roll over when we play them aren't going
to roll over in this tournament. They're very proud to be playing
on this big stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Glad to be invited
</P>
<P>
   All week long, Denmark coach Jorgen Hvidemose and his players
were good sports about being put in the role of playing the U.S. in
the opener. Even after being dominated on Saturday, he couldn't be
disappointed with being part of the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied,'' he said. ``We were a part of the party. We
created some chances and should have scored a goal or two. But it's
important for us to get some progress out of this match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really big game for everybody. Even Mia Hamm had
admitted she was nervous in front of this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Teeny-bopper crowd
</P>
<P>
   In case there was any question about the main target audience
for this World Cup, the entertainment acts in the pre-game
ceremonies were known mainly to teenagers: Bwitched, Billie and
N'Sync.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful audience fidgeted afterward while bigwigs with
suits took the microphones, ranging from FIFA president Sepp
Blatter to United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan.

HAMM HANDLES HYPE AND AMERICANS' HIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J._ She is the face of women's soccer, the
player the young girls squeal for, the one personality who has
pushed through the glass ceiling of invisibility in a sport still
trying to broaden its appeal beyond the weekend fields of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   For the Women's World Cup to succeed, in many ways, Mia Hamm has
to succeed. She is the one person anybody knows, if they know
anything about women's soccer. The largest audience ever to watch a
women's sporting event in the United States came to see Hamm
Saturday and she did not disappoint them, scoring a goal and
assisting on another as the Americans defeated Denmark, 3-0, in the
opener before a crowd of 78,972 at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is the poster girl for this World Cup, the one featured in
the television commercials, the newspaper and magazine stories, the
broadcast profiles. It is her No. 9 jersey that is sold at the
concession stands. In truth, she had not played at her best in
previous important tournaments, but Saturday she turned the hype
into an accurate forecast.
</P>
<P>
   While her teammates seemed tight and nervous at the beginning,
Hamm attacked immediately and threatened to score, or put someone
else in position to score, nearly every time she touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for her to get off quickly, because our team
didn't get off quickly,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. ``She looked
dangerous every time she got the ball, and it had a soothing effect
on our team. She wanted the responsibility, she wanted the ball.
Mia was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark drilled a shot across the goal mouth in the second
minute and American goalkeeper Briana Scurry, still woozy from a
freight-train collision in front of the net, smothered another ball
in the 15th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes were winning balls in the air at midfield and the
American defense found itself in unaccustomed retreat. On attack,
passes were being made too soon or were erratically placed. The
United States needed a play, a goal, a galvanizing moment, to
settle itself, and Hamm provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Her first meaningful touch came in the 17th minute, and she did
not waste the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a long diagonal pass from Brandi Chastain with her right
foot in the penalty area, Hamm slashed to her left and tried to
chip the ball over Katrine Pedersen, the Danish defender. The ball
hit Pedersen in the chest, but Hamm pounced on it and blasted a
left-footed shot from 13 yards over the head of goalkeeper Dorthe
Larsen. With this bit of brilliant improvisation, the Americans had
a 1-0 lead and the confidence that more goals would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Hamm kept telling herself as she
sprinted upfield in celebration. ``I don't score goals like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a burden on Hamm, but also unprecedented opportunity,
in this World Cup. While she has scored more international goals _
110 _ than any man or woman ever to play the sport, the beauty of
her game is its completeness.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is a selfless passer and a willing defender. She kept
sending balls into the penalty area for Kristine Lilly and Cindy
Parlow, and even when they could not catch up to them, or place
them in the back of the net, Hamm kept serving them up again as if
this were Wimbledon instead of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the 73rd minute, Hamm punched a hard cross from the
right flank and midfielder Julie Foudy connected. Gathering the
ball with her left foot, Foudy clipped the underside of the
crossbar, and the Americans pulled ahead by 2-0. The team's comic
relief, Foudy then tossed up her arm and leg, striking a pose out
of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Danish defense could not stop Hamm Saturday, cramping
hamstring muscles finally forced her to leave the game in the 88th
minute. A minute later, Lilly, who moved from midfield to forward
in the second half, drilled a shot from the top of the penalty area
to give the United States its final margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goals help your confidence,'' Hamm said of the expectations
placed on her for the tournament. ``As a front-runner, that's one
of your responsibilities. To be able to do it in the first game
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hamm's presence, there were long dull stretches in the
game, and in the end, it may have served a greater purpose as a
cultural experience than an attractive athletic event. Only one
previous match _ the gold-medal soccer game at the 1996 Summer
Olympics, which drew 76,489 for the American victory over China _
rivaled Saturday's game in terms of attendance for a women's
sporting event in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was largely composed of soccer moms and dads, and
teen-age and pre-teen girls, a number of whom had their faces
painted red, white and blue and who wore a replica of Hamm's
jersey. One teen-ager was spotted reading Hamm's autobiography in
the parking lot before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She reminds us of what we can be if we keep our heads on
straight,'' said another of her fans, Kim Johnston, 18, of
Edmeston, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The American players got into the star-spangled spirit by
painting their fingernails and toenails alternately red and blue,
and they had an impromptu dance party before leaving the team
hotel. ``This is what happens when you have a lot of time on your
hands,'' Hamm said. It took her calm assertiveness to channel this
nervous excitement into useful soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was unbelievable,'' said Hamm, who was too fatigued
to join her teammates in a victory lap. ``It was a very proud
moment. We could hear each other, but we couldn't hear side to
side. This is what we always dreamed a World Cup should be.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Love affair with No. 2 ends badly
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Well, so much for that romance. A rift has
come between the golf pros of the world and Pinehurst No. 2, the
course once beloved, now reviled. It was ``the greatest U.S. Open
course'' he had ever seen, Greg Norman had said. He shot 151,
11-over par and was gone. Davis Love III loved it, professed his
undying devotion to it. Colin Montgomerie, the fleshy one, said
that this was the kind of course that just might be right for the
Europeans to break their long losing streak in the U.S. Open.
Donald Ross, who created it, would have been taking bows, had he
not been dead since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the cut at 36 holes. Jason Tyska, Spike McRoy, David
Lebeck, Geoffrey Sisk, Esteban Toledo and Kaname Yokoo made it.
Jack Nicklaus, Curtis Strange, Fuzzy Zoeller, Ernie Els and Steve
Jones didn't. What they have in common is, they are all former
champions. Lebeck has never played in an official tournament
before. Yokoo is the mystery player from Japan. McRoy has collected
$6,120 on the Nike Tour this year. The others are of equal
anonymity. That's the treachery of U.S. Open courses, seldom ever
praised before the 99th event reached this revered, storied old
course, with its shorn greens.
</P>
<P>
   As play began Saturday, there wasn't a European name on the
leaderboard. As twilight fell across the Sandhills, only one name
was in red numbers, and Phil Mickelson's reign was numbered. The
mourners' band was back in fine tune, as is usual at such places as
Olympic, Oakmont, Oakland Hills, Baltusrol, where the grass grows
high.
</P>
<P>
   One player, reflecting the frustration of the day, said,
``Personally, I prefer high rough.'' Tom Lehman said it after a
round of 73, his best of the week. Now he tells them.
</P>
<P>
   The horror stories coming in off the course sounded like reports
from a war zone. The wind had puffed up. The sun had taken the day
off. The skies spit a mist of rain, but the greens were still as
slick as glacial ice. Pin placements came in for the most damning
tirade, this reflecting the annual common displeasure with the
blue-jacketed gentlemen sportsmen of the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pin placements were borderline sadistic,'' Scott Verplank
said, though he had just come in at 72, his best round of the week,
with four birdies. This contradicted John Cook (77) who said, ``A
birdie today is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Lehman again, who will not be in the final pairing for
a fifth year. ``This makes Augusta look tame.''
</P>
<P>
   Then John Cook. ``If anyone shoots even par today, it will be
the round of the year.'' There were two, and Steve Stricker had to
hole a fairway bunker shot for eagle on the third hole to check in
with a 69. Tim Herron had an even 70.
</P>
<P>
   Players were wild-eyed and shaken. They cursed the USGA under
their breath, but all in all, it sounded like just another third
day at another U.S. Open. When there's no one else to blame,
there's always the financiers, the industrialists, the tycoons, the
elderly officials of the USGA. But can they be blamed for missed
three-foot putts, for sprayed tee shots that startle the squirrels?
And have you ever seen as many putts left short by men who should
be good at this game?
</P>
<P>
   We check in now with Lee Janzen, 13-over-par and no threat to
defend the title he won in San Francisco last year. ``I've been
asked many times what was the hardest golf course I ever played,''
he said. ``Now I have the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dreadful day for all concerned, except Pinehurst No. 2.
It defended its honor righteously. By end of the day, Payne Stewart
had the one red figure left on the board, 1-under-par. ``These guys
are good,'' the TV promo, was in serious jeopardy. The three who
began the day in the lead, Mickelson, David Duval and Stewart had
been separated and spread about the board. It had been, as the most
outspoken had said, a pretty horrid day on No. 2, except for
Stewart, who once again had the lead going into the final 18 holes,
as in San Francisco a year ago.

 &HT;    Stricker's 1-under 69 gives him a title shot
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Steve Stricker's 1-under-par 69 was nothing
short of a masterpiece Saturday at Pinehurst No. 2, but look at the
necessary ingredients. Stricker jumped from 3 over par to even-par
in two holes by draining a 45-foot putt for birdie at No. 2 and
then holing out from a fairway bunker at No. 3 for eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Using the rare scoring flurry to move into contention in the
U.S. Open, Sticker, the only golfer under par, finished the third
round at 2-over 212.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel OK,'' said Stricker, runner-up to Vijay Singh in last
year's PGA Championship. ``I've been in this position a few times.
I learned a lot from last year. ... I'm in good position. I need to
come out and put up another one of those (69's) or better
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker's bunker shot came from 137 yards with an 8-iron,
erasing the irritation of a badly pulled drive at the 335-yard par
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a perfect yardage for me,'' Stricker said. ``I
wasn't able to see it go in the hole, but the crowd just kept
getting louder and louder and I knew it was in.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day was less celebratory for Stricker, who tied for
fifth last year at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' he said. ``You have to be careful not
to chip it or putt it off the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ripping it
</P>
<P>
   Never much for practice range time, John Daly usually at least
makes an appearance. Not so prior to Saturday's third round. Daly
hit no practice balls prior to his 11:45 a.m. pairing with Steve
Pate. Unfazed, he boomed a huge draw off the first tee, but maybe
it caught up with him later as Daly shot an 81. ... When Tom
Watson, who turns 50 on Sept. 4, made the cut Friday, it created
his first weekend appearance in a major in his last seven tries.
... Greg Norman, after missing the cut Friday with rounds of 73-78:
``It's a bit of a horror story for me right now. I'm in a video
store picking out all of the bad movies instead of the good ones.''
Asked how many greens hit, Norman said, ``I probably hit 12, but I
only stayed on two.''... A kid ran up to Curtis Strange after the
first round and said: ``Mr. Nicklaus, may I have your
autograph?''... Ernie Els, with wins in 1994 and 1997, had missed
only one cut prior to Friday, in 1995 at Shinnecock.
</P>
<P>
   Angry young men
</P>
<P>
   When Jose Maria Olazabal punched his hotel wall Thursday night,
breaking a bone in his right hand and knocking him out of the
tournament, it prompted inquiries to other players about things
they've done when angry about their games. Said Phil Mickelson, ``I
used to have to buy my clubs if I ever broke them, so I learned not
to break them. I can't imagine trying to break a bone over it, it
doesn't make sense, let alone a club.'' David Duval said, ``I had a
putter about three years ago where I grabbed one end and grabbed
the other and just broke it. It was the putter; it just wasn't
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst again?
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of a return to Pinehurst No. 2 for the 2004 U.S.
Open, but Saturday wasn't the ideal day to bring up the subject
after windy conditions made hitting the hardening, crowned greens
even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 41 then,'' said Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who
cherished the 74 he shot Saturday. ``I might have retired.'' Of his
quest to win a major, Montgomerie immediately began looking forward
to the the British Open at Carnoustie next month (he holds the
course record there with a 64) and the PGA Championship at Medinah
in August. ``I'm getting on a bit,'' he said. ``I'll take any of
them now. I'm 36 next week. I'm running out of time. I'm not proud.
I'll take any of them.''

 &HT;    Stewart leads by 1, but pack chasing
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ If this sounds familiar, it's understandable.
Payne Stewart has the 54-hole lead in the U.S. Open for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking a 15-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole Saturday, the
42-year-old Stewart shot a 2-over-par 72 to grab a one-stroke lead
at 1-under-par 209 over Phil Mickelson entering today's final round
at treasured but treacherous Pinehurst No. 2
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson stroked in a 6-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole to
crawl even with Stewart, then watched the 1991 champion sink his
for the sole lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who shot a final-round 74 last year and lost to Lee
Janzen, is the only player under par for the tournament. No. 2
became a nightmarish test Saturday when winds kicked up, making par
not just a good score, but a great one. With greens hardening, it
was commonplace to see chip shots rolling back to one's feet or
approach shots tumbling off the back of the putting surface.
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes back at 1-over 211 are Tiger Woods, who recovered
nicely after a double bogey at the first hole, for a 72; and Tim
Herron, who managed an enviable par 70.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 75, second-round co-leader David Duval is still in
prime shape, just three shots back at 2-over 212 and tied with
Steve Stricker, whose 69 was the only sub-par round recorded; and
PGA champion Vijay Singh (73).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked many times what the hardest golf course is
that I ever played,'' said Janzen. ``Now I have the answer.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A COURSE WITH A DIFFERENT FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to update with Saturday's third round.) 
 (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinehurst, N.C. _ After Lee Janzen trudged off the 18th green
Saturday with a 76 for a 13-over-par total of 223, he put Pinehurst
No. 2 in perspective as well as on a pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked many times what's the hardest course I've ever
played,'' Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champion, said. ``Now I have
an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   So might all the other golfers in this U.S. Open with a
different look. Approach shots scooting off the sloping turtleback
greens into grassy hollows, then the world's best golfers trying to
hit delicate chip shots close to the hole if they are to save par.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often the chip is too delicate or too firm, and the
ball slides back or skids away as if the golfer were playing
miniature golf and had missed the clown's nose.
</P>
<P>
   In most Opens, the look has usually been that of a pro slashing
his ball out of rough deep enough to hide his shoes. Or his ball
plopping into a pond. Or a putt sliding past. But whatever the pros
do or don't do in Sunday's final round, they will create instant
Open lore here in the Sandhills where the pines stand tall.
</P>
<P>
   In other years the Open has usually been blessed with the memory
of what happened before at that year's course. How Jack Nicklaus
won at Baltusrol or Pebble Beach. How Ben Hogan won at Merion or
Oakland Hills. How Bobby Jones won at Winged Foot or Interlachen.
How Arnold Palmer won at Cherry Hills, or how he lost at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   But however the winner wins in Sunday's final round, it will be
unique to Pinehurst No. 2, no relation to any other Open anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   And with two par-3 holes among Pinehurst No. 2's final four
holes, the finish will be different from that on any of the usual
Open courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different,'' said Payne Stewart, the 1991 Open champion
at Hazeltine and the runner-up last year at Olympic, referring to
the two short holes. ``Then you've got a par-5, I mean a par-4,
that you play in between those two par-3's.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who birdied the 18th Saturday for a 72 and 209 to
snatch a one-stroke lead going into Sunday's final round, was
referring to the 489-yard 16th, the longest par-4 in Open history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stand there on the tee at 15 and 17,'' said Stewart, who
parred both of the par-3's Saturday, ``and you think, `I've got a
par-3, it's going to be easy.' You've still got to hit the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And each tee shot must be precise. The 15th hole is 202 yards to
a severe turtleback green with two gaping bunkers on the right. The
17th is 191 yards with a somewhat flatter green but with swales
that funnel an imprecise tee shot into any of five surrounding
bunkers _ one to the left, one to the rear right and three on the
front right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15th is not easy,'' Tiger Woods said. ``Friday it was
gusty and I ripped a 5-iron and didn't get there. And the 17th is
probably the easiest of the par-3's here because at least you have
some room to hit to.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the dreaded 18th awaits: 446 yards slightly uphill, its
fairway left to right. For other PGA Tour and amateur events here
in the past, the traditional Sunday hole location on the par-4 has
been rear left.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first round on 18,'' said Stewart, ``I drove it in the
left rough and hit a really good 6-iron out of there and it ran up
on the front of the green and then it came back off the green, like
it's supposed to do. And then I just didn't hit my first putt hard
enough from the collar.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 the Atlanta Athletic Club had a similar 3-4-3-4 finish.
With a birdie 2 at the 15th and a birdie 3 at the 18th after a
fabled 5-iron to within 3 feet, Jerry Pate won that Open by two
strokes over Tom Weiskopf and Al Geiberger. In 1909 the Englewood
(N.J.) Golf Club had a 3-4-4-3 finish as George Sargent won by four
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the Atlanta A.C.'s only Open (as a Bicentennial
favor to the late Bobby Jones) and it's not likely to get another.
Englewood, dug up two decades ago for a condominium complex, never
had another Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to Sunday,'' said David Duval, ``a par on 15 is
going to be very valuable, as well as on 16. But you have more of
an opportunity to make birdie on 17. The 18th is a difficult hole,
but if you hit a good drive, you can access all the difficult pin
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's finish, Mickelson, the left-handed swami of the
short game, bogeyed the 15th, 16th and 17th holes and birdied the
18th, but he thought the two par-3's would favor the leader in
Sunday's finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have an opportunity to put a 3 on your scorecard,
that's the goal,'' Mickelson said. ``It's going to be very
difficult to make up shots to par on those two holes. Par on those
two short holes will be a good score. If you have to make it up
with the leader, you're going to hope the leader falters rather
than trying to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, it will be a different finish to a
different Open with a different look at Pinehurst No. 2.

DESPITE DOUBLE-BOGEY, PAK LEADS GOING INTO FINAL ROUND  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J._ Se Ri Pak has a simple mission for Sunday, the
final day of the ShopRite LPGA Classic. The native of South Korea,
who sprang into prominence in women's golf last season, wants to
win the tournament so she can present her father and coach, Joon
Chul, the trophy as a gift for Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of Pak, 21, capturing the $1 million tournament are
fairly good. At 10-under 132, Pak has a two-shot lead after
shooting 69 Saturday afternoon to go with the course and tournament
record of 63 on opening day. Juli Inkster, who won the U.S. Open
two weeks ago, is eight under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad day, and I thought second or third would have been
fine going into the last day,'' Pak said after her round. ``This
was not as easy as yesterday, but I'm hanging in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's only blemish Saturday was a double-bogey on the 384-yard
fourth, where she hit three shots off line to the left. It was the
kind of double-bogey that could have devastated her, but she held
herself together and finished the day with four birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who has no victories this season after winning four times
in her rookie season last year, came very close to making bogey on
the 337-yard 17th, but she saved par by sinking a 25-footer after
she missed the green to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt like a birdie, if not an eagle,'' Pak said of the
save that gave gave her enough encouragement to finish with a
birdie 4 on the 508-yard 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster shot 68 with birdies on the last three holes. The winner
of three tournaments this season, Inkster's 68 was one of her less
stellar rounds, with seven birdies and four bogeys. ``It was very
sloppy,'' Inkster said after going to the driving range right after
her round. ``I was very fortunate to hit 3-under. If I can make
this my sloppy day, hopefully I'll come out fine tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Trish Johnson (71), Wendy Doolan (66) and Leta Lidley (68) were
tied for third at 135, a stroke behind Inkster. Johnson's round
included two birdies and two bogeys, while Lindley had five birdies
and two bogeys. Doolan had eight birdies and three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, last year's winner with a remarkable 17-under
196, was five behind Pak at 137 after shooting a 6-under 65 with
seven birdies for the day's best round.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam's 65 came after a 72 on Friday. She said she didn't
know the difference between the two rounds. ``It's golf,'' she
said. ``It's weird. Today, I put the ball on the right side of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Wicoff had the only ace of the day for her first career
hole-in-one. She used a 4-iron to ace the 177-yard 14th, earning a
Mercury Cougar.

PLAY BALL! 4 HOURS AND 372 PITCHES LATER, METS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ ``Titanic,'' the movie, seemed like a trailer
compared to this.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Mets and Cardinals 3 hours 56 minutes to finish nine
innings Saturday afternoon, with the Cardinals holding on for a 7-6
victory in the longest nine-inning game the Mets have ever played.
</P>
<P>
   There were 372 pitches thrown, 201 by the Cardinals and 171 by
the Mets. Jason Isringhuasen threw 70 pitches in just two and
two-thirds innings (35 balls and 35 strikes). Darren Oliver, the
St. Louis starter, labored even harder: he threw 121 pitches in
four-plus innings (58 balls, 63 strikes).
</P>
<P>
   There were eight pitchers in the game. There were 25 full
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on Mark
McGwire's 20th home run off Isringhausen (1-2). But even though
they nearly blew leads of 6-1 and 7-2, the Cardinals did not have
to bat in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And still the game lasted nearly four hours. And the tempo
actually picked up from the sixth inning on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like a walk across the desert,'' said Mets
catcher Mike Piazza, who extended his career-best hitting streak to
22 games with a fifth-inning home run. His streak is two games
short of Hubie Brooks's 1984 club record. ``As soon as you see some
water,'' Piazza said, ``it's not there. It's a mirage.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Mets could empathize. They were sure they had
seen the tying run score in the top of the fifth, only to have the
home plate umpire, Charlie Williams, rule Bobby Bonilla out.
Replays seemed to show he was safe.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, many of the Mets privately grumbled about
Williams' inconsistent strike zone, which both helped them and hurt
them, saying it helped lengthen the time of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had already scored four runs in the top of the fifth to
pull within 7-6 on Piazza's two-run homer, his 15th of the season,
and Rickey Henderson's bases-loaded, two-run single with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Three batters earlier, Bonilla had worked a walk as a
pinch-hitter to load the bases. With Bonilla now on third and
Henderson on first, St. Louis reliever Manny Aybar quickly got
ahead of Edgardo Alfonzo, one ball and two strikes. Before he threw
another pitch, Aybar faked a move to third, wheeled toward first
and turned to see he had Henderson picked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to go on that pitch,'' said Henderson, who had
homered off Oliver for the Mets' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Henderson had no choice. But Henderson also wanted to get
in a rundown to give Bonilla, who does not run well, a chance to
score. Bonilla waited for Mark McGwire to throw to second baseman
Joe McEwing. And then Bonilla broke for home.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Castillo, Piazza's former backup with the Mets, was
waiting for the throw. He was also preparing to block the plate.
Castillo is listed at 6 feet and 180 pounds; Bonilla at 6-3 and
240. Castillo, in other words, was giving away at least 60 pounds,
giving new meaning to his nickname, Bambi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castillo can't stop me, trust me,'' Bonilla said later. ``He
can be standing on a barricade and he's not going to stop me. I
just hope I didn't hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla made his slide left leg first. McEwing's throw beat him.
But Castillo could not block the bigger man from the plate.
Bonilla's leg appeared to reach home well ahead of Castillo's tag.
But Williams ruled him out. And not another run scored the rest of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Bobby was safe,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   So did the rest of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby broke right on time,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``If Bambi was blocking the plate, it looked like Bobby went
through him easily. But it's tough to tell from where I was
sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla had a much better view. He exchanged words with Williams
after the call, but would not reveal what he said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say one thing,'' said Bonilla. ``I know I got a good
jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The play would have been less significant had the Mets been more
productive with runners on base. Henderson's hit was the Mets'
first of the game with runners in scoring position in 10 at-bats.
They would only have one more base-runner the rest of the game:
Henderson _ whose two-out double in the eighth gave him four hits
for the day. But Aybar (3-1) induced Alfonzo into a pop-up to first
on a full-count pitch to end the threat. And the Mets went down in
order against Scott Radinsky and Ricky Bottalico in the top of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say who had a tougher day, Alfonzo, who went 0 for
5 and failed with runners in scoring position three times; or
Isringhausen, who grew up in nearby Brighton, Ill., and allowed six
runs in front of his family. One thing was sure. Isrinhausen's
afternoon was definitely shorter. Alfonzo had to play the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you, it seemed like a four-hour game,'' Cardinals
Manager Tony La Russa said. &QL;

DESPITE CLASH, NORTH   AND SOUTH KOREA TO RESUME TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ North Korea said Sunday that planned talks on
humanitarian issues with South Korea, their first contact in 14
months, will go forward Monday in Beijing despite last week's naval
gunbattle, the first high seas firefight between the two sides
since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the North's schizophrenic attitude toward the
South, Pyongyang also accused Seoul Saturday of inciting war, and
vowed to retaliate for the 10-minute battle that sank a North
Korean torpedo boat, killing an estimated 30 North Korean sailors
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange of fire was an adventurous act for provocation of
war which the South Korean puppets had planned, prepared in secrecy
and promoted,'' Pyongyang's official Korea Central News Agency
quoted a Navy Command spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our quality to answer . . . an all-out war with all-out
war,'' the news agency added. ``There is no limit to our
retaliatory strike at the enemy, and it is merciless.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that rhetoric, Seoul downgraded its military alert
status Saturday, because Northern ships have kept out of the
disputed waters for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul claims several Northern warships intruded on Southern
waters for nine days straight and finally fired Tuesday. The
standoff apparently began with both sides guarding their fishing
boats in the Yellow Sea's crab-rich waters. South Korea's Ministry
of Defense says its boats tried to bump Northern ships back into
their waters before the Northern side fired.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most serious incident since South Korea sank a
Northern spy vessel last December. That crew was found dead,
apparently of a mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are technically at war, since the 1950-53 Korean
War ended in an armistice. Since 1945, the peninsula has been
divided into Communist North, backed by China, and the South,
supported by the United States. The border is the world's most
militarized, with 2 million troops deployed on the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, ordinary South Korean seem unfazed by last
Tuesday's clash. Life continued as normal in the capital, and
numerous citizens said they believed their government was inflating
the incident for domestic political and economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us think it's just a big show to divert people's
attention from domestic scandals,'' such as a recent brouhaha
surrouding a couple of Cabinet ministers' wives who each supposedly
accepted $10,000 worth of clothing and furs, said Pyun Ju Hyun, 26,
a customer service representative. ``When I look at CNN,'' the
clash ``looks really serious and deadly, but I think they try to
make it more serious than it is. We here know it's nothing much.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Hyun Jeong, a marketing executive, agreed that ``foreigners
have a tendency to exaggerate the situation here, so some little
struggle which we think is natural at sea, especially among
neighbors . . . gets sensationalized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Political scandals happen everywhere, including the USA and
England,'' and politicians there have mastered the art of
exploiting foreign policy issues like Iraq or Kosovo to take the
heat of themselves at home, Park asserted. ``Like that, many Korean
politicians utilize the North-South situation at times when they
are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so cynical about their government's motives,
but many seemed unconcerned about an escalation of tensions. Mun
Sung Jun, 26, a security guard, said he is relaxed because he
believes the South's military is superior to the North's. ``South
Korea has been victorious in the past, and this time we were again.
North Korea is frightened of South Korea. And we are not afraid of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   If war were to erupt, Mun said he would be proud to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some older Koreans who lived through the Korean War view the
recent conflict as provocation by the North to force concessions
connected to military deployment or aid. Jack Kim, 60, a defense
contractor who survived General Douglas MacArthur's landing in
Inchon and now lives in Michigan, suggested that ``North Korea is
trying to push the US to the negotiating table'' at the talks in
Beijing or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's North-South talks were planned to discuss food aid to
the famine-stricken North and the reunification of countless
families separated since the war. The naval clash may shift
attention to security issues, which may be Pyongyang's intention.
The North wants 37,000 US troops out of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent two guided-missile cruisers to Korean
waters from Japan after Tuesday's clash. Pyongyang Saturday
denounced ``the invariable, aggressive nature of the US warhawks
seeking to ignite a war in Korea at any cost,'' according to the
official news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, three North Koreans defected to the South,
government officials said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade said Kim Woo Suk, 38, his wife, Song Ki Sun, 25, and Kim Suk
Hoon, 29, were seeking asylum.

LEE, IBF MAY FACE ACTION IN PROBE OF BOXING CORRUPTION

 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, Robert W. Lee Sr. quietly formed the International
Boxing Federation. If the announcement lacked both drama and
publicity, Lee did not lack for ambition: The IBF, he pledged,
would be built from scratch with the idea that it would objectively
rank the world's top fighters and create its own set of legitimate
championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of a new boxing organization, one that claimed it
wanted to clean up a sport rife with wrongdoing, Lee was a curious
candidate to play the part of maverick reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, after all, had never been a serious boxer or trainer or
promoter, having spent most of his professional life as a homicide
detective in Hudson County, N.J. More odd, however, Lee, at the
very moment he was creating the IBF, was deputy commissioner of the
New Jersey Athletic Commission, a governmental agency charged with
monitoring boxing in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And federal agents investigating corruption in boxing in the
early 1980s had said they had evidence that Lee accepted illegal
payoffs in his job with the state commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, none of it _ a lack of experience, a possible
conflict of interest, a brush with the FBI _ mattered. Lee indeed
founded the IBF (originally calling it the U.S. Boxing Association
International), and within months staged its first championship
fight.
</P>
<P>
   And for the last 16 years, the IBF, along with the WBC and the
WBA, has functioned as one of the sport's three sanctioning
organizations, and thus as one of its most powerful forces.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF has anointed champions, but it has also been sued by
fighters who have claimed, among other things, that its ranking
system was fixed. It has made millions of dollars, but has also
been at the center of some of the sport's great embarrassments _
most recently when the performance of a judge it appointed in the
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight March 13 set off a New York
City criminal investigation into whether the bout was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lee and the IBF, and with them another layer of boxing's
credibility, seem to be in additional peril.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Newark, in a broad grand jury
investigation that predates the Holyfield-Lewis debacle, have been
submitting evidence of possible criminal conduct by the IBF, which
is based in East Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is looking into whether the IBF accepted payoffs
in return for ranking certain fighters. Over the last year, the
organization's financial records have been seized; promoters,
managers and boxers have been questioned about a variety of
improper schemes, and promoter Don King, who has worked closely
with the IBF over the years, has said he believes prosecutors have
targeted Lee and the IBF in an attempt to ultimately indict him.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has denied any wrongdoing, saying he believes he is being
investigated because prosecutors have failed in their attempts to
go after the WBC and the WBA, which are based in Mexico and
Venezuela, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an easy target because I'm in the United States,'' Lee
said a few weeks ago. ``I'm here, and I'm accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTION TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   King, whose business offices in Florida were raided by federal
agents this month, said before the raid that he expected to be
indicted, but also predicted that he would be exonerated. According
to people who have testified before the grand jury, prosecutors
have focused on him because they are interested in seeing whether
he might have used his influence over Lee to turn the IBF and its
titles into his own fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're trying to get Bob Lee,'' King said, ``but it
always ends up with me. I've been indicted all my life. But I'm not
going to deal with smokescreens and hypotheticals, and I'm not
going to give up my most basic right _ the presumption of
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing's sanctioning organizations have long drawn criticism.
The WBC and the WBA operated as fringe groups in the sport until
the early 1960s, publishing rankings of fighters and designating
their own sets of champions, but being all but ignored by the most
powerful promoters and fighters.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the late 1970s when television networks,
reacting to repeated scandals in boxing, turned to the two
organizations in an attempt to create a credible mechanism for
ranking fighters and staging legitimate championship fights.
</P>
<P>
   But despite having been enlisted to help the networks and the
sport, the newly powerful organizations were soon criticized for
their own alleged misdeeds _ manipulating their rankings,
extracting enormous sums of money from fighters, establishing
alliances with promoters that called into question the integrity of
both fights and champions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the Committee on Governmental Affairs conducted
the most recent U.S. Senate investigation of boxing in 1992, it did
not look into the sanctioning organizations and their ranking
systems, so convinced was it of their illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so universally accepted that they're arbitrary and
subject to manipulation that we didn't think it would serve any
purpose to spend six months looking into them,'' said Paul Feeney,
a legislative aide to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was a scandal involving how boxers were
ranked that lifted the sanctioning organizations to positions of
real influence. In 1977, during a boxing tournament televised by
ABC Sports, it was revealed that the rankings of the boxers
involved, then set by The Ring magazine's experts, were flawed, and
that the records of some boxers were bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, ABC turned to the WBA and the WBC, which had been
formed decades before. The organizations took over the ranking of
the top boxers, deciding who would fight whom and when.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations, which made occasional nods toward the
interests of fighters _ establishing safety regulations such as
shortening the lengths of championship fights _ became the
beneficiary of television's effort to, in effect, purchase
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from ABC and other networks paid the organizations
for the right to broadcast a sanctioned fight, and fighters gave up
a piece of their purse for the privilege of having a shot at a
sanctioning organization's title.
</P>
<P>
   And quickly, a dynamic of widespread coziness took hold.
</P>
<P>
   The interests at work in this dynamic were easy to see. One one
hand, television executives eager to offer the viewing public a
reliable product came to depend on at least the surface seriousness
of, say, a WBC-sanctioned championship, one to be fought for by
boxers whose rankings were said to be deserving.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the promoters ingratiated themselves with the
sanctioning bodies, recognizing that title fights meant more money.
And the sanctioning bodies set fees for their championships, often
taking as much as 3 percent of each fighter's purse.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long, then, for people in boxing to conclude
that in using the sanctioning bodies to name champions, set
rankings and strip fighters of their titles if they did not box
designated opponents, one scandal had simply replaced another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Bob Arum, a longtime promoter, charged in a magazine
article that a WBA official, Pepe Cordero, had extorted $500,000
from him in order for Arum's fighter, Ray Mancini, to gain a
championship fight. Arum repeated the charge in a recent interview.
Cordero, who was never charged or disciplined as a result of the
allegation, died years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, made similar allegations. In the end, the FBI's
early-1980s study did not result in the prosecution of major fight
figures, but investigators nevertheless formed some conclusions
about the sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They collect percentages of a fighter's purse in sanctioning
fees every time he fights,'' Joseph Spinelli, a former agent who
led the investigation, said. ``No one knows where it goes or who it
goes to. They're not accountable to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many promoters are quite frank about their efforts to get close
to the sanctioning organizations. It has been a ritual for years,
for example, for promoters to underwrite the costs of the
organizations' annual conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everything else,'' said the promoter Butch Lewis,
whose records on his dealings with the IBF have been subpoenaed by
the FBI in the current investigation. ``You go to the conventions,
put on a cocktail party, you make donations to the conventions.
That's what you do to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marley, a former publicist for King who now manages a
number of boxers, agreed that the relationships between promoters
and sanctioning organizations could look suspect. ``There were
always hints being dropped,'' Marley said of rankings being put up
for sale. ``If you're a discerning manager you see them. I can't
give you any evidence. I don't have any receipts. I don't think
guys are bringing bags of cash and handing them out to these
organizations. But they do things like buy wedding presents for
people.''

<P>
   Boxing has always attracted eclectic characters _ from the
heroic to the criminal, the comic to the sad. Thus the story of Bob
Lee and his rise within boxing is not entirely difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who at 67 is among the most powerful people in the game as
the head of the IBF, was not much of a boxer as a youth, a broken
finger cutting short his career after four fights. He served as a
detective with the Hudson County Police Department, later lost an
election for sheriff in Union County, and then took up a
bureaucrat's job in the New Jersey consumer affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, though, Lee was assigned to assist Althea Gibson, the
former tennis great, in her job as the state's athletic
commissioner. Part of his job was helping attract boxing events to
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, questions were raised about Lee's
conduct. In 1980, the FBI, then conducting its initial
investigation into boxing, said an undercover agent had made an
audiotape that recorded Lee's acceptance of a bribe as payment for
granting a promoter's license. Though the investigation did not
result in indictments, the agents gave information on Lee to the
New Jersey authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has always maintained that the bribery claim is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   State officials did not take action against Lee on the bribery
accusation, but four years later they did force his removal from
office. Lee, it turned out, had worked for the WBA, and later
formed the IBF, while he continued to work at his state job
overseeing boxing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after an investigation by the state attorney general's
office, Lee was forced by the New Jersey Investigation Commission
to give up his state job because of what were termed ethical
misjudgments. Among the findings was that Lee had solicited funds
for the IBF from the very boxing people he was regulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he saw his role as more boosterism than regulator,''
said James Morley, who headed the state investigation. ``Most of
those guys thought they were there to find ways to get more boxing
in New Jersey, not to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woodworth, the manager of Roberto Garcia, the IBF's junior
lightweight champion, said Lee's unusual route to becoming the head
of a sanctioning organization was a damning commentary on the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there's something wrong with these organizations when
Bob Lee can go from being fired as a state commissioner to being
president of a sanctioning organization,'' Woodward said. ``But
this is the business of boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one boxing manager, Ron Weathers, said he had told the
grand jury in Newark that part of that business involved direct
payoffs to the IBF. Weathers said in a recent interview that he had
told prosecutors of ``several occasions'' on which he had made
improper payments in order to get his fighters ranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' Weathers said of the IBF and the other
sanctioning bodies, ``you could only do business with these
organizations if you paid them.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One fighter, William Guthrie, gave a sworn statement two years
ago claiming that the IBF's tactics could involve tools other than
money. Guthrie, a former IBF lightweight champion, sued King,
alleging that in using his influence with Lee, King had told Lee
not to grant Guthrie a title fight if Guthrie decided to sign with
a different promoter. Guthrie said Lee had then in fact told him
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt what they were saying was true,'' Guthrie said
in an interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he has been singled out for criticism and punishment
because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two predecessors, Abe Greene and Joe Maloney, who were both
white, they had done the same thing I did,'' Lee said. ``I copied
what they did. Yet they never found them to be in ethical
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the state attorney general's investigation, Lee continued
to be haunted by his past. In 1992, he was called before the Senate
committee and was asked to answer questions about the FBI's claim
that he had taken a bribe in 1980. Lee repeatedly invoked his Fifth
Amendment privilege and declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the stuff they were talking about,'' Lee said
recently, ``nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Much, though, was happening with the IBF. Marvin Hagler fought
in its first championship event in 1983. Larry Holmes soon became
one of its champions. Its conventions attracted all the major
promoters. Lee's son, Robert W. Lee Jr., became a senior officer.
The organization's coffers filled with cash, as it took a greater
percentage of a fighter's purse than any other sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of fighters who have come through here and have
been world champions, I'm happy about that,'' Lee said as he sat in
the IBF's offices. ``If you think about it, we've put a lot of
money in the pockets of these guys.''

<P>
   The IBF has only five full-time employees, and its finances are
not subject to any kind of independent oversight. According to
people who have testified before the grand jury in Newark,
prosecutors are looking into the question of whether improper
payments to IBF officials were made through the overcharging of
sanctioning fees.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about how the IBF has conducted its business have
certainly been widespread for years. Arum, the promoter who claimed
he was required to pay off a WBA official for a prize fight more
than a decade ago, said that his early optimism about the IBF
quickly dissipated, and that he has given testimony before the
Newark grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were American guys who weren't going to be corrupt,''
Arum said he once thought. But, he said, ``I began hearing rumors
as early as the end of the 1980s that guys were paying for
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The current federal investigation of the IBF, according to law
enforcement officials, grew directly out of a lawsuit brought
against the organization by Michael Moorer, a former heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 suit, Moorer argued that he had been wrongly denied
the IBF's No. 1 ranking, and had instead been leapfrogged by two
less-deserving boxers, including Francois Botha, a King fighter who
moved from No. 4 to No. 1. Moorer said he had been told by Lee that
he was not fighting frequently enough to merit the top slot.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case, Moorer and his lawyers obtained the
testimony of managers and television executives. Promoter Dan Duva,
then president of Main Events, said in an affidavit that the IBF
official in charge of rankings, Doug Beavers, had told him that Lee
ordered that Botha be ``unilaterally'' moved to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most provocative testimony came from Seth
Abraham, president of Time Warner-HBO Sports. He said in a sworn
statement that King had outlined for him how he would have Botha
moved ahead of Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is indeed what happened,'' Abraham said in a recent
interview. ``There is no secret Don knows how to use the
organizations better than anyone I know. But quite frankly all the
promoters do what the organizations allow them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was ultimately settled, and, according to John
Davimos, Moorer's manager, the fighter received $3 million and a
promise that he could fight for the IBF title in the future. He
fought for the title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But according to lawyers involved in the suit, as well as a
number of people who have testified before the grand jury,
prosecutors were intrigued enough by the allegations in the case to
start their own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of promoters, including Butch Lewis and Cedric Kushner,
have either testified before the grand jury or turned over many of
the financial records of their dealings with the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   King and others have said that they believe the government's
case has been helped by the work of Beavers, the former IBF
rankings official, who they say worked as an informant for
prosecutors over the last year or more. Beavers, who has since left
the IBF, did not return repeated telephone calls seeking a
response.
</P>
<P>
   George Foreman, who once held the IBF's heavyweight title, also
testified before the grand jury. He said he was questioned
extensively about knowledge of kickbacks for rankings. Foreman said
he told prosecutors he had no direct knowledge of such payoffs, but
that he believed such schemes existed. But he blamed the promoters
as well as the sanctioning organization officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard the old expression, `Can two walk together
unless they agree?''' Foreman said. ``I believe that's the way it
works.''

COLLINS' ANGELS FUTURE BECOMING MORE PRECARIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the one-year anniversary of the Los Angeles
Dodgers' Sunday Night Massacre, the Anaheim Angels are faced with
how long they can stay with manager Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Dodgers' unfulfilled expectation cost manager
Bill Russell and GM Fred Claire their jobs. Fox hadn't even spent
the big money on Kevin Brown yet, but they knew what they didn't
like. That night, they whacked two 30-year employees and began
reinventing the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Angels' turn.
</P>
<P>
   The owners at Disney went against their frugal nature by signing
Mo Vaughn last winter and expected nothing less than an American
League West title in return.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't know was that Collins' hyper personality
already had worn out much of the team after just two seasons. When
Gary DiSarcina and Tim Salmon went down with injuries, everyone had
an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the large egos in baseball, players rarely look in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was an easy target. Citing the aggressiveness that makes
him the player he is, Randy Velarde ripped the manager two weeks
ago for taking away his green light to run with Vaughn at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers used to get locked up on the bases for fear of
taking the bat out of Mike Piazza's hands, but this is much
different.
</P>
<P>
   This was a mutiny by players who couldn't get motivated by some
career minor- leaguer who liked to yell. When they heard the Angels
were negotiating to extend Collins' contract they used the only
leverage they have outside the jurisdiction of the Major League
Players Association. The front office doesn't fire the players.
</P>
<P>
   A lot can change in two weeks, but since then the message from
the players has gotten even louder. They've dropped five straight
and 10 of 12. They are 10 games behind Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep this up for a week or two, we're going to take on a
spoiler role,'' said Angels left-hander Chuck Finley, after losing
Friday to the Yankees. ``Fifteen games out by the All-Star break?
I've done that too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney made a critical blunder when it allowed Collins' contract
to become a distraction in a season of such high expectation. They
went after Vaughn but allowed Collins' $400,000 salary to become a
bigger issue. Disney had so much hope but didn't understand the
terrain. Collins should have been given the extension well before
the season started. If it worked out they would be in the playoffs.
If it didn't, Collins would get a $400,000 going-away present.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is one of the most decent guys in baseball, but his ilk
appears to be a vanishing breed.
</P>
<P>
   All the years traveling by bus in the Texas League taught him
lessons that would benefit any organization. But players don't want
to know about that night in Midland when he owned the world. They
want to know what it's like batting in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are just as pathetic as the Angels right now; maybe
worse because they spent more money to put together an indifferent
team. Their purge a year ago did nothing to improve the situation.
But no one is questioning Davey Johnson. He has a World Series ring
with the Mets and averaged 96 wins a season. He took messy
situations in Cincinnati and Baltimore and made them into playoff
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' lack of major-league experience hurt him in Houston,
where players said he was too uptight. They just didn't want a guy
in their face who hadn't been in their shoes. He was replaced by
low-key Larry Dierker and the Astros took off.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true in New York, where manager Buck Showalter, a
career minor- leaguer, was replaced by the fatherly Joe Torre. Two
World Series titles later, the Yankees are Showalter's team but
Torre's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that will be true of Collins, too. Although he never
has finished lower than second as a major-league manager, he never
got the Double-A dirt out of his uniform.

   WEIMER, Texas:false identification documents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presumably riding the rails, he has surfaced in Michigan,
Florida, Vermont, Oklahoma, Missouri, New Mexico and California.
</P>
<P>
   He has been deported at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes me so angry,'' Nancy Strickland, whose
husband, Tom, teaches English at Weimar High School, said in an
interview at her Weimar home. ``They had him so many times and kept
turning him loose.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, his travel portfolio includes McAllen, Laredo,
Kountze, Groom, Denton, San Antonio and, of course, tiny Weimar and
metropolitan Houston. It was Houston where the suspect may have
launched his Texas killing spree, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHORTLY BEFORE CHRISTMAS 1998, police received a routine
telephone call from employees at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston. Dr. Claudia Gabriella Benton, 39, had not shown up at
work, and her colleagues were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Police drove to her home in West University Place, an upscale
municipality surrounded by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:30 p.m. on Dec. 17, they discovered Benton's body on the
floor of an upstairs bedroom. Her head and upper body were covered
by a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   A bloody butcher knife lay nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners determined that the physician had been
sexually assaulted and stabbed but that death apparently occurred
from a blow to the head with a blunt instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and young twin daughters were out of the state at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In those grim early hours, nobody noted that the slaying scene
was near the railroad tracks. That would come later, after Benton's
stolen 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport turned up in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   And after fingerprints linked the brutal slaying of Claudia
Benton to Rafael Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON MOTHER'S DAY, a week after the bodies of Skip and Karen
Sirnic were discovered, the Rev. Mark Miller of Austin conducted
the Sunday services at Weimar's United Church of Christ as a guest
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God, we come to worship in great need,'' Miller said in
an opening prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been wounded deeply by the deaths of Skip and Karen.
We hurt. We grieve. We suffer. ... Help us light candles and not
curse the darkness. Oh God, we need you to be with us. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   The children's sermon that morning was dedicated to Karen
Sirnic. An insert in the church bulletin contained a personal and
poignant message to the slain secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karen,'' it said, ``your love certainly is unending and no one
can take that away from us!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators had found no trace of the Sirnics'
missing red pickup. But, like Claudia Benton's Jeep, it too would
turn up abandoned in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the people of Weimar coped as best they could
with a mix of fear and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paranoid and scared to death, and they don't know what
to do anymore,'' Weimar police officer Douglas Blaha said. ``A
preacher and his wife. How could they kill someone with the Lord?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that shouldn't be happening in our town.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Weimar Country Grocery, owner Sam Mordence mourned the
community's loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Once open and trusting, often gathering outside in the evenings
to visit, the people of Weimar are too frightened to go out at
night, Mordence said with a trace of anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leery of strangers. They're leery of leaving their
doors open. They're leery of the darkness,'' he said. ``You didn't
see that before.''
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old high school senior said his family has put extra
latches on screen doors, changed door locks and, like others in
town, keeps lights turned on all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' he said. ``In a small town like this, you never
expect something like that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, a starter on the Wildcats football team, quickly
realized that he was being interviewed. Concerned about retaliation
by the killer, he pleaded with the reporter not to use his name.
</P>
<P>
   In Weimar, the level of fear itself was frightening. And it was
about to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON JUNE 4, Linda Vacek drove out to visit her mother at her
small white farmhouse in Fayette County between Weimar and
Schulenburg, just off I-10 and about three miles from the Sirnics'
home.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad tracks run nearby, but not as close as they were to the
homes of other victims.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason for alarm. The night before, Vacek had
spoken with her mother, Josephine Konvicka, 73, who had lived alone
since the death of her husband in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A small dog guarded the home, but it was old and deaf and
couldn't even muster a bark.
</P>
<P>
   Vacek found a scene so gory that neither the family nor
authorities will discuss it in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County Sheriff Rick Vandel said Konvicka, like the
Sirnics, was attacked in her bedroom and killed by a blow to the
head. Some speculated that the weapon was left embedded in her
head.
</P>
<P>
   She was not sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he had a clue who was in the home when he broke
in,'' Vandel said, theorizing that the intruder expected to find a
younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed her for no reason. She was just lying there sleeping
in bed. He could have left without waking her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he have to kill her?'' he wondered rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder ransacked the house, apparently looking
unsuccessfully for his victim's car keys. Evidence suggests that he
tried to start the car without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume he came off the train,'' the sheriff theorized
in explaining the suspect's frantic efforts to find the keys and
use the car for his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could not see the victim's house from the tracks. He just
walked through the woods until he came to the house. There were no
barking dogs. No lights. No sounds from the house.''
</P>
<P>
   As before, the killer gained entry through the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took the screen off and raised the window,'' Vandel
said. ``He used a weapon he got from the location. I think it was
outside the house. It's not the type of thing you'd have in the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff, who spent 24 years with the Houston Police
Department, 20 of them as a solo motorcycle cop, does not
camouflage his distaste for the man known as Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This county is filled with good, honest, hard-working,
God-fearing German and Czech folks who live a law-abiding
lifestyle,'' Vandel said. ``We're a rural area. We don't lock our
doors. We don't look over our shoulders. We leave our keys in the
car. He's changed all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are people fearful in Weimar, but also in Schulenburg
and Flatonia, both of which lie in his county. MORE &QL;

   ``There's the same fear and mood there also,'' he said.
``Actually, there are more trains going through Flatonia, because
they break off going north and south.''

   What really worries him, the sheriff says, is that the killer is
getting more aggressive.

back to my county and do another crime,'' he said. But Vandel says

Dominguez may have been raped and killed because the killer could
not find Josephine Konvicka's car keys.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says the body of the 26-year-old was found by her
brother in the bedroom of her home when she did not show up for a
family function in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1993 white Honda Civic was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the time of death is uncertain, her body was discovered
June 5, a Saturday, one day after investigators learned of the
Konvicka slaying near Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Officers speculated that the killer, without transportation,
abandoned his routine of using a victim's stolen car to return to
San Antonio. Instead, he hopped an eastbound freight train near
Weimar, got off in Houston and resumed his predatory search.
</P>
<P>
   Like the others, Dominguez lived and died near a rail line.
</P>
<P>
   And although she was sexually assaulted and killed by a blow to
the head, her slaying was not tied at once to the elusive
Resendez-Ramirez. But her car turned up days later in Del Rio near
the International Bridge leading into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And fingerprints found in the car matched those of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the FBI had forensic evidence linking
Resendez-Ramirez to the Sirnic and Konvicka killings and both
Houston slayings. But the case had taken a new and even more
ominous turn. The bodies of George Morber, 80, and his daughter,
Carolyn Frederick, 52, were discovered Tuesday in their home in
Gorham, Ill., about 100 yards from a rail line. What's more, a
truck missing from the scene was found the next day in Cairo, about
60 miles south of Gorham.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the deaths in southern Illinois were sketchy, but
because of similarities to the Texas cases, Illinois authorities
requested the fingerprints of the prime Texas suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers and FBI agents headed to Illinois at once with
their data on Resendez-Ramirez. Mike Cox, a Department of Public
Safety spokesman in Austin, said Rangers have also been in Mexico
to gather information about Resendez-Ramirez, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's everywhere and nowhere _ he has no roots,'' Tom Vinger,
another spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, told the AP.
``But he knows we're looking for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is on.''
</P>
<P>
   WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
</P>
<P>
   In Weimar, Mayor Bennie Kosler says that about 20 trains roll
through town every 24 hours and that people can't help but wonder,
after the second episode: ``Is he on this train?''
</P>
<P>
   Police have doubled their nighttime patrols, and Kosler says
that overtime is not a concern until they ``catch this maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as it is, he said, it was ``kind of a relief to know it
wasn't someone from our area. I hoped we didn't have someone that
sick and that mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In a coffee shop that bears his name, but which he recently
sold, the mayor revealed a facet of the case that police have not
confirmed or discussed. He says that ``30-some-odd dollars was
lying on top of the dresser'' in the bedroom where the Sirnics were
slain.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the intruder is so obsessed with killing
and sexual gratification that he ignores money at his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so weird,'' Kosler says. ``I guess he just
wanted to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Weimar, including law enforcement officers, appears
convinced that the killer crossed over into Mexico because the
Dominguez car was found in Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they catch him, we're going to think he's around,
because he is,'' says Larry Wick, owner of M-G Farm Service Center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite stories to the contrary, Wick says that the run on
handguns continues, but that they've never run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a normal week, we'll sell one or two handguns,'' he said.
``We've sold 40 or 50. We've sold some shotguns and some rifles.
And I've got some more coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are also swift for Mace and pepper gas.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Church of Christ, Ralph Ludwig, the interim
pastor, suggests that the deaths of the Sirnics and others have
taken a tremendous emotional toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's done to the community is chilling,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Larry Wick, there is no end in sight. Or sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a train whistle blow,'' he says with a sad smile,
``and you start thinking about it all over again.''

RAIL-RIDING SERIAL KILLER LEAVES TRAIL OF TERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Texas _ In the dead of night, police believe, he
scrambled from a passing freight train and slipped alone and unseen
into this peaceful little ranching community in the coastal savanna
of Southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He came to rape and kill, and, as before, he chose his victims
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Creeping through a darkened carport, he removed a weapon from a
tool cabinet. He pried open a window, unlocked a rear door, found
the bedroom where his targets lay sleeping and attacked with
horrendous fury.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the couple saw the snake tattooed on his
left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, May 2, a parishioner at Weimar's United
Church of Christ discovered the bodies of the minister and the
church secretary, Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen.
</P>
<P>
   The popular couple had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore calm to the terrified town,
investigators assured heartbroken residents that the killer was
most likely an outsider and that he probably would not return.
</P>
<P>
   They were half right.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings of Skip and Karen Sirnic and the subsequent
revelations about a maniacal serial killer sent residents scurrying
for guns, ammunition, dogs and a wide range of security devices.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks passed. Then, in early June, the unthinkable occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Again under cover of darkness, the killer returned. He broke
into the small farmhouse of a 73-year-old widow and killed her with
a blow to the head as she slept.
</P>
<P>
   Her home was three miles from the Sirnics' and, like the Sirnic
house, near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Weimar residents recoiled from the latest violence, the
body of a young woman was discovered June 5 in her Houston home.
She had been sexually assaulted and beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   The crime was not immediately linked to the Weimar killings. But
it did fit the chilling pattern and emerging profile of a suspect
in earlier sex slayings in Houston and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread: Each crime occurred not far from railroad
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the FBI formed a multiagency task force to share
the fruits of their investigative efforts and track down a suspect
as elusive and deranged as he is cunning and vicious.
</P>
<P>
   They identified him as a 39-year-old Mexican national and
branded him a rail-hopping, ``thrill-killing'' drifter motivated
more by sexual deviancy than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what he might do, and we cannot project where
he might go. ... But I think his free time is limited,'' Weimar
Police Chief Bill Livingston told a Star-Telegram reporter at
midweek. ``There are too many good cops looking for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely 24 hours later, officers stopped a freight train in
Central Texas and arrested five men, one considered a suspect
because of a snake tattooed on his forearm.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the wrong arm.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEIMAR EMBRACES a population of 2,050 in Colorado County and
lies along Interstate 10 and U.S. 90 between San Antonio and
Houston in Southeast Texas. The Texas capital, Austin, is little
more than an hour's drive northwest.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's top 10 calf producers, Colorado County
derives its name from the river that winds down from Austin en
route to Matagorda Bay on the Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lush green expanse dotted with small, private lakes and
wooded areas that provide food and shelter for deer, doves, ducks,
geese and turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar is home to large families of Czech and German ancestry,
and its agriculture and light industry are enhanced by a booming
sausage business.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place for Special Living, proclaims the town's slogan.
</P>
<P>
   That changed overnight with the grisly discovery in the
parsonage of United Church of Christ on May 2, a Sunday. That was
also Skip Sirnic's 47th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS PAST midnight on a summer evening in 1997 when a
20-year-old woman, covered in blood, staggered to a student's house
near the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington. Her face was
swollen, her jaw fractured, her head and neck cut. She had been
beaten so severely that she could barely open her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat me up,'' she mumbled. ``He beat me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Goetz told The Courier-Journal in Louisville that the young
woman pointed out into the darkness and said, ``My friend's down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoned by Goetz, police arrived and found the bound body of
Christopher Maier, 21, a student and Phi Kappa Psi fraternity
member from North Canton, Ohio. He had been beaten to death. His
date, also a student, told them that a man in his 20s had emerged
from the darkness and attacked them. He struck Maier with a board
or rock, then tied his hands and feet with a cord.
</P>
<P>
   Before killing Maier, he raped and beat the young woman and left
her for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Police soon learned that the Aug. 29, 1997, attack occurred as
the couple walked from one party to another. They had taken a
shortcut popular with university students.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcut took them along the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   XXX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IN ONE SENSE, the deadly saga dates back to Aug. 31, 1976, when
a teen-ager from Puebla, Mexico, entered the United States at
Brownsville, the southern tip of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to FBI records obtained by the Star-Telegram, that was
the first recorded appearance in this country of the man known
today as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. It is but one of many names or
aliases he has used during two decades of nonviolent brushes with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than three dozen notations in the FBI's criminal
history, little is known about the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted posters showing five of the many faces of
Resendez-Ramirez decorate virtually every shop, convenience store,
office building and service station on Weimar's main streets.
Police say he changes his appearance at will.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is named in a Harris County burglary indictment
and charged by the federal government with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He has been linked by forensic evidence to five beating deaths
in Texas and the one in Kentucky. He is also a suspect in several
other killings.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards total at least $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's criminal repertoire includes burglary, car theft,
aggravated assault, battery, trespassing on railroad property,
false representation as a U.S. citizen, illegal re-entry,
defrauding an innkeeper, illegal possession of a concealed weapon,
false statements to a federal officer, possession of a firearm by a
felon, and possession of false identification documents. MORE &QL;

HOUSTON JUGGLES RATTLES AND THE SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In Nets' item, corrects Van Gundy's agent to Rob Ades, sted
Rod.) 
(bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allan Houston's main chore in the last week has been figuring
out how to shake free from Mario Elie, the relentless San Antonio
swingman who keeps tugging at Houston's jersey and his confidence.
The playoffs being about adjustments, it is easily the
second-toughest job the Knicks' shooting guard has this
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The first: 2 a.m. feedings.
</P>
<P>
   After a week without being with his newborn daughter, Remi-Jean,
Houston was planning to celebrate his first Father's Day in his
Greenwich, Conn., home on Sunday with his wife, Tamara, and their
first child.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably not have a tremendous impact on his performance
in the National Basketball Association finals or help him cope with
Elie and the Spurs any better than he and Knicks already have
through two games.
</P>
<P>
   But it has helped him further strike a balance between his
professional and personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you first get married and you have to go on the
road, that's kind of an adjustment,'' Houston said. ``But then,
when you have a baby, and then you go on the road to the NBA
finals, that's like, you've just got a lot of stuff going on in
your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston telephoned home often in the last week, usually getting
the standard response: ``I'm feeding her. I'll call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   Remi-Jean was born the day after Houston's phenomenal Game 6
performance against Indiana _ a game Tamara attended before labor
was induced the next day. Before Game 2 against San Antonio, he was
looking forward to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone went out and got her a Knicks uniform,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the emotions he felt watching his daughter being
born, he added: ``To be honest, I don't know what in the world I
was feeling. It's an emotion that I had never experienced before.
Obviously, joy was a lot of it. But it is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my sister last night, and I said, `You better call
me on Father's Day.' And she was like, `Man, that sounds funny.'''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston, new father. Kind of takes the sting away from
those 7-for-17 nights, no?
</P>
<P>
   The Don Nelson Connection
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his messy divorces with the Knicks and Golden State,
Don Nelson is credited with being one of the game's modern-day
innovators, a man who would put a 7-foot-6-inch center behind the
3-point line if he thought it would help his team's chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson presided over very good teams in Milwaukee and lackluster
teams in the Bay Area before contentious power struggles with Chris
Webber and Patrick Ewing tarnished his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson has never got to the NBA finals as a coach. Even so,
as perhaps the only connecting thread between Jeff Van Gundy and
Gregg Popovich, he is not envious that two of his former unheralded
assistants got the opportunity this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve it,'' Nelson said from his home in Dallas, where
he serves as the Mavericks' coach and general manager. ``They're
the kind of guys you wouldn't mind being in a fox hole with. Pop is
a little more military than Jeff, but there are a lot of
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that neither Van Gundy nor Popovich played
in the league, and therefore had to work harder to gain respect
among their players than many coaches. They have also been on the
firing line recently, with Popovich's job in question after the
Spurs' 6-8 start and Van Gundy weathering two attempts made at
relieving him of his duties during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Nelson points out, the largest common denominator may be
their knack for getting emotional about their relationships with
their peers. In the macho culture of the NBA, Van Gundy and
Popovich have no trouble expressing their sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is closer to Popovich, having worked with him for four
seasons at Golden State. But Van Gundy also endeared himself to
Nelson during the 59 games he coached in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nelson was fired by the Knicks in March 1996, the first
person to console him in his Philadelphia hotel room was Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't crying, but Jeff came to my room in tears,'' Nelson
said. ``I felt worse for him than I did for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became pretty close,'' he added. ``I really appreciated
that he and Don Chaney would come up to my room to spend some
quality time with me that day. That's the kind of people they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich became the victim of one of Nelson's greatest pranks
while they were with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Popovich was an art lover, Nelson procured a
portrait of an American Indian from an artist Popovich once coached
with at the Air Force Academy. The artist did not charge Nelson for
the painting, but instead gave it to him as a gift for Popovich's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson then took the painting to the owner of an art gallery he
knew in San Francisco. He had the gallery owner mount and display
the painting for $25,000, then brought Popovich into the gallery
with the other coaches after a lunch at Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Hey, Pop, isn't this the guy you used to work
with?''' Nelson said. ``And he just went wild. `That's him! That's
him!' I said, `Why don't you buy it?' He said, `Oh, no, I can't
afford that.' I told my friend to put it on my bill and wrap it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the assistant coaches, who were in on the gag, were
about to break the news to Popovich when he suddenly got emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He starts bawling,'' Nelson said. ``He says: `I can't believe
you guys did this for me, a $25,000 piece of art painted by this
guy I know. This is really something.' At that point, we're all
feeling bad. We got him hooked in so good. That's probably as good
as I ever hooked anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BKN-NOTEBOOK-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: hooked anybody.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why Are the Nets Stalling?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have not yet asked the Knicks for permission to speak
with Jeff Van Gundy about becoming New Jersey's next head coach,
and who knows if the team will. Any attempt to sway Van Gundy
toward the Meadowlands would most likely involve a concession of
draft picks and cash shipped to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer the Nets go without hiring the interim coach Don
Casey on a permanent basis, the more they are open to speculation
that the club is merely waiting to see what happens with Van
Gundy's future. What must Casey be feeling?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have already offered Phil Jackson a reported $21
million for three seasons, an offer turned town three weeks ago by
Jackson's agent. Rumors of Mike Fratello's returning to his
Hackensack roots are also circulating.
</P>
<P>
   If Nets owner Lewis Katz continues to bide his time with the
interim coach, one wonders if Van Gundy's shadow is going to become
as ominous to Casey's future as Jackson's shadow once was to Van
Gundy's.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Van Gundy's agent, Rob Ades, has been Casey's
personal friend and lawyer for 30 years. If Van Gundy was in the
running, the first thing he would have to do is pick up the phone
and make a courtesy call to Casey, who in turn would finally
realize the truth about his once-noble profession: coaching is now
an incestuous, shady, off-season business in which people respect
their peers while trying to make sure they first cut the best deal
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the Front Office
</P>
<P>
   After all the early season criticism, it is now clear that the
deposed general manager Ernie Grunfeld and Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts made some hard but ultimately wise
decisions when it came to trading away aging veterans in the off
season for an infusion of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby were on the
verge of being declared busts, it is hard to say that they are
long-term cures for the franchise's future. But without them, the
Knicks do not embark on this nice little post-season run.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one wonders how different the Knicks would look in the
championship round with a decent big man coming off the bench. Herb
Williams has been invaluable to the locker room this season during
troubled times and it is admirable that the club has shown that
kind of loyalty to the NBA's elder statesmen, but it is hard to
envision him being a 20-minute role player at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can be done about Charles Oakley, whom the Knicks needed
to move to get Camby. Or Buck Williams, who retired, and Terry
Cummings, who was trade bait for Sprewell. But somewhere, anywhere,
the Knicks could have used a body for the stretch run. &QL;

IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME FOR THE SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Square Garden may be the hallowed Mecca of
basketball, but making the Spurs travel 1,865 miles just to pick up
their NBA championship trophy there seems a little silly.
</P>
<P>
   On a record roll strengthened by 12- and 13-point victories over
the punchless Knicks in Games 1 and 2, the question for the Spurs
now is not whether they will win their first title, just when.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1987 has a team won the first two games of the Finals
by double digits. That Lakers team, led by Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, whipped the Celtics by 13 and 19 en route to a 4-2
series victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the hobbling Knicks denting San Antonio's
armor. Since Sean Elliott's Memorial Day Miracle to beat the
Blazers in the West finals, the Spurs have steamrolled to their
past four victories by an average of 15.2 points and can climax the
NBA's best-ever playoff run at 15-1 with a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the really bad news for New York:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a better, more focused team on the road,'' said San
Antonio guard Mario Elie, whose team takes a commanding 2-0 lead in
the series and a 6-0 road playoff record into tomorrow night's Game
3. ``From an intensity standpoint, we've got to keep grinding. But
from X's and O's, we're in good shape. We've got them looking
around a little confused.''
</P>
<P>
   After their anemic offensive performances in the first two
games, the overmatched Knicks will have to be sneakier than a
Chinese spy and Bobby Valentine combined to steal even one game
against a clearly superior opponent. San Antonio has handcuffed New
York's transition offense into a half-court disaster that is
painful to watch, putting the Knicks on pace to obliterate the
Finals record for fewest points in a four-game series. The
Baltimore Bullets scored 376 in a four-game loss to the Milwaukee
Bucks in 1971. Through two games, the Knicks have 144.
</P>
<P>
   New York's scrambling energy is creating 82 shots per game to
San Antonio's 65, but starting big men Chris Dudley and Larry
Johnson are a combined 3-of-20, leading scorer Latrell Sprewell is
17-of-46 and the Knicks have more turnovers (28) than assists (20).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to score against these guys,'' said
forward Kurt Thomas, ``or those screaming fans will be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Spurs have won a record 12 consecutive playoff games
and that no team since 1977 has rallied from an 0-2 deficit to win
the title, The Alamodome's almost 40,000 fans erupted in chants of
``Sweep, sweep'' late in Game 2. Best and worst
</P>
<P>
   Best strategy: While the Knicks' Sprewell and Marcus Camby tried
to interlock arms in front of him during a free throw, Tim Duncan
played Red Rover and broke through for a crucial offensive rebound
putback that pushed the Spurs' lead from five to seven in the final
2.5 seconds of the third quarter of Game 2.

   Worst strategy: The Knicks' decision to attack the rim early
totally backfired in Game 2. They had four shots blocked, but the
Spurs were called for no fouls in the first quarter, and only had a
Finals record-low 13 fouls in the game. Numbers game 1: Times
during their Texas 12-step that the Spurs have allowed more than 91

   Duncan is averaging 29 points and 15.5 rebounds, but he has a
ways to go to catch the Finals records of 41 points per game by
Michael Jordan in '93 and Bill Russell's 29.5 rebounds per game in
'59. ... Since a 92-86 loss to the Mavericks at Reunion Arena on
April 13, the Spurs are 23-2. ... How lopsided is this Finals? The
Spurs are shooting 45 percent from the field, 65 percent from the
free-throw line, have yet to break 90 and have trailed for only
four minutes.

 &HT;    Bob Bullock, lieutenant governor, average Joe
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The eggs and bacon were frying, the hotcakes
bubbling. Gus Vayas was busy at the grill Saturday, just as he has
been most others during the 20 years he has been the proprietor of
the G-M Steakhouse Breakfast Luncheonette at 624 N. Lamar Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   But the back table, a two-seater with the red-checked
tablecloth, was empty. Bob Bullock, its steady occupant on
Wednesdays and Saturdays for the past four years, died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great Texan and my friend,'' lamented Vayas, 56, as
he flipped hash browns onto a plate. ``Bacon and eggs, extra bacon,
three eggs over easy and coffee. He had the same thing every time.
I started it when I saw his car drive up.''
</P>
<P>
   Vayas and other customers at the rail-thin diner featured in the
cult movie ``Slacker'' remembered Bullock for his easy-going,
average-citizen demeanor, as a guy who chatted about the weather
and news events, but never politics _ even though he was one of the
most powerful men in Texas politics, the lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   He once told a reporter he liked Vayas' place because he could
smoke at the table if he wanted to, something not allowed anymore
at most Austin restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Vayas proudly pointed to a wall near the cash register, where an
autographed photo of Bullock hangs beside an official proclamation
designating his eatery ``the official restaurant of the Senate of
Texas'' _ both gifts from Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock last stopped by about a week ago, Vayas said. Though he
seemed thinner and frail, having just left the hospital a day
earlier, an outgoing Bullock greeted and shook hands as always.
``You're a great Texan. I love Texas,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   And as always, he ``wasn't like the other politicians who get
their nose up in the air. He was just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up at 5 o'clock every morning . . . and work until 9 at
night, every day, seven days a week,'' Vayas said. ``I like to work
hard. (Bullock) liked to work hard. He was a common man. He loved
people. And people liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be with sadness at the passing of a friend that Vayas
plans to attend his friend's funeral today, ``even if I have to
close up.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Turning slowly on her heels, Arlington resident Deanna Hannerly
scanned the portraits on the walls in the Capitol Rotunda. And then
scowled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is he?'' she asked Saturday morning, while touring the
statehouse with her daughter and three grandchildren. ``Bob
Bullock's not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Paintings of Texas' chief executives hang here, and Bob Bullock
was only a lieutenant governor, she was told, and surprise flashed
across her face. ``I thought he was governor,'' said Hannerly, 66.
``Well, he ran Texas like he was. And he did a good job at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He should've been governor. He was a real leader,'' remarked a
nearby kibitzer. ``He was the Average Joe, just like us. Not like
the rest of these fancy politicians up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other tourists in the seat of state government Bullock
called home for so many years nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the reaction Saturday from Capitol tourists _ some of
whom had once met Bullock, most of whom had not, all of whom said
they felt like they knew him well.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio retiree Sam Herrera, 59, explained it this way: ``I
only met him once, about 20 years ago. He shook my hand when he was
campaigning. But I voted for him every time because he did what he
said he would. He kept his promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In crisp detail, Herrera recalled almost every word of the brief
exchange he had with Bullock, in the middle of a steamy day outside
a cafe in Harlingen, near where Herrera grew up and where Bullock
had briefly worked as a lawyer years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shook my hand, told me he needed my help to make Texas a
better place, to help him make sure the tax money was spent
better,'' Herrera said. ``Ever since I always thought of him that
way. He was for the little guys of the world like me.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the public Bullock, the demanding, cajoling
workaholic whom everyone at the Capitol seemed to know or fear,
there was a private man, several friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Castlebury, who worked for Bullock from 1974 until 1994,
from speechwriter at the comptroller's office to the chief of
correspondence in the lieutenant governor's, explains:
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal generosity has been his life's secret. It did not
matter, employee or friend, if he knew you needed help, he was
there. Over the years, I have seen him help with money for
medicine, help them if their kid got in trouble with the law, help
people who got in financial trouble _ $25 or $50, nothing big _ but
he was always willing to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you needed a push for a job, if you needed moral support
and he knew about it, he was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big people usually didn't need any help. This is where he
really helped the little guy, and never asked for anything in
return.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bullock first came to Austin in 1950 or 1951, he was a
little guy.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained during a 1994 interview, Bullock's first state
job was working as a go-fer in the Railroad Commission's mailroom _
while he attended the University of Texas for a semester, majoring
in architecture. ``You couldn't get much lower than the loading
dock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of Bullock's connection to average Texans might be
in the hundreds, possibly thousands, of state employees who once
worked for him, alumni who are now scattered through most state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Like Harry Bradley, 56, superintendent at the State Cemetery,
where Bullock is to be buried today.
</P>
<P>
   After an 11-year career at various state agencies, Bradley
volunteered in Bullock's 1990 campaign for lieutenant governor,
then joined the General Services Commission. When Bullock prodded
state officials to restore the run-down cemetery, Bradley said he
was picked ``because it was Bullock's project, and I'd worked for
Bullock. I've known him and his people for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock influenced state government because of the way he
influenced people . . . by raising the bar so high that only the
best job was acceptable,'' Bradley said. ``He and (legendary
football coach) Vince Lombardi were carbon copies: hard
disciplinarians, tough but the most compassionate people in the
world. And you loved working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those connections could be seen best in the infamous
file of hundreds of thousands of index cards that Bullock
established in 1966 to help then-Lt. Gov. Preston Smith run for
governor. The cards got Bullock in trouble in 1975 when reporters
questioned why state employees were being used to maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Each card listed a name, address, phone number and other
information such as campaign contributions _ a level of detail that
made Bullock famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get a total picture of people on those cards,'' said
Castlebury, now the chief spokesman for Texas' prison system.
``Most of those cards represented average Texans, and to the extent
that Bullock brought about better government services, the little
guy was better served.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Vayas and the Capitol tourists remembered Bullock on
Saturday more as a common Texan like themselves, not as the
well-to-do politician he was, other friends said he truly never
lost touch with his humble roots in Hillsboro _ or the naive young
man visiting the State Capitol for the first time who took off his
shoes and promptly got a splinter in his foot from the wooden
floors.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock could joke about the different world in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Asked once what he thought of a reception for the visiting Queen
of England, Bullock laughed and remarked about the fancy food that
was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would've been just as happy with a foot-long
chilidog from Sonic,'' he said.

 &HT;    Former Texas lieutenant governor to be buried today
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On top of Republic Hill, where live oaks and
cedars provide shade for the state's fallen warriors and most noble
politicians, Bob Bullock will be buried today in the cemetery he
rescued from neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, one of the most powerful forces in Texas politics for
the past 25 years, will take his place behind Stephen F. Austin,
who organized the first Anglo settlement in Texas and became known
as the state's father.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Cemetery, home to 11 governors, two
Revolutionary War veterans and 64 Republic of Texas veterans, is
the state's foremost shrine to its dignitaries and a popular
tourist attraction and educational institution. For Bullock, the
former lieutenant governor who died Friday at 69, it was a beloved
oasis away from the rigors of the Capitol. He often sought refuge
in its pastoral landscape, strolling and ruminating in peace and
allowing the names etched on tombstones to spark memory and inspire
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's grave is on top of Republic Hill, the most prestigious
area in a cemetery that requires its entombed to have been elected
to the state legislature or to ``have made a significant
contribution to Texas culture and history as determined by the
State Cemetery Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt this was hallowed ground,'' said Bullock's longtime
friend Ralph Wayne, the head of the Texas Civil Justice League and
a former state senator from Plainview. ``He is in heaven, but his
remains are here. And he wouldn't want them anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock will be buried directly between Edward Burleson, who
died in 1851 and was the first ever to be buried at Texas State
Cemetery, and Stephen Williams, who fought in the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812 and the Siege of Bexar.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, as the teeth of the backhoe began digging
Bullock's grave, it was Wayne's turn to reminisce about the most
recent Texas legend to pass away.
</P>
<P>
   He was with Bullock on Tuesday. When he asked if Bullock was
breathing all right, Bullock, in his typical tough-guy fashion,
ignored the question and asked about Wayne's wife and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Give them a hug for me,''' Wayne recalled. ``Can you
believe that? Here he is with an oxygen mask on his face and he's
thinking about others. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of people here Sunday,'' Wayne continued.
``But that's only the beginning. They'll be coming for weeks and
months after that to say goodbye privately. He just touched so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As mourners make their way to his grave, they'll pass some of
the great protagonists in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who governed as he lived _ with gusto and heart _ will
be among the tombs of a lawyer who took on the Ku Klux Klan (Dan
Moody), a U.S. senator (Ralph Yarborough), the woman who designed
and made the first Texas Lone Star flag (Joanna Troutman) and the
first black woman from the south elected to Congress (Barbara
Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can come out here and, in one day, learn more about Texas
history than in a whole semester of class,'' Bullock once said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thousands of school children each year participate in a
history program at the cemetery, 909 Navasota St.
</P>
<P>
   That was his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock told me I had to do two things out here,'' said
Harry Bradley, the cemetery's superintendent, who also worked on
Bullock's campaigns. ``He told me to be helpful to people and give
guided history tours of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Just over two weeks ago, Bullock visited the cemetery and _ as
he had countless times before _ he ``walked around, talking about
this guy buried over here, that guy buried over there,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was big on Texas history. And there's a lot of history out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bullock, ever mindful of detail, was just as likely to
mention that the grass needed to be mowed or a fence mended or
litter picked up on the cemetery grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who was accompanied by his wife, Jan, during that
visit, ``was walking a little slower,'' but he spent more than two
hours reminiscing in what will become his final resting place,
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   His affinity for the cemetery became public four years ago when
he prodded state officials into a $4.7 million renovation project
that began in 1994. But the cemetery, which had begun to show its
age, had been a long-running interest.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Castlebury, a former Bullock aide who is chief spokesman
for Texas' prison system, said Bullock was making frequent
late-afternoon treks to the cemetery in the 1960s to talk history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of his favorite deals,'' recalled Castlebury,
then a reporter for the Austin American-Statesman. ``He'd call and
say, ``Let's go get a beer,' and we'd grab a hamburger and a
six-pack and go to the cemetery, to picnic tables on the west side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew great stories about a lot of the people buried out
there. ... He was a great storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he departed Bullock's staff in 1994, Bullock had orders
for the cemetery: ``I was on my way out the door. He told me he
wanted me to find some way to have inmates work out there. And
that's exactly the message I conveyed to (then-prisons director)
Andy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bullock said he was always intrigued by Texas history, it
was his appointment to the Texas Historical Commission in the 1960s
by then-Gov. John Connally, whose tomb lies near Bullock's, that
spurred much of his subsequent interest in historical preservation.
Bullock went on to champion the Capitol restoration project in
addition to the Texas State Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   That project gained momentum after he attended the funeral of
Harry Whitworth, the former state representative and lobbyist who
died in 1994. During the next three years, he spearheaded the
renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did more for this cemetery than anyone else,'' Bradley
said. ``This is where he ought to be. There is no other place.''
</P>
<P>
   A visitor's center, made of limestone, was built and modeled
after the Alamo barracks. About 2,200 Confederate graves were
restored. And a grand entrance called the Columbarium Wall was
erected.
</P>
<P>
   Today, mourners will pass through that wall's archway, march
along a path lined by 50 Texas flags and loop around to Republic
Hill Section 1, Row Q, Plot 11, where Bullock's remains will be
lowered into a hole 44 inches wide and nine feet long.
</P>
<P>
   They will also pass a flagpole 150 feet tall that Bullock could
see from his office in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Bullock wanted the flagpole installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished it at 9:30 at night in the rain, because I
promised he'd be able to see it the next morning,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Like flags all over the state, it is flying at half-staff.

 &HT;    Bullock opened doors to women, minorities
 &HT;    (Eds: Funeral is Sunday.)
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To Charles Miles and so many other minorities
and women, Bob Bullock was not just another legendary Texas
politician.
</P>
<P>
   He was opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock started the trend among state agencies to hire and
promote women and minorities,'' said Miles, 59, whom Bullock hired
in 1974 as one of six assistant comptrollers. ``Bullock didn't just
bring them in as entry-level employees. He put them in high
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles, owner of the Capital City Argus weekly newspaper, said
when he went to work for Bullock, the agency had fewer than 50
African Americans and Hispanics. When he left a year later, there
were more than 200 out of about 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   As Texans today pay their respects to the man whose financial
and political acumen made him a household name and whose service to
Texas won him respect from Democrats and Republicans, Texans of a
darker hue and different gender are remembering Bullock as the man
who opened doors of opportunity when few others would.
</P>
<P>
   More than once he told employees he tackled equal opportunity so
fiercely to make up for his segregationist roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock was the first head of a state agency to aggressively
hire women and minorities,'' said Cecelia Burke, a former Bullock
employee and the first woman to be elected Travis County tax
assessor-collector. ``He was a visionary who found the brightest
and best, then gave them opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The country boy from Hillsboro did more than break down
entrenched racial and gender barriers in state government.
Throughout his career as comptroller and later as lieutenant
governor, Bullock rose time and again to defend state contracting
and employment programs aimed at assisting minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, that might seem a politically safe _ if
not smart _ bet. But it was the early 1970s. Austin was
experiencing race riots as whites resisted integrating public
schools. A former comptroller had called then-Rep. Eddie Bernice
Johnson, a Dallas Democrat, ``a stupid nigger woman'' when she
pushed the agency to hire women. The University of Texas was in the
early stages of integration, still with segregated dormitories.
Blacks and women _ even college educated _ largely were relegated
to menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was in such a climate that Bullock plowed ahead, hiring
blacks, Hispanics and women into well-paying and secure jobs. And
he did so disarmingly, maintaining a good ol' boy demeanor while
reaching out to what he would later describe as Texas' rich
diversity. Bullock is credited with reshaping the face of state
government to look more like the population it served and expanding
a burgeoning minority middle class in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock set the trend for what was to follow,'' said Nelda
Wells Spears, Travis County tax assessor-collector. She remembers
that it was Bullock who first opened the door of opportunity to a
public service career which ultimately would result in her being
the first African American in Texas elected to the post she now
holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a (bachelor's) and a master's degree, but could not find
meaningful, well-paying work,'' said Spears, 52. ``Then came
Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears was called to an interview on Christmas Eve 1974 she
never will forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining, and I was nervous,'' she recounted. ``When I
walked in, there was Bob Bullock, working on Christmas Eve day. He
hired me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears quickly rose through the ranks and became director of
personnel. During her nearly five-year tenure, she saw the agency
transformed from one that was ``lily white'' to the most ethnically
and gender diverse of all state agencies, ``in a very short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other state agencies followed suit, Miles and others said, but
when they didn't _ well, Bullock convinced them it was the right
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened his agency up and he was proud of it,'' said Bill
Aleshire, former County Travis county judge who as a young man
worked for Bullock. ``Because he was comptroller, he was able to
use that position to shake up other agencies. He would get
interested in how they were performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles said Bullock's ``contributions to equal opportunity in
employment surely make him a civil rights figure.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bullock was civil rights mover, then he was an unlikely one.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hillsboro in 1929, Bullock was reared in a segregated
farming community during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas was different back then,'' Bullock said in a 1994
interview. ``I was straight in from Hillsboro. I didn't even ride
in an elevator until after I was out of high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock came to Austin in 1957 after being elected to the Texas
House. He later told Miles and others who asked why he worked so
ferociously to open doors for minorities that he had been a
segregationist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, I probably voted for all of those (segregationist)
bills,'' he said in the interview. ``Wish I hadn't now.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles said: ``He sat me down and said, 'Charlie, I never saw a
segregation bill I didn't like. I can't go back. I can't change
that. But I can make things right now.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Miles, Burke, Spears and a host of other women and minorities
were the beneficiaries of Bullock's hiring and promoting policies,
which they and others say helped expand Austin's minority middle
class. But millions more have benefited from economic and
educational policies he helped create, and later saved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, minority lawmakers succeeded in creating a state
program aimed at directing more state contracts to businesses owned
by women and minorities. The program lacked teeth. In 1993, when
Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, was a freshmen, he wanted to strengthen
the program but didn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the hell I was doing,'' West recalls. ``But
Bullock did. With his assistance, I amended the budget so that the
program for the first time had goals for state agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bullock put his muscle behind another West initiative,
which created teaching centers at historically black colleges and
universities. The centers train teachers especially for work in
inner-city schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the demographics of Texas were changing,
becoming more urban and more minority,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   But long before that, Bullock got involved in fighting for equal
rights, Johnson said. When, as a state senator, she tried to pass
legislation in 1987 laying the foundation for the state contracting
program, senators would blow her off, refusing to come to her
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would break quorum,'' she said, ``so I went to Mr.
Bullock. Back then, women and minorities weren't getting any state
contracts. It was a good ol' boy network.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock gathered together all the senators for a discussion and
directed all to talk about their most important bills. With the
senators present and under Bullock's watchful eye, she got the
committee hearing and the votes to pass the language into law.
Bullock also was instrumental in setting up Johnson's district,
Dallas' first black congressional district, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morin, executive director of the Texas Association of
Mexican American Chambers of Commerce, said Bullock helped save
that same state contracting program when Republicans attempted to
dismantle it in 1997. The program has steered billions of dollars
to businesses owned by women and minorities since its inception in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Wardaleen Belvin, a top aide to Bullock, said her boss was
deeply concerned that Texas would retreat from equal opportunity
programs and end up in a racial feud similar to California's highly
publicized affirmative action wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him sitting me down and saying, 'I don't know what
it's like to be black. I don't know what it's like to feel racial
discrimination. I can't change the past. But I can do what is
right, and I promise you I will do everything I can to make this
right.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bullock set the stage for a compromise this year
that brought Democrats and Republicans together and salvaged the
state contracting program. That was the Bullock style, which
minorities say is his lasting legacy to Texas, a state where
African Americans and Hispanics will form the majority within 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a civil rights activist in his own right,'' said U.S.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston. ``He set the tone that it was
OK that all of us _ African Americans, Hispanics, women and white
men _ live under the Texas flag.''

   Marcus Camby was moving with the wobbly and awkward steps of a
newborn colt as he drove into the paint and nearly fell down while
twisting and turning, all in an effort to get off a shot that would
find the net before David Robinson and Tim Duncan found it.
</P>
<P>
   The two Spurs did not have to work hard on this late-game
occasion Friday night. The shot squirted into the air like a bar of
soap that got away and landed on top of the backboard before
kissing the shot clock. But this is what Robinson and Duncan do.
They make a fool out of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was trying. So was Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas and Chris
Childs. But they were a combined 5 for 26 in the Knicks' Game 2
loss to San Antonio, and they made for a shaky support group for
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure on Allan and Sprewell to score,''
said Mario Elie, who continually funneled Houston inside on the
baseline where Robinson and Duncan were waiting for him. ``Those
guys are terrific players, but I always say that two can't beat
12.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell and Houston have to keep playing on their own _ as
they did in Game 2 to finish a combined 17 for 42 from the field _
the Knicks will be in a potentially devastating situation when they
play Game 3 of the four-of-seven-game National Basketball
Association finals on Monday at Madison Square Garden. Even as the
crowd filtered out of the dome Friday night, there were chants of
``Sweep'' by the Spurs fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys on this team have a lot of pride,'' Camby said. ``We
don't want to get swept, and I don't think that's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Down two games to none, the Knicks maintained a feisty good
spirit on the surface, but they have to find some points from
alternate sources to give themselves a chance against the Spurs.
Although they are banged up, the Knicks can tap a few options. The
obvious one is Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 2, he was as alone on the perimeter as a scarecrow
in a field but on a sprained knee he had little lift when he
launched 7 3-pointers and hit just 1. With two days of rest, he may
feel better for Game 3 and get a hit of adrenaline from the home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Childs could also be a threat. He was able to dart inside for
open looks on runners but missed when he noticed Robinson and
Duncan closing in on him. He finished 2 for 8. If he can spot up
and knock down a 3-pointer, Childs _ or Charlie Ward, for that
matter _ could give the Knicks a little boost. If Houston and
Sprewell can drive-and-kick the ball out, Childs poses much more of
a threat outside, than going inside against the Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great lane intimidation as far as making each shot
in the paint difficult,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I thought we
had some good looks in there. But nothing comes easy with those two
guys there.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier on themselves, the Knicks could run a
pick-and-roll now and again and be less predictable. So far,
Robinson and Duncan have been able to lurk in the background and
await the one-on-one drives of Sprewell and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Thomas could diffuse some of that predictability
with his ability to nail a base-line jumper. Thomas was 1 for 6 in
Game 1, but if the mood hits him, he is capable of scoring in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just need a third or fourth guy to help,'' Elie said.
``Larry is not 100 percent. Kurt is a role player. Maybe Camby, but
he just does a great job giving them energy on the offensive
boards. We can't let Allan or Sprewell beat us. We've got to try
and make Kurt Thomas, Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has stepped forward so far. Camby was the X factor in the
Knicks' Indiana series, but has had trouble staying out of foul
trouble when matched against Robinson. He has had difficulty making
a shot without wondering when and if it &UR;  &LR; will be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two guys in there like they have, you worry
about them blocking shots and altering the shot,'' Camby said.
``It's tough to get into the lane. But then when you get to the
lane, you still have to face two intimidators inside and try to
shoot over them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Camby, those shots are usually putbacks. With the quickness
of Duncan, those second-chance shots can end up partly blocked. In
Game 3, Camby may have more plays run for him, and may be more
effective down the stretch if he can avoid early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It's that final stretch that has been the melting point for the
Knicks. As the games have worn on, Houston and Sprewell have begun
to wilt under the Spurs' 48-minutes of defensive pressure. In the
fourth quarters of Games 1 and 2, Houston was 1 for 7 and Sprewell
was 4 for 13. They've fallen into the Spurs plan to wear out the
Knicks by the fourth quarter in an effort to steal their energy for
a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made some mistakes at the end, like dribbling off their
foot or trying to make something happen,'' Robinson said. ``You can
see those type of things starting to take effect after a long
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another long night ended Friday. The Knicks were left to wander
off the court with visions of Robinson and Duncan still fresh in
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are right now, we have to be efficient and get some
unexpected scoring, as we did the other night from Kurt,'' said Van
Gundy, referring to Thomas' 13 points in Game 1. ``We have to have
some other guys who are going to put the ball in the basket,
especially when they come to block shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will come.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley played just 13 minutes in Game 2 with a bruised
elbow that limited his mobility throughout the game. Dudley is just
another in a line of banged-up Knicks. The team dressed 10 players
for Game 2, but have just 8 of them playing healthy. ``Obviously,
you'd like to have your full complement,'' Jeff Van Gundy said.
``But the one thing I've learned in the NBA is that there's no
mercy. Nor should there be. As I've told our team, it's not about
who we have or don't have, it's who we have to play. We have to
play better.''  &QL;

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ When Steve Stricker teed off in Saturday's
third round of the U.S. Open, he was six strokes off the lead. When
he birdied the second hole, he was five behind. And when his 8-iron
shot into the wind out of a fairway bunker from 136 yards spun into
the cup on the 335-yard third hole for an eagle 2, he suddenly was
only three strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that go in, you don't expect that,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   And on a windy afternoon that had scores soaring at Pinehurst
No. 2, you do not expect any golfer to shoot one-under-par 69, but
that's what Stricker did. He was the only golfer to shoot under par
for the day and, with a 54-hole total of 212, he is three strokes
behind the leader, Payne Stewart, entering Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I shot the round of the year,'' Stricker
said. ``I feel great that I shot a 69, but getting off to the start
I did really fueled my whole round. I mean, three under through
three, you don't expect to start off that way. But it got me into
position to shoot 69.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker, 32, is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour. He has been
on the leader board in three of the last five major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Open at Olympic, Stricker also shot 69 in the
third round, for 213, six shots off Stewart's lead. He finished
with a 73 that tied for fifth as Lee Janzen won. At last year's
Professional Golfers' Association Championship, he shared the
third-round lead with Vijay Singh and closed with a 70, but
finished second to Singh by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shinnecock in '95, that was extremely difficult as
well _ windy, extremely fast greens,'' he said, referring to the
1995 Open. ``But this is one of the toughest courses I've ever
played, if not the toughest.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pros complained that some of the hole locations were
unfair, but Stricker disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how reasonable they are,'' he said, ``but they're
fair. But the pins are put in positions where you have to play
extremely smart. If you don't, if you try to be too greedy, you're
going to pay the price. You have to take your 20- and 30- and
40-footers and two-putt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got on tour, I couldn't handle that. I thought,
this isn't golf. They force you into situations that you're not
comfortable with, but I've learned to deal with that over the years
because everybody has got to play it. They're trying to find out
who the toughest person is mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker acknowledged being too aggressive on the 16th and 17th
holes, which he bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking 3-iron all the time on 16,'' he said of the
489-yard hole, the longest par-4 in Open history. ``I ended up
taking a 2-iron and trying to get it all the way back there to the
hole and it went over the green too far. On 17, I tried to stuff it
in there. I should have put it in the center of the green and tried
to make a 20-footer. But maybe that's a lesson I learned for
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson for if, and when, the Open returns to Pinehurst No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the Open come back here,'' Stricker said. ``I
think it's going to bring out the best winner _ the person who
thinks his way around, who hits it probably better than anybody
during that week, although I've probably proven that theory wrong.
I don't feel I'm hitting enough fairways and greens. I'm doing it
with my short game.'' &QL;

STATE ACCUSED OF APPROVING CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHOUT PUBLIC COMMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A loose coalition of legislators, school and union
officials charged Saturday that New York state officials violated
state law when they approved the state's first eight charter
schools last week without providing a chance for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   State officials denied the charge, saying that since the
charters had not been formally issued, there was still time for
public input. But the dispute, and the threat of legal action by
teachers' unions, could delay the first three charter schools _ two
in New York City and one in Albany _ from opening in September as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools get public subsidies and independence from local
school districts, as long as they meet academic objectives outlined
in their charter, or operating permit.
</P>
<P>
   State law calls for school districts to be notified before
charters are issued and at every ``significant'' step in the
approval process. The idea, state education officials said
Saturday, was for parents, community leaders and educators to be
able to endorse the schools or to describe any adverse impact they
might have on the community and existing schools before a decision
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, which was adopted in December, up to 50 charters
can be granted by the trustees of the State University of New York
and up to 50 more by the State Board of Regents. The SUNY trustees
approved the eight charter schools, out of 15 applications, on
Tuesday. The names of the applicants were kept confidential until
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials confirmed that the vote occurred before any
school districts had been notified in writing that the applications
had been filed. In some cases, notice was given by telephone before
the vote, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who charged that state law was violated have consulted one
another about the issue, but have not agreed to act together
formally. Some oppose charter schools; others support them under
certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sanders, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and
a Manhattan Democrat, said that he was troubled by what he called
the secrecy surrounding the approval process and that he would ask
the state attorney general to review it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is suggesting that these schools ought not at some
point be allowed to open up,'' Sanders said. ``But it is now
clearly precipitous for that to happen this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki called the issue
``nothing more than a red herring.'' The spokesman, Charles H.
Deister, added, ``Unfortunately, there are always going to be
defenders of the status quo who oppose innovative ideas in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of
Teachers, the New York City teachers' union, said the UFt and the
New York State United Teachers were contemplating legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is what was there to hide?'' Ms. Amlung
said. ``Why the big rush? These are public schools. So it's
impossible right now for the public or for parents to say whether
these are good programs, whether they have high academic
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy G. Kremer, executive director of the New York State
School Boards Association, said several school districts had
complained about not receiving advance notice of charter schools
planned for their districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a small matter,'' Sanders said. ``The charter
school law required full disclosure and input by the local school
district and community prior to any charter being issued. SUNY
either willfully ignored this requirement, or in its rush to open
charter schools this fall, it neglected to follow all the necessary
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Steffey, president of the Charter Schools Institute, a
newly created arm of the state university, said that the law had
not been violated because the charter documents had not been
issued. He said applications were due at the end of May and that he
thought it was important to move quickly to approve them, even
before soliciting comment, so that charter schools would have time
to prepare to open in September.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was still time for public notification and comment
before the applications go before the Regents for another review on
July 15. If significant objections arise, he said, the approvals
could be revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the vote was on Tuesday was a vote to empower the
president of the Charter Schools Institute, me, to enter into a
charter with the approved applicants,'' Steffey said. ``I have not
done so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regents have 60 days to raise objections to the charters,
and SUNY has 30 days to answer in writing. But SUNY can issue the
charters over the objections of the Regents after the full 90 days
have expired.
</P>
<P>
   State law calls for the SUNY trustees to notify school districts
that would be affected by a charter school ``at each significant
stage of the chartering process.'' It also says that the district
must have the opportunity to comment on the proposed charter and
that it can choose to hold public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for New York City schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew, said Crew still had not been notified by SUNY
of the five charter schools to be located in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the law never intended for the local school
district to be in the dark,'' Ms. Coletti said. ``This elaborate
concealment could be a violation of the spirit of the law, if not
the letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffey acknowledged that none of the school district
superintendents had been formally notified until Saturday, at the
earliest. Letters were sent out either by mail or by fax Saturday,
or would be sent out Monday, he said.

   &UR; NO PICNIC ON MOUNT KENYA &LR;  By Felice Benuzzi. Lyons, $14.95. In
1943 the author and two Italian compatriots escaped from a British
POW camp and embarked on a loony quest to scale Mount Kenya and
plant their nation's flag on its summit, knowing they would
eventually wind up in solitary. This lively account is both a
ripping yarn and a self-mocking survival tale. ``Gay adventure,
this, with the quality of truth,'' Robert Payne wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIS SIDE OF BRIGHTNESS &LR;  By Colum McCann. Owl/Holt, $13. This
gritty, intense novel by a young Irish writer chronicles the
eroding fortunes of three generations of a disturbed family whose
members once helped to build the New York City subway system but
now live in its darkened tunnels. ``This Side of Brightness'' is a
``deft feat of balance and fancy footwork,'' David Willis
McCullough wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year. ``It
is also a disturbingly beautiful portrait of a family whose dreams
are never quite able to stae off the painful reality of their
circumstances, a portrait that ends without sentimentality and yet
with renewed hope.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNFINISHED PRESIDENCY: JIMMY CARTER'S JOURNEY BEYOND THE
WHITE HOUSE &LR;  By Douglas Brinkley. Penguin, $15.95. This account of
the ex-president's second career as poet, teacher and crusader for
human rights also explores the two sides of his personality: his
Christian values and his fierce egotism. ``Even Carter's severest
critics ... will find it hard to be unmoved by his blend of
idealism and practicality,'' Godfrey Hodgson wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE OR WHEN &LR;  By Anita Shreve. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
Thirty-one years after a brief teen-age romance, an insurance
broker and a lonely poet rekindle their affair, first through
letters and then in the flesh. ``Throughout this finely wrought
book, Ms. Shreve manages to keep the reader suspended between
despair and hope'' for her characters, Susan Isaacs wrote in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RINGS OF SATURN &LR;  By W.G. Sebald. New Directions, $14. This
hybrid of fiction, travel, biography, myth and memoir follows the
writer on a walking tour of the English coast but mostly sails
through space and time as he ruminates on everything from silk to
Joseph Conrad. ``The book is so natural and accessible ... that one
is left enchanted,'' Roberta Silman wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUSE OF SLEEP &LR;  By Jonathan Coe. Vintage Contemporaries,
$13. This intricate novel follows the loosely connected lives of
four characters _ among them a narcoleptic woman and a dream addict
who sleeps at least 14 hours a day _ and their shared preoccupation
with dreamland. ``Coe has written a witty, engaging romance,''
Suzanne Berne wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOURGEOIS EXPERIENCE: VICTORIA TO FREUD. VOLUME 1:
EDUCATION OF THE SENSES &LR;  By Peter Gay. Norton, $16. The first of
five volumes in the author's provocative study of the American and
European middle classes from the 1820s to World War I focuses on
Victorian sexuality in all its extravagant and surprising variety.
He calls his approach ``history informed by psychoanalysis,'' and
he goes a long way toward disproving stereotypes about the era's
sexless femininity. ``There has been no inquiry of this majestic
import and ambition before,'' Neil McKendrick wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; VOLUME 2: THE TENDER PASSION &LR;  ($16), Gay takes on
19th-century attitudes toward love and argues that bourgeois
marriages were more stable and rewarding (for men and women) than
most people believe. Gay ``shows himself splendidly resourceful in
conjuring up the intimate worlds of these individuals,'' Paul
Robinson wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BALLAD OF PECKHAM RYE &LR;  By Muriel Spark. New Directions,
$11.95. Set in a working-class London suburb, this frothy comic
novel describes the havoc caused when a textile company hires a
young Scottish consultant ``to bring vision into the lives of the
workers.'' In 1960 the reviewer Gerald Sykes called this a ``genial
popular entertainment of, imaginably, the Alec Guinness kind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIRTH OF BEBOP: A SOCIAL AND MUSICAL HISTORY &LR;  By Scott
DeVeaux. University of California, $18.95. This scholarly study
traces the shift from swing to be-bop in New York in the 1940s,
focusing on musicians like Charlie ``Bird'' Parker, Dizzy Gillespie
and others who transformed the jazz landscape. The book discusses
jazz ``the way musicians have talked about it, not as a matter of
schools and eras but as a slow-boiling stew of experience,'' Ben
Ratliff wrote last year in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CELEBRATING BIRD: THE TRIUMPH OF CHARLIE PARKER &LR; , by Gary
Giddins (Da Capo, $17.95), is an incisive portrait of the legendary
saxophonist that addresses both his musical genius and his tragic
life. In 1987 the reviewer Jason Berry called this ``as penetrating
a character study of Bird as any yet written.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAMBS OF GOD &LR;  By Marele Day. Riverhead, $12.95. Three nuns
living in a crumbling convent on a remote island find their
solitude threatened by a young priest who arrives out of nowhere
with plans to turn the property into a luxury resort. The result is
a ``marvelous novel'' that is ``affecting and humorous and always
absorbing,'' Julie Gray wrote last year.

CO-FAVORITE HAS TROUBLE BUT STILL WINS ITS OPENER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ China, the co-favorite to win the Women's
World Cup, almost failed to win its opening first-round match
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Sweden a goal in the second minute, China battled back
for a difficult 2-1 victory at Spartan Stadium. Midfielder Liu
Ailing scored the go-ahead goal in the 69th minute, and Sweden
could not answer against acrobatic China goalkeeper Hong Gao.
</P>
<P>
   With speed, experience, technical skill and the fitness that
comes from a nine-game, 48-day prep tour, China is considered a
likely opponent for the United States in the final at the Rose Bowl
on July 10. China has beaten the United States in two of three
matches this year.
</P>
<P>
   In what shaped up as a defensive struggle between teams with two
of the best goalkeepers in the tournament, the game started like a
shootout. Sweden opened aggressively, controlled the midfield and
stunned China with the second-fastest score in Women's World Cup
history.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Kristin Bengtsson intercepted a deflected pass from
defender Fan Yunjie 30 yards in front of the Chinese goal, briefly
dribbled closer, then buried a crisp line drive into the upper left
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes into the match, however, a different China team
emerged. Midfielder Zhao Lihong found a soft spot on the left wing
and repeatedly tested the Swedish defense, creating shot
opportunities that kept keeper Ulrika Karlsson busy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th minute, the pressure was converted into a goal.
Midfielder Liu Ying launched a corner kick that crossed in front of
the goal, where forward Jin Yan had slipped away from defender
Cecilia Sandell. Yin headed the pass over Karlsson to even the
score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the first half was spent primarily on Sweden's side
of the field, with the inability of Yan and forward Sun Wen to
finish off several easy chances keeping Sweden in the match.
</P>
<P>
   China took the lead in the 69th minute. Liu Ailing took a short
pass from Liu Ying and lofted a touch shot over Karlsson, who had
drifted 10 yards in front of the goal, and the ball found the
center of the net.
</P>
<P>
   This was the latest in what has developed into quite a rivalry.
In the 1991 Women's World Cup, won by the United States, Sweden
eliminated host China in the quarterfinals, a loss so devastating
that China shut down its women's national team program for two
years. In the 1995 Women's World Cup, China eliminated host Sweden
in the quarterfinals, and in the 1996 Olympics, China beat Sweden
on the way to the silver medal.

IRABU BREAKS A SMILE, AND YANKS RELAX, TOO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu has always been an enigma to his
teammates, hidden behind a language barrier he has rarely attempted
to traverse. But Irabu is emerging from his shell, and whether it
is a coincidence or not, it's coming at a time when he is becoming
a significant contributor in the Yankees' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu permitted three hits and one earned run in seven innings
as the Yankees placed another stake through the walking dead
Anaheim Angels, in a 6-2 victory Saturday night at Yankee Stadium.
Derek Jeter, the Yankees' new No. 3 hitter, had two runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, decimated by injury and beset by clubhouse turmoil,
have lost six consecutive games. The Yankees, on the other hand,
are gaining steam, propelled by their starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rotation has compiled a 2.55 ERA over its last
421/3 innings; from David Cone to Roger Clemens to Orlando
Hernandez to Irabu, all the starters are going good.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu began throwing a cut fastball about three weeks ago and
refined his mechanics, working to keep his weight back longer in
the middle of his delivery. But the most significant change in
Irabu, some teammates say, is that he seems far more relaxed.
Silent and sullen for most of his first two years with the Yankees,
Irabu appears to be having fun playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi mentioned it last week, after watching Irabu warm up
in the bullpen. ``Hey, Boo-Boo is smiling,'' Girardi said to Mel
Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. When Irabu pitched against the
Texas Rangers last week, he pointed to his infielders to
congratulate them _ ``Nice play,'' Irabu said in English to third
baseman Scott Brosius, something he had never done before.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, after Paul O'Neill had a couple of hits, Irabu
told his interpreter, George Rose, ``Watch this.'' Irabu walked
over to O'Neill, held up a fist _ this is the Yankees' way of
recognizing one another for a good effort _ and said, ``Nice
game.'' With a grin, Irabu said to Rose, ``I've never done that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre believes Irabu (4-3) is getting more comfortable
with his teammates, and more confident _ and all of that is
manifesting itself in how he is performing. On June 8 he allowed
two runs in five and a third innings against Philadelphia, then
stifled the Rangers six days later, and he won again Saturday
night, despite some relatively ordinary stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When Irabu is right, when he dominates, he throws a fastball 92
to 95 mph to either side of the plate, and with two strikes, will
use his diving split-fingered fastball and tempt opposing batters
into swinging and missing. Against the Angels, his splitter was
erratic, often bouncing in front of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels threatened in the first and second innings last
night. Irabu pinched off the rally both times. With runners at
first and second and one out in the first, Irabu got Todd Greene to
fly out to center and then broke the bat of Garret Anderson on a
grounder back to the mound. With a runner at third and one out in
the second, Irabu used his fastball to jam Matt Walbeck into a
short flyout to left field. By the time the Angels did get on the
board, on Greene's home run in the fourth, the Yankees already had
a lead that must have looked insurmountable to the last-place
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Omar Olivares pitched well against the Yankees at the
Stadium on May 13, and when Manager Joe Torre brought in his
infield in the second inning last night, it was a sign that Torre
was leery of another strong outing by Olivares. But the
right-hander waded into trouble in almost every inning, some of the
mess created by his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the Angels' center fielder, loped in to catch an easy
fly by O'Neill to open the second inning _ and simply dropped it,
like a youngster losing the head off an ice cream cone. O'Neill
stole second. Chili Davis pulled a grounder to the right side to
advance O'Neill to third. Terry Collins, the manager of the Angels,
ordered his infield in, and Jorge Posada bounced a single through
the right side, scoring O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, moved from cleanup to the No. 2 spot in the
Yankees' lineup in part because he is not getting enough extra-base
hits, slammed a line drive to right-center one out into the third
inning, the ball leaving an indent in the padding as it bounced off
the top of the wall; Williams slid into second base headfirst with
a double. Jeter, shifted from No. 2 to No. 3 because Torre is
seeking more run production, singled to score Williams and give the
Yankees a 2-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finished off Olivares in the sixth, turning a 3-1
lead into one of 5-1. Brosius and Chuck Knoblauch singled, Williams
rammed a double to drive home Brosius, and, following a pitching
change, Knoblauch scored on Jeter's sacrifice fly. Yankees 5,
Angels 1.

EARLY WARNING SIGNS: ODOM HAD ALREADY STARTED TO DESTRUCT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you think the erratic behavior displayed by
Lamar Odom this week hurt his draft status, think again. Odom had
already begun to slip before his 11th-hour decision to try to
return to Rhode Island for another year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls had apparently already decided to either
select Maryland's Steve Francis, or better yet, trade the pick
before Odom canceled his workout with the club and announced he
would try to regain his college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice try by Odom, considering he had signed last month
with agent Jeff Klein, a major violation by NCAA standards. His
case was so weak that even Rhode Island refused to present an
appeal to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Odom was injured, and that was why he
canceled workouts with the Bulls and Charlotte. But it turned out
to be false. He has already rescheduled with both teams this week,
so chalk up this strange display to immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Odom? Barring an exceptional workout, he
will not be taken by the Bulls. Chicago is busy hammering Toronto
to send it Tracy McGrady and the No. 5 pick, so the Raptors can
select Francis.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto is reluctant to part with McGrady, especially since
he is close to rookie of the year Vince Carter, who the Raptors
want to keep happy at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility that Bulls GM Jerry Krause will
select Francis, and then trade him later. Either way, the Bulls are
putting a ``for sale'' sign on their draft pick, something
considered unlikely when they won the lottery last month.
</P>
<P>
   The team watching all of this with great amusement is Vancouver,
which has the second pick. The Grizzlies were thought to be certain
to trade their choice for a power forward, but now that Odom has
slipped they may decide to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Odom had a better-than-average workout with the Grizzlies before
he went AWOL, and a good interview with Grizzlies GM Stu Jackson.
Vancouver thinks he could play three positions (shooting guard,
small forward, power forward), and likes the idea of pairing him
with Mike Bibby and Shareef Abdur-Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Charlotte, which is ignoring offers for the No. 3
selection, and would be perfectly happy to take Baron Davis. The
Hornets would also take Odom if he slides down that far.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have the Clippers. They have no chance of landing
Francis or Davis without moving up, and desperately need a point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   But forward Wally Szczerbiak is the best-player available when
the Clippers' name pops up on the draft board, thereby presenting a
dilemma. Should they take Andre Miller or Jason Terry a little
higher than they are valued, or select Szczerbiak?
</P>
<P>
   Option No. 3 might be better? Trade the pick.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota considered sending Terrell Brandon and the No.6 pick
to the Clippers for Lorenzen Wright and the No. 4 pick, but that
was when there was hope Davis or Francis might slip a few spots.
</P>
<P>
   Put down your Dukes: Two players who have caused the most
intrigue are Duke's Elton Brand and Corey Maggette. Brand has been
knocked for his size, but last week in Chicago, the Bulls said he
was actually 6-foot-8\. He also had a 7-5 horizontal reach and
vertical reach of more than 9 feet, which is typical of 7-foot
centers. That means Brand is back in the top five, and the the
Bulls are even considering him again.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette, however, has not been so fortunate. He has been woeful
from the outside during workouts, and has still not signed with an
agent, although he said he still has no thoughts of returning to
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to be a taken in the lower half of the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks had their point: While the Knicks struggle with Charlie
Ward and Chris Childs at point guard, they probably can't help but
think what would have happened if the NBA had avoided a lockout.
The Knicks were set to sign Oded Katash, a 6-5 Israeli who is
considered the best point guard in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA season appeared doomed, Katash signed with Maccabi
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The Glove stays in Seattle: Despite all the speculation, Seattle
intends to keep point guard Gary Payton. Sonics executive Wally
Walker said he will keep Payton and forward Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Much less certain is whether Hersey Hawkins will return
(doubtful), or if the Sonics will keep the 13th pick, which they
believe is too low to get a quality player.

PROSECUTING MENTALLY ILL IS INSANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in August 1997, 29-year-old Carrie May didn't report to
work at a local convenience store, and instead locked herself in
her Phoenix apartment, put a newly purchased pistol to her head
and, speaking through the closed front door, told her mother she
was going to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie May has been trying to kill herself since she was 16,
when she slit her wrists. She spent time in a mental hospital and,
after about a year, tried to slit her wrists again.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 18 or so, she augmented the slashing by injecting
herself with lighter fluid.
</P>
<P>
   In her 20s, she tried to hang herself.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she injected herself with carburetor fluid.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she cut herself again.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she shot herself in the chest with an electric nail
gun, spent time in a psychiatric ward and, upon release, shot
herself in the chest with the nail gun again.
</P>
<P>
   Because she never tried to harm anyone but herself, however, and
had no criminal history, Carrie easily was able to pick up a
handgun in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   (And we have the nerve to say ``she'' is out of whack.)
</P>
<P>
   That day in August 1997, the Phoenix police surrounded the
apartment where Carrie was holed up. Negotiators spoke with her on
the telephone while some officers drilled a peephole through a
neighboring wall and others peeked in through the front door, which
they opened with a passkey. &QL; 
TRYING `COPICIDE'
</P>
<P>
   Carrie told a police negotiator she didn't have the nerve to
shoot herself. Later, she'd tell psychiatrist Gwen Levitt she was
hoping to commit what the police call ``copicide,'' in which a
suicidal person gets the police to shoot him or her.
</P>
<P>
   During the hours of negotiations, police say Carrie waved the
pistol at officers looking at her through the front door. And, at
least once, she fired the weapon, though not at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she simply put the gun down and walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, Carrie's attorneys have tried to have
their client placed in an intensive probation program in which
she's monitored to make sure she is working, taking medication and
getting therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has never been a threat to anyone but herself,'' attorney
Charles Arnold said. ``To treat her as a criminal, and want to send
her to jail, is both a waste of taxpayer money and a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, that's exactly what the Maricopa County
Attorney's Office has been trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Because a weapon was waved at police officers and a shot was
fired, the best offer prosecutors have made to Carrie May involves
pleading guilty to one count of aggravated assault, which could
send her to prison for up to nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many prosecutors have been on this case,''
Arnold said. ``There have been a few. Essentially, all of them have
indicated at one time or another that they'd like to do probation,
but say they can't because of an in-house policy of mandating
prison time for those who threaten police.'' &QL; 
PSYCHIATRIST'S FEAR
</P>
<P>
   Arnold doesn't believe Carrie May was a threat to the police, or
to anyone else. In Dr. Levitt's psychiatric evaluation, May is
described as having borderline personality disorder, depression,
bipolar disorder and more. She wrote, ``I believe it would be
appropriate for the court to consider probation as an option in
this case.'' Adding, ``I fear that Ms. May will make multiple
suicide attempts in prison, and may be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors haven't gone along with that recommendation,
a trial date for Carrie May has been set for September. A spokesman
for the County Attorney's Office said Friday, however, that the
case is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, by someone with all his marbles. And a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie May suffers from a mental disorder, which can be treated
with therapy and medication. A justice system that chooses to lock
her up is incurably nuts. &QL;

AN IMPORTANT TWO WEEKS FOR REDS  
 VALENTINE'S ALTERATIONS 
RIPKEN BIDS FOR RETURN 
THE HOMERLESS RACE 
IT'S A BLUE JAY! IT'S FERNANDEZ
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS homerless item to UPDATE Castillo's and Stocker's
at-bats for the season to include Saturday's games.)  (rk) 
 By   MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds are giving Jim Bowden, their general
manager, ``every reason to believe they can play with the wild-card
teams.'' In the next two weeks, though, the upstart and unheralded
Reds will let him know if they can play with the division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday night, the Reds, who have been in the middle of
a wild-card race that commands little attention, play 14
consecutive games against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the National
League West leaders, and the Houston Astros, the Central leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The eight games against the Astros figure to be more
enlightening for the Reds, because they play in the same division.
But the two-week span overall will provide Bowden with an idea of
what he might be doing later in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come July 31, we'll know a lot better where we are,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for making trades without waivers, and it's
a key date for the Reds. When Bowden made off-season trades that
brought high-priced Greg Vaughn and Denny Neagle to Cincinnati, he
said that if the Reds were not in contention for something by the
deadline, he could trade the players to teams that were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to find out,'' he said. ``I always keep an
open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the Reds were 1 1/2 games behind San
Francisco in the wild-card race, with the Mets in between. They
were in second place in the division race, four games behind the
Astros. They have been as close as 1 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Reds in these positions? Weren't they supposed to be
more at home lower in the standings?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, their young first baseman, is one reason the Reds
have become a first-half contender. He took a league-leading .377
batting average into Saturday night's game, and he led the team in
RBIs with 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' defense, especially up the middle, is another reason.
Pokey Reese, their young second baseman, has teamed well with
veteran Barry Larkin and had made only one error in 61 games. He
was hitting well, too, with a .287 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get spoiled watching guys like him,'' Jack McKeon, the
Reds' manager, said. ``He has great range, great hands, great
instincts and a strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster, Mike Cameron, performs a similar role in
center field. ``He catches everything in center,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the unexpectedly competitive Reds has been
their relief corps, a group of no-name pitchers who have made
themselves the most effective bullpen in the major leagues. The
Reds would not be where they are without Scott Williamson, Danny
Graves, Gabe White, Scott Sullivan and Dennis Reyes, who among them
had seven years of major league experience when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's 2.72 ERA is the only bullpen ERA in the majors
below 3.00. The .211 batting average the relievers have allowed
opponents is the only average below .225. Their effort has been
season-saving because the Reds' starting pitchers have averaged
only five innings a start, making them the shortest-working
starters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to get it done,'' McKeon said. So the
relievers have had to get the job done. Sullivan, Graves and
Williamson began the weekend with more innings in relief than
anyone in the league except Brian Edmondson of Florida. Williamson,
who in his third year as a professional throws a fastball 96 to 98
mph, leads National League relievers with six victories, and his
1.39 ERA and 54 strikeouts are second.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and McKeon appreciate what the bullpen has done, but they
know they can't expect to get that kind of production for the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our starters to pitch well or we'll burn out the
bullpen,'' Bowden said. ``We could use another starting pitcher or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who is on the disabled list strengthening his left
shoulder, has won no games this season. Brett Tomko, who was
demoted to the minors briefly earlier in the season, has won two
games. The Reds had counted on 15 victories each from Neagle, Tomko
and Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is on the prowl for starters who might be available in
trades but said: ``Thirty clubs can't agree on a salary cap,
revenue sharing, realignment, the designated hitter or Astroturf,
but I found one thing they all agree on. All of them want starting
pitching and none of them wants to trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it will be up to McKeon to navigate the team through
the hazardous waters filled with Diamondbacks and Astros. Trader
Jack noted that the Reds beat each team two out of three in earlier
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure we're not intimidated by them,'' he said.
``It's a good test for us. If we want to stay where we are, we have
to at least split with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Alterations
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine feels he is a marked man, but the Mets' manager
invites scrutiny and retaliation. In the past few weeks, Jack
McKeon, the Cincinnati manager, has questioned Jason Isringhausen's
glove and the shirt Pat Mahomes wore under his uniform, forcing the
Mets to alter the glove and Mahomes to change the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was McKeon's turn in the art of baseball gamesmanship. He
acted after the Mets' grounds crew applied an excessive amount of
water in front of home plate before a game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watered the field down purposely,'' McKeon said, speaking
of Valentine. ``Someone overheard him say it the night before to
the groundskeepers.'' The start of the game was delayed as the
grounds crew, at McKeon's request to the umpires, put down a
substance to soak up the water. ``I was worried about getting
Piazza hurt,'' McKeon said with a straight face, referring to the
Mets' catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken Bids for Return
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken was on the disabled list earlier this season _
recovering from a chronic back ailment, dealing with his father's
death and facing a .179 batting average and five errors in eight
games _ he brushed off suggestions that he was just about finished
as a productive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to arm yourself with your tools and go out there and
find out,'' he said, discussing the ability that might remain.
``Then you'll know yourself. You're being judged in front of all
these people, but nobody can make that judgment except you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others' rush to judgment has suffered a setback. Since his
return from the disabled list, Ripken was hitting .363 (45 for 124)
with 24 RBIS, eight home runs and two errors in 31 games before
Saturday night. His rejuvenated performance will help the Orioles
take an important step with greater ease.
</P>
<P>
   They must decide by July 13 if they want to exercise the $6.3
million option in Ripken's contract for next season or pay him a
$2.5 million buyout. Although club officials have not talked about
their plans, they are prepared to pick up the option.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ripken should play only part time next year, the Orioles
figure they can pay him the high salary for what he has done for
the franchise.

   The Homerless Race
</P>
<P>
   On successive days last week, the race for most times at bat
without a home run underwent a dramatic change. Last Monday, Tony
Womack of Arizona relinquished his lead in the race with a home run
against Ryan Dempster of Florida in his 227th at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier Mike Caruso of the Chicago White Sox, in his 216th
at-bat, hit his first home run of the season against Rick Aguilera
of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Their exit from the race left Luis Castillo of Florida all alone
at the top. He ha &UR; s &LR;  batted 235 times without hitting a home run.
Rey Ordonez of the Mets is a distant second with 193 at-bats, and
Kevin Stocker of Tampa Bay is next at 187.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl probably cannot understand their power problem. The
Milwaukee pitcher has 29 at-bats in his 14 starts, and he has hit
two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Blue Jay! It's Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   Some people might swear that Tony Fernandez stepped into a
telephone booth last Aug. 1, but all he did, really, was move from
second base to third base. Since that day, however, American League
pitchers have suffered from Fernandez's transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Not even balls made of Kryptonite can get him out. ``This is not
a phenomenon this year,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager,
said. ``You go back to last August, when we moved him from second
to third. He didn't have to worry about a lack of range. He seemed
to take off offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   A .282 career hitter for his first 14 years in the majors,
Fernandez was hitting .287 when the month of July ended last year.
The next day he began playing third, and he proceeded to hit .381
in his last 67 games, finishing with a .321 average, just one point
below the career-high .322 he batted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a fairly good hitter,'' Ash said, ``but he's
moved into another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is batting a league-leading .409. When the first phase
of interleague play began June 4, he was hitting .383. In 15 games
since, he has amassed 27 hits in 55 at-bats (.491). Besides
catapulting him beyond .400, his torrid stretch has given Fernandez
a share of Dominican Republic baseball history. His two hits
Saturday gave him 2,177, moving him into a tie with Julio Franco
for most ever by a Dominican native.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work ethic, his concentration and, I think, his comfort
level all play a role in it,'' Ash said of Fernandez's remarkable
late-life improvement as a hitter. ``I've never seen anybody, and I
underline anybody, work like this guy works. Pre- and post-game, he
conditions himself. He sets a work tone second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who turns 37 on June 30, is in his third tour of duty
with Toronto, with which he has spent nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has always been a hard worker,'' Ash added, ``even when
we had him as a youngster. He always had dedication. Everybody
talks about the pressure that comes with hitting .400. He's a guy
who has the ability to shut it out. That doesn't seem to bother
him.''

A STRAIGHT SHOT FROM THE HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Mickelson caused a commotion when he set his
priorities down like a Cessna on the first fairway at the U.S.
Open. For days people have been carrying on as if he's piloting
fatherhood into a whole new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   With Mickelson's wife Amy due to deliver their first child any
day and Mickelson adamant about attending the birth even if it
costs him a chance at his first major title, the announcers in the
primmest and most proper of sports have been prattling on about
water breaking, not putts.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask us, it's the best thing to happen to golf
broadcasting since Johnny Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Enough, already, about golfers who go to Japan for months at a
time, chasing the pot of gold while their spouses remain back in
the States raising the children. Some nuclear family, that. And
don't aggravate us with stories of athletes who casually,
carelessly father children they have no intention of claiming, much
less raising.
</P>
<P>
   You ought to know, when it comes to his commitment to
fatherhood, Mickelson's not flying solo. Anymore, he's not even
flying in the face of convention. Winger Brian Bellows of the
Washington Capitals flew home between Games 1 and 2 of the 1998
Stanley Cup Finals to be with his wife during the birth of their
second child and Detroit Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman nearly
missed a game in this year's playoffs because he insisted on
attending the birth of his third child.
</P>
<P>
   If Mickelson thinks his yet-to-be-born daughter is weighing on
his mind now, just wait until she's old enough to miss him. Just
wait until she can tug on his pant legs as well as his paternal
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is lucky that way. The Scottsdale resident won't have
to look far for athletes who have balanced with uncommon grace the
sometimes conflicting interests of professional sports and
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow golfer and Scottsdale resident Tom Lehman, for example,
can tell him a really long drive isn't 325 yards _ it's the five
miles back to your hotel on a Saturday night of a PGA Tour event
after seeing your wife and kids off at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   And Matt Williams, a slugger for the Arizona Diamondbacks, can
tell Mickelson a sacrifice isn't a way of advancing runners, it's a
conscious life decision.
</P>
<P>
   What they have to say, fathers everywhere probably could stand
to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to remember,'' said Williams, ``is
when you're on your deathbed, do you want to be able to say, `Jeez,
I made a million bucks' or do you want to be able to say you were a
good father? It's all a matter of putting your priorities in
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Williams was on a Cleveland team that advanced to
the World Series. He had reached the pinnacle of his profession. He
should have been ecstatic. Instead, he was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   He and his first wife had split and she was living in Phoenix
with the couple's three children. He missed his two daughters and
son. They visited him often that summer, but it wasn't the same.
The children's lives were scattered in two cities and they began to
show the strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where they didn't want to get on that damn
plane again,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was the perfect place for Williams, the ballplayer.
But he also knew baseball wouldn't be there to comfort him in his
old age and neither would his kids, if he didn't do something. So
Williams asked for _ and was granted _ a trade to the expansion
Diamondbacks. For the sake of his relationship with his kids, he
went from one of the best teams in major-league baseball to one of
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The move has worked out well for everyone. The second-year
Diamondbacks have one of the best records in baseball, Williams
leads the National League in runs batted in and his children are a
lot happier now that their dad is a constant presence in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game doesn't allow you to have the perfect family life
under the best of circumstances,'' Williams said. ``You have to try
to do the best you can. Because baseball doesn't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour season can stretch from January to December if
golfers let it. As it is, Lehman spends half the year on the road.
``I don't get to sleep at home nearly enough,'' he has lamented.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerant life was OK when his children were preschoolers.
They could be carted along with the carry-on luggage from one event
to the next. But now his two daughters are 9 and 6 and his son is
almost 4. They are growing up. They have lives that clash with
their dad's nomadic existence.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman dotes on them whenever he can. Some athletes hurt
themselves by punching walls or striking water coolers or throwing
patrons through bar windows; Lehman required surgery on his right
shoulder last year when he injured it performing handstands for his
children before the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   It's awesome and awful when his family accompanies him on Tour.
They have a great time, until wife Melissa and the kids have to
return home to their lives. The goodbyes can be heartrending. On
the weekend of the Heritage Classic in Hilton Head, S.C., in April,
Lehman stood with his daughters in the galley of a flight bound for
Atlanta until the plane was ready to push back.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls cried when he disappeared up the jetway and his
younger daughter, Holly, sobbed, ``I want my daddy,'' until after
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   It would be two weeks before she would get her daddy back.
</P>
<P>
   All too soon, Lehman will have to let his daughters go. But he
doesn't have to tell Mickelson that. He'll find out fast enough.

WRONGLY CONVICTED MAN TAKES CAUTIOUS STEPS BACK INTO SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A station wagon lurches past the house that Dennis Fritz shares
with his mother, the car's exhaust exploding from a rusted tailpipe
scraping the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, a neighbor rips the air with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, boom boxes blast music that gets lost in
static.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz doesn't blink. This isn't noise.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is the Conner Correctional Center, a medium-security
prison in Hominy, Okla., where Fritz was sentenced in 1988 to life
imprisonment for a murder he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is the echo of cell doors slamming shut, guards shouting
in your ear, radios blaring on every tier, inmates yelling for
someone just inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is the roar inside his head for the years he lost behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that irritated me before _ noisy neighbors, whooping
and hollering, power tools _ it's just nothing to the madness in
the pen,'' says Fritz, a Kansas City, Mo., native who grew up in
Lee's Summit, Mo., and moved to Oklahoma when he was 17. ``This is
serenity. Everything now I take with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   In April an Ada, Okla., judge, taking into consideration that
DNA tests of semen and hair samples did not genetically match
Fritz, 49, or his co-defendant, Ron Williamson, 46, dismissed the
murder charges against them for the slaying of Debra Sue Carter,
who was sexually molested and strangled in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still overwhelmed. At various times during the day, once
or twice a day, I think, `You're free,' '' Fritz says quietly in a
soft drawl. ``I find myself wanting to restrict myself a little bit
as if I were still in prison. Just being able to make decisions
puts me in a state of exhilaration, of excitement that is
unbelievable.''
Every day Fritz thinks about prison. Sometimes he dreams about it;
other times he talks about it. He has interviewed writers who want
to tell his story, but he has begun to think that he should write
it himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of two inmates in a concrete cell, 8 feet by 10 feet.
The only furnishings were a sink, a toilet and a bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the same cell for 10 years,'' he says. ``The cells
are so naked, the only place you can sit is on your bunk....At
least once a day I'd think, `I hate this place.' I had total
disgust for being there.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent hundreds of hours in the prison law library working on
his case, promoting his innocence. His daily routine rarely varied:
He ate his meals, lifted weights and studied in the library. When
it was time to return to his cell, he wrote legal briefs into the
late hours of the night until his back ached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember the first two or three years were a real
struggle,'' Fritz says. ``I was innocent; I knew it but had no way
to place my feelings. A guilty person, they can assign blame to
themselves and feel remorse and begin healing. It is different when
you're innocent. You carry around a set of bitter feelings. It's
harder emotionally than actual prison life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think, `How did this happen to me?' I had to quit
asking that question. It took me five years to realize that there
was a possibility I might be spending my life there.''
</P>
<P>
   At times marijuana eased the stress. The guards overlooked the
drug because it calmed the inmates, Fritz says. A more serious
offense was alcohol. Anyone caught making brew was automatically
sent to a maximum-security prison. Alcohol caused too many fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the social order of prison life, Fritz had respect as a
murder convict with a life sentence. He quickly learned, however,
to keep quiet about the specific nature of his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby rapers and women killers are frowned upon,'' he says. ``I
got some hard looks. In the penitentiary, you're around an element
of violence all the time. It's a world of madness. How you say
something and when you say it is real important. Timing is
everything.''
Sometimes Fritz wonders whether he can be totally independent
again. The thought makes him uneasy. He helps around the house or
works outside to regain a level of responsibility denied him in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself taking small steps,'' he says. ``Every now and
then I drive to the store. I'm not really working to get back into
the mainstream too fast. I don't really feel a part of society yet.
I don't think I ever will. I've grown to be relatively careful in
the things I do.''
</P>
<P>
   So many things have changed. Plastic cards, instead of keys,
open hotel doors. And there's voice mail, ``that telephone message
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's Summit, a small town when Fritz was there last, is just
one of many growing suburbs connected to the city by a maze of
highways. He feels lost just looking at a map. He remembers many
people but has called only a few old friends whom he hasn't seen
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed access to small stuff like being able to get a metal
finger file,'' Fritz says. ``The bigger things you accept aren't
going to come to you, but it's the little things you always took
for granted that caused a little irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains mindful of his surroundings, aware that someone might
be watching him, sizing him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but I always used to keep my hands in my
pockets when I'd go into a store,'' he said. ``Now I feel
self-conscious, like the store owner would think I'm lifting
something. I catch myself and take my hands out of my pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Resch, district administrator of the Kansas City Probation
and Parole Office, said it would take time for the anxiety to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incarceration is an incredibly dehumanizing experience, more
so when you know you're innocent,'' Resch said. ``I'm not sure it's
possible for any of us who haven't gone through it to know what
it's like to come back out.''
Since their release, Fritz and Williamson have appeared on ``Good
Morning America,'' ``The Leeza Show,'' ``Inside Edition,'' ``Burden
of Proof,'' a German television station and ``Dateline.'' They used
the publicity to push for state-mandated DNA testing for prisoners
who cannot afford to pay for it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz is content to have behind him the frenzied talk-show
circuit that at times left him feeling like a rag doll. He lives
with his mother, her dog and six cats. He spends his days writing
letters thanking people who supported him in prison. He calls his
daughter in Oklahoma City. She was 12 when he was sentenced; she's
24 now.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz would not let her visit him at Conner. They spoke on the
telephone and wrote letters during those years. He did not want her
exposed to prison life.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps in touch with his lawyer, Barry Scheck, co-founder of
the Innocence Project, a New York-based organization that provides
assistance to inmates who believe they've been wrongfully convicted
of capital offenses. He also maintains contact with Williamson, who
has moved to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted the death penalty for both men, but only
Williamson received that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1973 and 1993, an average of two persons a year were
released nationwide from death row because of DNA test results or
other significant evidence of their innocence, said Richard Dieter,
director of the Washington-based Death Row Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years that number increased to an average of
four inmates a year. This year alone, six inmates have been
released from death row.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz knows that he came close to spending his prison time with
Williamson on death row. He holds his bitterness deep inside. Time
is rushing by too fast for him to dwell on what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and a buddy inside, we'd talk about what it would be like
to open an icebox or go to the bathroom and close the door and not
have some idiot or guard bust in on you,'' Fritz says. ``We'd keep
an open mind in the belief that we'd be out one of these days. And
when we did walk out, we would have an added perception of life. A
real appreciation of life itself.''
