ANGELS GET THREE FOR SECOND BASE
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After last season's trade of Randy Velarde to Oakland, the
Anaheim Angels finished the season with Double-A player Trent
Durrington at second base. Friday, they signed three second basemen
in an effort to find someone who can be productive at that
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels signed Scott Spiezio to a major-league contract, and
signed Pat Kelly and Jason Bates to minor-league contracts for the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio, who was added to the 40-man roster, split time between
Oakland and the A's Triple-A affiliate in Vancouver in 1999. In 89
games for the A's, Spiezio, 27, hit .243 with eight homers and 33
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals during this offseason was to develop depth at
the second base position,'' Angels general manager Bill Stoneman
said. ``With the addition of these three players, we expect good
competition in the infield during spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 31, played in 37 games for the Blue Jays last season,
hitting .267 with six homers and 20 RBI. Kelly has also played with
the Yankees and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 28, was in the Tigers organization last season but did
not play because of bone spurs in his left foot. He played from
1995-98 with the Colorado Rockies, hitting .239 in 319 games.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Bates will attend spring training as non-roster
invitees.

EDITORIAL: PERSISTENT WAR IN ANGOLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by oil revenues, diamond smuggling and a disregard for
civilian lives on all sides, Angola's ruinous civil war has
stubbornly outlasted the Cold-War machinations that ratcheted up
the death toll in the 1980s. Upward of 1 million Angolans have died
in 25 years of fighting and famine, and tens of thousands have been
maimed by land mines. Unicef recently called Angola the worst place
on earth for children _ a country where 30 percent of them will die
before the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent series of military advances by government forces
may mean the war is nearing a decisive phase. It is far too early
to tell, but clearly an opportunity is at hand for the rest of the
world to pressure both sides to devise a lasting peace based on
democratic values and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War Angola's conflict has evolved into
a crude competition between government and rebel forces for power
and profits from the country's rich deposits of diamonds, oil and
gas. A cease-fire collapsed in 1992 after President Eduardo Dos
Santos won an election and Jonas Savimbi, the rebel leader,
cynically resumed the fighting. A second cease-fire in 1994 fell
apart a year ago when the government accused the rebels of
stockpiling arms and attacked. Savimbi had in fact rearmed with the
benefit of several billion dollars in diamond-smuggling revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dos Santos' forces, strengthened by escalating oil profits,
have driven the rebels out of nearly three-quarters of the country,
and the fighting has spilled into neighboring Namibia. Savimbi, who
received South African and U.S. support during the Cold War,
deserves little sympathy. He has broken numerous promises and
ruthlessly pursued his own agenda. But the rest of the world would
be mistaken if it unconditionally embraced Dos Santos. Though his
government was legitimately elected and has long since abandoned
its original Marxist creed, it has been responsible for widespread
rights violations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. representative to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, set the right tone on a visit to Angola when he said the
United States would throw its weight _ and, it is hoped, its
intelligence capabilities _ behind a Canadian-led effort to tighten
and enforce sanctions on Savimbi's diamond- and weapons-smuggling
operations. At the same time he spoke bluntly about the
government's human rights abuses and met with an Angolan editor who
had been imprisoned and tortured. It was a welcome departure from
the record of recent years in which an U.S.-backed U.N.
peacekeeping unit too often accommodated Angola's warlords by
overlooking their flagrant abuses. &QL;

MARKET RALLIES TO FINISH WEEK STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to adjust figures for Staples, Qualcomm and Lucent.) 
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market Friday rallied across the board,
wiping out most of the losses of a topsy-turvy week that began with
interest rates surging and equity investors running for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after falling 4.3 percent
Monday and Tuesday, rallied the last three days to finish the week
at a new high, eclipsing the record set New Year's Eve. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks bounced back to just 28
points shy of its record. The Nasdaq composite index, which fell
prey to the rush to dump technology stocks, was off 9.8 percent
through Thursday, but its 4.2 percent rally Friday left it down a
more modest 6 percent for the first week of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The selling in New York early in the week sent stocks in Europe
and Asia tumbling. But those markets also rebounded Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street rally showed that investors, despite a surge in
interest rates since mid-November and the imminent threat of rate
increases by the Federal Reserve, still want stocks _ even if they
are ones they had avoided before. The rally also makes one wonder
if selloffs will ever spook investors.
</P>
<P>
   As all three major stock gauges rose together for the first time
this year and trading volume neared record levels, investors bought
nontechnology stocks that were shunned last year. At the same time,
they picked up some of the technology stocks that had been hammered
Tuesday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Staples, the office equipment retailer, which plunged almost 29
percent last year, climbed 1 1/4, to 25 5/16, and is up 22 percent
this week. Caterpillar, the manufacturer of big machinery, climbed
1 11/16, to 53 5/16, rising for a third consecutive day. It is up
13.3 percent for the year after rising just 2.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the technology side, Qualcomm rallied for the first time in
three days, rising 9 15/16, to 150. After being one of the
top-performing stocks last year, surging 2,616 percent, Qualcomm
fell 21.9 percent from Tuesday through Thursday. Yahoo and Cisco
Systems also rose Friday after falling this week. The three stocks
led the Nasdaq composite index up 155.49 points, or 4.17 percent,
to 3,882.62 _ 248 points below the high it hit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 269.30 points, or 2.39
percent, to 11,522.56 _ 25 points above its previous record. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index rose 38.02 points, or 2.71 percent, to
1,441.47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market hit a speed bump this week,'' said Thomas
M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, referring to the incredible 53.7 percent drive in the
Nasdaq index since Oct. 19. ``But the appetite is there to buy
stocks,'' he said. ``Money doesn't want to leave the stock market
so it is searching out safe havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Among these are drugs, consumer staples and old-line industrial
companies. Another sign of that shift was the jump in the price of
Coca-Cola Friday, which rose 3 3/4, to 60 3/4, after the company
announced some top executive appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in stocks came after the Labor Department announced
that 315,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs had been created in December
and that the nation's unemployment rate had remained at 4.1
percent, a 30-year low. The December data also showed that average
hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent last month and 3.7 percent for all
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While the jobs increase was higher than the 240,000 to 250,000
predicted by analysts, it did not seem to worry investors, nor did
the jump in average hourly earnings. Treasury bond and note prices
fell after the jobs data were announced but rallied later in the
day. The yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 6.54 percent, from
6.56 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose 6/32, to 94 18/32.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Slifer, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers, said
one reason for the muted response is that the yields of Treasury
bonds and notes have already risen sharply in anticipation of
interest rate moves by the Federal Reserve, probably beginning with
a quarter-point increase at the Feb. 2 policy-makers' meeting. He
also said that although wages were rising, the rate of increase was
below the pace of more than 4 percent of early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of the forces driving selling earlier this week was the fear
of an increase of at least half a percentage point in the Fed's
short-term interest rate target as the central bank seeks to slow
the economy to an acceptable, noninflationary pace of growth. With
the economy growing at a 5 percent rate in the last six months
there is no sign of a slowdown yet. That concern sent the yield on
the 30-year bond up to 6.62 percent on Monday and again on
Wednesday, the highest in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors with profits in technology stocks in 1999 seemed
to have delayed their move to lock up their gains until the new
year so that their due date for capital gains would be put off as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in interest rates and some negative earnings
announcements from technology and Internet companies, including
Amazon.com, Gateway and Lucent Technologies, helped accelerate
selling.
</P>
<P>
   But as investors abandoned technology they picked up other
stocks, including hard-hit financial shares, sending the Dow and
the S&AMP;P 500 indexes, which are less heavily weighted in technology
than the Nasdaq, turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, the maker of telecommunications equipment,
set a one-day trading volume record with 179 million shares
changing hands, including 136.6 million on the New York Stock
Exchange and the rest on other trading systems. The volume exceeded
Oracle's 171.8 million shares traded on Dec. 9, 1997. Lucent
plunged 24.7 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, a fall
reflected in Friday's results, with the stock down 15 1/4, at 53
3/4. Lucent announced late Thursday that its first-quarter revenue
and earnings would fall well short of analysts expectations.

KNICKS SURVIVE ORLANDO, 94-86 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The New York Knicks tried to clamp down on their
prosperity as tightly as on a chew toy Friday night, but they
nearly allowed the aggressive Orlando Magic to tear it away.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held a 16-point lead with five and a half minutes
left in the game, and watched it melt to six before squeezing by
with a 94-86 victory, their third straight. Although they were
slow-footed on most rebounds, getting beaten on the boards, 58-39,
the Knicks were able to counter the energy of the Magic by
unleashing Allan Houston (23 points), Latrell Sprewell (19 points)
and Patrick Ewing (18 points) on the home team. The Knicks' wave of
talent saved them from humiliation at the Orlando Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, the Knicks have allowed six double-digit
leads to evaporate and have turned apparent blowouts into narrow
escapes or losses. This time the Knicks held the Magic to just 35
percent shooting from the field but could not overcome their
penchant for mishandling advantages. With 1 minute 39 seconds
remaining, Darrell Armstrong hit two free throws to cut the Knicks'
lead to 92-84.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling call on Larry Johnson with 1:15 remaining gave the
Magic hope. The rookie Corey Maggette then hit a jumper with 52
seconds left to pull Orlando to 92-86.
</P>
<P>
   After Ewing missed two free throws with 35 seconds to play, the
Knicks (20-12) were able to prevent the Magic (16-17) from pulling
off a miracle finish by shutting it down in its last two
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's group of misfits from around the world _ highlighted
by a Continental Basketball Association castaway, Armstrong, and a
European find out of Penn State, John Amaechi _ began by showing
the Knicks how the hunger of the unknowns could keep up with their
hefty-priced talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic players embarrassed the Knicks as they scraped up
enough extra shots to stay close, down by just 41-40 at the half.
Once again, the low-energy Knicks were lethargic and trailed the
athletic Magic on the boards, 33-22, including 12-3 in offensive
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Knicks picked up their energy and began to create some
opportunities by forcing the Magic into bad shots and untimely
turnovers, they were able to take a 75-64 lead after the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who went 1 for 7 in the first half, was a big part of
the personality boost. Much more alive after halftime, he shot 5
for 6 in the third quarter and played harder on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Unearthing that kind of drive was a long process, though. The
Knicks labored through the first half, particularly on the
offensive boards. Marcus Camby, usually the Knicks' energetic
weapon, was of little help because of early foul trouble, a problem
that has plagued him for two weeks.

EDITORIAL: THE DEBATE OVER GAY TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, said strongly and unequivocally this
week that they would allow gays to serve openly in the military.
That is the only fair and rational course now that five years of
experience has shown the compromise policy of ``don't ask, don't
tell'' to be a failure that should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared at first to be a subtle but important difference
between the two Democrats in the debate Wednesday night. Gore said
he would require in advance that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff be in agreement with his position. Bradley had the better
formulation, saying simply that he would expect his appointees to
carry out the policy of their commander in chief on gays in the
military. That put the emphasis where it belongs, on the need for
military obedience to lawful orders rather than on the personal
beliefs of the officers. On Friday Gore adjusted his stance by
asserting that he did not intend to ask nominees for the Joint
Chiefs or other high military positions about their personal views
or ideology on this or any other issue. He said he, too, would
simply expect them to follow orders.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidates, by contrast, all oppose lifting the
ban on openly gay troops. Sen. John McCain said he would retain the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. He asserted that it was working
despite ample evidence that it has accelerated the dismissal of gay
service members. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also said he backed
``don't ask, don't tell,'' but made things worse by inventing a
litmus test against liberalizing the policy. He said he would not
appoint anyone to the Joint Chiefs who advocated allowing gays to
serve openly in the military, thus elevating bigotry as a defining
criterion for selecting military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates are taking a risk in standing up for
principle on this issue. But by asserting the primacy of civilian
command, they may be able to avoid the trouble that befell
President Clinton. Clinton supported ending the ban on gay troops.
But once in office he was forced to retreat because Gen. Colin
Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others publicly
denounced that policy. Congress later blocked the lifting of the
ban and wrote ``don't ask, don't tell'' into law.
</P>
<P>
   A new president who wants to change the policy would have to
work with Congress to rewrite the law. But the starting point has
to be a presidential commitment to the right of gay people to serve
on an equal basis in the armed forces.

UCLA FACES DESPERATE SITUATION EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ UCLA guard Earl Watson tossed and turned
Thursday night before dozing off at 4 a.m. Coach Steve Lavin
watched the disturbing game film until 2:30 a.m., then stared at
the ceiling for hours. After three years, he knows every nook and
cranny.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Northwest insomnia has become as common for the Bruins
as suspensions, injuries, first-round losses and NCAA
investigations. It's part of the chaos that's consumed the program
since the 1995 NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lavin era, the Bruins are 4-6 at Oregon, Oregon State and
Washington. That includes a wrenching 63-62 loss Thursday night in
Seattle, where they haven't won in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they dominated today's opponent, Washington State, with
three victories by a combined seven points. And if they aren't
careful this afternoon, they'll depart the dreary, wind-swept
Palouse 0-2 in conference play. Washington State isn't very good,
but neither is Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to make sure we get rid of that loss and not
let it linger,'' senior forward Sean Farnham said. ``No matter what
happened with USC and Washington State (the Trojans won handily),
we know Washington State will give us their best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is solely on Washington State. We can't look ahead
to USC (next week) and we can't look behind to Washington ... That
was a huge loss, but if we don't move on, it'll be a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Resiliency is as much a part of UCLA's character as sloppiness
and lethargy. Three years ago, the Bruins lost at Stanford by a
school-record 48 points but recovered to defeat Cal two days later.
Last season, they lost 65-63 at Oregon State, then responded with a
65-63 victory over Oregon behind Baron Davis' 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely has the situation seemed so desperate in part because
the Bruins (8-3, 0-1) don't have Davis, in part because they've
performed poorly against mediocre opponents that force them to win
with fundamentals, not athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins committed 19 turnovers against Washington's passive
zone defense. (Inexcusable.) They shot 42 percent from the field.
They made 9 of 19 free throws. They scored just six points in a
6:28 stretch late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bruins had one assignment _ stop Huskies gunner
Deon Luton _ and didn't come close. Luton scored 26 points and hit
the big shots while his teammates were a pathetic 14 of 46 from the
field. Time and again, UCLA defenders were out of position, a sign
they were poorly prepared for Washington's half-court attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he had to have that kind of game to beat us,'' Lavin
said. ``That's disappointing. We had the information and couldn't
apply it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concerns are free throws, having better execution
in late-game situations, taking better shots in late-game
situations, and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shoot 42 percent on free throws on the road and have 19
turnovers in a limited-possession game, then you're digging a
deeper hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Thursday's defeat reduced the Bruins' margin for
error. They must win 10 of their last 19 to reach the 18-victory
plateau that should secure an NCAA Tournament bid. That won't be
easy considering the upcoming schedule: at USC and North Carolina
next week, then Arizona, then a trip to Oregon, then Stanford. If
the Bruins don't correct their problems quickly, they'll be 11-9
after the first round of league play.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, we're in a very tough stretch,'' Lavin said. ``My
feeling is we have 19 games left and the majority will be like this
... dogfights.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit early in the season for must-win games, but that's
exactly what the Bruins face today against the worst team in the
Pac-10. Forget the conference title; an invitation to March Madness
depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about getting back on the right track,'' Watson
said. ``We can't keep losing every three or four games. We're in a
bad position for the Pac-10.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   A damning report issued this week by the Securities and Exchange
Commission showed that the partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, one
of the five large accounting firms that dominate the industry,
repeatedly violated rules that prohibit them from owning shares in
the companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
   Such violations challenge the credibility of an industry that
seeks indulgence for other potential conflicts of interest. For
example, accounting firms seek consulting contracts from the very
same companies they are hired to audit. That in turn raises the
question whether accountants pursuing lucrative consulting
contracts will dig deep to find financial irregularities during
annual audits.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctity of audit reports lies at the heart of
well-functioning financial markets. Auditors are supposed to work
on behalf of the public. If investors cannot trust the auditors,
they cannot trust the financial data on which billions of
transactions are based each day. The performance of stock and bond
markets is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors complain that the rules are picayune and impractical.
Some rules do need to be changed. But many of the infractions at
PricewaterhouseCoopers were not minor. In 140 cases, employees or
partners directly participated in audits of companies whose shares
they owned.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers has already fired a handful of partners
and promised to improve its behavior. Eventually, however, auditors
will almost certainly have to form a tough self-regulatory body
that can oversee its members' actions, along the lines of
disciplinary bodies of lawyers and stockbrokers. If auditors cannot
properly monitor their own behavior, how can they possibly be
trusted to monitor anyone else's?

EDITORIAL: A PLAN FOR GOVERNORS ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Governors Island in New York City's busy harbor has remained
tantalizingly off limits for years while city and state officials
decided how best to use it. A developer's fantasy island and a park
lover's open-air dream, the 172 acres include antique fortresses,
vintage all-American houses and a patch of distinctly ugly
buildings constructed more recently on the leftover fill from
construction of the New York subway system. Now, after suggestions
for using the outpost for everything from an artists' haven to a
casino complex, Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have
agreed on a plan that seems to meet the approval of a wide range of
normally contentious New Yorkers. While the proposal should be
regarded as a work in progress, it is a promising start, worthy of
the effort it will take to get the White House and Congress to go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Released with much fanfare this week, the new plan for Governors
Island provides for more than 50 acres of parkland and miles of
public shoreline, plus a Colonial Williamsburg-like family center
and private conference facility to help pay for the entire package.
The National Park Service would have to take over the forts, and
the shoddy structures that are said to be unsafe by today's
standards would be leveled to make room for green space. Pataki's
proposed Hudson River institute, his ``Woods Hole on the Hudson,''
could be housed on the island as well. Both the commercial and
public facilities need close study to make sure the best use is
made of the rare opportunity the island offers.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdles for this venture are still fairly high, especially
in Washington. A few years ago President Clinton promised Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan he would sell the island to New York for $1
if the state and city could agree on a plan that served the public
needs while finding private funds to pay for its upkeep. Since
then, Congress has upped the bill to a whopping $500 million, a
price tag that was used more as a budget gimmick than a real
assessment of the island's worth. Congress should drop the gimmick,
since the president is willing to stick to his earlier promise to
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the Empire State Development Corp., which would begin
filling in the crucial details. At that point, environmental
groups, politicians and public-interest planners like the Regional
Plan Association, which now strongly endorses this proposal, must
monitor progress day by day. What looks like a good plan must
evolve into a public treasure with plenty of public access and
plenty of open space.

KC STATE REPRESENTATIVE INTRODUCES CELL PHONE RESTRICTION BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _Kathy Bremer quit using her cellular phone in
the car after she caught herself zipping through a red light, right
past a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't hit anyone, and she didn't get a ticket. But the
experience was a powerful lesson, and she no longer uses the cell
phone while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a smart thing for me to do,'' said Bremer, a Kansas City
resident and cellular user for more than five years. ``I could have
hurt someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining a growing national trend, a Missouri legislator has
introduced a bill aimed at cutting down on the potential for
accidents caused by drivers using cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marsha Campbell, a Kansas City Democrat, said her bill
would prohibit the use of cellular telephones while driving, except
in emergencies. Violation of the law, a misdemeanor, would be
punishable by either a $500 fine or six months in jail, or both. If
a cellular user caused an accident, the consequences would be a
$1,000 fine or one year in jail, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a cell phone in the car is a great safety measure,''
Campbell said. ``I have a cell phone, and I like it. But I'm not
sure if anyone's phone call is worth another's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said she always pulled over to use her phone and
suggested that others do the same.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to introduce a bill after some constituents
contacted her about restricting cell phone use. During her morning
walks and commutes to the capital, she, too, had noticed
absent-minded drivers using cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's cell phone bill makes Missouri one of 11 states
considering such legislation. The National Conference of State
Legislatures says that last year, 22 states considered legislation
regarding cell phones and driving. The proposals vary, from
complete bans to mandating proper use of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   In eight states, cell phone legislation has failed, but laws
were passed in California, Florida and Massachusetts. None of the
three states has a complete ban; in Massachusetts, for example,
drivers who do not keep at least one hand on the wheel while using
a cell phone may face fines of $35 to $150, depending on whether
they have previous violations.
</P>
<P>
   No similar bill has been proposed in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely an issue that's gaining momentum among state
legislators,'' said Matt Sundeen, transportation policy specialist
for Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures. Sundeen
has been tracking such legislation for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer volume of cell phone use is causing representatives
to be more concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That volume is considerable: The federal Department of
Transportation estimates that 80 million cellular phones will be in
use this year nationwide. In the Kansas City area, 43.7 percent of
residents had cell phones in 1999, according to research by the
Minnesota Opinion Research Institute for The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 85 percent of cell phone users talk in the car,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In
1998, the agency studied the correlation between cell phone use and
traffic accidents. Researchers found that cell phones were major
contributors to the most common cause of accidents: inattention.
While cell phone users were busy dialing, conversing, answering the
phone or hanging up, their attention simply was not on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, driver inattention contributed to 754 accident
deaths, 47,064 injuries and 78,722 instances of property damage in
1998, said Sgt. John Hotz of the Missouri Highway Patrol. Hotz said
cellular phone use was one of many causes of driver inattention.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only problem researchers have found related
to driving and using a cellular phone. In Finland, where cellular
phones are more popular than in the United States, another study
concluded last year that talking on a cell phone resulted in an
average half-second delay in brake reaction whether a hands-free
phone or a hand-held phone was used.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 study funded by the American Automobile Association found
that 151 subjects in simulated driving situations failed to respond
or had slower response times to traffic situations with hand-held
or hands-free cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The study participants failed to respond 30 percent of the time
while using cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The more intense the phone conversation, the slower the response
time became. Even those who used a cell phone often had delayed
response times.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report
detailed a number of cell phone-related accidents. In a majority of
the cases, the cell phone users struck cars or other large objects
in clear view.
</P>
<P>
   Such accidents can be serious, even fatal. Two Missouri fatal
car wrecks were traced to cellular phone use in 1995, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, a truck driver talking on a cellular phone in
Portland, Ore., drove his truck into the path of an oncoming
freight train, according to The Oregonian newspaper. He was killed
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, a 2-year-old girl in Hilltown, Pa., was
killed when the car in which she was riding was struck by a driver
who ran a stop sign while using a cell phone, according to the
Tri-State Media News Network.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although area police departments don't keep
data specifically on accidents caused by cellular phone use, phone
calls and driving can be a bad combination, said Sgt. Randy Sims of
the Kansas City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some accidents where the person will say,
`Yeah, it's my fault. I was talking on my cell phone and not paying
attention,' &UR; '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said Campbell's bill would be a good safety measure, but it
would be difficult to enforce, especially with hands-free phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't tell if they were talking to themselves or
singing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bill Pross, Independence police spokesman, agreed. He
said his department did not have the resources to enforce such a
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on the things that we know lead to serious car
crashes: speed, failing to yield right of way, following too
closely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pross said he did not see the need for such a bill because
driver inattentiveness comes from many different sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way to work, there's women applying makeup, men
shaving,'' he said. ``I don't see any distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Stephanie Faul, communications director of AAA
Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington, who said legislators
focused too much on cell phones as hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, people are distracted all the time,'' Faul said.
``People are using cell phones, eating Big Macs, fiddling with CDs,
yelling at kids in the back seat. People just aren't paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, say cellular phone dealers, is education, not
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless carriers place a priority on customer education, said
Tom Murphy, spokesman for Sprint PCS. Sprint customers receive a
packet from the Cellular Telecommunication Industry Association
offering safety tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've supported safe driving since day one,'' he said. ``We
take it very, very seriously. But we don't believe legislation is
the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that the Missouri bill was not in the public
interest and that Sprint would lobby against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless phones do too much good for people who use them in
their vehicle,'' he said. ``People call police when they see a
drunk driver. People call 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill has not been assigned to a committee, and formal
debate has not begun. She could not predict the bill's odds for
adoption, but said she had received a lot of supportive e-mails and
letters from constituents. In addition, ``quite a few'' legislators
have told her they agree with the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some who agree in general, but they think it
needs some work,'' she said ``That's typical. Rarely do you come up
with a perfect bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bremer, the reformed cell phone user, said she had mixed
feelings about the proposed bill. Banning cell phone use while
behind the wheel would be a good safety measure, she said, but she
isn't sure it should be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a litle girl,'' she said. ``Talking on the cell phone
with her in the car is just an accident waiting to happen. But I
don't think it's worth a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone legislation is HB1184 (Campbell). Legislation
is available on the Missouri General Assembly site at http:

`KOBE STOPPER' IS A NON-ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant will face the self-proclaimed ``Kobe
stopper'' tonight in Seattle, but he's not exactly quivering at the
prospect. In fact, he can't believe anyone even considers Ruben
Patterson a relevant issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys actually want to talk about that?'' Bryant said
incredulously, in response to reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the NBA's greatest non-rivalry. Patterson spent last
season with the Los Angeles Lakers and guarded Bryant daily in
practice, but no one thought much of it until he signed with the
Sonics in August, then declared, ``I dominated Kobe, and everybody
knew it. They called me the Kobe stopper. He hated when I guarded
him _ all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's reaction? ``I laughed. (Ticked) me off. I laughed,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant, who was injured when the teams met in November,
looks forward to disproving Patterson's bold assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, especially if he's guarding me,'' Bryant said. ``I don't
think they're going to have him guarding me. They'll probably put
Gary (Payton) on me, for obvious reasons. I don't think they
believe he's the `Kobestopper.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bryant was surprised at Patterson's bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, because I know Rube. Rube likes to talk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bryant, Patterson's successes against him were few,
and short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny. Days when I felt like competing real hard, I had
my way. Days when I didn't feel like being completely into it, he
would have his little moments or whatever and then he'd start
talking trash. And then (I) just nipped it in the bud, and that was
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here to stay: At 3 p.m. today, Brian Shaw's nonguaranteed
one-year contract becomes guaranteed for the season, and it's clear
he's earned a roster spot for the season. Shaw was signed in the
wake of Bryant's broken hand in October, and he continues to
provide security and veteran experience in the guard corps.
</P>
<P>
   Ankle problems dogged Shaw in late December, but coach Phil
Jackson has started to rely on him again recently, especially with
Derek Fisher struggling with his shot. Shaw had a season-high eight
assists against the Clippers on Wednesday and scored seven points
against the Clippers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we wanted from Brian when we got him,'' Jackson
said. ``I basically said, `You're here to plug a hole that's left
by Kobe Bryant's injury.... We need a big guard, especially in the
kind of system I like to run. If it works out, you may be here for
the year, but I can't guarantee anything.' So we started out at a
premise at that level, and he just continued to fulfill the
promise. He's going to be a team player and a good one.''

CELTICS RULE OVER KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was as if the Celtics were showing off dramatic, before and
after photos. If you saw us play Dec. 28 in Sacramento, they seemed
to say, we just want to let you know that you caught us in the
throes of a rough period.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, there were 18,624 people at the FleetCenter. They
witnessed more than a 101-93 Celtics win. They also saw a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   They saw Antoine Walker throwing no-look alley-oop passes to
Tony Battie and falling an assist short of a triple-double. They
saw an entertaining and ineffective performance from outrageous
Kings point guard Jason Williams. They saw the Celtics build a
fourth-quarter lead, blow most of it, and still win. And if they
tuned in to Rick Pitino's postgame press conference, they even got
an admission from the Celtics' coach: he said he treats every game
as if it was ``World War IX.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, let's go to the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 28: The Kings' reserves torch the Celtics for 45 points.
You want to check the back of Lawrence Funderburke's jersey again
and make sure it doesn't say ``Abdul-Jabbar.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night: In a combined 64 minutes, five Sacramento reserves
managed 8 points. Funderburke played seven minutes and threw in a
layup.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 28: An exasperated Pitino says he doesn't understand why
his team doesn't defend the 3-point shot better and that there will
have to be improved defense from ``Our 4 and 5 men (or Walker and
Vitaly Potapenko).'' Paul Pierce has four fouls early in the third
and ends the night shaking his head after 24 frustrating minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night: The quirky Kings went nuts from 3-point range,
attempting a staggering 23 and making only six. Williams was 0 for
7. With most teams, there is a fine line between a good and bad
shot. With the Kings, that line is a 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the stats, you can see they'll take it from
anywhere,'' Battie said. ``You just have to be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Walker, Potapenko, and Pierce, the Celtics would have
been lost without them. Walker usually has some of his best games
against Webber (his resume includes a 49-point game and a
last-second shot against the forward) and Friday night was not an
exception. The 6-foot-9-inch forward had 17 points, 10 rebounds,
and 9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Walker was asked if he thought of getting a late
assist to secure a triple-double. Former Orlando guard Anthony
Bowie once did that, a move that was frowned upon by coach Brian
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Walker said with a laugh, ``I'd probably get fined for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Potapenko and Pierce had 10 rebounds each. Pierce scored 10 of
his team-high 19 points in the fourth quarter and Potapenko made
the shot, an 18-footer with 26.3 seconds left, that unofficially
ended the Celtics' interesting night.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting for several reasons. One was the style of
play. There were times when you asked yourself if there were traces
of asphalt in the new parquet floor. There was definitely a
playground feel to the game, and the leader was unquestionably
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento point guard took 17 shots and made four. His
attempts were so distinct that many of them deserved their own
names. One of the most memorable was a one-handed, combination
pushup shot/finger roll from 10 feet. It didn't go in. There was
also a smooth fake in the open court that had the third sellout
crowd of the season gasping. But after the nice fake, Williams
missed the layup.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there were a lot of misses for the Kings. They trailed
by as many as 14 in the first half and 15 in the fourth because of
the way they shot (42 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we never got on track,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman
said, ``but we never stopped playing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious in the third and fourth quarters. In the third,
the Celtics went up 14 after Battie made a jumper. The Kings cut
the deficit to 5 in the next 3 1/2 minutes and trailed by a hoop 15
seconds into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we never lost the lead,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The lead reached 15 after Pierce scored off an
assist from Walker. The Kings worked on the bulge again, but there
was never a feeling they would take it.

McNair, Casserly talk as Saints hold breath
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Although they had spoken on the telephone several times since
Houston defeated Los Angeles for the NFL's 32nd franchise, Bob
McNair and former Washington Redskins general manager Charley
Casserly had their first face-to-face meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly was the first candidate interviewed by McNair for the
job of vice president of football operations, which will be the
most important position in the front office of Houston's expansion
team.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, who is the No. 1 candidate of New Orleans owner Tom
Benson, interviewed with McNair and executive vice president Steve
Patterson on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a window of opportunity for us to talk with Charley
and other candidates,'' McNair said after almost a full day of
interviewing Casserly. ``Because teams are looking for good people
_ and I'm not talking about New Orleans specifically _ the window's
small, and it's compressed the time a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limited amount of time in which this game of musical
chairs plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Until new Redskins owner Daniel Snyder fired him before the
season, Casserly had spent his entire NFL career with Washington,
working his way up the organization from getting coffee for former
coach George Allen to becoming the general manager of a Super Bowl
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly earned three Super Bowl rings with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like that,'' McNair said about Casserly having Super
Bowl rings. ``I'm impressed by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want somebody who's been with a successful organization,
someone who's accustomed to winning and doing things in a
first-class manner. Charley's got those kind of (credentials).''
</P>
<P>
   Reports in New Orleans say Benson is ready to make Casserly the
Saints' president/chief executive officer/general manager, which
means he would be in charge of the entire organization, including
the personnel and administrative sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that Houston's going to be a premier
franchise,'' Casserly said. ``I'm excited about the opportunity to
interview in Houston. I think if we started now, we'd have a better
chance for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're flattered when people are interested, but you have to
use good judgment when trying to make the best decisions. In this
process, I'm taking it one day at a time. We'll just have to wait
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair plans to interview other candidates, including Joe Mack,
who worked in Washington, Carolina and Cleveland.

WORKER'S COMP COSTS JUMP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers' compensation insurance premiums statewide have
skyrocketed 18 percent to 25 percent during the first week of 2000
in what industry officials say is a reflection of the true cost of
doing business -- and insuring businesses -- in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the startling rate hikes were endorsed by
the state Insurance Commissioner's Office, but officials with the
agency say they didn't force the companies to increase premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have advocated a rate increase of 18.4 percent, but we
don't have the authority to tell (insurance companies) to raise
their rates by that much,'' said Tim Taylor, a legislative analyst
with the Insurance Commissioner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   While not mandatory, the proposed decision signed Oct. 29 by
Michael A. Kelly, chief deputy to Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush, does give the green light for an increase of nearly 20
percent to any insurance company that filed plans with the agency
by Dec. 31 to raise its rates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Quackenbush nor Kelly returned messages left at their
offices this week. Industry officials blame the 1995 deregulation
of the state's workers' compensation market for this year's hike,
in a round-about way. When state lawmakers deregulated the
industry, insurance providers engaged in price slashing in an
attempt to gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result has been that prices have remained very flat,
increasing only by a certain percentage each year,'' Hanson said.
``But this is while the cost of the workers' compensation system
has skyrocketed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau said carriers
have been paying out $1.41 in workers' compensation claims to
policy holders for every dollar they charge.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase applies to new and renewal policies that take
effect on or after Jan. 1. Some insurance brokers said they have
already seen their clients' premiums double overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are going up dramatically, and we're trying to lower
commissions to ease the pain of our customers,'' said Fritz Mutter,
president of Golden Pacific Insurance Services Inc. in Pasadena, an
insurance brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fairbanks, vice president with the California Chamber of
Commerce in Sacramento, said she wasn't surprised by the increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done to the system,'' Fairbanks said.
``It's out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Hanson, a legal analyst for Chicago-based CCH Inc., a
business and financial services firm that covers the workers'
compensation industry, called the 18 percent increase ``an enormous
jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies had until Dec. 31 to file their rate
increases for 2000 with the state Insurance Commissioner's Office,
a normal step taken each year.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the state's top workers' compensation insurance firms
-- Superior National in Calabasas, Fremont Compensation in Glendale
and State Compensation Insurance Fund in San Francisco -- have
raised rates across the board, according to insurance experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since open-rating in 1995, we've seen really artificially low
premiums over those years, so employers have been really getting an
outstanding deal,'' Taylor said. ``This is really just a market
move that is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Christensen, a spokesman for State Compensation Insurance
Fund, said regional offices statewide have been inundated this week
with calls from businesses asking for new rate quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like January is going to be a very good month for
us,'' he said. ``Industry-wide, in order to get market share,
insurers in many cases were selling their insurance under what it
cost to pay out for claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior National issued a report Dec. 20 to its insurance
agents in an effort to explain to its policyholders why premiums
would begin rising on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The report blamed open-rating, in which employers received a
substantial decrease in the overall price of workers' compensation
premiums. But at the same time, the underlying costs of the
insurance product to carriers have increased ``at an alarming
rate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's `pay the piper' time,'' said one insurance industry
official, who asked that his name not be used.

WORKER'S COMP COSTS JUMP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers' compensation insurance premiums statewide have
skyrocketed 18 percent to 25 percent during the first week of 2000
in what industry officials say is a reflection of the true cost of
doing business -- and insuring businesses -- in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the startling rate hikes were endorsed by
the state Insurance Commissioner's Office, but officials with the
agency say they didn't force the companies to increase premiums.
</P>
<P>

QUICK FIX SOUGHT FOR 101-405 EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Carney  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring the 101-405 freeway interchange a ``gridlock
emergency'' of earthquake proportions, Assemblyman Tom McClintock
proposed legislation Friday aimed at speeding improvements to ease
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock, R-Granada Hills, said fixing the Valley's ground
zero for gridlock should be done as quickly as the 66 days Caltrans
needed after the Northridge Earthquake to repair the 10 Freeway in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Wilson was able to invoke emergency powers to cut through
industrial-sized spools of red tape,'' he said at a news conference
held beside the 405 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between a highway made impassable by an
act of God and one made impassable by 25 years of neglect by man?''
said McClintock, vice chairman of the Assembly's Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said three decades of minimal freeway construction has led to
the traffic problem, and he wants to empower the governor to
expedite construction by declaring a ``gridlock emergency'' if a
certain stretch of freeway has reached 3,000 hours of delay per
day. That figure, calculated from traffic and congestion numbers,
is reached at several traffic bottlenecks throughout L.A.,
including the much-maligned intersection of the 101 and 405
freeways.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News series in 1997 identified that intersection as the
nucleus of Valley gridlock, and a recent survey named it the
seventh-most-congested junction in the country. The worst was the
intersection of the 405 and 10 freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Work to improve and expand the 101-405 interchange is set to
begin later this year, however, and the $7.9 million project will
be complete by 2002. It will add an auxiliary lane to the
northbound 405, and add a second connector lane from the north 405
to the eastbound 101 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said the State Highway Account is expected to have a
$2 billion surplus this year, earmarked for projects that Caltrans
doesn't have time to get to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding an additional lane to that freeway,'' he said,
gesturing to traffic passing on the 405, ``is no problem for a
contractor -- if the bureaucracy is swept away. It doesn't take
that long to build a freeway.''
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said time could be saved by running federal and state
environmental reviews concurrently, by contracting out engineering
work instead of requiring that it be done by Caltrans, and by
speeding up the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans is remaining neutral on the issue, said agency
spokesman John Robin Witt. But he warned that any time saved by an
abbreviated process could be eaten up by court battles, from losing
bidders challenging an abridged selection process, concerned
residential neighbors or angry environmentalists opposing
accelerated reviews.
</P>
<P>
   After the Northridge Quake, Caltrans saved time by having
bidders submit plans along with their bids, eliminating a step. But
Witt said that also made the process more complex and pulled
Caltrans employees off other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's something you want to do on an everyday
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And an environmental review, he said, is ``probably the single
most sensitive and time-consuming part of the project. Under the
best circumstances, that's going to take six months.'' But they can
last even longer if the area being built upon is discovered to have
historical significance and requires an archeological study, or
contains endangered species that have to be relocated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said there should be no difference between the
Northridge situation, in which existing freeway bridges had to be
rebuilt, and new projects to add lanes to traffic-choked freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said the freeway problem is mainly a money
issue, according to deputy press secretary Hilary McLean. During
his State of the State address Wednesday, he said local
transportation agencies are sitting on $1.7 billion in unspent
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are available transportation dollars. Let's get these
projects under way so we won't have these problems,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor agrees with the Republicans -- under the Wilson
administration, Caltrans needed a swift kick to get a move on,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The act that Wilson invoked, the state Emergency Services Act,
which gives the governor increased authority in times of crisis,
covers disasters of all kinds -- but not bad traffic, said Jaime
Arteaga, information officer with the governor's Office of
Emergency Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened after Northridge, it was caused by the disaster.
It was imperative that the roads could be fixed so folks could get
back to work and what have you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gov. Davis signed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman
Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, which enabled Caltrans to fast-track
construction on certain projects, picked by the agency's director.
The bill, AB405, was named for the 101-405 interchange, where Knox
has long championed improvement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock's proposal would let the governor decide which
freeways are in a state of gridlock emergency and in need of
immediate relief, and take the decision out of Caltrans' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of building highways, (Caltrans has) become the single
biggest impediment to highway construction,'' he said. ``As a
practical matter it's a lot easier to do it this way than to change
the whole system.''

Vikings quarterback Jeff George appears poised to shed his
``loser'' label. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Beware NFL: Jeff is no longer a Boy
George.
</P>
<P>
   Matured, if not totally humbled, by a tumultuous 10-year career,
Minnesota Vikings quarterback Jeff George is poised to grow out of
the ``loser'' label earned with wild incompletions, sideline spats
and postgame pouts during failed stints with the Indianapolis
Colts, Atlanta Falcons and Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly in this weirdest of all NFL seasons, George actually
led a team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back, because what's in the past is in the
past,'' said George, who will lead the Vikings against the Cowboys
in tomorrow's NFC wild-card playoff game at 11:30 a.m. at the
Metrodome. ``There are things I'm not proud of, but we all make
mistakes. I'm basically the same person, but now I'm on a winning
team. The main thing is I've got a great chance with a great team
to erase a bad rap, a bad reputation. If I can play like I'm
capable and we can win some games, people will look at me
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the spoiled brat who reneged on a oral promise to attend
Miami, transferred from Purdue to Illinois, whined with the Colts
and yelled at coach June Jones on the sideline with the Falcons,
George is still smirky, cocky, and overwhelmingly talented. He
credits his overhaul not to a personality face lift, but to a
significant upgrade in targets _ Randy Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In catching George's bullets,] Moss and Carter have also caught
George's reputation from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty? What you see right now is the same that I've
been for 10 years,'' said George, who began the season as a backup
to Randall Cunningham but now has the Vikings streaking into the
playoffs having won eight of 10. ``It just so happens that during
the course of the game, when you're winning, if you have a shouting
match on the sidelines it's not magnified. When you're losing, it
was. So I'm just as vocal on the sidelines as I've been in the
past; it's just that I've been in some bad situations.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Raiders failed to offer George a contract last spring,
his career hit the two-minute warning. He was a 33-year-old with a
37-74 record as a starter and the tag of being more negative than
George Costanza.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed with Vikings in April, it was only a minimum
$400,000 insurance policy after Minnesota traded backup Brad
Johnson to the Washington Redskins. On the eve of their first
playoff game since last year's heartbreaking loss in the NFC
Championship Game, George is now Minneapolis' most unlikely hero
since Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done is remarkable,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green
said. ``We went to him almost out of desperation, and he's been
sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   Green paced into the locker room, his 2-3 Vikings trailing the
Detroit Lions 19-0 at halftime Oct. 17 at the Silverdome. His move
to bench Cunningham and insert George didn't save a game, but it
certainly rescued a season.
</P>
<P>
   In half of precision passing and impassioned play, the supposed
pariah George rallied the Vikings to a 23-22 lead, only to watch
the Lions mount a last-minute drive for the game-winning field
goal. Despite the loss, it was that second half that ignited a
five-game winning streak and re-established the Vikings as one of
the most dangerous teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing how things have turned out, it's hard to argue with the
decision, isn't it?'' said Cunningham, who led the Vikings to a
15-1 regular-season record and within one field goal of the Super
Bowl last season. ``This year has been Jeff's time to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   George's reincarnation changed the course of the season, the way
the Vikings practice, the way receivers run routes and the way
opposing defenses prepare game plans. Under George, the receivers
had to become much more alert. Cunningham has a longer windup,
meaning receivers had plenty of warning a pass was coming. He was
also more likely to lock in on a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   George's release is one of the quickest in football, and he
makes his reads _ looking from one receiver to another _ with
similar speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff likes to run a lot of slant patterns,'' Carter said.
``And he's going to get the ball to you quicker on those slant
patterns. Your adjustment there is it might come to you out of the
break, or he might hold it until you run through the zone a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Cunningham struggled was defenses had committed to
taking away Moss on deep patterns. Of Cunningham's 124 completions
this season, 77 (62 percent) went to wide receivers. Of George's
177 completions this season, 140 (79 percent) have gone to wide
receivers _ the strength of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? The Vikings finished No. 3 in yards gained,
only one spot behind last year's record-setting offense. During the
final 10 games, with George at quarterback, the Vikings averaged 28
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and take all the credit,'' said
George, who threw 23 touchdowns, only 12 interceptions and will
likely command $6 million as a free agent in the off-season. ``This
was a fantastic offense last year when I was in Oakland. I've just
gotten the ball to the right people and let them make plays. They
make a quarterback's job easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though leery of George's unique physical skills, the Cowboys
aren't yet convinced of his mental maturation. Sure he can throw
25-yard slant patterns without having his feet set, but how will he
hold up in a playoff game under heavy pressure?
</P>
<P>
   In both of his losses as a starter (at Tampa Bay and Kansas
City), George had turnovers returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put pressure on him he's been known to crumple in the
pocket,'' said Cowboys defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban. ``I think he
can be rattled a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   George, who threw three second-half touchdowns in Minnesota's
10-point victory over Dallas in November, scoffs at the mounting
pressure. He has been the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL, the
run-and-shoot quarterback who threw for 4,100 yards, and he has
been the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   What he has never been, however, is champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to win,'' he said. ``That's the ultimate goal.
But I'm not out to prove anyone wrong. I know where I want to go,
and I know where this team wants to go. And that's to win the big
one. To come from where I was, and me not knowing my situation ...
yes, it's exciting. But there's nothing to prove. It's not me.
We're 8-2 as a team. Not one guy can do it. I'm just around a great
group of guys, a great supporting cast and just trying to win like
the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   By George, he's finally got it. nn

CORNERBACK STARTER OPPOSITE SANDERS STILL UNDECIDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After their final day of practice before
tomorrow's NFC wild-card game against the Minnesota Vikings, the
Cowboys still don't know who will line up at cornerback opposite
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Kevin Mathis (sprained knee) and Kevin Smith (strained
hamstring), who were hobbled the last month of the season by
injuries, practiced yesterday for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who is not as enthusiastic about
Smith's progress as he is Mathis', said it will likely come down to
a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   If he is ready, the eight-year veteran Smith will start. If not
Smith, then it could be Mathis or reserve Charlie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin \RSmith\S has improved, but he didn't take the jump we'd
have liked,'' Gailey said. ``Mathis looks to be a little closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was noncommittal on a starter largely because of the
uncertainty surrounding the game readiness of both players.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey understands that some times it takes injured players a
few plays to get back in a groove. Any hesitancy could be crippling
against the Vikings and their arsenal of big-play receivers.
COWBOYS CONFIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Few people outside their circle of friends are giving the
Cowboys much chance in tomorrow's game, but they are not without
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey said his team has practiced with a lot of energy and
focus this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys believe, and they feel good about themselves,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said: ``We're not taking a
psychology course this week to tell ourselves that `we can do it.'
We know we can do it. We've just got to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague agreed, saying, ``If at some point we
actually play our best game and put it all together, there's not
anybody we can't beat and no reason we can't make it all the way to
the Super Bowl.'' TUCKER WONDERING
</P>
<P>
   Attention, Vikings coach Denny Green: Cowboys receiver Jason
Tucker wants to know what you think of him.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants didn't think much of him, even after his
128-yard breakout game against the New Orleans Saints, and he
burned the Giants for a 90-yard touchdown reception. Will the
Giants show him more defensive attention or will they dare him to
beat them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they are going to do,'' Tucker said. ``I'm
sure they'll pay more attention to Raghib Ismail. I'm going to
continue to try to make plays to help us win. Nobody expected
anything from me a few weeks ago; I hope they still don't.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 2-0 in playoff games at Minnesota, winning there
in 1971 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have made more playoff appearances (26), played in
more playoff games (52) and have more playoff wins (32) than any
team in the postseason. Of course, the Cowboys are 0-2 in the
playoffs since defeating the Vikings in a 1996 NFC wild-card game.
Running back Emmitt Smith is the NFL's all-time playoff leader in
rushing touchdowns with 18. He needs 70 yards rushing to pass
Franco Harris for the top spot in that category. nn

SMU QUIETLY SNEAKING UP ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL'S ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ SMU's Mike Dement views his men's basketball program as
``a work in progress.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 12-2 record, though, arouses curiosity and provokes a question
not heard recently around University Park: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could these Mustangs, off the third-best start in school
history, be the real deal? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait and see,'' said Jeryl Sasser, SMU's
normally brash and flamboyant guard. ``I'm wondering if we are. I
feel in my heart that we are, and I see us everyday in practice.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The evidence supports Sasser's conviction, and if so, SMU, which
begins conference play today at home against Rice, could be on
track for its first NCAA Tournament appearance since the 1992-93
Mustangs captured the Southwest Conference title. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs have road victories at Southwest Missouri State,
Houston and Tennessee-Chattanooga and home victories against
Richmond, New Mexico State and Lamar. SMU's only losses are by
three at 7-5 Missouri and by five at 10-2 Tulane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on non-conference play, SMU might be the WAC's most
formidable challenger to 22nd-ranked Tulsa, which opened conference
play with a 94-73 victory at TCU on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Mustangs have played, Dement, in his fifth
season, said they are a long way from being where they want to be,
advancing from a mid-level status to an annual NCAA Tournament
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the hardest jump,'' Dement said. ``It's like a
ceiling. There are a lot of us trying to get through it, and it's
difficult. I don't know if we have everything in place yet to do
that. It's kind of a work in progress right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dement fielded the 12th-youngest team in Division I a year ago
with nine players either freshmen or sophomores. Those Mustangs
limped from the gate and lost seven of their first 10 games. A
late-season rush _ seven victories in their final 10 games _ served
as a sign of better times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs reached the WAC Tournament semifinals before being
eliminated by New Mexico in a one-point loss. The early-season skid
likely cost SMU a berth in the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in that locker room and talked amongst ourselves, and
we said that we had to start this season where we left off last
season,'' point guard Stephen Woods said. ``We were committed to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser, Woods and forward Willie Davis, whom Dement said ``has
played the best basketball,'' provide the Mustangs a potent 1-2-3
punch. Sasser, the WAC's Mountain Division Player of the Year as a
sophomore, leads the Mustangs in scoring (17.7) and assists (4.6)
and ranks second to Davis in rebounding (9.2).
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a senior, averages 14.5 points and 3.3 assists per game,
and Davis provides the Mustangs an inside threat, contributing 17.3
points and 9.5 rebounds per game. That trifecta makes the Mustangs
difficult to break.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't stop all three of us at the same time,'' Davis
said. ``Somebody's going to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Dement acknowledges as much, but the Mustangs need a little more
to crack that next echelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three guys are going to be tough to handle for
anybody,'' Dement said. ``They're going to draw a lot of attention,
which means that fourth and fifth \Rscoring options\S become the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where guards Damon Hancock and Quinton Ross, fourth and
fifth on the team in minutes played, enter the equation, but the
lack of another presence inside could be SMU's Achilles' heel
unless either Jon Forinash, DeWayne Floyd, Mike Niemi or a
combination of the three provide the Mustangs rebounds, defense and
a few baskets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need that big man,'' Dement said. ``We need
somebody to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be all that separates the Mustangs from a date with
March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go to the NCAA Tournament,'' Sasser said.
``That's the foremost thing on everybody's mind.'' nn

NELSON IS SUSPENDED ONE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE AND JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the first time in his 148-game coaching tenure with
the Mavericks, Don Nelson has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was suspended yesterday for one game and fined $10,000
for his confrontation with Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz and for
bumping referee Scott Wall in the Mavericks' 105-92 loss Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was fined $10,000 for throwing an elbow at center Shawn
Bradley, and for engaging in the confrontation with Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Donnie Nelson will coach tonight's home game
against the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked only the second time Nelson had been ejected
from a regular-season game since he started coaching the Mavericks
on Dec. 4, 1997. His other ejection was also at Reunion Arena
against Utah, on March 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, saying he will not be ``intimidated by Karl Malone or
anybody else,'' defended his role in the fracas yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it for any reason other than to protect my team,''
Nelson said. ``I thought there were a couple of dirty plays, and I
thought he tried to hurt my players. So, I went to their defense.
I'll do it every time. I'm not intimidated by Karl Malone or
anybody else. That's just the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson went onto the court after being ejected by Wall with 6:04
remaining in the third quarter. Nelson objected after Bradley was
whistled for a foul against Malone, whose knee struck Bradley's
midsection as Bradley tried to draw a charge. Bradley was on the
floor for several minutes before he was helped to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson continued to argue the call after Bradley left the court,
and Wall ejected Nelson. The Mavericks' coach then confronted
Malone, bumping Malone before the two were separated. Nelson was
escorted out of the arena. Malone was also called for a technical
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught when I was little to respect my elders, but
you're totally out of line when you get in a player's face,''
Malone said. ``He crossed the line, and I have no respect for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson declined to label Malone ``a dirty player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go as far as to say that,'' Nelson said, ``but
definitely he has a history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suffered an abdominal contusion from the collision and
left the game before returning. The on-court argument between
Nelson and Malone escalated to the point that the Mavericks' coach
bumped the player before being restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 54 before Nelson's first technical, and
Utah outscored the Mavericks 51-38 during the final 18 minutes for
a 105-92 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept their composure and got the ball to the right
players,'' said Michael Finley, who scored 30 points for the
Mavericks, who have lost nine of their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Finley played in his 329th consecutive game, third-longest
active streak in the league. nn

A GIVEN SUNDAY MIGHT BE ALL COWBOYS NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is more than a touch of irony that in the same week that
Oliver Stone's testament to NFL excess, ``On Any Given Sunday'',
was in theaters across the country, Cowboys' fans were yawning at
the prospect of their team venturing to Minnesota for a wild-card
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? That was the talk-show message delivered by
know-it-all hosts and callers alike. This clearly is a team not
going anywhere, they all said. End the suffering, take a better
draft position and start planning for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Are we spoiled, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl or nothing for our gang. No crackers and cheese for
these minions. Only caviar _ Beluga's best, please _ will do. And
forget the root beer. Dom Perignon, nicely chilled, or we'll take
our business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow's game at the Metrodome is all about what the Pete
Rozelles and Tex Schramms and George Halases always tried to tell
us was at the heart and soul of the NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   It's about heart and grit and determination. It's about dreams
and want-to and a chance, just a chance. How many times have we
begged for a team we loved to have just a chance?
</P>
<P>
   One more chance.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, we think we know this Cowboys' team all too well. It
has no chance, the cynics will be quick to assure you, and maybe
they're right. Maybe this team has no heart and no soul. Certainly
it has played like it plenty of times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys are in the playoffs because they earned it, even
at 8-8. That's a record we normally throw back around here, but
this isn't your normal NFL any more, and maybe it's time we got
used to it. Maybe it's time we began to understand that this isn't
the early '90s any more and that the rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson has been gone for six long years now, and maybe he
understood better than any of us how things would be in the new
NFL. More irony: Johnson's Miami Dolphins back-doored their way
into the playoffs, too, at 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing is to tell ourselves that the Cowboys can't win
tomorrow against the offensively talented Vikings. They blew a
17-point lead there earlier in the season, and maybe we're kidding
ourselves when we keep saying that things would have been different
if Emmitt Smith hadn't been sidelined after the first half with a
broken hand following an impressive 140-yard performance.
</P>
<P>
   Better to think the worst and not be disappointed. I suppose
that's the theory. At least if the Cowboys go on and lose, the talk
show know-it-alls can tell us, `See, I told you they had no chance,
the bums.'
</P>
<P>
   But what a miserable way to live life, never believing in
anything, being afraid to hope or dream.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what a great story it'll make if the Cowboys not only
win tomorrow, but begin to play as we thought they could this
season. What if Troy Aikman catches fire? Or Jason Tucker continues
to look more and more like Patrick Jeffers? Or Emmitt Smith becomes
Walter Payton incarnate one more time? Or two? Or three?
</P>
<P>
   What if? Isn't that what the NFL had in mind when it coined the
phrase ``On any given Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so no 8-8 team has ever won an NFL playoff game. Does that
make it impossible? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   So here's my advice for you this weekend. Go ahead, dream a
little. Forget the naysayers. They'll always be there. Allow
yourself to hope.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no room for hope this season, of all seasons, then
there will never be. Never has the NFC championship race seemed so
wide open. Yes, the Rams have had a glorious season _ a dream
season, if you will _ but they're still the Rams, after all. Who
knows how they'll react under playoff pressure?
</P>
<P>
   Anybody else out there scare you? The 49ers are but a memory.
The Pack isn't back. There are no Monsters of the Midway lurking
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the way to the Super Bowl is littered with not-so-scary
characters like the Rams, the Bucs and the Redskins, already twice
beaten by the Cowboys. Tomorrow's game, in fact, could be as tough
as any the Cowboys play if they should continue their postseason
journey. At least as tough as anything this side of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been an enigmatic team, unable to win on the
road since the season opener in Washington, unable to beat anyone
outside of their own division on the road since 1997, unable to
sustain anything beyond a one-game winning streak since starting
the year 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 15 of their players own Super Bowl rings. They know what it
takes. They have made this trip before.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all the Cowboys need is that one given Sunday, when it all
comes together. Or maybe even three.
</P>
<P>
   Just think what a movie that journey would make.

GAHAN HAPPY SHE JOINED IOWA STATE ON THE FAMILY PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tracy Gahan insists that playing at Iowa State wasn't a plan
concocted by her parents or her brother. It just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Terry, and her father, John, both graduated from
Iowa State. And her older brother, Jeff, is an All-American swimmer
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa State didn't start recruiting me until the end of my
junior year,'' said the former McKinney High School star, who
averages 5.6 points and 4.1 rebounds as a sophomore for the
10th-ranked Cyclones. ``Me coming here had nothing to do with my
parents or brother. They were happy that I came here, but they
would've supported me wherever I went. I just loved the coaches
here, and I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were pleased that their daughter selected their alma
mater over TCU and Oklahoma, but Gahan is even more pleased,
considering ISU is 10-2 and the favorite to win the Big 12 title.
It's a luxury that her brother is there and that when their parents
come up, it's their trip down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all my mom does when she comes up. She likes to tell me
what she did when she was here,'' said Gahan, who was the Texas
Class 4A player of the year in her senior year. ``My brother and I
weren't close at all in high school. It was never like I wanted to
follow him to college. We're pretty close now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gahan, Ames was an easy choice. Iowa State has made three
consecutive NCAA appearances and reached the Elite Eight last
season. The only thing she finds tough is dispelling misconceptions
high school friends have about the Iowa's vast farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there is more to do around Dallas, but Ames is a great
town,'' she said. ``Everyone thinks it's all cornfields, but there
is stuff to do here.''
FAST BREAKS WHO'S BETTER? Today's game between No. 1 UConn and No.
2 Tennessee (3 p.m., KTVT/Ch. 11) features the two best teams of
the '90s. Save for the Lady Vols' slip in the first game of the
season, a 69-64 defeat against Louisiana Tech, both teams have been
dominant this season.
</P>
<P>
   Through 11 games, No. 1 Connecticut is undefeated and winning by
an average of 38.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Geno \RAuriemma\S has had some great teams, but this
may be his best ever,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. ``It is
difficult to see what you are looking for when most of the games
are blowouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you give UConn the national title, however, remember what
happened to the Huskies last season. At the same point last season,
Connecticut was undefeated and winning by an average of 28.2 points
and didn't lose until game No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   But, UConn didn't make the Final Four, losing to Iowa State in a
regional final. A MEANINGFUL HOOP Kimberly James, a sophomore
forward at Bethune-Cookman, scored the first points of the 2000s in
college basketball when she hit a layup at the 19:02 mark of the
Wildcats' 61-59 victory against Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about making your basket counts. It was James' only two
points of the game. GOT A SPARE $600,000 Empty your pockets; the
Philadelphia coordinating committee for the Women's Final Four
needs an additional $600,000 for promotions planned around the
event played March 31-April 2. Philadelphia Women's Basketball 2000
has already raised $1.4 million to pay for pep rallies, uniforms
for volunteers, parties and other details.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Not-So Brotherly Love shouldn't feel too bad. At the
same time last year San Jose, Calif., which hosted the 1999 Final
Four, was $300,000 short of its $1.6 million target and it achieved
its goal in time. A FAMILIAR SIGHT Texas A&AMP;M junior transfer
Jaynetta Saunders has been named the Big 12 Conference rookie of
the week in three of the five times the award has been given. She
leads A&AMP;M with 20 blocks and 16.6 points per game and is the
league's top shooter, hitting 63.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Big 12 players to be rookie of the week three
times or more are Jennifer Crow of Oklahoma State, three times in
1996-97; Julie Helm of Missouri, three times in 1996-97; Megan
Taylor of Iowa State, five times in 1997-98; and LaNeishea Caufield
of Oklahoma, four times in 1998-99. nn

MAVERICKS ROOKIE BEGINS CLASSWORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Leon Smith left a Dallas psychiatric clinic and flew to
Houston yesterday while the Mavericks continued discussing the
rookie forward's future with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks president and chief executive officer Terdema Ussery
declined to say whether the Mavericks will make Smith a free agent
by terminating his three-year, $1.5 million contract. Billy Hunter,
executive director of the National Basketball Players Association,
wants Smith released from his contract so he can get a shot with
another NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to Hunter about a lot of things,'' Ussery said.
``We've talked about everything from A to Z, but we're not going to
know for sure what's going to happen until we get everything
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Purvis Short, director of player programs for the players union,
said Smith will be taking college courses in Houston that are
available to every NBA player. They include a financial education
program, player assistance program, career education program and a
basic health-education program.
</P>
<P>
   Short also said Smith's routine will not include workouts with
future Hall-of-Fame center Moses Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some people who are going to be training with Leon,
but Moses is not one of them,'' Short said. ``We have not even
talked to Moses about anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will live in an apartment with a roommate provided by the
NBPA. He also will continue his psychiatric treatments and
counseling sessions in Houston.

MARKING FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY, HOUSE REPUBLICANS REGROUP
</HEADLINE>

Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (rk)

   WASHINGTON _ Five years after Republicans took control of the
House with a rallying cry emphasizing family values, GOP lawmakers
are looking for something else to talk about in time for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Their focus on virtue took a big hit during President Clinton's
impeachment saga when several Republican leaders were forced to
address their own personal infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   So, Republicans are doing all they can to distance themselves
from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, their onetime hero and
leader whose righteous calls for a new morality in America stirred
conservatives but later rang hollow amid revelations of his own
long-running extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced, Gingrich wasn't even invited to the GOP
anniversary celebration on Capitol Hill, even though he is widely
viewed as the architect of the successful 1994 Republican
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Newt had a reversal of fortune doesn't in any
way distract from the accomplishments of the Republican Congress,''
said Rep. Spencer Bachus R-Ala., who cited welfare reform as one
example. ``I think we've been splendidly successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Capitol Hill Republicans prefer to talk about money,
not morality. They cite their record on balancing the budget and
promise tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from running in the red to running in the black,''
Bachus said.
</P>
<P>
   While many economists point to the 1993 balanced budget deal _
crafted by Clinton and congressional leaders _ as a key turning
point in the nation's fiscal health, Republicans say they deserve
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done a far better job of managing the taxpayers'
money,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHORS AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., recently made the pages of The
Washington Post's Sunday magazine, but he probably could have done
without the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline ``Filipinos Float Shelby A Loaner,'' the
article detailed a congressional trip to the Philippines taken in
September by members of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
which Shelby heads.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's desire to visit a strategic island in Manila Bay was
delayed by engine trouble on his boat. The solution? The Philippine
president authorized use of his yacht for the Shelby entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be much more luxurious than they had asked
for,'' said Shelby spokeswoman Andrea Andrews, who described the
trip as productive, saying it allowed senators and staffers to
learn about U.S. intelligence needs in that region.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR PAINS
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are not about to let an apparent victory get in the
way of what may turn out to be a potent political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hit by a barrage of GOP criticism for its statement that federal
health and safety regulations apply to at-home workers, the Labor
Department quickly retreated from that stand, promising to study
the issue instead.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers didn't relent in their criticism and promised to
hold their own hearings. ``The secretary has not ruled out
reissuing this advisory at a later date,'' noted Rep. Jim DeMint,
R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cass Ballenger, the North Carolina Republican who chairs a
key House work force subcommittee, said the prospect of federal
regulations applied to home workers ``would result in many
employers rethinking flexible, family-friendly arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TALKS
</P>
<P>
   The two major political parties have their own wealthy patrons,
according to a new study that concludes politicians are sinking
deeper into the money chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Buying of the President 2000 by the Center for Public
Integrity found that both Democrats and Republicans have long lists
of corporate and special interests that regularly fill party
coffers with millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of soft-money contributors to the Republican
National Committee was tobacco giant Philip Morris Inc., which
donated $6.2 million between 1991 and 1999. Amway Corp. came in
second with $4.5 million, followed by the American Financial Group
with $3.5 million, Nabisco with $3.2 million and At&AMP;T Corp. with $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   During that same period, the Democratic National Committee
collected most of its donations from unions, notably the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees with $3.7
million, followed by the Communication Workers of America with $3.6
million. The Seagram Co. donated $2.7 million, the National
Education Association gave $2.6 million, and the American
Federation of Teachers coughed up $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians have become so deeply enmeshed in the money chase
and personally tied to powerful economic interest that they have
lost the esteem and trust of the American people,'' said Charles
Lewis, director of the group.

   LOS ANGELES _ Eddie Jones could only play spectator. Glen Rice's
play, first a spectacle, became spectacular.
</P>
<P>

deal that made him a Laker, and made L.A. fan favorite Jones a
Charlotte Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   Rice scored 10 of his 17 points in the fourth, including a
momentum-turning 3-pointer in the final three minutes, as the Los
Angeles Lakers narrowly escaped with an 87-83 victory over the
Hornets at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Rice started slowly and was 1 for 6 entering the final quarter.
Then he was suddenly everywhere. He grabbed six rebounds in the
fourth quarter and hit the biggest shot of the night.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-pointer capped a 20-5 Lakers run that brought them back
from a 13-point deficit and gave them, incredibly, their first lead
of the night,80-78
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets sans the injured Jones with ex-Laker Elden Campbell
on the bench after fouling out fell behind by six but were within
two, 85-83, with 13.4 seconds left. Bobby Phills had the chance to
hit the potential game-winner, but with 3.5 seconds left, he
stepped out of bounds in the left corner while attempting a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the onetime Hornet, then nailed two game-clinching free
throws with 3 seconds remaining, and the Lakers extended their
winning streak to13. The Hornets lost their fourth in a row and are
2-6 since Jones injured his left elbow in late December.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never needed Rice's scoring more than they did
against his old team. Shaquille O'Neal struggled to navigate the
Hornets' sea of big bodies, including Campbell, and finished with a
below-average 23 points. Kobe Bryant, Jones' close friend, seemed
out of sorts and missed 14 of19 shots to finish with 13 points and
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones in the house, and Campbell in the lineup, Bryant
conceded there was a special element to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just motivation as far as being competitive because you
played together and you don't want him beating you,'' he said.
``I'm sure he doesn't want us beating him, just for bragging
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more-significant level, the game pitted the Lakers, one of
the top teams in the West, against the Hornets, who until recently
had the best record in the East. Until Jones went down with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team to be reckoned with in the Eastern
Conference,'' Bryant said. ``They've been struggling as of late of
course, that's due to a couple injuries they have, but they're
definitely a team to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad omens came early for the Lakers. Jones got the most
applause despite not playing (and appearing as a member of the
opposing team), Rice was misfiring from the outset, O'Neal's
3-footers were 3 inches short.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was this: The Lakers never got a lead in the
first halfand trailed 47-44 at halftime. That had only happened
twice before this season, and both games ended in Lakers losses, to
Houston and Toronto./ep In the first upset of the evening, O'Neal,
Rice and Bryant all were held to single-digit scoring in the first
half. The trio combined to make 5 of 22 shots, with Bryant going 2
for 12.
</P>
<P>
   A resurgent Derek Fisher scored nine points for the only Lakers
highlight of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Fans wasted no time welcoming Jones back to L.A.. His first
ovation came before pregame intros, before the National Anthem,
before Denzel Washington had even taken his courtside seat.
</P>
<P>
   Jones strolled out of the tunnel with his teammates, his face
beamed live on the jumbo video screen, and received a heartfelt
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the return Jones had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing, so I'm not back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expectations of suspicious Lakers staffers, Jones is
still several days away from playing and had no chance of suiting
up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even straighten my arm out,'' he said. ``I don't want
to come back to the team just because we lost a few games. I'm not
100 percent. .. I don't want to fall again, land on my elbow again,
then I have to have surgery. That's one step I don't want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jones will look forward to March 10, when he returns to
Staples to play the Clippers, and to Feb. 16, when the Lakers head
to Charlotte though, he admitted, ``it won't be the same'' as
facing his old mates in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready in a month,'' he said. ``I'll be healed all
up.''

USC WOMEN SURVIVE AGAINST WASHINGTON ST.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The USC women's basketball team barely survived
its 71-61 victory over Washington State on Friday night at the Lyon
Center, but the Trojans were more than happy to take it, since it
was the first good news they had all week.
</P>
<P>
   The program is still reeling from last week's death of
administrative assistant Barbara Williams from a brain aneurism,
and an emotional funeral service was held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle. I think emotionally, we were just spent,''
USC coach Chris Gobrecht said. ``We did not have a good week of
practice for obvious reasons. It was a very, very emotional time.
We were pretty flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Trojans (6-5, 1-0), senior guard Erica
Mashia had one of the best games of her career, tying a
school-record with six 3-pointers and finished with 20 points.
Mashia made six of nine 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Erica's shooting,'' Gobrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   USC also got an unexpected boost from walk-on freshman Erin
Young, who had a career-high nine points and three rebounds. Young
played 21 minutes, 14 more than her career-best. Forward Tiffany
Washington had 11 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (3-8, 0-1) stayed close thanks to senior guard
Jennifer Kerns, who had 25 points. The Cougars also benefited from
USC's 24 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though the biggest thing was we turned the ball over too
much,'' Gobrecht said. ``The turnovers were just really the biggest
indicator of us not being sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   USC also played shorthanded. Third-leading scorer Tiffany Elmore
missed the game with a sprained ankle and reserve point guard
Camille Norwood was suspended for disciplinary reasons.

DREAM TEAM VOTERS FELL ASLEEP FOR SURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We're sorry, but this year's Golden Globetrotters
are a joke. It's the worst snub we've seen since the Academy
overlooked Jim Carrey's performance in ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 11-member committee choosing the U.S. Olympic men's
basketball team had been entrusted with Golden Globe nominations,
it probably would have left Michael Clarke Duncan off the Best
Supporting Actor list for his performance in ``The Green Mile''
because it wasn't sufficiently impressed with his body of work.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez being left off some voters' MVP ballots this past
baseball season was borderline burlesque. USA basketball leaving
Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Vince Carter and Jason Williams off the
12-man team that will represent the U.S. at the Summer Olympics in
Sydney is downright farcical.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen ones Ray Allen, Steve Smith and Allan Houston are solid
players, don't get us wrong. And they've been in the NBA longer
than cornrows and braids.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Bryant, Carter and Williams, they're the old
guard(s). That clearly was no small consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When representing Old Glory, it's apparently of utmost
importance to have earned one's stripes.
</P>
<P>
   That maturity mattered more than mastery or marketing is
curious, given that the Summer Games are the Mount Olympus of
commercialism. Why, they make David Stern's NBA look almost, well,
quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he wanted to be on the U.S. team that will compete
in Sydney, but he didn't go out of his way to campaign for it.
Silly him, he thought it would be enough to do his canvassing on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I wanted to represent my country in the 2000
Olympics,'' Bryant said Friday before the Lakers' game against
Charlotte at the Staples Center. ``Ever since they made the
conversion from college players to pros (in 1992) I've really
wanted to play in the Olympics. I was hoping it would be in 2000,
but at the same time I'm going to have other chances.''
</P>
<P>
   His health willing, he'll be a lock in 2004. But if Bryant is
talented enough now, why hold him back? Olympic historian Bud
Greenspan's films are chock-full of U.S. athletes who unseated
their elders on their way to fame and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Gymnast Mary Lou Retton had a slimmer resume than teammate Kathy
Johnson in 1984 but took home more gold. A high school star
supplanted one of the sport's trail blazers in the pitching
rotation of the softball team that went on to win the gold medal in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, USA Basketball's insistence on recognizing
age over pure ability seems no less archaic than the amateur ideals
upon which the modern Olympic movement was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Dream Team?
</P>
<P>
   Dream On.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a team selection, these were political appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe, Vince Carter, they're too young, both of them,'' Lakers
coach Phil Jackson said Friday. ``They've got to pay their dues.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal said dismissively, but
it'll cost them.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fact that a few of the planet's premier players will
be missing from the world's stage. ``Those guys don't understand
marketing,'' said O'Neal, who turned down an Olympic invitation,
assuring Alonzo Mourning a berth to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you leave out Kobe, Iverson, Stephon Marbury?'' O'Neal
added, shaking his head. ``I don't know how you leave out my two
favorite players, Jason Williams and Vince Carter. Vince Carter on
the wing, that's excitement. That's money. And do you know how many
Jason Williams jerseys they would have sold?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, USA Basketball should have waited to name its
team until, say, July or August, the same time the U.S. Olympic
swimming and track and field squads will be culled. Why, by then
Tim Hardaway could be fully recovered from his knee injury and Vin
Baker might have found the All-Star form he seems to have
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway and Baker are among the Sydney dozen, begging the
question, Have spies from the Croatian team infiltrated USA
Basketball or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's on the committee?'' Bryant said. ``I don't even know.
I'd like to. Just out of curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   He has every reason to wonder.
</P>

LAKERS HOLD OFF HORNETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eddie Jones could only play spectator. Glen Rice's
play, first a spectacle, became spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   And when the principals in the The Trade finally shared the
floor Friday night, Rice did his best to justify the Los Angeles
Lakers' March 1999 decision to bring him to L.A., and send fan
favorite Jones to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers' winning streak in severe jeopardy, with an
injured Jones watching from the bench, with the Staples Center
throng still chanting ``Ed-die'' at odd moments, Rice stepped
forward and maybe at last earned his own following.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 10 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, including a
momentum-turning 3-pointer with 2:36 remaining, leading the Lakers
to a narrow 87-83 victory over the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was 1 for 6 entering the final quarter and had virtually
disappeared. Then, suddenly, he was everywhere. He gathered six
rebounds, snatched three steals and didn't miss a shot in the final
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough to start a ``Glen Rice'' chant, but it was
enough to extend the Lakers' winning streak to 13. Not that Rice is
seeking redemption for the controversial trade that made him a
Laker, or vengeance on his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is special when we can go out there and get a `W,'
'' he said. ``Just because it was against the Charlotte Hornets, it
really doesn't mean anything to me.'' But, he would admit, ``It was
fun, it was a lot of fun. It was a very competitive game.... We
didn't play our best game.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be scary when we really get on top of our game.''
The way they're playing now is scary enough. And the Lakers never
needed Rice's scoring more than they did against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal struggled to navigate the Hornets' sea of big
bodies,including ex-Laker Elden Campbell, and finished with a
below-average 23points. Kobe Bryant, Jones' close friend and
replacement, seemed out of sorts and missed 14 of 19 shots. He
finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and five turnovers, playing
the fourth quarter with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be proud of this win at all,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting in the 30-percent zone for the first three quarters,
the Lakers trailed continuously from tipoff until deep into the
fourth quarter. And they were down by 13 early in the final period
before Bryant, Rice and O'Neal came alive, mounting a 20-5 run that
got them their first lead, 80-78.
</P>
<P>
   The go-ahead shot was Rice's dramatic 3-pointer. He followed
that with a steal of Anthony Mason's lazy pass toward the paint.
The Hornets _ sans Jones, and with Campbell on the bench after
fouling out _ fell behind by six, but pulled within two, 85-83,
with 13.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Phills, one of three Hornets with 17 points, had the
chance to hit the potential game-winner. But with 3.5 seconds left,
he stepped out of bounds in the left corner as he attempted a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Rice then nailed two game-clinching free throws with three
seconds remaining, and sending the Hornets to their fourth straight
loss. They're 2-6 since Jones injured his left elbow in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this game was a product of what has been going on with
this team over the last couple of games _ the meltdown over the New
Year that we had as a team,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant acquitted himself with a late surge, but he dribbled into
a turnover in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost cost us the game,'' Jackson said. ``That's where
Kobe has to learn to let the team do the work sometimes, and not
his own spectacular ability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the streak lives, thanks in large part to Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Glen is a fabulous player,'' O'Neal said. ``Of course,
you hate to see a guy like Eddie go, but we traded a (star) and we
got a (star) back.... Yeah, I miss Eddie, but I don't miss anybody
else. I'm glad Glen's here. Glen is one of the greatest shooters in
the game, and every dominant big man needs a great shooter.''

QUICK FIX SOUGHT FOR 101-405 EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Carney  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Declaring the 101-405 freeway interchange a
``gridlock emergency'' of earthquake proportions, California
Assemblyman Tom McClintock hs proposed legislation aimed at
speeding improvements to ease congestion.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock, R-Granada Hills, said fixing ground zero for
gridlock in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley should be done as
quickly as the 66 days Caltrans needed after the Northridge
Earthquake to repair the 10 Freeway in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Wilson was able to invoke emergency powers to cut through
industrial-sized spools of red tape,'' he said at a news conference
held Friday beside the 405 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between a highway made impassable by an
act of God and one made impassable by 25 years of neglect by man?''
said McClintock, vice chairman of the Assembly's Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said three decades of minimal freeway construction has led to
the traffic problem, and he wants to empower the governor to
expedite construction by declaring a ``gridlock emergency'' if a
certain stretch of freeway has reached 3,000 hours of delay per
day. That figure, calculated from traffic and congestion numbers,
is reached at several traffic bottlenecks throughout L.A.,
including the much-maligned intersection of the 101 and 405
freeways.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Daily News series in 1997 identified that
intersection as the nucleus of San Fernando Valley gridlock, and a
recent survey named it the seventh-most-congested junction in the
country. The worst was the intersection of the 405 and 10 freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Work to improve and expand the 101-405 interchange is set to
begin later this year, however, and the $7.9 million project will
be complete by 2002. It will add an auxiliary lane to the
northbound 405, and add a second connector lane from the north 405
to the eastbound 101 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said the State Highway Account is expected to have a
$2 billion surplus this year, earmarked for projects that Caltrans
doesn't have time to get to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding an additional lane to that freeway,'' he said,
gesturing to traffic passing on the 405, ``is no problem for a
contractor -- if the bureaucracy is swept away. It doesn't take
that long to build a freeway.''
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said time could be saved by running federal and state
environmental reviews concurrently, by contracting out engineering
work instead of requiring that it be done by Caltrans, and by
speeding up the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans is remaining neutral on the issue, said agency
spokesman John Robin Witt. But he warned that any time saved by an
abbreviated process could be eaten up by court battles, from losing
bidders challenging an abridged selection process, concerned
residential neighbors or angry environmentalists opposing
accelerated reviews.
</P>
<P>
   After the Northridge Quake, Caltrans saved time by having
bidders submit plans along with their bids, eliminating a step. But
Witt said that also made the process more complex and pulled
Caltrans employees off other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's something you want to do on an everyday
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And an environmental review, he said, is ``probably the single
most sensitive and time-consuming part of the project. Under the
best circumstances, that's going to take six months.'' But they can
last even longer if the area being built upon is discovered to have
historical significance and requires an archeological study, or
contains endangered species that have to be relocated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock said there should be no difference between the
Northridge situation, in which existing freeway bridges had to be
rebuilt, and new projects to add lanes to traffic-choked freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said the freeway problem is mainly a money
issue, according to deputy press secretary Hilary McLean. During
his State of the State address Wednesday, he said local
transportation agencies are sitting on $1.7 billion in unspent
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are available transportation dollars. Let's get these
projects under way so we won't have these problems,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor agrees with the Republicans -- under the Wilson
administration, Caltrans needed a swift kick to get a move on,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The act that Wilson invoked, the state Emergency Services Act,
which gives the governor increased authority in times of crisis,
covers disasters of all kinds -- but not bad traffic, said Jaime
Arteaga, information officer with the governor's Office of
Emergency Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened after Northridge, it was caused by the disaster.
It was imperative that the roads could be fixed so folks could get
back to work and what have you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gov. Davis signed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman
Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, which enabled Caltrans to fast-track
construction on certain projects, picked by the agency's director.
The bill, AB 405, was named for the 101-405 interchange, where Knox
has long championed improvement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock's proposal would let the governor decide which
freeways are in a state of gridlock emergency and in need of
immediate relief, and take the decision out of Caltrans' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of building highways, (Caltrans has) become the single
biggest impediment to highway construction,'' he said. ``As a
practical matter it's a lot easier to do it this way than to change
the whole system.''

CONCEPT CAR DESIGNERS TRY TO CAPTURE CALIFORNIA LIFESTYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Gregory J. Wilcox  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You want a pickup truck, your kids want a
convertible and your wife wants anything as long as it has style.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to buy one car that fits all those
needs.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   That's what designers at Torrance-based Honda R&AMP;D Americas Inc.
in Southern Los Angeles thought when they came up with the Spocket,
a futuristic looking two-seat sports car, pickup trick and sport
utility vehicle all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   You pick the mode of transportation to suit your mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea was to do a car that shows the California
lifestyle so we started from zero,'' said Jose N. Wyszogrod, one of
the car's designers. ``In L.A. people like sporty cars, they like
SUVs and they like convertibles. They like to go skiing, to the
beach and haul stuff around. They like everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyszogrod and fellow designer Bernard Lee turned out the concept
-- which looks like a shortened Chevrolet El Camino on steroids --
in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 17 concept vehicles making either its world or
North American debut at the Greater L.A. Auto Show, which runs from
Saturday Jan. 8 through Jan. 16 at the Los Angeles Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the concept vehicles let designers explore their
wild side, they also push the technology envelope. For example, the
Spocket's roof slides back over the cargo bed opening the passenger
cabin to the sky and the rear bulkhead unfolds into a rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists should like it too, because it's a hybrid. The
designers were able to increase cargo space in the truck bed by
eliminating the rear axle and putting electric motors in the
wheels. A small gasoline engine is up front.
</P>
<P>
   Will this cross-pollenated vehicle ever reach a showroom near
you? That's hard to say. And it's why concepts make such a splash
at shows like L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see what the reaction of the public is. It
was very positive in Japan,'' said Wyszogrod.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes concepts do make the leap to production; the
redesigned Ford Thunderbird is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The car with lots of retro character was introduced in concept
form last year and is again making the car show circuit as a
concept. But sometime next year it goes into production, said Ford
spokesman John W. Clinard.
</P>
<P>
   Ford still plans some design tweaks and will be listening to
what the public has to say about the model during the show's run.
</P>
<P>
   So don't feel like you have to watch what you say while drooling
over the merchandise during the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put people at the show to hang around cars to listen to the
comments. We like it a lot because it's unbiased, true feedback. It
validates our market research,'' Clinard said.
</P>
<P>
   The lines of the new Thunderbird harken back to the models of
the 1950s. There are concepts in yellow, red and black.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no word on whether turquoise will be available
or what the price will be, although some sources at Ford said it
might be in the $40,000 range.

CONCEPT CAR DESIGNERS TRY TO CAPTURE CALIFORNIA LIFESTYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Gregory J. Wilcox  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You want a pickup truck, your kids want a
convertible and your wife wants anything as long as it has style.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to buy one car that fits all those
needs.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   That's what designers at Torrance-based Honda R&AMP;D Americas Inc.
in Southern Los Angeles thought when they came up with the Spocket,
a futuristic looking two-seat sports car, pickup trick and sport
utility vehicle all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   You pick the mode of transportation to suit your mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea was to do a car that shows the California
lifestyle so we started from zero,'' said Jose N. Wyszogrod, one of
the car's designers. ``In L.A. people like sporty cars, they like
SUVs and they like convertibles. They like to go skiing, to the
beach and haul stuff around. They like everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyszogrod and fellow designer Bernard Lee turned out the concept
-- which looks like a shortened Chevrolet El Camino on steroids --
in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 17 concept vehicles making either its world or
North American debut at the Greater L.A. Auto Show, which runs from
Saturday Jan. 8 through Jan. 16 at the Los Angeles Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the concept vehicles let designers explore their
wild side, they also push the technology envelope. For example, the
Spocket's roof slides back over the cargo bed opening the passenger
cabin to the sky and the rear bulkhead unfolds into a rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists should like it too, because it's a hybrid. The
designers were able to increase cargo space in the truck bed by
eliminating the rear axle and putting electric motors in the
wheels. A small gasoline engine is up front.
</P>
<P>
   Will this cross-pollenated vehicle ever reach a showroom near
you? That's hard to say. And it's why concepts make such a splash
at shows like L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see what the reaction of the public is. It
was very positive in Japan,'' said Wyszogrod.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes concepts do make the leap to production; the
redesigned Ford Thunderbird is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The car with lots of retro character was introduced in concept
form last year and is again making the car show circuit as a
concept. But sometime next year it goes into production, said Ford
spokesman John W. Clinard.
</P>
<P>
   Ford still plans some design tweaks and will be listening to

FEDERAL AGENTS TO AID POLICE IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Lisa Van Proyen  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Battling a 25 percent rise in gang violence in
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, police said Friday that they have
enlisted help from federal agents to stem illegal guns that are
fueling crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents will bring to
bear special surveillance equipment and formidable expertise in
tracking guns, which police said are fueling the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the guns out of the hands of gang members,''
said Los Angeles police Lt. Gary Nanson, officer in charge of the
Valley Bureau's gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police also are in talks with the FBI to join the
battle against street thugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law enforcement agencies are becoming more active in
gang enforcement because they realize that this is a form of
organized crime and it's a very violent crime,'' he said. ``It's a
very inte directed effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ATF will begin providing agents and equipment to the Valley this
month to track the guns that gang members use, said Nanson, who
took charge of the CRASH -- Community Resources Against Street
Hoodlums -- unit in the Valley three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police also are stepping up intervention efforts with youngsters
lured by gangs, and they are reaching out to the community for help
in rooting out gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many law-abiding citizens out there. We want to
give them the opportunity to solve crimes,'' Nanson said.
</P>
<P>
   A gang truce brokered in 1993 had brought drive-by shootings and
similar crimes to new lows, but began falling apart about a year
ago and now appears to have dissolved entirely, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the violence are new rivalries and membership changes as
gang members age, quit, go to jail or die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gang truce is not what it used to be. Seven years into it,
it's certainly diminished a great deal,'' said Detective Lance
Steaman of the San Fernando Police Department. ``Some of the kids
getting into the gangs now were 5 and 6 years old when the truce
started and they're not recognizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a phenomenon borne out in lives lost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a plunge in overall serious crimes, violent gang crimes
in the Valley increased 25 percent in 1999 over 1998, with 1,506
crimes in 1999 compared with 1,204 in 1998, according to police
statistics. Citywide, violent gang crimes increased 3.3 percent,
with 6,506 crimes in 1999, vs. 6,300 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   These crimes include homicide, attempted homicide, felony
assault, robbery, shots fired at inhabited dwellings, kidnapping,
rape, arson, witness intimidation, extortion and carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing population in the Valley, there are new cliques
being formed and rivalries for gang turf, particularly in the
Northeast Valley, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the LAPD's Foothill Division alone, there are about 40 gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody is in a gang today. Every day, I'm
getting a new gang ... It just seems to be the way now for kids,
and the music and movies glorify it,'' said LAPD Detective Kandi
Schmidt, in charge of the Foothill Division's gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   Foothill saw a 54 percent increase in serious gang crimes last
year, with 409 crimes reported in 1999, compared with 266 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   From Aug. 1 to Nov. 30, Foothill officers responded to a series
of gang-related shootings, including one weekend in November in
which six people were shot in three shootings, said Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven days of the year, police have logged at least
two gang-related incidents in the Valley, including a shooting at
San Fernando High School that left two students wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Five suspects remain on the run, but police have arrested three
young men, including a 14-year-old who was believed to have fired
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando is also experiencing an increase in the amount of
graffiti spray-painted and crossed out on buildings and walls -- a
precursor to gang violence, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gang members are hanging out in the neighborhoods and looking
for action,'' Steaman said. ``These are the types of incidents that
are precursors to shootings and assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Valley, a Winnetka boy was recovering Friday from a
stab wound to his abdomen after a confrontation Wednesday night. A
suspected gang member was arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devonshire Division shows an 84 percent increase in serious
gang crimes, but that figure is distorted because in January 1999
it took over a two-square-mile area in Panorama City formerly under
Van Nuys' jurisdiction that accounts for a high amount of gang
crimes. The 1998 figure does not account for that gang-infested
area.
</P>
<P>
   If you add that area's crime to Devonshire's 1998 figures,
there's only about a 10 percent increase in gang crimes, said Capt.
Joseph Curreri.
</P>
<P>
   And Van Nuys' 2 percent increase should actually be higher,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   School police officers stepped up patrols in the park near
Sylmar High School at the end of last year when there was an
increase in gang-on-gang fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``During dismissal and after school, they were grouping and
fighting. We hit them real hard and moved them to other areas,''
said Dodson, commander of the Los Angeles Unified School District's
police department.
</P>
<P>
   To deter youths from gangs, San Fernando officials plan to place
a full-time police officer in the schools this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a DARE program for gangs. The officer will try
to ID borderline kids and try to redirect them in a positive manner
away from gangs,'' Steaman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Devonshire, Curreri is working to combat gangs with the CLEAR
unit -- or Community Law Enforcement and Recovery, a federally
funded program that gives officers quick access to records and
suspends the probable cause requirement for searches of homes of
probation violation suspects.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, Curreri also had traffic barriers installed
on Langdon Street to detour narcotics trafficking by gang members
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Gang units from all six Valley divisions, including the Valley
Narcotics unit, will meet at least weekly to assure ``strong coord
officers, Nanson said. And every CRASH officer will be sent to
schools for better training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work more strongly as a team,'' he said.

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mickey Mouse is no longer king of the
California's Southland.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the changing landscape of the California economy,
biotechnology giant Amgen overtook the Walt Disney Co. on Friday as
the largest publicly traded company headquartered in the
five-county Los Angeles area, at least as measured by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of Amgen's shares surpassed that of
Burbank-based Disney on Friday. Amgen, the Thousand Oaks-based
biotech drug maker, now has a market capitalization of $69.46
billion, while Disney stands at $63.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of companies such as Amgen and the technology firms
that dot the west San Fernando Valley and east Ventura County
demonstrates a greater shift in the economic makeup of the region,
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back somewhere in the '60s and '70s, the Los Angeles
economy was a three-legged economy: You had aerospace,
entertainment and tourism,'' Kyser said. Now, ``I'd say we have
easily about 10 or 12 legs, and more are getting ready to sprout.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney itself has become more of a powerhouse than it was two
decades ago, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '70s, it was basically a very small studio. Now,
it's up in the big three with Time Warner and CBS-Viacom,'' Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Amgen and Disney are much larger than other Los
Angeles-area companies. Atlantic Richfield Co. is the
fourth-largest publicly traded company in the Los Angeles region,
after Orange County-based Broadcom, but at $25.96 billion Arco is
less than one-half the size of Disney or Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Qualcomm is the largest publicly traded company
headquartered in Southern California thanks to the stratospheric
run-up of its stock price in 1999. Qualcomm's market capitalization
-- that is, its stock price multiplied by the number of shares --
was under $5 billion in January 1999; it was valued at $98.97
billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Disney reigned over the region. Amgen was
the area's second-largest company in 1997, but was only one-fourth
Disney's size.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Amgen's market capitalization was $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in 1999, however, Amgen's shares have been one of
Wall Street's darlings as investors have taken note of the pipeline
of drugs that Amgen is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth over the past three years has turned Amgen into a
company with a greater market value than some of the nation's most
famous companies. For example, Amgen's market capitalization is now
greater than Ford Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker; and
Boeing Co., the world's largest aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stock has enjoyed rapid growth in each of the last two
years, based upon a growing appreciation of our primarily near-term
product pipeline,'' said Amgen spokesman David Kaye. ``With several
important drugs nearing potential approval, certainly that has
raised interest in our stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the products the company is preparing for presentation to
the federal Food and Drug Administration are follow-ups to its
franchise products, the blockbuster drugs Epogen and Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   Both products have generated more than $1 billion in annual
sales for Amgen. The next-generation versions offer longer dosing
and, according to analysts, could each match that level of annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really been our ability to sustain the growth of our
two franchise products as well as invest in our pipeline,'' Kaye
said. ``We hope that pipeline is about to bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Amgen's market cap has skyrocketed in the past three
years, Disney's has been relatively flat after a precipitous drop
18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Disney's market cap hit $83 billion in April 1998,
but its years of rapid expansion in the early 1990s began to take
their toll at the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings began to slide, and the stock price followed suit,
dipping from an early-1999 peak of $41 to its November low of
$23.50 per share. On Friday, Disney shares closed at $31.125.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Disney's price, rather than making it
unattractive, makes Disney's stock a bargain, said Douglas
Christopher, an analyst with Los Angeles investment firm Crowell
Weedon who follows both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney, on a price-to-cash-flow basis, is one of the cheapest
blue chip stocks we can find,'' Christopher said. ``Our price
target within the next 12 months is almost $50 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible Disney could mount a comeback, Christopher
said, and regain its title as the largest publicly traded company
headquartered in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, Disney has been somewhat out of favor with the
market,'' Kyser said. ``Rule of thumb: You never write off the
Mouse House. It always comes back.''

California's Southland.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the changing landscape of the California economy,
biotechnology giant Amgen overtook the Walt Disney Co. on Friday as
the largest publicly traded company headquartered in the
five-county Los Angeles area, at least as measured by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of Amgen's shares surpassed that of
Burbank-based Disney on Friday. Amgen, the Thousand Oaks-based
biotech drug maker, now has a market capitalization of $69.46
billion, while Disney stands at $63.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of companies such as Amgen and the technology firms
that dot the west San Fernando Valley and east Ventura County
demonstrates a greater shift in the economic makeup of the region,
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back somewhere in the '60s and '70s, the Los Angeles
economy was a three-legged economy: You had aerospace,
entertainment and tourism,'' Kyser said. Now, ``I'd say we have
easily about 10 or 12 legs, and more are getting ready to sprout.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney itself has become more of a powerhouse than it was two
decades ago, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '70s, it was basically a very small studio. Now,
it's up in the big three with Time Warner and CBS-Viacom,'' Kyser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Amgen and Disney are much larger than other Los
Angeles-area companies. Atlantic Richfield Co. is the
fourth-largest publicly traded company in the Los Angeles region,
after Orange County-based Broadcom, but at $25.96 billion Arco is
less than one-half the size of Disney or Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Qualcomm is the largest publicly traded company
headquartered in Southern California thanks to the stratospheric
run-up of its stock price in 1999. Qualcomm's market capitalization
-- that is, its stock price multiplied by the number of shares --
was under $5 billion in January 1999; it was valued at $98.97
billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Disney reigned over the region. Amgen was
the area's second-largest company in 1997, but was only one-fourth
Disney's size.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Amgen's market capitalization was $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in 1999, however, Amgen's shares have been one of
Wall Street's darlings as investors have taken note of the pipeline
of drugs that Amgen is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth over the past three years has turned Amgen into a
company with a greater market value than some of the nation's most
famous companies. For example, Amgen's market capitalization is now
greater than Ford Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker; and
Boeing Co., the world's largest aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stock has enjoyed rapid growth in each of the last two
years, based upon a growing appreciation of our primarily near-term
product pipeline,'' said Amgen spokesman David Kaye. ``With several
important drugs nearing potential approval, certainly that has
raised interest in our stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the products the company is preparing for presentation to
the federal Food and Drug Administration are follow-ups to its
franchise products, the blockbuster drugs Epogen and Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   Both products have generated more than $1 billion in annual
sales for Amgen. The next-generation versions offer longer dosing
and, according to analysts, could each match that level of annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really been our ability to sustain the growth of our
two franchise products as well as invest in our pipeline,'' Kaye
said. ``We hope that pipeline is about to bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Amgen's market cap has skyrocketed in the past three
years, Disney's has been relatively flat after a precipitous drop
18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Disney's market cap hit $83 billion in April 1998,
but its years of rapid expansion in the early 1990s began to take
their toll at the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings began to slide, and the stock price followed suit,
dipping from an early-1999 peak of $41 to its November low of
$23.50 per share. On Friday, Disney shares closed at $31.125.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Disney's price, rather than making it
unattractive, makes Disney's stock a bargain, said Douglas
Christopher, an analyst with Los Angeles investment firm Crowell
Weedon who follows both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney, on a price-to-cash-flow basis, is one of the cheapest
blue chip stocks we can find,'' Christopher said. ``Our price
target within the next 12 months is almost $50 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible Disney could mount a comeback, Christopher
said, and regain its title as the largest publicly traded company
headquartered in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, Disney has been somewhat out of favor with the
market,'' Kyser said. ``Rule of thumb: You never write off the
Mouse House. It always comes back.''

   Politics in the New Russian Style &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, perhaps even more than in New Hampshire, politics is
currently everything, and its exemplar is Acting President Vladimir
Putin. He campaigned throughout the week as if he were not the
runaway favorite in presidential elections now scheduled for March
26; he proclaimed tighter foreign currency controls, summoned
parliamentary leaders for a strategy session and, at one point, let
his close-cropped hair down in a nationally broadcast television
interview about what it was like to replace Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   His principal rival, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
remained stoic, refusing to say whether he would run for president
as he had indicated he would last month, before Yeltsin resigned
and gave Putin an almost unbeatable head start.
</P>
<P>
   The one cloud on Putin's horizon was a black one indeed: The war
in Chechnya, until now a Russian cakewalk, became pitched. Urban
warfare around Chechnya's capital, Grozny, proved so tough for the
attacking Russians that offensive operations were suspended and the
top command was shuffled.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, seemed only semiretired: visiting Israel to
observe Christmas, he was treated everywhere like a revered head of
state, and seemed to relish it. His spokesman said he was not
Russia's former president, but its first one. Yeltsin underscored
that: ``I haven't retired yet,'' he said, in what may or may not
have been a joke.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Fighting Sticker Shock
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, top-ranked colleges and universities
across the United States watched their endowments skyrocket along
with the stock market. Still, the cost of attending them kept
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now one such college, Williams, has decided not to raise
tuition, room, board or fees _ which total $31,520 annually, about
half the institution's actual cost _ in the next academic year. For
Williams, a 2,000-student campus in western Massachusetts, it is
the first halt in increases since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Such highly selective institutions operate in a fiercely
competitive environment, and experts predict that others will
follow suit. One criticism of these institutions has been that they
were reluctant to free up money from their rapidly expanding
endowments to hold down costs to students; that, in fact, is the
course Williams now plans to take. Even as tuition and fees
increased 50 percent there, from $20,760, since 1990, the endowment
was tripling, from $333 million to more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is hardly the only institution in such a situation:
Harvard, the leader, has an endowment near $14 billion _ and a
current sticker price of $34,682.

   Another 4-Year Term For Greenspan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve, joining Wall Street, economists
and politicians from both parties in crediting him with deftly
nurturing the nation's long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment insured some continuity in economic
policy as Democrats and Republicans fight for control of the White
House and Congress. With the economy steaming along at a
potentially inflationary pace, it also removed the possibility that
Greenspan might feel under pressure to hold off on raising interest
rates in order to ensure he could keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Investors saw Greenspan's renomination as confirmation of their
fears that the Fed will raise rates aggressively this year,
providing further reason for them to cash in the big profits from
last year's runup in equity prices. Stocks tumbled through much of
the week, led by some of those technology-company high fliers,
before appearing to stabilize.

   Bush and Gore Get Key Endorsements
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush got an enthusiastic endorsement from a
former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Elizabeth
Dole, and spent his first full day back on the campaign trail in
the new year showcasing Mrs. Dole and hoping that she would bring
over women and independents to help him beat back Sen. John McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore won the backing
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Washington's reigning
liberal. The Gore campaign was looking for Kennedy to provide a
boost in the Northeast, where support for Gore's rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, is the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the insurgent McCain and Bradley campaigns was
identical: They said the endorsements showed their rivals were
creatures of the establishment.

   Problems? What Problems?
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe anyone who tells you there were no year 2000
computer problems. There was a baby with a birth certificate
stating she was 100 years old. A couple of people briefly had small
fortunes magically appear in their bank accounts. A Web site
reviewing the performance of mutual funds appeared to be reporting
from the year 19100.
</P>
<P>
   There were tens of thousands of other hiccups too, not all of
them amusing. But there were no disasters of the kind that had
prompted huge numbers of potential travelers to lie low over the
holiday and abstain from using airlines in particular. So by
mid-week, corporate and government command centers that had been
staffed to the gills with specialists prepared to leap into action
had all the bustle of exhibits in a wax museum. Many shut down
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Managers who had overseen the fixes, especially in financial
circles, stuck firmly to their belief that hard work had allowed
the world to dodge a bullet. Some said it was too soon to declare
victory. But the most visible signs of Y2K turmoil were in Internet
chat rooms where the forecasters of disaster, known as gloomers,
expressed disbelief and their longtime opponents, the pollies
(short for Pollyanna's) gloated mercilessly.

   An Internet Stock Adviser Is Charged With Fraud
</P>
<P>
   In the highest-profile Internet stock fraud case yet, the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Yun Soo Oh Park, one of the
Web's best-known stock gurus, for fraud. Regulators said Park had
lied about his picks' returns, secretly accepted stock in a company
in exchange for recommending it to his almost 4,000 subscribers and
repeatedly urged subscribers to buy the same stocks that he was
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Park, 50, will fight the charges, his lawyer said. But the case,
which raises First Amendment issues, is a clear signal that
securities regulators are determined to rein in fraud on the wild
wild Web.

   An Election Changes The Rulers of Croatia
</P>
<P>
   In what Washington hopes will be a model for Slobodan
Milosevic's Serbia, the voters of Croatia gave their democratic
opposition a sweeping victory in parliamentary elections,
dethroning the Croatian Democratic Union of the late president,
Franjo Tudjman, who died in December.
</P>
<P>
   A six-party opposition coalition will have a stable majority,
but it may be a month before the likely new prime minister, Ivica
Racan, a thoughtful former Communist, can take office. Presidential
elections are on Jan. 24, and the opposition hopes to elect Racan
partner Drazen Budisa over the current foreign minister, Mate
Granic, a relative moderate in the Tudjman party.

   Dozens Feared Dead In Norway Train Wreck
</P>
<P>
   Two trains collided near Rena, Norway, in the country's worst
train wreck ever. As many as 35 people were thought to have died;
the number remained uncertain because the authorities were unsure
how many people were aboard. Agence France Press reported Saturday
that 18 bodies had been recovered thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Moving Day (Sort Of) For the Clintons  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Senate candidate, and her husband,
William Jefferson Clinton, the president, moved into their new home
in Chappaqua, N.Y., a year before the lease runs out on their
current home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mrs. Clinton had planned to move in alone Thursday to
unpack, but the president, at the last minute, changed his plans
and accompanied her for an overnight stay. Mrs. Clinton's mother,
Dorothy Rodham, stayed, too.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart would not say what the
couple ate for their first dinner in their new home, a $1.7
million, 111-year-old house north of New York City that will be
Mrs. Clinton's base during her first political campaign, but he
said it was delivered by a friend, Jill Iscol of Pound Ridge, N.Y.
He said the couple was ``very excited'' about the move.

<P>
   China's Military Resumes U.S. Contacts
</P>
<P>
   After a prolonged chill, China has agreed to resume military
contacts with the United States, dispatching a senior army general
for two days of talks in Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon considers ``military-to-military'' exchanges
important to stability in Asia, but it is not clear how committed
the Chinese military is to the idea. China remains deeply wary of
American motives after NATO's bombing of its embassy in Belgrade
during the war against Yugoslavia last May.

   New Arrests In Suspected Terror Plot
</P>
<P>
   Two more Algerians were arrested, one in Brooklyn and the other
in Seattle, in the broadening investigation of a terrorist bomb
plot that authorities say was interrupted with the arrest in
December of Ahmed Ressam as he crossed into the United States near
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrests, which included one man taken into custody at
Kennedy International Airport on New Year's Day as he was preparing
to leave on a flight to Paris, came amid indications that the
authorities were focusing their efforts on a network of Algerians
in New York, Seattle, and Boston. The intended target of the bomb
plot remained unknown.

House and Congress. With the economy steaming along at a
potentially inflationary pace, it also removed the possibility that
Greenspan might feel under pressure to hold off on raising interest
rates in order to ensure he could keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Investors saw Greenspan's renomination as confirmation of their
fears that the Fed will raise rates aggressively this year,
providing further reason for them to cash in the big profits from
last year's runup in equity prices. Stocks tumbled through much of
the week, led by some of those technology-company high fliers,
before appearing to stabilize.

   Bush and Gore Get Key Endorsements
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush got an enthusiastic endorsement from a
former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Elizabeth
Dole, and spent his first full day back on the campaign trail in
the new year showcasing Mrs. Dole and hoping that she would bring
over women and independents to help him beat back Sen. John McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore won the backing
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Washington's reigning
liberal. The Gore campaign was looking for Kennedy to provide a
boost in the Northeast, where support for Gore's rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, is the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the insurgent McCain and Bradley campaigns was
identical: They said the endorsements showed their rivals were

   There were tens of thousands of other hiccups too, not all of

staffed to the gills with specialists prepared to leap into action
had all the bustle of exhibits in a wax museum. Many shut down
ahead of schedule.

   Managers who had overseen the fixes, especially in financial

   In the highest-profile Internet stock fraud case yet, the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Yun Soo Oh Park, one of the

repeatedly urged subscribers to buy the same stocks that he was
selling.
</P>

<P>
   The immediate spark, not that it matters after so many years,
was a series of misunderstandings. One evening, hours after a
prison guard mistakenly thought they had been fighting, two inmates
were taken from their cells for punishment. A rumor, no more true
than the phantom fight, spread through the cellblock that both had
been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the whole thing was pretty silly. The consequences
were anything but.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, on Sept. 9, 1971, angry inmates at the Attica
Correctional Facility, 30 miles east of Buffalo, N.Y., rioted. They
seized control of an exercise yard and took guards as hostages.
Thus began a chain of often-bizarre events that produced the worst
prison insurrection in U.S. history, indeed the bloodiest single
clash between Americans since street riots in New York City a
century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 43 people died at Attica, nearly all _ inmates and
hostages alike _ when state troopers stormed the prison Sept. 13
and fired indiscriminately through a thick haze of tear gas. It
was, a state investigating commission would later conclude, an
assault both ill-conceived and poorly executed, leading to needless
loss of life. One disenchanted state prosecutor ended up calling it
``a turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the mass death were not shocking enough, officials at
first lied about what had happened. They said inmates had killed
the hostages, slitting their throats and castrating them. None of
that was true, as autopsies showed the next day. Arguably worse,
troopers and Attica guards resorted to brutal reprisals. They
forced inmates to strip and crawl over broken glass. One man had a
screwdriver repeatedly shoved into his rectum. Another, forced to
lie naked for hours with a football propped under his chin, was
warned that if he let the ball drop, he would be killed or
castrated.
</P>
<P>
   Why rehash those events now? Because the demons of Attica have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same.
</P>
<P>
   They were back last week when a federal judge in Rochester
announced a settlement that may at last bring finality to Attica's
painful aftermath. Under the deal, the state will pay $8 million to
inmates who were beaten and tortured, plus $4 million for lawyers'
fees. ``We have all suffered,'' said the judge, Michael A. Telesca.
``The end is in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Some who lived through the 1971 debacle _ inmates,
guards, officials, lawyers, reporters _ wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the body blows that some American
institutions endured. The seemingly endless war in Vietnam had
already taken its toll by 1971. A year earlier, National Guardsmen
in Ohio had opened fire on Kent State students, killing four of
them. Now, at Attica, more than three dozen people were shot dead
within minutes in the name of the state _ and officialdom's first
instinct was to not tell the truth about it.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for many, a queasy feeling that government might be
capable of just about anything. Nor did the news media emerge
looking good. Tales of inmates' atrocities were reported as fact.
There was not nearly adequate attribution to officials who were
spreading the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little like the Vietnam war coming home,'' recalls
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a prison monitoring group. ``You had a brutal application
of government power and then the sheer audacity of government
cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of how deep the cynicism ran, catch ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' the next time it is on television. In that 1975 film,
Al Pacino, playing a loser who takes hostages after a botched bank
robbery, whips up a street crowd to pressure the New York police to
hold their fire. He does it by rhythmically chanting, ``At-ti-ca,
At-ti-ca, At-ti-ca.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet good came out of the 1971 siege. This is separate from
the political good it probably did New York's Republican governor,
Nelson Rockefeller, who ordered troopers to storm the prison. That
action, and tough drug laws that he promoted two years later,
helped make the relatively liberal Rockefeller more palatable to
conservatives. By coincidence or not, President Gerald R. Ford,
invoking the 25th Amendment, named him vice president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Attica's broader good was that the public could no longer ignore
awful prison conditions. The initial rioting did not really result
from minor misunderstandings. Attica, like other prisons, was
seething because of overcrowding, bad food and medical care, rigid
censorship and meager visiting rights. True, loopy radical demands
were made during the riot, symptomatic of the times; the
authorities were hardly about to provide transportation to a
``nonimperialist'' third world country. But the anger stemmed from
basic conditions, like rules limiting inmates to one shower a week
and one roll of toilet paper a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the situation improved. In New York,
special agencies kept an eye on prison operations. For a while,
some newspapers covered prisons as a regular beat. A new
state-financed group, Prisoners' Legal Services, gave inmates a
voice in court. In time, as the state and the country shifted to
the right, such efforts were ridiculed as whining on behalf of
killers and rapists wanting color TV and pepperoni pizza. But Legal
Services has never had a lawsuit tossed out for being frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Until Attica, ``a lot of people didn't see the way that
prisoners were dehumanized to no constructive end,'' said David
Leven, who was Legal Services' executive director for years.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, time dulled Attica's shock effect. A ``lock 'em up
and throw away the key'' attitude has sent the prison population
skyrocketing. And rehabilitation is rarely mentioned in political
discourse. Nationwide, there were 198,000 people in federal and
state prisons at the time of Attica. In mid-1998, the figure was
1.2 million, not including 600,000 more held in local jails. The
New York state prison population today is approaching 72,000,
compared with 12,500 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, aside from advocates like Gangi, you don't hear much about
prisons these days, and even in last week's settlement the state
acknowledged no guilt. Here and there, there has been a prison
riot, but nothing comparable to 1971. It may be that Attica's most
enduring legacy was to make everyone starkly aware of the
terrifying possibilities should there ever be a fire next time.

<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ To the untrained observer, Swedes and Norwegians
(aka the Olsons and the Olsens) may seem interchangeable. Both are
prosperous, blue-eyed and reserved. On the world stage, they hand
out peace prizes and preach global cooperation while saving their
aggressions, if any, for the ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the privacy of their snowbound peninsula, Sweden and
Norway have lately resembled ``two blind men slugging it out on a
highway,'' in the words of a Danish commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the countries are having a business disagreement. A
$50 billion merger between the Swedish and Norwegian state-owned
telecommunications companies has unraveled. Unofficially, this
telephone tiff has exposed a dark current of national chauvinism
and aggression _ just the sort of thing the new age of globalism is
said to be rendering obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a Swedish government minister derided Norway as
``the last Soviet state.'' Top Norwegian officials called the
Swedes liars and questioned whether they could read. The chief
executive of the briefly merged company even shoved a radio
journalist to the sidewalk and kicked him in the back, explaining
later, by form of apology, ``He looked like a drug addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Sweden and Norway is traditionally defused by
low humor. When a Swedish newspaper columnist denounced Norway over
the fiasco, a Norwegian retorted in print, ``I hope you gain 12
kilos during Christmas and grow a wart on your nose.'' But it
didn't work this time. Millennium's end had been soured by the
re-enactment of painful colonial-era dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians believed that each side in the enterprise was to have
equal say in strategic matters. So when a dubious double vote by
the Swedish board chairman made cosmopolitan Stockholm rather than
rustic Oslo the headquarters of the all-important cellular
telephony division, Norwegians felt betrayed. They suffered a
collective flashback to a century ago, when Sweden's King Oscar
repeatedly used his veto power to humiliate the provincial
Norwegian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the cell phone grab was cheered in Stockholm, where
the tabloid Expressen headlined its cover story, ``Ha, ha,
Norway!''
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, the normally fractious Parliament erupted as one to
demand that Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik dynamite the
merger, which he did. It was not clear how that helped Norwegian
telephone customers or the development of Norwegian technology, but
as a battle tactic it had precedent. Twice in earlier centuries,
residents of the Norwegian border town of Halden burned their city
to the ground to drive out the Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 94 years after breaking free of imperial Sweden and 30
years after striking oil in the North Sea, Norway, whose mostly
rural population of 4.4 million is half that of more urbanized
Sweden's, continues to savor independence and to search for its own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway still defines itself in terms of its relationship to
Sweden,'' said the Norwegian author Tor Bomann-Larsen. ``To be free
and independent means to be rid of the Swedes.''
</P>
<P>
   In daily life the rivalry is usually good-natured. Norwegians
love to shop in Swedish stores while Swedes seek serenity in the
mountains of Norway. According to Aake Daun, an ethnologist at the
University of Stockholm, Swedes see Norwegians as ``healthy and
honest, reliable and sporty,'' though not usually business-partner
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swedes think unreflectively that Sweden is the biggest and
most advanced and most creative of the Scandinavian countries,''
Professor Daun said. ``When they talk to Norwegians about how
things are done in Sweden, it is like a schoolteacher telling how
things are done in the grown-up world.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's development of vast offshore oil reserves has boosted
its social stock, but most Swedes consider Volvo, Electrolux and
other big Swedish manufacturing companies more worthy of esteem. To
them it was a no-brainer to locate the proposed bi-national mobile
phone service in Stockholm, where the mobile-phone giant Ericsson
would provide synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Norway blames Swedish arrogance rather than Norwegian
nationalism for destroying what could have been a global showcase

<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ To the untrained observer, Swedes and Norwegians
(aka the Olsons and the Olsens) may seem interchangeable. Both are
prosperous, blue-eyed and reserved. On the world stage, they hand
out peace prizes and preach global cooperation while saving their
aggressions, if any, for the ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the privacy of their snowbound peninsula, Sweden and
Norway have lately resembled ``two blind men slugging it out on a
highway,'' in the words of a Danish commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the countries are having a business disagreement. A
$50 billion merger between the Swedish and Norwegian state-owned
telecommunications companies has unraveled. Unofficially, this
telephone tiff has exposed a dark current of national chauvinism
and aggression _ just the sort of thing the new age of globalism is
said to be rendering obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a Swedish government minister derided Norway as
``the last Soviet state.'' Top Norwegian officials called the
Swedes liars and questioned whether they could read. The chief
executive of the briefly merged company even shoved a radio
journalist to the sidewalk and kicked him in the back, explaining
later, by form of apology, ``He looked like a drug addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Sweden and Norway is traditionally defused by
low humor. When a Swedish newspaper columnist denounced Norway over
the fiasco, a Norwegian retorted in print, ``I hope you gain 12
kilos during Christmas and grow a wart on your nose.'' But it
didn't work this time. Millennium's end had been soured by the
re-enactment of painful colonial-era dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians believed that each side in the enterprise was to have
equal say in strategic matters. So when a dubious double vote by
the Swedish board chairman made cosmopolitan Stockholm rather than
rustic Oslo the headquarters of the all-important cellular
telephony division, Norwegians felt betrayed. They suffered a
collective flashback to a century ago, when Sweden's King Oscar
repeatedly used his veto power to humiliate the provincial
Norwegian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the cell phone grab was cheered in Stockholm, where
the tabloid Expressen headlined its cover story, ``Ha, ha,
Norway!''
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, the normally fractious Parliament erupted as one to
demand that Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik dynamite the
merger, which he did. It was not clear how that helped Norwegian
telephone customers or the development of Norwegian technology, but
as a battle tactic it had precedent. Twice in earlier centuries,
residents of the Norwegian border town of Halden burned their city
to the ground to drive out the Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 94 years after breaking free of imperial Sweden and 30
years after striking oil in the North Sea, Norway, whose mostly
rural population of 4.4 million is half that of more urbanized
Sweden's, continues to savor independence and to search for its own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway still defines itself in terms of its relationship to
Sweden,'' said the Norwegian author Tor Bomann-Larsen. ``To be free
and independent means to be rid of the Swedes.''
</P>
<P>
   In daily life the rivalry is usually good-natured. Norwegians
love to shop in Swedish stores while Swedes seek serenity in the
mountains of Norway. According to Aake Daun, an ethnologist at the
University of Stockholm, Swedes see Norwegians as ``healthy and
honest, reliable and sporty,'' though not usually business-partner
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swedes think unreflectively that Sweden is the biggest and
most advanced and most creative of the Scandinavian countries,''
Professor Daun said. ``When they talk to Norwegians about how
things are done in Sweden, it is like a schoolteacher telling how
things are done in the grown-up world.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's development of vast offshore oil reserves has boosted
its social stock, but most Swedes consider Volvo, Electrolux and
other big Swedish manufacturing companies more worthy of esteem. To
them it was a no-brainer to locate the proposed bi-national mobile
phone service in Stockholm, where the mobile-phone giant Ericsson
would provide synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Norway blames Swedish arrogance rather than Norwegian
nationalism for destroying what could have been a global showcase
for Scandinavia's vaunted wireless technology. But the boundary
between it and the Swedes is now also the fault line of the
burgeoning European Union. Twice Norwegians have rejected EU
membership against sound business advice, and their isolation from
Europe is deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Norman, a Norwegian economist, said the telecom nightmare
could send Norway further into its shell while Sweden turns to
another former colony, Finland, for a telecom partner. If that
merger succeeds it might be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize.

   HOUSTON _ The death row and execution chamber in Texas might be
about the last place anyone would willingly want to visit. No state
has executed as many people with such efficiency, yet that is
exactly why Gerges Scott stopped by in September. Scott works for
the Corrections Department in New Mexico, which expects in the next
few months to hold its first execution in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he came to Texas because he wanted to learn from the
very best.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Florida, legislators jousted in a special session.
First, they renounced their electric chair for execution by lethal
injection. Then, they wrangled over Gov. Jeb Bush's proposal to put
new limits on death row appeals. On Friday that measure also passed
_ by one vote. The effort to speed the process had a good many
lawmakers saying that Florida seemed more and more like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our role model for killing people,'' said state Rep.
Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, in a hearing that preceded the
special session, according to The St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Texas as a national role model for capital
punishment is enough to make death penalty opponents shudder, but
the actions of New Mexico and Florida suggest that some regard the
state as a place worth emulating. Whether this shows a growing
national appetite for more executions, though _ carried out more
quickly with fewer appeals _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A national review of capital punishment last year reveals
several conflicting signals. There were 98 people executed, the
highest number since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty
in 1976. For the third straight year, Texas led the nation in
executions with 35. In all, 38 states have the death penalty, and
polls continue to show that a strong majority of Americans favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington, a nonprofit group often critical of the death penalty,
five governors granted clemency in five cases. Usually one is
average. The center also noted other indicators of public
uncertainty: the Nebraska Legislature voted for a moratorium on
executions, but Gov. Mike Johanns vetoed it. The state later
financed a study of the fairness of its death penalty. Polls in
Illinois and Missouri showed public support for moratoriums in
which capital punishment could be studied.
</P>
<P>
   David Dow, a University of Houston Law Center professor who has
represented death row inmates in appeals, said the contrasting
attitudes reflected a host of factors. The Illinois poll numbers,
he said, may reflect the fact that 12 inmates in the state have
been released from death row since 1976 compared to 11 who have
been executed. Last year, one inmate, Anthony Porter, was spared
hours before his execution when a Northwestern University
journalism class proved his innocence. Seven other people were
freed from death rows nationally last year, bringing the total to
84 since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has executed a total of 44 inmates, the third highest of
any state after Texas, with 199, and Virginia, with 73. The recent
controversy arose after the Supreme Court indicated that the
electric chair might constitute cruel and unusual punishment;
photographs of an execution showed flames shooting from a mask on
one inmate's face. Adding to the debate, Bush, the younger brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, pushed the bill to limit appeals,
legislation not unlike a law his brother signed five years ago. Jeb
Bush has emphasized the suffering of victims' families and
complained that inmates spend about 14 years on death row before
they are executed. ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' he wrote
in a recent op-ed article. Friday's measure is expected to limit an
inmate's legal appeals to a five-year period. Bush's top policy
adviser on the issue, Brad Thomas, caused a flap last week when he
said in The St. Petersburg Times: ``What I hope is that we become
more like Texas. Bring in the witnesses, put them on a gurney, and
let's rock and roll.'' Thomas has since apologized to the governor,
who has described capital punishment as ``serious and somber.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Florida legislature argued during the special
session that the appeals limits were a hurried proposal, possibly
unconstitutional, that might result in executing wrongly convicted
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the attractions of Texas to all the other states,''
Professor Dow said, ``is that there is a sense that Texas has
managed to defeat all the death penalty opponents who had managed
for the last 20 years to thwart the state's interest in carrying
out this punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The public often supports efforts to curb appeals, he said,
because of a widely held belief that capital inmates enjoy more
rights than they deserve. ``What Texas has managed to do is whittle
away at criminal defendants' rights,'' Dow said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat who authored the 1995 law
streamlining the Texas appeals process, denied that any rights were
infringed. He said the law also required, for the first time, that
the state pay for the appeals of indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Maurie Levin, executive director of the Texas Capital Defense
Project, a nonprofit group that helps death row inmates, said
replicating Texas ``would be phenomenally stupid.'' She and other
critics say the state provides inadequate legal aid to poor
defendants. She also criticizes its willingness to execute inmates
who are mentally retarded or mentally ill or who committed murder
at 17, the legal age in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who is a spokesman for New Mexico Corrections, said his
visit to Texas was to learn how to prepare for the media circus
surrounding an execution. He also saw how the state actually
carried one out. He described death row officials as compassionate
and professional. While executions do not attract much attention in
Texas, he said things will be different in New Mexico. ``It will be
the story of the year for 2000,'' he said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When questions surfaced about Sen. John McCain's emotional
stability, he put them to rest last month with a deluge of paper:
1,500 pages of medical records, going back to 1973. And that was
the abridged version.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now know that, psychologically, McCain is a rock, in
the opinion of his doctors. But they also now know about the mole
on his shoulder, about his arthritis, hay fever and intestinal
polyps, as well as the size of his prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   No law forces candidates to bare their medical histories. But
the news media and political rivals press for revelations, hinting
that those who decline may have something to hide. Some people
maintain that the public interest demands that the usual right to
confidentiality be waived. Others question whether the public
needs, wants or has a right to such information.
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that McCain was planning to release his
records, he was urged not to do so by Dr. Claire Dixon-Lee,
president of the American Health Information Management
Association, whose 40,000 members maintain medical records at
hospitals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating if releases of health information by
presidential candidates served as a catalyst for demands for this
kind of information from Americans when they apply for jobs or
loans, get married or partake in routine activities,'' Dr.
Dixon-Lee wrote. She suggested instead that candidates have their
doctors write ``comprehensive summaries,'' including only the
information pertinent to running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley has taken that approach, releasing a statement
from his doctor saying that he is in good health and that his
abnormal heart rhythms should not interfere with his work. His
staff has promised more data should he become the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has regularly sought medical information
about presidential candidates, assigning Lawrence K. Altman, a
reporter who is also a physician, to review medical histories and
to conduct extensive interviews with candidates and their personal
doctors. Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, said it was the
newspaper's responsibility to provide readers with information
``pertinent to an individual's ability to do the job of
president.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited former Sen. Paul Tsongas as an example of why medical
information is important, and why a letter from the candidate's
doctor is not sufficient. After telling voters he had been
successfully treated for cancer, Tsongas won the 1992 Democratic
presidential primary in New Hampshire. But he later left the race
and acknowledged under pressure that he and his doctors had
concealed a recurrence. He died of cancer in 1997, after having
publicly endorsed the formation of a presidential commission to
study the issue of how much medical information candidates should
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to have a doctor on our staff who doesn't seek to
examine the candidates themselves but who is qualified to examine
medical records, ask reasonable questions and draw conclusions,''
Lelyveld said. ``We don't need to publish everything he sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, candidates who have hidden their illnesses have been
elected and have governed effectively. Beyond his paralysis from
polio, which the press helped to play down by not photographing him
in his wheelchair, Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered from severe heart
disease and hypertension. His doctors knew he was severely ill when
he ran for a fourth term in 1944, but they concealed it, supposedly
as a matter of national security, because the nation was at war.
Roosevelt died a few months into the term.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower had heart disease and was secretly advised
by his doctor that he might not live through a second term. John F.
Kennedy did not tell voters he had Addison's disease, a serious
failure of the adrenal glands that required treatment with
steroids. And Abraham Lincoln is widely believed to have suffered
from lifelong bouts with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Would Americans have voted differently in any of those cases had
they known the truth? In Kennedy's case, the 1960 election was so
close that some historians say public knowledge of his health might
have given the victory to Richard M. Nixon. But some would argue
that Lincoln's, Kennedy's and Eisenhower's ability to function in
office prove that candidates should not be disqualified or judged
on the basis of health problems. Roosevelt may have been another
matter, but even if voters had known of his condition, it is hard
to imagine that they would have turned against him in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Callahan, an ethicist and co-founder of the Hastings
Center for Bioethics in Garrison, N.Y., argued that medical privacy
should be suspended for presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running, you're giving up your privacy, and
justifiably so,'' he said. ``The reason very simply is that the
health of somebody who is going to be president will bear on the
performance of that person once in the job. It's as relevant to
know somebody's health as their positions on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he found it hard to think of any exceptions. Even
though millions of people live normal lives with treatable
conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, they should be
disclosed, he said, along with any other disorder that carries a
higher than average likelihood of illness or death. Genes that
predispose a person to breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease are
also relevant, he said, as well as psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recurrent depression would certainly be something you'd want
to know about,'' Callahan said. ``Manic depression would be even
more worrisome, with someone who was hysterical at some times and
flat-out depressed at others. I guess I'd like to see a letter from
a doctor that went over the main features of mental and physical
health, but didn't present the reading of every test that was
taken. But the physician should be neutral, not a crony or pal of
the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medicine at San Francisco General
Hospital, questioned the relevance of medical information. ``I
don't know if it helps us make a more learned decision about the
candidates,'' he said. ``It may potentially just play into people's
phobias and biases. We've had a number of amazing leaders who had
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston
University, said a letter from a doctor vouching for a candidate's
health should be enough. He said the rigors of campaigning would
take their toll on anyone who did not have the stamina to be
president, and that voters would see that for themselves without
the media's examining medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they ever found out anything that mattered?'' he asked.
``I don't think there's any magic in medical records, that we're
going to learn something essential about candidates by rooting
around in their records. If there's a terminal illness, you'd want
to know. That is fair, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should candidates be expected to disclose whether they have
ever consulted a psychiatrist, Annas said, because the stigma
attached to psychiatric treatment might cause politicians who need
it to forgo it rather than risk being forced to admit it. He
pointed to the case of Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who in 1972 was
dropped as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee after it became
known that he had failed to tell his running mate, Sen. George
McGovern, that he had received electroshock treatments for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   King said he was ``willing to bet'' that many people with
depression or manic depression had been successful politicians. He
suggested that if a psychiatric disorder was severe enough to
interfere with a person's ability to function, it would be obvious
to voters anyway.

<P>
   When questions surfaced about Sen. John McCain's emotional
stability, he put them to rest last month with a deluge of paper:
1,500 pages of medical records, going back to 1973. And that was
the abridged version.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now know that, psychologically, McCain is a rock, in
the opinion of his doctors. But they also now know about the mole
on his shoulder, about his arthritis, hay fever and intestinal
polyps, as well as the size of his prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   No law forces candidates to bare their medical histories. But
the news media and political rivals press for revelations, hinting
that those who decline may have something to hide. Some people
maintain that the public interest demands that the usual right to
confidentiality be waived. Others question whether the public
needs, wants or has a right to such information.
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that McCain was planning to release his
records, he was urged not to do so by Dr. Claire Dixon-Lee,
president of the American Health Information Management
Association, whose 40,000 members maintain medical records at
hospitals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating if releases of health information by
presidential candidates served as a catalyst for demands for this
kind of information from Americans when they apply for jobs or
loans, get married or partake in routine activities,'' Dr.
Dixon-Lee wrote. She suggested instead that candidates have their
doctors write ``comprehensive summaries,'' including only the
information pertinent to running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley has taken that approach, releasing a statement
from his doctor saying that he is in good health and that his
abnormal heart rhythms should not interfere with his work. His
staff has promised more data should he become the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has regularly sought medical information
about presidential candidates, assigning Lawrence K. Altman, a
reporter who is also a physician, to review medical histories and
to conduct extensive interviews with candidates and their personal
doctors. Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, said it was the
newspaper's responsibility to provide readers with information
``pertinent to an individual's ability to do the job of
president.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited former Sen. Paul Tsongas as an example of why medical
information is important, and why a letter from the candidate's
doctor is not sufficient. After telling voters he had been
successfully treated for cancer, Tsongas won the 1992 Democratic
presidential primary in New Hampshire. But he later left the race
and acknowledged under pressure that he and his doctors had
concealed a recurrence. He died of cancer in 1997, after having
publicly endorsed the formation of a presidential commission to
study the issue of how much medical information candidates should
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to have a doctor on our staff who doesn't seek to
examine the candidates themselves but who is qualified to examine
medical records, ask reasonable questions and draw conclusions,''
Lelyveld said. ``We don't need to publish everything he sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, candidates who have hidden their illnesses have been
elected and have governed effectively. Beyond his paralysis from
polio, which the press helped to play down by not photographing him
in his wheelchair, Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered from severe heart
disease and hypertension. His doctors knew he was severely ill when
he ran for a fourth term in 1944, but they concealed it, supposedly
as a matter of national security, because the nation was at war.
Roosevelt died a few months into the term.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower had heart disease and was secretly advised
by his doctor that he might not live through a second term. John F.
Kennedy did not tell voters he had Addison's disease, a serious
failure of the adrenal glands that required treatment with
steroids. And Abraham Lincoln is widely believed to have suffered
from lifelong bouts with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Would Americans have voted differently in any of those cases had
they known the truth? In Kennedy's case, the 1960 election was so
close that some historians say public knowledge of his health might
have given the victory to Richard M. Nixon. But some would argue
that Lincoln's, Kennedy's and Eisenhower's ability to function in
office prove that candidates should not be disqualified or judged
on the basis of health problems. Roosevelt may have been another
matter, but even if voters had known of his condition, it is hard
to imagine that they would have turned against him in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Callahan, an ethicist and co-founder of the Hastings
Center for Bioethics in Garrison, N.Y., argued that medical privacy
should be suspended for presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running, you're giving up your privacy, and
justifiably so,'' he said. ``The reason very simply is that the
health of somebody who is going to be president will bear on the
performance of that person once in the job. It's as relevant to
know somebody's health as their positions on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he found it hard to think of any exceptions. Even
though millions of people live normal lives with treatable
conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, they should be
disclosed, he said, along with any other disorder that carries a
higher than average likelihood of illness or death. Genes that
predispose a person to breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease are
also relevant, he said, as well as psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recurrent depression would certainly be something you'd want
to know about,'' Callahan said. ``Manic depression would be even
more worrisome, with someone who was hysterical at some times and
flat-out depressed at others. I guess I'd like to see a letter from
a doctor that went over the main features of mental and physical
health, but didn't present the reading of every test that was
taken. But the physician should be neutral, not a crony or pal of
the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medicine at San Francisco General
Hospital, questioned the relevance of medical information. ``I
don't know if it helps us make a more learned decision about the
candidates,'' he said. ``It may potentially just play into people's
phobias and biases. We've had a number of amazing leaders who had
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston
University, said a letter from a doctor vouching for a candidate's
health should be enough. He said the rigors of campaigning would
take their toll on anyone who did not have the stamina to be
president, and that voters would see that for themselves without
the media's examining medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they ever found out anything that mattered?'' he asked.
``I don't think there's any magic in medical records, that we're
going to learn something essential about candidates by rooting
around in their records. If there's a terminal illness, you'd want
to know. That is fair, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should candidates be expected to disclose whether they have
ever consulted a psychiatrist, Annas said, because the stigma
attached to psychiatric treatment might cause politicians who need
it to forgo it rather than risk being forced to admit it. He
pointed to the case of Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who in 1972 was
dropped as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee after it became
known that he had failed to tell his running mate, Sen. George
McGovern, that he had received electroshock treatments for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   King said he was ``willing to bet'' that many people with
depression or manic depression had been successful politicians. He
suggested that if a psychiatric disorder was severe enough to
interfere with a person's ability to function, it would be obvious
to voters anyway.

<P>
   Is making racist and xenophobic remarks a sign of mental
illness?
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball seemed to suggest it was last week when
commissioner Bud Selig demanded that John Rocker, the ace relief
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, undergo psychological testing,
three weeks after his remarks about immigrants and blacks were
reported in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig's move may have more to do with politics and a desire
to save Rocker's career than with worries about his mental health,
say experts who study sports.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is that
racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless combined
with other problems. If it were, a huge swath of American society
would be considered ill, they say..
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have these thoughts but simply don't express
them,'' said Chris Crandall, a social psychologist at the
University of Kansas who studies prejudice. ``I think the guy just
didn't have his mental editor turned on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, 25, seems to have better control over his 95-mph
fastball than his tongue. During last year's playoffs, he engaged
in vituperative battles with New York Mets fans, spitting at them
and venting his hatred of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker went even further in comments to a magazine writer
who accompanied him on a recent hunting trip. Among other things,
Rocker called an overweight black team-mate ``a fat monkey,''
complained about what ``degenerates'' New York fans were and said,
``the biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also likened riding the subway to Shea Stadium to driving
through Beirut, and described the passengers as ``some kid with
purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude
who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some
20-year-old mom with four kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But as abhorrent as those views are to many, they are not
necessarily insane, Dr. Daniel Borenstein, the president-elect of
the American Psychiatric Association, said. ``A tendency toward
bias is a normal human characteristic,'' he said. ``An extreme form
of bias is racism, but none of that is a mental disorder in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Rocker's outbursts scary, some sociologists say, is
that many Americans share his views though they know it is
politically verboten to express them. ``Vast majorities of white
Americans hold stereotypical views of people of color that are not
far from Rocker's views,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder of the
Center for the Study of Sport in Society.
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick said the center's surveys suggest racism is on the rise
among young Americans over the last 15 years. To expect sports to
remain insulated from such trends is naive. ``We are not going to
get baseball or basketball teams free of people who have the
attitudes of Rocker,'' he said. ``We can at least make our players
and people in our front offices understand there are consequences
for going across certain lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials have said Rocker's evaluation is a prelude
toward meting out a fine, a suspension or some other discipline.
Officials said the idea of testing Rocker before deciding how
severe punishment should be was a compromise reached with the Major
League Baseball Players Association, the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarks made by Rocker were pretty reprehensible,'' said
Richard Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball. ``It's not
something we can overlook. Something has to be done and this is a
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   His mental health aside, Rocker's diatribe has not been good for
baseball's image, which is not good for business. Nor will it be
easy for him to keep working for the Braves, whose starting lineup
last year regularly included black and Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta City Council, which represents a city where
minorities are the majority, has passed a resolution calling on the
Braves to dismiss Rocker. Some team mates have also made it plain
that they do not look forward to working with him this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitcher's value may outweigh all that. He was a
dominating closer for the Braves as they won the 1999 National
League Pennant with 38 regular season saves.
</P>
<P>
   While Rocker can exercise his First Amendment rights, the
Constitution shields him only from governmental actions to limit
speech, say civil liberties lawyers. Courts have held a private
company or organization can still discipline or dismiss an employee
for statements if they interfere with an employee's ability to do
his job or damage the employer's image.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps a measure of Rocker's talent that Braves president
Stan Kasten, the son of a Polish immigrant whose family was killed
in a Nazi concentration camp, has said the pitcher deserves ``a
second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Rocker's case is it gets us talking about racism
again,'' Lapchick said. ``One of the great problems of racism in
America is that we tend, unless it is thrown up in our faces, to
avoid it.''

<P>
   Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate, created quite the stir
this fall when he hailed Bob Dylan as one of the greatest artists
of the century and proclaimed ``Visions of Johanna,'' from Dylan's
1966 album ``Blonde on Blonde,'' the best song lyric ever written.
</P>
<P>
   As the queen's official poet, Motion, 47 years old, is the
latest in a long procession of literary lions that includes Dryden,
Wordsworth and Tennyson, so his pronouncement on Dylan's place in
the canon surely raised some eyebrows on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion sheds light on a peculiarly British
fascination with a peculiarly American performer. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TINA KELLEY
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) First, portions of an interview with Motion
in the October edition of The Message, published by the
London-based Poetry Society: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How highly do you rate him?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's one of the great artists of the century. He comes on the
scene at a very high level, then (with a few glitches here and
there) extends himself steadily _ usually staying one step ahead of
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is it about him you especially like?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concentration and surprise of his lyrics; the beauty of
his melodies (and the rasp of his anger); the dramatic sympathy
between the words and the music; the range of his devotions; the
power of self-renewal; his wit; his surrealism; the truth to
experience.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) British literati have apparently been
arguing for years about whether Dylan is as good a poet as Keats.
Motion, the author of a recent biography titled ``Keats'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1998), weighed in on the issue in The Message:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the Keats/Dylan debate?
</P>
<P>
   A: In one sense it's important to establish differences, and
these can be described pretty simply. Keats didn't play the guitar,
or write much for music (I mean: his words are free-standing in a
sense that Dylan's aren't), and Dylan hasn't produced any
book-length narrative poems. In other respects I think it's a false
dichotomy. They each have their own brilliant and distinctive
things to say, and neither _ in their greatness _ matters more or
less than the other.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that I think that all contemporary rock
music, or . . whatever music, always and inevitably holds its own
when compared to poetry proper. Most song lyrics rely heavily on
their accompanying music; without their music, they're banal,
repetitive, nothing-y. I don't find them rewarding as poems.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't meant to sound crusty or stick-in-the-mud. It just
acknowledges the particular merits and opportunities of different
forms. In other words: Dylan is an exception proving a more-or-less
general rule. He doesn't (as Robert Lowell said he did) ``lean on
the crutch of his guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Oct. 7, a group of poets including Roddy
Lumsden and John Burnside joined Motion for an online chat session
on the Web site of the Poetry Society (www.poetrysociety.org),
focusing (if chat sessions can be said to focus) on Dylan's lyrics.
Highlights follow. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) It's hard to say what direct effect BD has had on
poets _ though there are some who carry echoes of his work in
remembering ways. Mainly, I think it's a question of his being
exemplary in the matter of openness. I mean, showing us in a very
public way that it's ok to merge lyric, narrative, surreal etc.
writing, and to demonstrate that it can be serious fun. . . . john;
we know Keats could sing _ or did sing, at any rate. What do you
think it was like?
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Not like a nightingale, I imagine. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) There's something in all this about how music proper
has its own logic and `meaning' of a non-verbal kind, which adds of
course to the comparatively meaningful and logical words. And how
this connects with the elements of poetry proper which do not
aspire to logic and coherence as their first port of call. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) True to the medium, the discussion
eventually turned to matters of pairing off: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (roddyl) I think there should be a `dating' agency for
poets/composers. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) Dating agency here we come: Poet Laureate, 46,
non-smoking meat-eater, lyrical, seeks musical ditto with view to
possible etc. etc.. . .
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Cheers, I'll off and have that toddy now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The discussion prompted online responses
from a variety of Dylan enthusiasts, including this message
directed to Motion from someone who identified himself as Pete
Younger: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Bravo for sticking your head above the parapet on behalf of
Dylan's lyrics. Were they the product of the lyricist half of a
traditional song-writing duo critics would be less reluctant to see
them as literary works in their own right. And the Nobel committee
less perverse in ignoring (one of) the dominant artistic figures of
our century. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yet another remarkable and unique aspect of Dylan's art is his
willingness to keep performing it and continually re-interpreting
it for anybody who shows up. Never before has the dominant artist
of a generation been available to mass scrutiny . . . Bob is out

   Dylan cannot match Shakespeare's achievement in inventing
several centuries of Western society by defining its complete
emotional lexicon. But he has achieved something similar on a
smaller scale for the second half of this century in establishing
the permissible obsessions of his time. And that has been largely
achieved by the verbal element of his oeuvre.

   Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate, created quite the stir
this fall when he hailed Bob Dylan as one of the greatest artists
of the century and proclaimed ``Visions of Johanna,'' from Dylan's
1966 album ``Blonde on Blonde,'' the best song lyric ever written.
</P>
<P>
   As the queen's official poet, Motion, 47 years old, is the
latest in a long procession of literary lions that includes Dryden,
Wordsworth and Tennyson, so his pronouncement on Dylan's place in
the canon surely raised some eyebrows on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion sheds light on a peculiarly British
fascination with a peculiarly American performer. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TINA KELLEY
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) First, portions of an interview with Motion
in the October edition of The Message, published by the
London-based Poetry Society: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How highly do you rate him?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's one of the great artists of the century. He comes on the
scene at a very high level, then (with a few glitches here and
there) extends himself steadily _ usually staying one step ahead of
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is it about him you especially like?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concentration and surprise of his lyrics; the beauty of
his melodies (and the rasp of his anger); the dramatic sympathy
between the words and the music; the range of his devotions; the
power of self-renewal; his wit; his surrealism; the truth to
experience.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) British literati have apparently been
arguing for years about whether Dylan is as good a poet as Keats.
Motion, the author of a recent biography titled ``Keats'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1998), weighed in on the issue in The Message:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the Keats/Dylan debate?
</P>
<P>
   A: In one sense it's important to establish differences, and
these can be described pretty simply. Keats didn't play the guitar,
or write much for music (I mean: his words are free-standing in a
sense that Dylan's aren't), and Dylan hasn't produced any
book-length narrative poems. In other respects I think it's a false
dichotomy. They each have their own brilliant and distinctive
things to say, and neither _ in their greatness _ matters more or
less than the other.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that I think that all contemporary rock
music, or . . whatever music, always and inevitably holds its own
when compared to poetry proper. Most song lyrics rely heavily on
their accompanying music; without their music, they're banal,
repetitive, nothing-y. I don't find them rewarding as poems.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't meant to sound crusty or stick-in-the-mud. It just
acknowledges the particular merits and opportunities of different
forms. In other words: Dylan is an exception proving a more-or-less
general rule. He doesn't (as Robert Lowell said he did) ``lean on
the crutch of his guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Oct. 7, a group of poets including Roddy
Lumsden and John Burnside joined Motion for an online chat session
on the Web site of the Poetry Society (www.poetrysociety.org),
focusing (if chat sessions can be said to focus) on Dylan's lyrics.
Highlights follow. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) It's hard to say what direct effect BD has had on
poets _ though there are some who carry echoes of his work in
remembering ways. Mainly, I think it's a question of his being
exemplary in the matter of openness. I mean, showing us in a very
public way that it's ok to merge lyric, narrative, surreal etc.
writing, and to demonstrate that it can be serious fun. . . . john;
we know Keats could sing _ or did sing, at any rate. What do you
think it was like?
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Not like a nightingale, I imagine. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) There's something in all this about how music proper
has its own logic and `meaning' of a non-verbal kind, which adds of
course to the comparatively meaningful and logical words. And how
this connects with the elements of poetry proper which do not
aspire to logic and coherence as their first port of call. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) True to the medium, the discussion
eventually turned to matters of pairing off: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (roddyl) I think there should be a `dating' agency for
poets/composers. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) Dating agency here we come: Poet Laureate, 46,
non-smoking meat-eater, lyrical, seeks musical ditto with view to
possible etc. etc.. . .
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Cheers, I'll off and have that toddy now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The discussion prompted online responses
from a variety of Dylan enthusiasts, including this message
directed to Motion from someone who identified himself as Pete
Younger: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Bravo for sticking your head above the parapet on behalf of
Dylan's lyrics. Were they the product of the lyricist half of a
traditional song-writing duo critics would be less reluctant to see
them as literary works in their own right. And the Nobel committee
less perverse in ignoring (one of) the dominant artistic figures of
our century. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yet another remarkable and unique aspect of Dylan's art is his
willingness to keep performing it and continually re-interpreting
it for anybody who shows up. Never before has the dominant artist
of a generation been available to mass scrutiny . . . Bob is out
there every night (well he will be again in a few weeks) creating
his art afresh _ lyrically and musically. Why doesn't everybody go
to see the person through whom their lives will be remembered to
future generations?

poet. Do you think of yourself in those terms?

up and be a poet. But it's a dedication. It's a big dedication.
Poets don't drive cars. (Laughs) Poets don't go to the supermarket.
Poets don't empty the garbage. Poets aren't on the PTA Poets, you
know, they don't go picket the Better Housing Bureau, or whatever.
. . . Poets don't even speak on the telephone. Poets don't even
talk to anybody. Poets do a lot of listening and . . . they behave
in a gentlemanly way. And live by their own gentlemanly code. And
die broke. Or drown in lakes. Poets usually have very unhappy

   JERUSALEM _ Before President Clinton left Washington for his
first meeting with Israeli and Syrian leaders at a Shepherdstown,
W.Va., retreat, his aides requested a copy of the Camp David
agreement to review the formulations that forged peace between
Egypt and Israel some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Jerusalem, Israeli officials feverishly studied
the negotiations with Jewish settlers evacuated from the Sinai as a
result of that accord. Clearly, that first evacuation, which broke
the Zionist taboo against abandoning a settlement, would serve as
the historical template _ complete with do's and don'ts _ for what
may be Israel's next one, from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Camp David process is the yardstick, whether it
should be or shouldn't be,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a diplomacy
expert at Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Even in quaint Shepherdstown itself, the memory of Camp David
asserted itself in the 20-year-old Hebrew-Arabic-English peace
posters that decorated the store windows last week. Following the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, a Jewish grandmother had given the
posters to her granddaughter, now a town resident. Save them for
the day that Israel makes peace with the rest of its enemies, she
had said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the comparison is unfair. Camp David _ 12
excruciatingly long days in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and
Anwar Sadat hammered out a framework of peace _ was the climax of a
process. Shepherdstown, where bilateral contact has been limited to
clipped utterances of ``Lobby, please'' in the hotel elevator, is
an opening scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparing and contrasting of Camp David and
Shepherdstown is inevitable, because parallels are so explicit.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, the parallel begins with the basic formula of
trading peace for land occupied during a war _ then the Sinai, now
the Golan Heights. There is the uprooting of Jewish settlements
planted by the Israeli government _ then some 5,800 residents, now
17,000. And there is the attempt to not just declare
non-belligerency but to normalize relations with the most
influential foe of the Jewish homeland in the Arab world _ then
Egypt, now Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For Syrian President Hafez Assad, the Camp David deal is
something to equal or best, especially since he declined Sadat's
invitation to join in his peace negotiations with Israel in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to trump Sadat, or else why has he waited 20 years,
especially after criticizing Sadat so strongly for making too many
concessions,'' said Shibley Telhami, who holds the University of
Maryland's Anwar Sadat Chair for Population, Development and Peace.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, there is the American purse that bankrolls the
effort. After Camp David, that meant $3 billion in annual aid to
Israel and $2.3 billion to Egypt over 20 years, and an
understanding that the amounts were linked, to rise or fall
together.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, despite the cold peace that emerged from the
beginnings of a more promising relationship, there is the fact that
the fundamental peace stuck: There have been no conflicts, no
skirmishes, no large military exercises on the Israeli-Egyptian
border.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed much, of course, since the Camp David
talks in September 1978. Egypt was a key client state of the Soviet
Union, and the cold war hovered over the forging of that first
melting of hostilities in the Middle East. That was a factor
crucial for the avid American participation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, besides the breakup of the Soviet Union, peace has
been forged with Jordan. The peace effort with the Palestinians,
which tentatively began with agreement at Camp David that the
Palestinians had a right to full autonomy, has chugged into its
final stages. Camp David itself broke up Egypt's alliance with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines from Israeli newspapers in the late 1970s bear an
eerie resemblance to current ones. Right-wing parties threaten to
quit the governing coalition; settlers mobilize rallies in their
own defense; Israelis express anxiety about increasing dependence
on the Americans, and some accuse the government of ignoring
domestic concerns in its focus on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one Jerusalem newspaper, after sneaking a
correspondent into Syria, gave in to pages of rapture about Syria
itself _ the warmth of the people, the smoothness of the hummus. It
recalled the euphoria that Sadat engendered in the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, this time, there is very little enthusiasm for
the prospects of what peace will bring beside an end to war. That
is a product of Assad's tough persona. But it is a lesson of Camp
David, too. The fact that the peace with Egypt remains so cool
fuels some of the opposition to the negotiations with Syria. And
even for supporters, it mutes expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned our lesson not to expect too much from a major Arab
power that has its own internal agenda and problems,'' said Joseph
Alpher, director of the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``The
inclination is to build a kind of equation. Despite Sadat's warmth,
we got a cold peace with Egypt. So with Assad's coldness, we're
going to have a frigid peace with Syria.''

recalled the euphoria that Sadat engendered in the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, this time, there is very little enthusiasm for
the prospects of what peace will bring beside an end to war. That
is a product of Assad's tough persona. But it is a lesson of Camp
David, too. The fact that the peace with Egypt remains so cool
fuels some of the opposition to the negotiations with Syria. And
even for supporters, it mutes expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned our lesson not to expect too much from a major Arab
power that has its own internal agenda and problems,'' said Joseph
Alpher, director of the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``The
inclination is to build a kind of equation. Despite Sadat's warmth,
we got a cold peace with Egypt. So with Assad's coldness, we're
going to have a frigid peace with Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After painful wrangling, the Egyptians got the full Israeli
withdrawal they wanted. Now Syria, too, is pushing for a full
withdrawal. ``For every inch of the Sinai that Sadat got, Assad
wants a little more,'' Professor Steinberg said. But unlike with
Israel and Egypt, where both sides accepted the international
borders, Syria wants Israel to pull back another seven square miles
beyond the international border to the line that stood between them
on June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike with Egypt, which repossessed a 124-mile stretch of
desert that served as a natural buffer with Israel, the heights of
the Golan confer a military advantage on Syria. This changes the
dynamic of the negotiation over land, with Israel putting a high
value on the security controls that could be provided by early
warning stations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who question the use of Camp David as a model also argue
that Sadat, in braving rifts with the Arab world, was the one who
took the risks and that Assad should not be rewarded for waiting
this long. And they point to what they see as a bitter fruit:
Egypt's sophisticated military capability, a potential threat to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, note the peculiar cooperation that has developed
between Israel and Egypt, which, since their aid levels are linked,
almost jointly lobby Congress every year for continued high levels
of financing. They say that if Syria were brought into the U.S.
orbit, it would give the Americans and Israelis leverage. Assad too
is reportedly looking to establish a close economic, military and
strategic relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That Assad is not present in Shepherdstown could be a reflection
solely of his ill health. But it is likely that it is another
signal of how he wants to do things differently than Sadat at Camp
David. Many Egyptians, and many Arabs in general, were disappointed
with that accord, and believed that Sadat had caved in to U.S.
demands and had sold out the Palestinians to regain the Sinai. .
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak drew a direct parallel with
the Israeli-Egyptian conflict and its resolution before leaving for
Shepherdstown. He visited the spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, seeking an
endorsement of his peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were once those who said that Sharm el-Sheikh without
peace was preferable,'' he said. ``Then,'' he continued, referring
to the 1973 war, ``we had 3,000 graves and the picture changed.''

   GUSAU, Nigeria _ Alongside a dark and deserted highway, a few
dozen Nigerian soldiers and civilians sat at rickety tables on a
Saturday night, their faces barely visible under the flickering
lightbulbs powered by a weak generator.
</P>
<P>
   The night, most emphatically, was slow in Gusau, the capital of
Zamfara state in northwestern Nigeria, where elected officials had
recently announced the introduction of Islamic law, or sharia. A
lone man sang mournfully at his table and women were few and
cheerless. But the beer flowed, plenty of warm, cheap Nigerian
beer, more than enough for a few thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Zamfara state? This is sharia? This is amazing!'' said
a Christian man who, after crossing state lines earlier that day,
had made a beeline for this highway spot, which sits next to the
army barracks and, with the officers' mess across town, is one of
two places in Zamfara where alcohol is now sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story going around this dusty town in the Sahel
region south of the Sahara desert, the governor sent an emissary
with a written request that the military commanders stop serving
alcohol in the barracks. The messenger was told to leave, though
not before he was forced to swallow the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fantasy,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the deputy
governor. He added, however, that the soldiers would henceforth not
be asked to refrain from drinking, sharia or no sharia.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was typical of the way Islam must bend in
Nigeria, as it has to in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa,
where the religion exists alongside Christianity and strongly held
traditional beliefs, say experts on religion in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Sudan's Islamic rulers have grabbed the West's
attention in this region, as Khartoum became a harbor for
anti-American terrorists and a long-running civil war against a
mostly Christian and animist south killed 2 million people. More
recently, Jordanian and U.S. officials have linked terrorist plots
to Islamic militants from the North African country of Algeria. But
while the West's encounter with Sudan's rulers and Algeria's rebels
seems to fit with its experience of antagonism from Islamic
militants in Lebanon, Iran, Afghanistan and Libya, it would be a
mistake to think that such militance represents the attitude taken
by Muslims throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Islam in Nigeria _ indeed, Islam in most of sub-Saharan
Africa _ is an easygoing affair, religion scholars say. To be sure,
religion is a fissure in this country and one often exploited by
politicians to divide, but it ranks far behind other factors like
ethnicity and geography. So while many Nigerians say Zamfara's
politicians are using Islam to unite a Muslim north against a
predominantly Christian south, they regard it as a dangerous and
calculated political threat, not an expression of nascent religious
extremism. And few believe Zamfara's decision could lead to the
rise of the anti-Western and xenophobic Islam associated with
Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan or the Algerian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   As such, experts say, Nigeria is much more representative of the
more tolerant kind of Islam found in sub-Saharan Africa and, at the
other end of the Islamic world, in the vast reaches of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, nearly half of Nigeria's 110 million people describe
themselves as Muslims, outnumbering by far the Muslims found in any
other country in the region. There are more Muslims here, in fact,
than in North African countries like Morocco, Algeria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Africa, in general, tends to be more Islamic in the north and
largely Christian in the south. Nigeria reflects that divide
internally, though half the Yoruba, the dominant ethnic group in
the southwest, are believed to be Muslim. Islam arrived in what is
now northern Nigeria in the 11th century. The British practiced
indirect rule in the region, leaving in place Islamic rulers and
allowing them to retain sharia for civil matters like marriage and
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Muslims in the south tend to be the most liberal.
Among the Yoruba, it is common to find Muslims and Christians in
the same family; some Yoruba even practice both religions, with a
dash of traditional Yoruba beliefs. Even in the north, traditional
customs and beliefs have adapted Islam to fit local needs, said
Aisha Abdul-Ismail, an expert on Islam at Bayero University in
Kano. ``Because of the mixture of indigenous beliefs and Islam in
Nigeria, what is Islam is often not the real Islam,'' she said.
``It is syncretic.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, can be said of Christianity in Nigeria and
sub-Saharan Africa. Half the cars in Lagos may have bumper stickers
professing the driver's love for Jesus, but polygamy is still
widely practiced among Nigerian and African Christians.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly this syncretism that has prevented the rise of
Islamic extremism here, said Haruna Salihi, a scholar of Islam and
politics in Kano: ``Arabs in particular may feel that Islam is
their unique heritage,'' he said. ``But that is not the case with
us. Here you find various combinations of Muslims, Christians and
traditional beliefs, and it's a restrictive factor against the kind
of eruption you find in the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ethnicity _ not religion _ remains the essential
way most Nigerians and Africans identify themselves. Indeed, the
bloodiest clashes that have occurred since Nigeria inaugurated a
civilian government in May have had less to do with religion than
ethnicity. They have pitted the northern Hausa, who are Muslim,
against the southern Yoruba, who are also Muslim as well as
Christian. The Hausa and the smaller northern groups associated
with them have dominated the military since independence in 1960
and ruled Nigeria. But since the May election of President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a retired general and Yoruba, the northerners have
complained that they are being shut out of power.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the northerners accuse Obasanjo of doing so in order
to favor his fellow Yoruba; they never mention the fact that he is
a born-again Christian.

Service for AMs of Sunday, Jan. 9:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DRUGS-I (Tijuana, Mexico) _ The first of a two-part
series on how drugs and crime have corrupted Mexico. By Tim Golden.
(EDS: Two versions of this story will move: full-length _ 3,700
words _ as it appears in The Times and an abridged version,
MEXICO-DRUGS-I-ABR, at less than half that length. The full-length
version will move by noon EST.) With a map.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ This grand nation boasts a 1,100-year
lineage of autocrats, from Ivan the Terrible to Peter the Great;
from Aleksei the Quietest One to Uncle Joe Stalin. So the question
arises: what to call its first democratic leader, Boris
Nikolayevich Yeltsin? By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Mozdok, Russia) _ News Analysis on the shakeup
of the Russian command around the Chechen capital, Grozny, and
whether the move signals a change of strategy by the Kremlin. By
Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Shepherdstown, W.Va.) _ From hilltops in this
pre-Civil War town where Israel and Syria have negotiated all week,
you can just make out the farm across the Potomac River where
Abraham Lincoln met Gen. George B. McClellan in a tent and
complained that he suffered from ``the slows'' after the battle of
Antietam. Last week, traveling here almost daily to deal with a
very different conflict, Bill Clinton found himself struggling to
cure the same affliction. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ECON (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ One year after a currency
crisis sparked fears that the Brazilian economy was heading toward
an Asian-style meltdown, growth has resumed, calm has returned and
it is once again business as usual here. In other words, Brazil's
Congress is acting as if the crisis never occurred and
procrastinating about approving the government's economic program.
By Larry Rohter. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-POLITICS (Santiago, Chile) _ A look at the political
skills of Joaquin Lavin, the first conservative candidate with a
chance to win Chile's presidency since Gen. Augusto Pinochet left
power in 1990. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-SEX-HARASSMENT (Prague, Czech Republic) _ When the
European Union asks its applicants for admission what men do to
women in the workplace, the countries of Central Europe will
apparently have some explaining to do. To the shock of many Czechs,
a recent study commissioned by the daily Lidove Noviny indicated
that almost half of the country's working women have been subjected
to sexual harassment in the workplace. By Ladka Bauerova.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-ASSESS (Undated) _ Whether it is with scorn, anger or
resignation, most computer experts and year 2000 program managers
brush off suggestions that they overreacted to the Y2K threat,
taken in by computer companies and consultants positioned to profit
from fear. Still, like the skeptics, many wonder: How did countries
that started so late _ and appeared to do so little _ manage to
enter 2000 as smoothly as nations like the United States and
Britain that got an early jump? By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   LA-EDWARDS-TRIAL (Baton Rouge, La.) _ For a quarter century,
Edwin W. Edwards was Louisiana's great guilty pleasure, the
four-term governor whose breezy misbehavior amused the voters while
infuriating several generations of federal law-enforcement
officers. But beginning on Monday, the former governor will face
what almost everyone acknowledges is the most serious prosecution
of his career, one that he may have difficulty eluding with the
Cajun wit that always beguiled previous juries. David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY (Miami) _ The heated political battle over the custody
of the 6-year-old boy Elian Gonzalez showed no signs of subsiding
Saturday after a House Republican leader subpoenaed the boy to
testify before Congress in an effort to keep him in the United
States. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   ATIICA-SETTLEMENT (Undated) _ Robert Lavinski is a piano teacher
in Rochester, N.Y., who is partial to Ravel, Chopin and Chick
Corea. Arthur Bobby Harrison volunteers as a boxing coach in
downtown Syracuse. George Alexander Shorts Jr. is a Brooklyn
resident who has never been able to work because of his broken
toes. What they have in common is that they are all former inmates
at Attica who survived the bloodiest incident in the history of
America's prisons: the uprising and siege of 1971 in which 43
people were killed and more than 80 wounded. A settlement proposed
on Tuesday that would give up to 1,281 inmates a total of $8
million as compensation for the abuse they suffered 29 years ago
has rekindled interest in the siege. By David W. Chen and Randal C.
Archibold.
</P>
<P>
   CIVILSUPPORT-AGENCY (Norfolk, Va.) _ One year ago, Brig. Gen.
Bruce M. Lawlor was a small-town Vermont lawyer whose duties in the
national guard included hauling water to livestock during summer
droughts and rescuing farmers in winter ice storms. Last month,
Lawlor became the first commander of a sensitive new military
operation that would respond if the United States were struck by a
chemical, germ or nuclear attack. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-ICEFISHING-RISKS (Harrison Township, Mich.) _ Ice fishing
has long been a big part of winter life in Michigan. Indians
engaged in the sport long before white settlers arrived, and the
state's Department of Natural Resources estimates that 300,000
people still go ice fishing each winter. But a string of accidents,
combined with a succession of fairly mild winters, has provoked an
acrimonious fight in the Michigan Legislature over whether new laws
are needed to discourage ice anglers from taking excessive risks.
By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-MONEY (Portsmouth, N.H.) _ Many prominent Democrats say
they are deeply troubled that the Republican Party is collecting so
much more money than the Democrats that it will enjoy an
insurmountable financial advantage _ perhaps enough to cost them
the White House. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ To the surprise of many
political analysts, Bill Bradley raised more than $27 million for
his underdog quest for the Democratic nomination last year, just $2
million less than his rival, Vice President Al Gore. Though his
contributor list is laced with names of the rich and powerful, the
story of how Bradley kept pace with Gore is mainly filled with
lesser-known figures. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   TRUMP-POLITICS (Undated) _ There may be many reasons to run for
president of the United States, but the chance to turn a profit on
the campaign trail is generally not one of them. Unless the
office-seeker happens to be Donald Trump. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-DEBATE _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley debate in Iowa beginning at 2 p.m. EST. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.

</P>
<P>

CHILEAN'S HOMESPUN RECORD COULD MAKE HIM PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Joaquin Lavin, the first conservative
candidate with a chance to win Chile's presidency since Gen.
Augusto Pinochet left power in 1990, has never managed anything
larger than a neighborhood of 250,000 people on the east side of
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, Las Condes, is a redoubt of mansions, soaring
glassy banks, luxury high-rise apartments and a city hall decorated
with prints celebrating the world of polo and golf _ hardly the
usual testing ground for a candidate who wants to govern a complex
country of nearly 16 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's resume lacks the heft of that of his opponent, Ricardo
Lagos, who headed ministries in the two previous, center-left
governments. But the 46-year-old conservative has a strong chance
of winning next Sunday's election, a showing that has much to do
with the broadly held perception that he governed little Las Condes
with imagination and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't vote based on parties and ideology anymore,''
Lavin said in a televised debate with Lagos. ``They vote for the
candidate they believe will solve their daily problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly seven years as mayor, he borrowed entire chapters from
political textbooks devised in cities as far away as New York,
Geneva and Singapore in an effort to find free-market solutions to
social problems. But more than anything else, his innovations in
education and health care are softening the image of the Chilean
right, which still carries the baggage of the human rights abuses
of the Pinochet dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin is also part of a new wave of younger politicians who
appear committed to overturning the traditionally highly
centralized power structures of Latin America, parlaying local
government success into capturing national attention, and even high
office.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua,
was elected president of Argentina, following similar victories by
mayors in Colombia, El Salvador and Nicaragua in recent years. In
both Peru and Mexico, a mayor and former mayor are contenders in
presidential elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   The man from Las Condes has used a fat budget nourished by
plentiful real estate taxes to inaugurate projects big and small,
all smartly packaged for maximum media coverage. He eased traffic
jams with battery-powered mobile traffic lights turned on and off
depending on traffic flows. He spruced up old buildings by
providing matching funds to tenants for repainting.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin created three charter schools that have improved student
performance, and he channeled people released from prison into
sanitation jobs. A devout Roman Catholic, he provided counseling
for single pregnant women _ including those who used drugs or had
been raped _ to urge them to give birth and either to rear their
own babies or to give them up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With advice from William J. Bratton, the former New York City
police commissioner, Lavin instituted community policing. And with
guidance from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research
group, he modeled a new school for dropouts and gang members on the
Wildcat Academy in Lower Manhattan, an alternative high school.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The man who might one day negotiate arms and trade deals with
Washington and Buenos Aires does not talk much about foreign policy
on the campaign trail. Instead, he goes to great lengths to spell
out how he will reduce the time patients wait for attention at
public health clinics. No subject is too small as Lavin explains
how to clean up graffiti by giving juvenile delinquents paint
brushes, provide day care for working mothers and offer college
loans to achieving students.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin began using his nuts-and-bolts philosophy for political
gain after he lost a bruising congressional race in 1989 as a
right-wing ideologue who defended Pinochet and went by the nickname
``the fighting cock.'' He reoriented his political compass to
squeak out his 1992 electoral victory with a campaign that put bus
service before any ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he was re-elected with 78 percent of the vote
_ a result that catapulted his presidential candidacy over more
traditional conservative politicians. Last year, he resigned as
mayor to run for president. In last month's first-round balloting,
Lavin shocked the political establishment by attracting better than
47 percent of the vote and virtually tying Lagos, who only a few
months ago was expected to win easily.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say that Lavin's programs are paternalistic and
token, and that his statements about helping the poor are meant to
confuse voters and hide his past as a low-level official in
Pinochet's planning ministry. A country with 10 percent
unemployment and a primitive infrastructure in the rural provinces,
they say, will need more than Lavin's Las Condes-style tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a demagogue,'' said former President Patricio
Aylwin, who is campaigning hard for Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Lavin attracted tens of thousands of
lower-income voters in last month's vote by promoting his pragmatic
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lavin built a reputation in Las Condes as a person who
delivers practical solutions,'' said Ricardo Israel, a political
scientist at the University of Chile. ``He never fails to say on
the campaign trail, `I can do for you what I have done for the poor
of Las Condes.'''
</P>
<P>
   While most of Las Condes is well-to-do, it has several
working-class barrios that have attracted Lavin's particular
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Colon Oriente, for instance, he built a public gymnasium and
swimming pool. He set up clubs for the elderly, where they were
provided powdered milk, classes in floral arrangements and
counseling for emotional problems. He set up kiosks where people
could file crime complaints without traveling long distances to
police stations.
</P>
<P>
   When a wealthy landowner threatened to drive away 52 families
living in shacks on her land so that a supermarket could be built
there, Lavin bought the land and, in a joint undertaking with the
Housing Ministry, built public housing for the families. Lavin's
effort was in marked contrast to the policies of Pinochet, who
drove squatters out of Las Condes whenever he had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a mayor do so much,'' said Regina Zuniga, a
43-year-old resident of the project. Ms. Zuniga, an unemployed
domestic worker, voted for the two previous presidential candidates
of the center-left government. But this time she is voting for
Lavin because, she says, ``he will provide work for all the
people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Lavin talks constantly about how he
improved health care in Las Condes. He provided limited health
insurance free to 2,000 of the lowest-income men who headed
households, covering operations for ailments like varicose veins
and hernias that could otherwise put them out of work. So his
constituents would not have to wait months for various services at
public clinics, he donated a building to a private clinic in
exchange for its providing free annual examinations to 1,200
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   And he built small neighborhood infirmaries outfitted with cars
so doctors and nurses could make house calls to those too sick to
leave home. The model for the free house calls came from British
socialized medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by Lavin's heterodoxy, Dr. Djamila Calixtro, an
immigrant from Cuba who worked for years there in family health
care, sought employment in one of the infirmaries. ``I'm
integrating what I learned in Cuba to work for Mayor Lavin,'' she
said in a comment that would surely make Fidel Castro cringe.
</P>
<P>
   A patient in Calixtro's infirmary, Nelson Meza, said he was
finally giving up alcohol thanks to the counseling he was receiving
there. An unemployed bus driver, Meza, 48, said he voted for the
Communist presidential candidate in 1993, but this year would vote
for Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a young man who will work for the poor,'' he said.
``If he becomes president, it will be a new country.''

   ``Kee-ripes,'' lamented W.W. ``Pudge'' Heffelfinger in his 1954
book ``This Was Football.'' ``How different modern football is from
the old days when the coach wouldn't dare make a decision without
first consulting the team captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain? How quaint. In the current National Football
League, the most important function of a captain is knowing when to
drop the Gatorade bucket on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Heffelfinger, who was Walter Camp's first All-America selection
back in 1892 and the game's first professional _ $500 for a game
between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh
Athletic Club _ wouldn't have known what to make of a game where
coaches have come to dominate everything from player drafts to
strategy. Or a game where the serial retirements of the New York
Jets head coach Bill Parcells and his designated successor,
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, would dominate sports
headlines for days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, a game that required something called a
defensive coordinator. ``Your head coach today,'' Heffelfinger
railed in 1954, ``has become an absolute dictator. He not only
picks the team, designs the plays and relegates the captain to a
corporal's status, but during the game he frequently governs the
choice of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the game, not only were coaches not the
venerated figures we know today; they were, on occasion, forcibly
ejected from the field by players when they became too dictatorial.
But by the end of the century, a top football coach like Parcells _
who turned three successive losing teams, the Giants, Patriots and
Jets, into winners _ had achieved the superstar free-agent status
that team owners succeeded in denying the players.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Most historians pinpoint the 1920s, when football
began to change from a sporting contest organized for the enjoyment
of college athletes and spectators to a money-making proposition
for the universities _ and later, of course, for the owners of
professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   A century after Pudge Heffelfinger's exploits for Yale, football
has all but ceased to exist outside of an organized structure.
Travel the country and you'll see pickup games of basketball and
baseball, but outside of a high school field, where do children
still play football?
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear that they would know how. The game has
gotten so complex that no one but the coaches truly understands it.
The head coach has evolved from a man who carried a bucket and
helped the captain to a man who coaches coaches, a swarm of
coordinators and assistants and quarterback coaches and line
coaches and receiver coaches from whom consensus must be drawn
before a single play can be allowed. Forget Pudge Heffelfinger _
Vince Lombardi wouldn't recognize this game.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest game of his life, the 1967 ``Ice Bowl'' NFL
Championship against Dallas, with the ball on the 1-yard line and
13 seconds to play, Lombardi was asked by his captain, quarterback
Bart Starr, what he wanted. ``Score a touchdown,'' replied the
greatest coach in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   What Lombardi meant was: ``I've already done my part of the job;
now you do yours. You know better than I do what has to be done.''
(And Starr did. He called his own number and won the game on a
quarterback sneak.)
</P>
<P>
   Compare the Lombardi-Starr moment with that of the head coach at
Alabama a couple of years ago who, when asked why his team had lost
the biggest game of the year on a boneheaded last-minute pass play,
replied, ``I didn't know we were calling a pass.'' He had delegated
a decision on which his job might depend _ not to the quarterback
(heaven forbid), but to a sub-coach.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative to such chaos seems to be coaches like
Parcells, who are too much in control, so much so that their
players often appear as automatons. There may be a law to the
modern game, something to the effect that the better the coach, the
duller his team.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a second law: the more in control the coach
becomes, the faster he burns out. Bill Parcells has now burned out
three times.

   ``Kee-ripes,'' lamented W.W. ``Pudge'' Heffelfinger in his 1954
book ``This Was Football.'' ``How different modern football is from
the old days when the coach wouldn't dare make a decision without
first consulting the team captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain? How quaint. In the current National Football
League, the most important function of a captain is knowing when to
drop the Gatorade bucket on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Heffelfinger, who was Walter Camp's first All-America selection
back in 1892 and the game's first professional _ $500 for a game
between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh
Athletic Club _ wouldn't have known what to make of a game where
coaches have come to dominate everything from player drafts to
strategy. Or a game where the serial retirements of the New York
Jets head coach Bill Parcells and his designated successor,
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, would dominate sports
headlines for days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, a game that required something called a
defensive coordinator. ``Your head coach today,'' Heffelfinger
railed in 1954, ``has become an absolute dictator. He not only
picks the team, designs the plays and relegates the captain to a
corporal's status, but during the game he frequently governs the
choice of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the game, not only were coaches not the
venerated figures we know today; they were, on occasion, forcibly
ejected from the field by players when they became too dictatorial.
But by the end of the century, a top football coach like Parcells _
who turned three successive losing teams, the Giants, Patriots and
Jets, into winners _ had achieved the superstar free-agent status
that team owners succeeded in denying the players.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Most historians pinpoint the 1920s, when football
began to change from a sporting contest organized for the enjoyment
of college athletes and spectators to a money-making proposition
for the universities _ and later, of course, for the owners of
professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   A century after Pudge Heffelfinger's exploits for Yale, football
has all but ceased to exist outside of an organized structure.
Travel the country and you'll see pickup games of basketball and
baseball, but outside of a high school field, where do children
still play football?
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear that they would know how. The game has
gotten so complex that no one but the coaches truly understands it.
The head coach has evolved from a man who carried a bucket and
helped the captain to a man who coaches coaches, a swarm of
coordinators and assistants and quarterback coaches and line
coaches and receiver coaches from whom consensus must be drawn
before a single play can be allowed. Forget Pudge Heffelfinger _
Vince Lombardi wouldn't recognize this game.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest game of his life, the 1967 ``Ice Bowl'' NFL
Championship against Dallas, with the ball on the 1-yard line and
13 seconds to play, Lombardi was asked by his captain, quarterback
Bart Starr, what he wanted. ``Score a touchdown,'' replied the
greatest coach in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   What Lombardi meant was: ``I've already done my part of the job;
now you do yours. You know better than I do what has to be done.''
(And Starr did. He called his own number and won the game on a
quarterback sneak.)
</P>
<P>
   Compare the Lombardi-Starr moment with that of the head coach at
Alabama a couple of years ago who, when asked why his team had lost
the biggest game of the year on a boneheaded last-minute pass play,
replied, ``I didn't know we were calling a pass.'' He had delegated
a decision on which his job might depend _ not to the quarterback
(heaven forbid), but to a sub-coach.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative to such chaos seems to be coaches like
Parcells, who are too much in control, so much so that their
players often appear as automatons. There may be a law to the
modern game, something to the effect that the better the coach, the
duller his team.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a second law: the more in control the coach
becomes, the faster he burns out. Bill Parcells has now burned out
three times.

FOR BRADLEY, AN INNOVATIVE MONEY TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last summer, Adrienne Arsht, chairwoman of
TotalBank in Miami, read Bill Bradley's book, ``Values of the
Game.'' A fan of women's sports, Ms. Arsht liked what Bradley, a
former New York Knick, had to say about teamwork, discipline and
responsibility. So she volunteered to help his insurgent campaign
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the Bradley campaign called. Could she be the host
of a fund-raiser? ``I said, do we do tea sandwiches or what?'' Ms.
Arsht, 57, recalled. ``I had never done anything close to this in
my life. Not since 1968, when I left my father's law firm in
Delaware and went to work for Eugene McCarthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Arsht and her co-hosts managed to cajole 150 friends
and business associates into paying as much as $1,000 each to hear
Bradley speak at her home in October. When he left, his campaign
was $100,000 richer.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many political analysts, Bradley raised more
than $27 million for his underdog quest for the Democratic
nomination last year, just $2 million less than his rival, Vice
President Al Gore, the party's front-runner. Though his contributor
list is laced with names of the rich and powerful, the story of how
Bradley kept pace with Gore is mainly filled with lesser-known
figures like Ms. Arsht.
</P>
<P>
   With no political machine at his fingertips, and no powerhouse
fund-raisers like Terry McAuliffe, who solicited $27 million for
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign, Bradley turned to a loose network
of longtime friends and supporters to be his money gatherers.
</P>
<P>
   Many were old friends from Princeton, his alma mater, the
National Basketball Association or the Senate, where he served
three terms. But others were people like Ms. Arsht who had never
met him, only read his books, heard him lecture or seen him play
basketball. Still others supported him simply because he had never
been part of the Clinton administration. Most had no political
fund-raising experience. But they were affluent people with
affluent friends willing to open their Rolodexes to help him get
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not what you'd describe as a national organization,''
said Leonard Riggio, chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``It was a whole
bunch of people who Bill has met over the years, and who were
waiting for him, waiting for the signal. It hasn't been the kind of
campaign others have run where they had superstar fund-raisers.
It's been a whole bunch of people who just helped out. A lot of
soldiers and no generals.''
</P>
<P>
   By tapping into so many veins of money, many of them from
outside the usual Democratic contributor lists, Bradley sidestepped
what many people had considered a towering obstacle to his
campaign: Gore's early success at locking up many of the best-known
and most-loyal Democratic fund-raisers and contributors.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, Bradley _ with much help from Wall Street _ had begun
nearly matching Gore's fund-raising. By late fall, he was
out-raising Gore 2-to-1. And now, as the campaign begins the
expensive sprint toward the Iowa caucuses of Jan. 24 and the
delegate-rich primaries of March, Bradley, thanks to his more
frugal spending, seems likely to have more cash available _ at
least $19 million _ than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To many political analysts, Bradley's fund-raising success is
the main reason he has turned a once seemingly lopsided race into
one of the liveliest Democratic primary battles in decades. Money
has given him not just the power to contest Gore deep into the
primary season, they say, but also credibility among Democratic
activists, contributors and voters. But Bradley's successes have
also raised questions among advocates of campaign finance reform
about his devotion to revamping the fund-raising system, a central
part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that he's an effective fund-raiser, he loses
some of the edge on being for reform,'' said Larry Makinson,
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, an
independent group that tracks campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just a year ago, Bradley was starting virtually from
scratch. When he announced his candidacy in late 1998, his
fund-raising machinery consisted essentially of an old list of
Senate contributors and two aides: Betty Sapoch, of Princeton,
N.J., who had raised money for his three Senate races, and Richard
Wright, a former Princeton basketball teammate and former Carter
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither had raised money for a presidential campaign,
they knew most of Bradley's longtime supporters, and their job was
to knit them together into what Mrs. Sapoch called ``Bradley
cells.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Wright's task to convince the fund-raisers that
there were sources of money beyond the Democratic deep pockets
already in the Gore camp. ``We were going into a world where we
were told we couldn't raise a cent because all the lists were
gone,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, their first calls were to Princeton alumni.
Bradley, class of '64, was not only the university's most famous
basketball player, but also a member of its board of trustees. The
alumni appeals worked so well that Wright began joking that he had
met all 1,500 of Bradley's roommates during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Lawrence Lucchino, class of '66 and president of
the Padres baseball team, held a party at the stadium in April that
raised $300,000. In Chicago, Mellody Hobson, a 30-year-old money
manager whom Bradley recruited for Princeton, helped organize a
March event that brought in $1.5 million. And in San Francisco,
John D. Diekman, a venture capitalist, used his extensive
connections with the class of '65 to sell tickets for an April
event that raised $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Princeton Rolodex was very important in that early
period,'' said John Scully, a partner in an investment firm who
graduated a year behind Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In that early period, Bradley played a major role in soliciting
contributions. Though he once wrote that his aggressive
fund-raising for his 1990 re-election campaign made him feel like
he wore ``a scarlet dollar sign,'' he devoted several hours a day
early last year to calling donors. He also personally recruited
most of his major fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Michael King, a New Jersey native and
co-chairman of King World Productions, a syndicator of several hit
television programs. King, who had long admired but never met
Bradley, agreed to help organize a June fund-raiser in Los Angeles
that brought in nearly $1 million. Michael D. Eisner, the chairman
of the Walt Disney Co., and Barry Diller, the media executive, were
among the Hollywood figures there.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also signed up John L. Thornton, president of Goldman
Sachs, at a dinner meeting at Thornton's London home a year ago
that had been arranged by mutual friends. In July, Thornton
organized an event with Americans living in London that raised more
than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman employees have contributed more than $209,000 to
Bradley, making the company his single largest source of money. One
reason is that about 15 company executives are Bradley supporters.
But another reason, Thornton said, is that the candidate's style
and record are appealing to investment bankers and entrepreneurs,
even those who do not always agree with his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is clearly the most genuinely accomplished person in
the race,'' Thornton said. ``Everything he's done is through sheer
determination. And that's a trait professional,
achievement-oriented people are attracted to.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his meticulous way, Bradley actually began laying the
foundations for his campaign in 1997, after he retired from the
Senate, a period when he taught at Stanford, made paid speeches
around the country and was a $300,000-a-year consultant to J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan experience seems to have paid off in support from
company officials. Douglas A. Warner 3rd, the company's chairman,
has contributed $1,000 to his campaign. And Morgan employees gave
more than $39,000 to Bradley last year, compared with about $2,000
to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While at Stanford, Bradley used much of his spare time to meet
lawyers, bankers and executives in Silicon Valley and San
Francisco, areas where Gore was thought to be particularly strong.
Bradley has now raised more money in California than the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was for him to get to know the valley, but part was
to develop relationships that might help him in a presidential
campaign,'' said John Roos, a Palo Alto lawyer who introduced
Bradley to several of his Silicon Valley clients.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of Bonnie Reiss, another supporter, Bradley also
met with about 50 longtime supporters in New York in 1998, before
he had announced his candidacy. Many of those people had been
disappointed that he had not run in 1992, and Ms. Reiss felt he
needed to smooth things over before starting a new campaign. The
smoothing worked, and the group raised $1.2 million at an event
last April.
</P>
<P>
   While such large events were going on, Bradley's friends from
the NBA were organizing smaller parties around the country. Dave
Bing in Detroit, Dave DeBusschere in West Hampton, N.Y., and Abe
Pollin, owner of the Washington Wizards, gave house parties that
raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Robertson, John Havlicek, Willis Reed, Phil Jackson and
many others contributed money, called friends and spoke at
fund-raising events. And a cast of 20 Hall of Fame players appeared
alongside Bradley at a Madison Square Garden event in November that
raised $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden event provided a prime example of how the Bradley
campaign chiefs marketed their candidate to diverse audiences.
Tickets were distributed widely on the liberal Upper West Side and
in central Brooklyn, bastions of support for Bradley. But friends
of Bradley's also sold many tickets to members of a New York
lawyers' basketball league, including to many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, the Democratic candidates have raised
nearly as much money as they will be allowed to spend for the
primaries, about $33 million each. Wright says he has already
reduced his staff by 60 percent, and fund-raisers around the
country are being asked to devote themselves to political work for
the next few months, decommissioned by their own success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my earmuffs ready for New Hampshire,'' Ms. Arsht
said.

   What if Domino's had to prove that it was really ``delivering a
million smiles a day'' or if Chevrolet had to demonstrate that its
trucks were actually ``like a rock''?
</P>
<P>
   What if Kentucky Fried Chicken had to prove that its chicken was
really fried in Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the questions Syl Sosnowski, Papa John's
International's vice president for marketing, said he asked himself
last week after a federal magistrate in Dallas ordered the company
to drop its slogan ``Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from Magistrate William Sanderson Jr. prohibits Papa
John's from using the word ``better'' to describe its pizza,
because the company could not prove that it used fresher and
tastier ingredients than that of its chief competitor, Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Papa John's argued that its advertising slogan, like
those of most American companies, was the kind of harmless boast
that consumers expect in television ads. But Sanderson, whose
decision applied only to the Papa John's case, ruled that if
something is not true, one should not say it and awarded Pizza Hut
$467,619 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the federal courts and the Federal Trade Commission
have been the ultimate arbiters in defining the thin line where
puffery ends and consumer fraud begins. Still, most scholars find a
generic answer elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to generalize about what the FTC and the courts
would consider puffery,'' said Kent Middleton, an advertising
professor and the chairman of the journalism department at the
University of Georgia. ``But the test is: would the average reader
or viewer be deceived by this?''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, companies cannot make inaccurate statements about
facts that can be proven or are not obvious jokes, said Middleton,
a co-author of ``The Law of Public Communication'' (Addison-Wesley,
1999). But there is nothing wrong with making vague and ridiculous
claims to goad people into buying products, he added.
</P>
<P>
   It is all right for Breath Savers to say its mints give
``ultimate fresh breath'' and Snapple to contend its products are
``made from the best stuff on earth'' because few would take those
claims literally, experts say. Similarly, Pepsico is allowed to air
commercials that show a student receiving a Harrier jet as a part
of the ``Get Pepsi Stuff'' challenge because most reasonable people
would take it as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the rule is: the more ridiculous the claim, the better,
said Ross Perry, an advertising professor at Babson College in
Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, for example, could say, as it did in the 1980s, that its
cars are ``faster than a speeding bullet.'' But it would land in
hot water if it made the far more modest claim that they were
faster than a Porsche.

something is not true, one should not say it and awarded Pizza Hut
$467,619 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the federal courts and the Federal Trade Commission
have been the ultimate arbiters in defining the thin line where
puffery ends and consumer fraud begins. Still, most scholars find a
generic answer elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to generalize about what the FTC and the courts
would consider puffery,'' said Kent Middleton, an advertising
professor and the chairman of the journalism department at the
University of Georgia. ``But the test is: would the average reader
or viewer be deceived by this?''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, companies cannot make inaccurate statements about
facts that can be proven or are not obvious jokes, said Middleton,
a co-author of ``The Law of Public Communication'' (Addison-Wesley,
1999). But there is nothing wrong with making vague and ridiculous
claims to goad people into buying products, he added.
</P>
<P>
   It is all right for Breath Savers to say its mints give
``ultimate fresh breath'' and Snapple to contend its products are
``made from the best stuff on earth'' because few would take those
claims literally, experts say. Similarly, Pepsico is allowed to air
commercials that show a student receiving a Harrier jet as a part
of the ``Get Pepsi Stuff'' challenge because most reasonable people
would take it as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the rule is: the more ridiculous the claim, the better,
said Ross Perry, an advertising professor at Babson College in
Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, for example, could say, as it did in the 1980s, that its
cars are ``faster than a speeding bullet.'' But it would land in
hot water if it made the far more modest claim that they were
faster than a Porsche.

Y2K EXPERTS LEFT TO EXPLAIN WHY TURNOVER WAS PROBLEM-FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it is with scorn, anger or resignation, most computer
experts and year 2000 program managers brush off suggestions that
they overreacted to the Y2K threat, that they were taken in by
computer companies and consultants positioned to profit from fear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like the skeptics, many wonder: How did countries that
started so late _ and appeared to do so little _ manage to enter
2000 as smoothly as nations like the United States and Britain that
got an early jump?
</P>
<P>
   ``That question is plaguing all of us, although some people
won't admit it,'' said Maggie Parent, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's
representative to Global 2000, an international banking group
formed to coordinate and stimulate year 2000 work. ``We expected
there to be some significant blowouts.''
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank survey published last January concluded that just
54 of 139 developing countries had national year 2000 programs
outlined and only 21 were actually taking concrete steps to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, China, Italy and Venezuela showed up as high-profile
question marks in various studies last year. Paraguay's year 2000
coordinator was quoted last summer saying the country would
experience so many disruptions that its government would have to
declare martial law. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova were seen
as so risky that the State Department issued a travel advisory in
November and nonessential personnel were given home leave over New
Year's.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for the surprisingly quiet rollover? Computer
experts cite several factors. Even the experts may have
underestimated how hard many countries worked in the last few
months, when the problems were better understood, and how much help
they had from others that started early. And in many cases the
assessments about overseas readiness were based on scarce, vague or
arbitrary data.
</P>
<P>
   But the simplest if most embarrassing explanation is that the
same public and private analysts who testified before Congress and
were widely quoted overestimated the world's dependence on computer
technology. Most countries had much less to do to prepare because
they are far less computerized than the United States. The
computers they do have are much less likely to be tied together in
complex systems and are often so old that they run much simpler
software, according to Louis Marcoccio, year 2000 research director
for the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a briefing last week on why Pentagon analysts
overestimated the risks in many countries, Deputy Defense Secretary
John Hamre said, ``If we had a failing, it may be that we
extrapolated to the rest of the world the kind of business
practices that we have developed here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Once adjustments are made for technology dependence, some
analysts say, the investment of the United States and other
pacesetters in year 2000 preparations was not that far out of line
with those that started late. Unfortunately, the figures from many
countries are so unreliable that it is hard to be sure. Russia, for
example, is estimated to have spent anywhere from $200 million to
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccio suspects the lower figures are closest to the truth
but he adds that based on the government's estimate that the United
States spent $100 billion, ``If Russia spent $400 million, they
spent proportionally more than the United States, because the
United States is 300 times more reliant on computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assessments lead down a pathway that only a statistician
could love. Use Gartner's estimate that the United States spent
$150 billion to $225 billion, instead of the government's, and the
comparable Russia investment jumps to a minimum of $500 million.
Tamper with Gartner's guess that the United States is 300 times as
computer-dependent, and figures dance in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly everyone agrees that the figures for the United
States include substantial sums toward preparations in foreign
countries by American multinationals. Motorola said that its $225
million year 2000 budget included not just repairs at its overseas
factories but, for example, helping its Asian suppliers pinpoint
potential year 2000 flaws. It also paid overtime for support that
helped paging and radio networks in Italy function flawlessly over
New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also picked up part of the tab for
foreign nations. To jump-start lagging nations, the government paid
for many of them to send representatives to the first U.N. meeting
on year 2000 in late 1998. It distributed hundreds of thousands of
CDs in 10 languages providing background and suggestions for how to
organize year 2000 projects. More recently, the Defense Department
provided the $8 million needed to set up a joint observation post
in Colorado as an extra layer of insurance against miscommunication
that could lead to missiles' being launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of free consulting from the United States and
agencies like the Inter-American Development Bank,'' said Rodrigo
Martin, a Chilean who headed a regional committee in South America
of national year 2000 coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   Such aid played a bigger role in helping late starters to catch
up than most people realize, according to some computer experts. As
John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, sees it, hype about the magnitude of the problem did
not mislead as many people as hype about the impossibility of
getting it largely fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a process that could move faster than the
preparedness surveys,'' Koskinen said, noting that alarming press
releases and testimony frequently relied on research that became
out of date within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Del Clark, who led the year 2000 program at Phillips Petroleum,
concurred, saying: ``China was the big question mark for us. Part
of what happened was that they were working hard late in 1999 and
the status information was out of date.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that repair efforts became less expensive toward the
end because of the experience gained by those who did the work
early and the tools developed for them, according to Brian Robbins,
senior vice president in charge of the year 2000 project at Chase.
In addition, Robbins said, it turned out that some countries like
Italy had done more work than reported because leading
multinational companies based there started before a government
agency began collecting data on the country's preparations.

</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the pacesetters were far enough along for a sense to
develop that others were lagging, and fears about the consequences
began building. There were extenuating circumstances in some cases,
like the economic slump in Asia, and many realized the problems
would not be as daunting as in the United States. But with time
running down, industry groups like Global 2000 and a few countries,
including the United States, began trying a variety of tactics from
threats of isolation to subsidies and other inducements to
accelerate year 2000 preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People outside of information technology don't realize how
incredibly mobilized the world became,'' Ms. Parent said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those most familiar with the relative
preparedness and spending levels in many foreign countries wonder
whether it will be possible to figure out why things ended up going
so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Information was always hard to come by and hard to compare since
sources varied so widely in what costs they attributed to year 2000
work. In general, foreign countries have not included labor costs
in their year 2000 figures while the United States and Britain
have, but practices have varied widely, according to Songchun Moon,
a computer science professor at the Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now that year 2000 has arrived, the pressure to sort out such
data is disappearing rapidly. Still, questions about the transition
will not go away. What actually happened might figure in insurance
lawsuits because if courts were to decide insurers were liable for
the money companies spent to avoid problems, the insurers would
undoubtedly cite the success of laggards and low spenders as a sign
that budgets for American companies were needlessly bloated.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, though, comparing preparations and the results
achieved may shed valuable light on cultural differences in how
technology is set up and managed, according to Edward Tenner,
author of ``Why Things Bite Back.'' That in turn could help society
deal with problems like global warming and the proper use of
biotechnology. ``We really need to look at the sociology of
computing in detail,'' he said.

<P>
   Americans spent an estimated record $185 billion this holiday
season, on dolls and games, sneakers, power tools and skateboards.
In effect, they bought brands.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Arnell, the chief creative officer of AG Brand
Consulting, who trademarked the term power-branding, notes, the
7-year-old girl who unwrapped her Millennium Barbie exclaiming,
``It's just what I wanted!'' was unwittingly saying, ``This is the
brand I wanted!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system that allowed Barbie to live is the brand,'' Arnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   That system, which endows products with profound psychological
meaning, is rooted deep in America's history and psyche. In the
19th century, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that citizens of the
young democracy craved badges of personal identity to distinguish
themselves as individuals and to bring order to a society that
lacked formal class distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century , brands were an important part of
American commerce and culture. A number of them, including American
Express traveler's checks, Ivory Soap, Kodak, Lipton and others
still carry instant recognition. It is doubtful, however, that even
the most zealous shill could have foreseen the prominence brands
have assumed in contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   Successful brands work by carving out a niche in our
subconscious _ what advertisers call a ``mind share.'' They do this
by connecting themselves to universal human needs and desires _ for
security, say, or for love, status, power, beauty or even God. A
minister once said to a Coca-Cola bottler, ``I see a strange
connection between your slogan, `The pause that refreshes,' and
Christ's own words, `Come unto me all ye that travail, and I will
refresh you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Spence, owner of the advertising agency GSD&AMP;M in Austin,
Texas, says a brand must be built and portrayed as ``a sacred
promise of what you stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you stand for as a brand is going to be as important as
what you sell,'' he said, ``because everybody's selling the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, one of Spence's clients, promises
``freedom.'' Another client, Fannie Mae, the federal agency that
guarantees home loans, promises ``the American dream.'' Wal-Mart
stands for ``trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the product, the goal is always emotional
identification between it and the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At this level of abstraction, ``the brand becomes a nexus for
people for whom fulfilling similar aspirations is a major life
theme,'' according to a recent paper by Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton. That
may mean joining the crowds in Las Vegas at a Coca-Cola fantasy
land, which offers the curious experience of walking inside a
fizzing soda bottle. Or, to cite a Booz Allen example, it might
entail buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and indulging in a
collective Easy Rider fantasy with other Harley owners.
</P>
<P>
   No distinction need be made between people and things. Both are
equally brandable, says Spence. President Clinton, whom he has
advised, has managed to stay in the ``hope business.'' And Sen.
John McCain has a story that Spence thinks might be unbeatable:
``I've been tested under fire, and the fire lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing consumer devotion, however, is becoming increasingly
difficult, as the number of new products inundating the consumer
each year climbs toward 50,000, and as the volume of advertisements
swells to help each one reach its intended audience. Forrester
Research, a market research group, notes that by age 16, the
typical American ``will have seen almost 6 million ads; that's more
than one per waking minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Toronto Star, and author of the
newly published ``No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies''
(Picador), says companies are responding to this clutter by
extending the brand experience itself. ``The power of marketing was
always associative,'' Ms. Klein said. ``Through an ad, something
positive was associated with your product. But branding is now
incarnating those associations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite example is Roots, a Canadian clothing company that
seeks to evoke the happy experiences its founders had at summer
camp. The company built a logo-festooned camp on the western coast
of British Columbia, where grown-up ``campers'' pay hundreds of
dollars a day to experience a luxurious version of their camping
years, swathed in Roots-brand imagery and language. Barnes &AMP; Noble
stores, which self-consciously recreate the ambience of a
19th-century bookshop, attempt to place customers inside the brand,
just as Niketowns try to recreate the feeling of being a high
school athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, says Ms. Klein, all brands use cherished memories to
create commercial cocoons and encourage people to live in them.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the girl with the Barbie doll, Americans begin to
weave those cocoons from an early age, said Alan Manevitz, a
psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital. The Jolly Green
Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy live in the same cozy psychic
space as Santa Claus. ``If you can get a kid at an early age,''
Manevitz said, ``you can imprint a brand on him.''

WELCOME TO THE INTERNET, THE FIRST GLOBAL COLONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Pangaea. It was the Earth's great
land mass, the mother of all seven continents, which broke up 240
million years ago as Earth's tectonic plates moved apart. That was
the last global continent, until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the new one, a cyber-Pangaea. But unlike the
original, this global realm is not really stateless. In many
respects, it is U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing is that many of the pioneering breakthroughs of
the Internet came from abroad, especially Europe. The World Wide
Web, for example, was created by an Oxford-educated physicist, Tim
Berners-Lee, while working in the shadow of the Swiss Alps at the
CERN physics laboratory outside Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But Berners-Lee, like so many emigrant technologists, soon
departed for the more fertile soil of America, where the
innovations of the Internet have flourished remarkably. The causes
cited by way of explanation are all ingredients that contribute to
the entrepreneurial climate in the United States _ venture capital
financing, close ties between business and universities, flexible
labor markets, a deregulated business environment, and a culture
that celebrates risk-taking, ambition and getting very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the technology, economics and culture of the
Internet feel awfully American. The companies that have cashed in
on the Internet from newcomers like Amazon.com and Yahoo to the
established technology suppliers like IBM, Sun Microsystems, Cisco
and Microsoft are American. By one estimate, U.S. corporations
collect 85 percent of the revenues from the Internet business and
represent 95 percent of the stock market value of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   English is the dominant language of the Internet, found on most
Web sites and used in most e-mail. Perhaps most important, the
culture of the Net tends to be informal and individualistic,
decentralized and hard to control. This makes it the preferred
medium of dissident groups in countries around the world, and it
also makes it feel just like home to American net surfers. ``The
Internet is profoundly disrespectful of tradition, established
order and hierarchy, and that is very American,'' observed Fareed
Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the Internet is a transmitter of the kind of
relentless, consumer by consumer competition that can be volatile
and destabilizing. It has the astringent flavor of free-market
economics embraced in America more than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States government had tried to come up with a
scheme to spread its brand of capitalism and its emphasis on
political liberalism around the world, it couldn't have invented a
better model than the Internet,'' said Don Heath, president of the
Internet Society, an international organization.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the values of the United States nor its faith in their
universal applicability are universally welcome, however, and the
same may be said of the Internet. France and Germany, among other
nations, are concerned that the Internet economy may prove
impossible for nations to regulate, and create such vast inequality
and rootlessness among its citizens that they will lose their sense
of social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people understand the Internet is a technolotform, not some form of American imperialism,'' noted Gerhard
Schulmeyer, who heads the U.S. arm of the big German company
Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Internet moves rapidly and is a disruptive technology
that threatens institutions of all kinds, companies and trade
unions, so it has added to the sense in Europe that people's backs
are to the wall,'' Schulmeyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of America's influence on the world, the Internet lies
in the arena of what Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government terms ``soft power.'' It's like rock
'n' roll or American movies, which earn lots of money, to be sure,
but mainly influence other nations by offering an irresistible
alternative culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite America's early Internet lead, the Web is a vast
expanse, accommodating significant national and linguistic
differences. ``There is a lot more diversity on the Internet than
just looking at the English-language Web pages might suggest, and
it's getting more diverse all the time,'' said Esther Dyson, editor
of Release 1.0, a newsletter that focuses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is diversity, too, in how people believe the Internet
should be allowed to function. Europe, in particular, has offered
plenty of resistance to the U.S. self-regulatory approach for
handling personal data on the Internet. The Europeans believe that
Internet commerce poses a potentially alarming threat to privacy,
and after two years of negotiation, the two sides have been unable
to reach agreement on common principles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, calls the Internet privacy talks represent a ``new-era
trade dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly half of the global online population resides in
the United States. Forty four percent of Americans have Internet
access at home or at work, more than double the percentages in
Germany and Britain, according to Jupiter Communications. Only a
few Scandinavian countries, notably Sweden, approach the American
level of Internet access, the research firm reports.
</P>
<P>
   This edge in Internet use is expected to decline steadily as
other countries, especially Europe and Japan, close the gap. And
some industry executives believe Europe could quickly catch,
perhaps even surpass America, in Internet technology as the world
moves beyond the personal computer as the primary device for
cruising the Net. In the coming ``post-PC era,'' they say, people
will increasingly use wireless devices like ``smart'' cell phones
for e-mail, shopping and information services over the Internet.
European companies like Nokia hold the global lead in the cell
phone market largely because they rallied around a unified European
technology standard, known as GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications), while U.S. companies competed with a handful of
incompatible standards.
</P>
<P>
   But it is culture _ not raw technology alone _ that will
determine whether the United States retains its status as the
pre-eminent Internet nation. David Braunschvig, a managing director
of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., is optimistic about Europe and he insists
``there is no logical reason why the U.S. should have this de facto
monopoly on Internet innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunschvig, whose doctorate in computer science is from the
University of Paris, says he tells his friends at dinner parties in
France that all Europe with its 350 million people really needs to
produce is 30 or 40 entrepreneurs like Marc Andreessen, who left
college to co-found Netscape, the Internet browser pioneer. ``My
European friends say, Of course, we've produced such people, but
they have moved to America,'' said Braunschvig, who lives in New
York.

<P>
   In the beginning, there was Pangaea. It was the Earth's great
land mass, the mother of all seven continents, which broke up 240
million years ago as Earth's tectonic plates moved apart. That was
the last global continent, until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the new one, a cyber-Pangaea. But unlike the
original, this global realm is not really stateless. In many
respects, it is U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing is that many of the pioneering breakthroughs of
the Internet came from abroad, especially Europe. The World Wide
Web, for example, was created by an Oxford-educated physicist, Tim
Berners-Lee, while working in the shadow of the Swiss Alps at the
CERN physics laboratory outside Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But Berners-Lee, like so many emigrant technologists, soon
departed for the more fertile soil of America, where the
innovations of the Internet have flourished remarkably. The causes
cited by way of explanation are all ingredients that contribute to
the entrepreneurial climate in the United States _ venture capital
financing, close ties between business and universities, flexible
labor markets, a deregulated business environment, and a culture
that celebrates risk-taking, ambition and getting very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the technology, economics and culture of the
Internet feel awfully American. The companies that have cashed in
on the Internet from newcomers like Amazon.com and Yahoo to the
established technology suppliers like IBM, Sun Microsystems, Cisco
and Microsoft are American. By one estimate, U.S. corporations
collect 85 percent of the revenues from the Internet business and
represent 95 percent of the stock market value of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   English is the dominant language of the Internet, found on most
Web sites and used in most e-mail. Perhaps most important, the
culture of the Net tends to be informal and individualistic,
decentralized and hard to control. This makes it the preferred
medium of dissident groups in countries around the world, and it
also makes it feel just like home to American net surfers. ``The
Internet is profoundly disrespectful of tradition, established
order and hierarchy, and that is very American,'' observed Fareed
Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the Internet is a transmitter of the kind of
relentless, consumer by consumer competition that can be volatile
and destabilizing. It has the astringent flavor of free-market
economics embraced in America more than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States government had tried to come up with a
scheme to spread its brand of capitalism and its emphasis on
political liberalism around the world, it couldn't have invented a
better model than the Internet,'' said Don Heath, president of the
Internet Society, an international organization.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the values of the United States nor its faith in their
universal applicability are universally welcome, however, and the
same may be said of the Internet. France and Germany, among other
nations, are concerned that the Internet economy may prove
impossible for nations to regulate, and create such vast inequality
and rootlessness among its citizens that they will lose their sense
of social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people understand the Internet is a technology
platform, not some form of American imperialism,'' noted Gerhard
Schulmeyer, who heads the U.S. arm of the big German company
Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Internet moves rapidly and is a disruptive technology
that threatens institutions of all kinds, companies and trade
unions, so it has added to the sense in Europe that people's backs
are to the wall,'' Schulmeyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of America's influence on the world, the Internet lies
in the arena of what Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government terms ``soft power.'' It's like rock
'n' roll or American movies, which earn lots of money, to be sure,
but mainly influence other nations by offering an irresistible

ANALYSIS: YELTSIN'S BUNGLED VISION LEAVES RUSSIA CHANGED, THOUGH
TROUBLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ This grand nation boasts a 1,100-year lineage of
autocrats, from Ivan the Terrible to Peter the Great; from Aleksei
the Quietest One to Uncle Joe Stalin. So the question arises: what
to call its first democratic leader, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin?
</P>
<P>
   Boris the Liberator? True, he ended more than a millennium of
dictatorship. But Russian democracy, such as it is, clings to a
slim reed. Boris the Beneficent? Yeltsin did bestow the blessings
of capitalism, which has created a new Russian middle class. But
his policies also plunged millions into poverty far more grinding
than most any American has known.
</P>
<P>
   Boris the Peacemaker? Only with the West; the horrors of
Chechnya are even now being relived. How about Honest Boris? Few
perceive him as downright corrupt; unfortunately, Russian
government under his rule was a more-or-less open kleptocracy.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Granted a decade on the world's main stage,
Yeltsin, 68, played it to the hilt, switching strategies, seizing
moments and confounding enemies up to his unexpected resignation on
New Year's Eve. That he will go down as one of Russia's historic
figures, along with Peter, Ivan and even Vladimir Lenin, is beyond
question.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike them, Yeltsin defies pigeonholing. He was a brilliant
politician and, perhaps, a lousy president. He put down a Communist
revolt in 1993 in the most tyrannical of ways, shelling his own
Parliament. But he never tried to stifle communism itself, however
much he detested it; that would have been undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Communists have already banned themselves,'' he
said in an interview last June. ``They are political failures.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a vision of a Russia that would never persecute innocents
the way his own father was persecuted by Stalin. In his country's
bleakest hour, at the depths of a KGB-led coup against the Soviet
reformer Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1991, that vision led him to climb
atop an armored troop carrier outside his besieged office and,
armed only with an idea, bring an empire to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin seldom had trouble with the big picture. It was the
pointillism of policies and laws and bureaucracy that seemed not
just to elude him, but to leave him dazed _ or bored, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He ran through six prime ministers and uncounted deputies,
trying to find someone who could turn his dreams into bricks and
mortar. In his chosen successor, Vladimir V. Putin, he may have
found someone close _ a self-professed democrat with policy skills
and a Yeltsin-like fondness for the strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, the price he paid for the years of searching.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a vision was crucial,'' said Robert Legvold, a
Columbia University political scientist and Russia scholar.
``Without it, there would have been disaster. But to have a vision
without the ability to implement it is the source of all the
problems they have now.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems frequently seem to overwhelm the good in Yeltsin's
legacy. From its pinnacle as an empire that put the first man in
space and built now-outmoded industry at a dizzying pace, Russia
has taken a terrifying fall: the gross domestic product has been
halved, the average life span has fallen 2.5 years, the birthrate
has dropped by one-third, and the mortality rate has risen by
one-quarter _ all just since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's once-fearsome army now sends soldiers out to forage for
mushrooms because there is no money for food. At $33 billion, total
spending in the 2000 federal budget is less than what Kmart Corp.
took in from U.S. shoppers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, while down from the quadruple-digit rate of the early
1990s, is expected to exceed 30 percent this year. Almost a third
of the nation scrapes by beneath the official subsistence level _
and the subsistence level is a bare $36 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this wreckage, though not all of it, can be laid at
Yeltsin's feet. Blessed with enormous political momentum after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin still failed to get
Parliament to pass the basic legislation _ land reform, financial
regulation, commercial law _ that underpins a capitalist society.
</P>
<P>
   And, in common with leaders of some of the other post-Communist
societies, the president let the government fall under the sway of
cronies, political supporters and palm-greasers who frequently put
the people's interest behind their own.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's decision to privatize state industries swiftly through
a now-infamous voucher program designed by American economists
proved an invitation to corruption. Ordinary Russians had no idea
what to do with stock certificates, much less how to participate in
corporate governance. Entire companies and even industries were
snapped up and their assets looted by crooked factory managers,
mobsters and tycoons; workers were left holding the empty bag.
</P>
<P>
   The government has fared little better than industry. Internal
corruption and political horse-trading caused billions to be
squandered on Kremlin renovations and marble-slathered ministry
buildings while pensions and teachers' salaries went unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Favoritism is endemic: it is hard to envision another major
nation selling its oil fields at cut-rate prices to political
supporters, for example, or calmly allowing the state-run railroad
to funnel its freight through a Swiss forwarder tied to the son of
the former railways minister.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such unending corruption has not just sapped the government of
money and manpower, it has all but destroyed public confidence in
the Yeltsin government and blackened his family name. Why Yeltsin
has so stoically accepted it is one of the great mysteries of his
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the reform-minded leader of the Yabloko
party, once recalled giving Yeltsin an urgent warning about
bureaucratic thievery, only to be greeted with a sigh and a shrug.
``Grigory Alekseyevich,'' Yeltsin is said to have replied, ``What
do you expect? Russia has always been corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to heap the blame for these crushing failures on
Yeltsin, and to his credit, he has shouldered it. In his emotional
farewell speech on Dec. 31, he asked forgiveness from those who
thought independence would produce overnight pie-in-the-sky, adding
a bit ruefully, ``I myself believed in this _ that we could
overcome everything in one spurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, however, Russia today seems permanently and
irremediably a capitalist state _ flawed and not wholly privatized,
maybe, but with a growing base of small businesses, a rudimentary
banking system and a currency in which the people have a modicum of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year's disastrous economic collapse, which wiped out
many Russians' savings for the second time in a decade, has proved
something of a blessing by dragging the ruble down to a realistic
value, making exports too expensive for most people and thus
sparking a real revival in domestic production. Russia's economy
actually grew last year, and is poised to grow again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners are quick to attack the theft, ineptitude and
backsliding that have marked every step of Yeltsin's reign. But in
retrospect, neither they nor Yeltsin may have appreciated the
enormous cultural gulf between his Russian heritage and the Western
ideals he sought to graft onto his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a land that had never known a free vote or a
civil-servant bureaucracy. Or, for that matter, a competitive bid.
Yeltsin, after all, was not Jefferson or Locke, but a party
apparatchik from Sverdlovsk, a hard-line Communist who once oversaw
the order to bulldoze the house where Czar Nicholas II and his
family were massacred decades before at Lenin's behest.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's coming of age is all the more heroic for that. A
peasant construction worker from the Ural Mountains, he was a
latecomer to the Communist bureaucracy, at 30. But he quickly rose
to become the Sverdlovsk party leader on the strength of his
personality and no-nonsense approach.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that he was unaware of the inhumanity of the
system for which he worked. When Yeltsin was but 3, in 1934,
Stalin's enforcers sent his father, Nikolai Ignatievich, to a labor
camp simply for being a kulak _ a landowning peasant.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 autobiography, ``The Struggle for Russia,'' Yeltsin
wrote that he came to know the details of his father's persecution
_ the pettiness of the charges against him, the identities of his
accusers _ only after coming to power in Moscow and examining the
Cheka files on the case.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Owned, owned, owned.' That was why he was guilty _ he had
worked a lot and taken responsibility on himself,'' Yeltsin wrote.
``Did the Chekists' machinery really gobble up people so
senselessly? Perhaps my life would have taken a different turn had
I been able to see my father's file earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Gorbachev, a smoother and more outwardly ambitious man,
dragooned him to run the city of Moscow in 1985, Yeltsin was an
instant hit _ an opinionated, straightforward breath of fresh air
who actually seemed to listen to citizens' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev quickly came to see him in another light, that of a
rough-edged blowhard who wanted his job. In 1987, Yeltsin was
removed from atop the Moscow Communist apparatus _ a political
death sentence _ after criticizing the snail's pace of Gorbachev's
reforms. Soon afterward he was hospitalized because of the first of
a series of heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not give up. Over Gorbachev's objections, he landed a
seat in Russia's Parliament, then became its chairman. In 1990, he
quit the Communist Party. In 1991, he overwhelmingly won election
as president of Russia, then still a Soviet republic. Three months
later, when the KGB started a putsch against an increasingly
vacillating Gorbachev, Yeltsin grabbed the reins of the democratic
movement, leading a genuinely popular revolution.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Gorbachev had resigned, the Soviet Union
was demolished, and Yeltsin and leaders of other major Soviet
republics had agreed to go their separate ways. It was the greatest
peaceful revolution of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's instincts, toward individual liberty and market
capitalism, were certainly right by Western standards. It is his
execution that has been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He has shown undue enthusiasm for manipulating the news media
and spending wads of illicit cash to ensure his side's electoral
victories _ not just in December's parliamentary elections, but in
1996 when his own re-election was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   He is roundly condemned for putting down the 1993 Communist
uprising by shelling the very Parliament where his appearance atop
an armored vehicle had peacefully defused a coup. More than 150
people died in the ensuing battle.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Yeltsin was in the fight of his life, moving against
coup plotters who already had called for a military revolt and for
his arrest _ and who seemed perilously close to accomplishing both.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation has never quite recovered among average
Russians, whose tolerance for political upheaval already was long
past the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Some others, however, see his excesses as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an autocrat who forced himself to be a democrat,'' said
Edvard S. Radzinsky, a Russian historian and chronicler of the
Romanov dynasty. ``Even when he destroyed the Parliament at the
White House and had the right to arrest many people for life, he
didn't do it. He understood that he had to set an example.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a curious way, Yeltsin's failings are his asset. A true czar
might have yanked Russia out of Communism and into a capitalist
economy more cleanly, but without freedom. A purer democrat would
have succumbed to the 1993 coup that Yeltsin so decisively
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, a czar with a democratic heart, made a mess of the
process from start to finish. And a decade into independence, his
nation is bloodied, bereft, penniless, sick _ and still, by
somewhat generous standards, free, for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history is both cursed and magnificent,'' Yeltsin wrote in
his autobiography. ``It is fitting that in Russia the tragedies,
these contradictory strands of history, are so tightly woven
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Stalin. But he could as easily have been
writing about the Russia created by Boris the Bold _ and about
himself.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet was supposed to be
a global medium and a stateless realm, a kind of cyber-Pangaea. But
its innovations have flourished primarily in the United States. The
generally cited reasons include America's entrepreneurial climate _
venture capital financing, close ties between business and
universities, flexible labor markets, a deregulated business
environment, and a culture that celebrates risk-taking, ambition
and getting rich. By Steve Lohr. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In some ways, comparison
between the 1978 Camp David talks and the current talks in
Shepherdstown is unfair. Camp David _ 12 excruciatingly long days
in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat hammered out
a framework of peace _ was the climax of a process. Shepherdstown,
where bilateral contact has been limited to clipped utterances, is
an opening scene. But the comparisons and contrasts are inevitable,
because parallels are so explicit. By Deborah Sontag. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER-RACISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is making racist or xenophobic
remarks a sign of mental illness? Major League Baseball seemed to
suggest it was last week when it demanded that John Rocker undergo
psychological testing following his rantings about immigrants and
blacks. But the consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is
that racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless
combined with a host of other problems. If it were, then a huge
swath of society would be considered mentally ill. By James C.
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL-COACHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The history of the rising
power and prestige of football coaches. In the early years, coaches
were not venerated figures; in fact, players sometimes ejected them
from the field when they became too dictatorial. Today, a top coach
like Bill Parcells _ who turned three losing franchises into
winners _ has achieved the superstar free-agent status that team
owners have succeeded in denying the players. By Allan Barra. (Also
moved in `s' category as FBN-COACHES-REVIEW)
</P>
<P>
   ATTICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why rehash the bloody Attica prison
uprising of 1971 almost 29 years later? Because its demons have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same. They were back last week when a
federal judge announced a settlement that may at last bring
finality to Attica's painful aftermath. By Clyde Haberman. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-MEDICAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ No law forces candidates
to bare their medical histories. But the news media and political
rivals press for revelations, hinting that those who decline may
have something to hide. Some people maintain that the public
interest demands that the usual right to confidentiality be waived.
Others question whether the public needs, wants or has the right to
such information and whether it serves a legitimate purpose. By

   DEATH-PENALTY-REVIEW (Houston) _ The thought of Texas as a
national role model for capital punishment is enough to make death
penalty opponents shudder, but at least a few places regard the
state worth emulating. Yet whether this suggests a growing national
appetite for more executions, carried out more quickly with fewer
appeals, is unclear. A national review of capital punishment last
year reveals several conflicting signals. By Jim Yardley.

<P>
   BRAND-NAMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In today's cluttered and
confounding marketplace, brand identification has never been more
important. The topic is ultra-hip, both in the realms of style and
business. But ``branding'' is easier said than done. By Douglas
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND-CLAIMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if Dominos or Chevrolet had
to prove that their advertising slogans are true? Pizza Hut was
recently awarded damages from Papa Johns for the latter's claim
that its pizza was ``better.'' By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ British poet laureate Andrew
Motion recently created a stir when he proclaimed Bob Dylan's
``Visions of Johanna'' the best song lyric ever written. A look at
some of the discussions outlining a peculiarly British fascination
with a peculiarly American performer.

   AFRICA-ISLAM-REVIEW (Gusau, Nigeria) _ A look at the way Islam
must bend in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries, where
it exists alongside Christianity and indigenous traditional
beliefs. In recent years, Sudan's Islamic rulers have grabbed the
West's attention in this region, as Khartoum became a harbor for
anti-American terrorists and a long-running civil war against a
mostly Christian and animist south killed 2 million people. But it
would be wrong to think that Sudan represents the attitude taken by
Muslims elsewhere in Africa. By Norimitsu Onishi.

<P>
   NORWAY-SWEDEN-REVIEW (Oslo) _ Norway and Sweden are both
prosperous, blue-eyed and reserved. On the world stage, they hand
out peace prizes and preach global cooperation while saving their
aggressions, if any, for the ski slope. However, in the privacy of
their snowbound peninsula, Sweden and Norway have lately been
slugging it out. By Walter Gibbs.

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet was supposed to be
a global medium and a stateless realm, a kind of cyber-Pangaea. But
its innovations have flourished primarily in the United States. The
generally cited reasons include America's entrepreneurial climate _
venture capital financing, close ties between business and
universities, flexible labor markets, a deregulated business
environment, and a culture that celebrates risk-taking, ambition
and getting rich. By Steve Lohr. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In some ways, comparison
between the 1978 Camp David talks and the current talks in
Shepherdstown is unfair. Camp David _ 12 excruciatingly long days
in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat hammered out
a framework of peace _ was the climax of a process. Shepherdstown,
where bilateral contact has been limited to clipped utterances, is
an opening scene. But the comparisons and contrasts are inevitable,
because parallels are so explicit. By Deborah Sontag. (Moved in `i'

   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER-RACISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is making racist or xenophobic
remarks a sign of mental illness? Major League Baseball seemed to
suggest it was last week when it demanded that John Rocker undergo
psychological testing following his rantings about immigrants and
blacks. But the consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is
that racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless
combined with a host of other problems. If it were, then a huge
swath of society would be considered mentally ill. By James C.
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL-COACHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The history of the rising
power and prestige of football coaches. In the early years, coaches
were not venerated figures; in fact, players sometimes ejected them
from the field when they became too dictatorial. Today, a top coach
like Bill Parcells _ who turned three losing franchises into
winners _ has achieved the superstar free-agent status that team
owners have succeeded in denying the players. By Allan Barra. (Also
moved in `s' category as FBN-COACHES-REVIEW)
</P>
<P>
   ATTICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why rehash the bloody Attica prison
uprising of 1971 almost 29 years later? Because its demons have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same. They were back last week when a
federal judge announced a settlement that may at last bring
finality to Attica's painful aftermath. By Clyde Haberman. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-MEDICAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ No law forces candidates
to bare their medical histories. But the news media and political
rivals press for revelations, hinting that those who decline may
have something to hide. Some people maintain that the public
interest demands that the usual right to confidentiality be waived.
Others question whether the public needs, wants or has the right to
such information and whether it serves a legitimate purpose. By

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norma Castro felt almost as if she were part
of a new country 10 years ago, when her home state of Baja
California led Mexico into a new era by voting out the corrupt
machine that had dominated its politics for six decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought things were going to change for real,'' recalled
Mrs. Castro, a homemaker. ``We thought that if we gave them a
chance _ another government, another party _ maybe they would do
something about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a decade of reform-minded opposition government, the
waves of drug-related crime that have coincided with more
democratic politics are eroding the faith of Mrs. Castro and her
neighbors that any government can improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe anymore,'' Mrs. Castro said, describing
how the lines at her neighborhood polling place have grown shorter
each year. ``They figure, `What's the point of voting if nothing is
going to change?'''
</P>
<P>
   After years in which Mexicans held to the belief that drugs like
cocaine were a problem that merely passed through their country on
their way to places like Los Angeles and New York, the illicit
trade here has begun to profoundly affect people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Street crime, fed by an explosion of drug abuse, has risen
exponentially. With the police overwhelmed by drug-related killings
and the courts awash in traffickers' bribes, crimes almost unheard
of not long ago _ kidnappings, bank robberies, drive-by shootings _
are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   For people without the means to hire lawyers or bribe judges,
justice has grown steadily more elusive as the system has buckled.
Corrupt police officers are fired by the score; illegal gun
ownership and private security businesses are booming just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Polls that once showed citizens concerned with street lights and
sewer lines now register public safety far ahead of all other
concerns. At the same time, voter participation rates at record
highs in the early 1990s have quickly given way to some of the
highest abstention levels in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main source of support for the opposition was its promise
to fight crime and corruption, and people no longer believe in
that,'' said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, a leftist politician who was
Baja California's first independent human rights ombudsman. ``There
is a cost to the democracy in that disillusionment. People don't
think anyone can solve their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an article of reformist faith in Mexico that free
political choice would be the ultimate solution to corruption and
injustice. With the end of fraudulent elections and authoritarian
rule, the thinking went, leaders would be accountable to the voters
rather than to the system of patronage and payoffs built by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Baja California, things have not gone according to
that plan. While public administration has generally improved under
the National Action Party (known as the PAN, its Spanish acronym),
violence, crime and corruption have redrawn the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   PAN officials move ``emergency'' police trailers from one
neighborhood to another, cutting ribbons each time, but never
leaving the units in place long enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Like the former Communists of Eastern Europe, some local leaders
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (known by its Spanish
acronym as the PRI) have all but embraced its authoritarian past,
hoping for a comeback by harking back to days when the criminals
with whom they colluded were at least under some control.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of trafficking is disproportionate in Baja
California. The state has long been a conduit into the United
States for cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin; it is
also the base of the Arellano Felix brothers' mafia, arguably the
most violent Mexico has known.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of democratic politics and the drug trade, two of
the defining forces of contemporary Mexico, has also posed a
conflict that bears special attention as the country readies for
the most competitive presidential election of its modern history,
which is to take place this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the politicians of Baja California and a few other
crime-ravaged states governed by the opposition, the major
candidates in the presidential race all cite the collapsing justice
system as a crucial issue in the country's future. They have said
little, however, to sustain faith in the power of free political
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows now that the government cannot stop the
criminals here,'' said Armando Gutierrez, a Tijuana radio announcer
whose son, Hodin, a crusading state prosecutor, was killed by
gunmen thought to be working for the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just wish that they would come clean _ say they are afraid
or they are taking payoffs or they don't know what to do,''
Gutierrez went on. ``They tried to pretend this wasn't happening,
and when they finally looked around, it was too late. The criminals
were on top of them.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE LEADERS: Success in Theory, Failure in Practice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the PAN swept into the statehouse in 1989, it appeared that
the young businessman who became governor, Ernesto Ruffo, could not
have chosen an easier act to follow. The last PRI governor had been
forced to resign by his own party as a series of corruption
scandals came to light.
</P>
<P>
   In the drug underworld, Baja California had been a province in
the empire of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, a former policeman whose
ability to befriend public officials helped him to become the
country's most powerful trafficker. By the time Felix was arrested
in 1989, though, the state was becoming a haven for his much more
confrontational second cousins, the six Arellano Felix brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In one of several interviews, Ruffo recalled thinking that the
solution to the state's corruption problem would be a
straightforward matter of designing systems in which it could not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Since criminal suspects could have their court files ``lost''
for a small fee, the new government installed computers and
instructed prosecutors to store their records there. Within weeks,
the computer network was besieged by mysterious hackers and power
outages; records vanished just the same.
</P>
<P>
   The new state government did not shy from firing some of the
more notorious officers of the state police, who often moved on to
jobs in other forces or with the traffickers themselves. The
problem it had was replacing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing was,'' recalled one former state police official,
``there were no prosecutors who came from the PAN. There were no
comandantes from the PAN. `Ruffo's police' were the same ones who
had been there before.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the problem necessarily solved by new recruits. As
recently as this spring, almost a third of the entering class at
the state police academy were found to have lied on their
applications, state officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very careful whom you choose and how you train
them,'' one senior police official said, without irony. ``Each one
is a potential criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, as the Arellanos began to solidify their
control of the Tijuana underworld, state officials had little
understanding that Mexico's biggest traffickers were growing
significantly richer and more defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Successful U.S. interdiction efforts in the Caribbean were
forcing as much as three-fourths of the cocaine flow through
Mexico. Its smugglers, who had usually been paid in cash to
transport drug loads for South American producers, began taking
their cut in kind. As the Mexicans expanded their own wholesale
business in the United States, their earnings shot up dramatically,
and the bribes they paid to Mexican officials rose apace.
</P>
<P>
   Under the PRI, drug mafias had generally secured the
government's tolerance by dealing in part with senior officials or
their emissaries. With fewer government leaders willing to take
their money, former officials said, traffickers focused on key
positions throughout the criminal-justice apparatus: the district
court, the attorney general's security detail, the state police
homicide squad (to cover up killings), and the car-theft unit (to
supply stolen cars).
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, according to Mexican officials and two Mexican
intelligence reports, the Arellanos made long-term alliances with
up-and-coming police officials and politicians, helping move them
into powerful posts. Not everyone was bought off, officials said,
but in an atmosphere of pervasive fear, not everyone needed to be.
</P>
<P>
   One former state law-enforcement official, who sat in a
cavernous, empty restaurant whispering about his dealings with the
Arellanos' emissaries, said it became irrelevant whether he and his
colleagues took the money. Whenever they turned down satchelsful of
cash, they were also careful to say they had no intention of
getting in the traffickers' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal cops come and go from Mexico City,'' the former
official said, ``But I have to live here when the job ends. You
don't have the power to really do anything, so why get yourself
killed? One must not get tangled in the feet of a galloping
horse.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SYSTEM: Long on Water, Short on Safety
</P>
<P>
   Baja California never had a particularly effective criminal
justice apparatus. But evidence including crime statistics and
opinion polls suggests that the system began to break down more
seriously after 1993, as the traffickers became more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   PAN officials were generally making life more efficient. Water
delivery was improved, electrical service extended. There was no
such progress, however, when it came to the administration of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Local news organizations, most still in the hands of businessmen
loyal to the PRI, cast Ruffo's aides as corrupt cousins of their
governing-party predecessors. The governor generally blamed the
federal authorities, who have jurisdiction over drug crimes, and
was often slow to clean house when significant accusations emerged
against some of his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Even when officials did stand up to the drug mafias, the
prevailing sense of the traffickers' impunity was more likely to be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   With small-time drug peddlers spreading across Tijuana, for
instance, the city police chief, Federico Benitez, began sending
officers after them. When a corrupt young federal police commander
dropped by to offer him a huge monthly stipend to end the patrols,
Benitez abruptly ended the meeting, former officials who worked
with him said.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy did not last. On April 24, 1994, Benitez was shot
to death as he drove through the city. The aftermath was as
striking as the killing: the federal commander was charged with it
but never arrested, meeting unabashedly with reporters to proclaim
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months before Benitez's death, a federal police
commander who had been battling the traffickers was gunned down on
a busy Tijuana street by state police officers working as
bodyguards for one of the Arellanos. Three weeks after that, the
PRI presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was assassinated
in Tijuana in a crime that has never been solved.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of drug-related killings quickened again in 1996, and
the epidemic began to create a whole new zone of criminal impunity.
If a body turned up bearing gunshot wounds or signs of torture,
officials said, even honest homicide detectives generally moved on
to the next case on the presumption that this one probably could
not be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Former state police officials and prosecutors said that as the
traffickers began to operate more freely, so too did the other
organized-crime groups in the state: car thieves, immigrant
smugglers, kidnappers, bank robbers. The proliferation of
trafficking groups under the Arellanos' lordship also led to
greater distribution of drugs on the Mexican side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   One former state attorney general, Jose Luis Anaya Bautista,
said the state justice system was effectively overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have jurisdiction to investigate these crimes,'' he
said, ``but they had very serious effects on the state. The
trafficking creates more and more addicts. And as the number of
addicts increases, so do the burglaries, the robberies, the car
thefts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state of more than 3 million people, the investigative
police force numbered about 650 officers and staff members. ``If
you take away the sick guys, the old guys and the guys on vacation,
that leaves you maybe 500,'' Anaya noted. Several current and
former officials said they guessed that 150 to 200 of those
officers received some money from the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Anaya was himself publicly accused of collaborating with the
Arellanos by two of the traffickers' former associates. He denied
the claims and was never charged, but was forced to resign in late
1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the state's crime statistics are shoddy, incomplete and
generally not made public, several sets obtained by a reporter
suggest that virtually all major crimes began rising sharply in
1994. While a severe economic crisis was fueling crime rates
throughout Mexico during that period, Baja California generally
maintained the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In one newspaper-sponsored poll Tijuana, 50 percent of those
queried said they would not report being victimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get robbed and you make a complaint,'' said the head of
the Chamber of Commerce, Arturo Gonzalez Cruz, ``you will spend six
or seven hours waiting to report it. They will assign detectives,
but the detectives will never show up. Because nobody ever
investigates anything.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TRADE: More Addicts, More Killings
</P>
<P>
   The wider impact of the drug trade has rarely been obvious in
Baja California. Cities like Tijuana and Mexicali brim with new
businesses, and the worst of the fear generated by drug-related
crime tends to concentrate in poor suburbs not seen by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the makeshift drug treatment centers that have popped up
across the state, addicts pack into the sorts of tiny cells that
might house migrant laborers or prisoners, which many of them have
been. The difference: the addicts must plead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The centers are all full, the head of one treatment network,
Miguel Angel Marroquin, said. ``And you can ask anyone _ nobody
would say that we are reaching even 1 percent of the addicts out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clients are users of cocaine or crack, which became
more widely available in Mexico as smugglers shifted to payment in
kind for the drugs they transport. Social workers say more of the
addicts are heroin and methamphetamine users, who have watched the
price of their drugs fall even as the purity has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave your house for the day and these kids will strip it
clean,'' Hortensia Ortiz, a shopkeeper in the Morita neighborhood,
said as a scrum of youths with shaven heads and baggy jeans passed
by.
</P>
<P>
   Across a dirt road, two police officers were draped over plastic
folding chairs in the back of a trailer that had recently been
trucked into the neighborhood. A desktop computer sat unused beside
them.
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks, the officers had yet to intercede in any crimes,
said people in the neighborhood, but Mrs. Ortiz's husband was
leading a petition drive to persuade the authorities to leave the
trailer in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than nothing,'' she and a couple of her customers
explained all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The state governor, Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer, argued in an
interview that crimehad yet to seriously hurt industry or tourism,
engines of the state economy that depend heavily on foreigners'
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez Alcocer has had to establish a rush-hour gantlet of
police protection for Japanese and American plant managers who
commute from the San Diego area to maquiladoras, tax-exempt
assembly plants across the border. Local business people, angered
by what they see as special treatment, are lobbying for their own
state prosecutor to deal with crimes against business.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has been a boon to security companies. Businesses
offering bodyguards, armored cars and alarm systems have
flourished. In a country with strict laws against gun ownership,
shopkeepers have taken to carrying revolvers in their aprons.
</P>
<P>
   Many Baja Californians say the corrosion of the justice system
by drug corruption and violence has also strengthened the
longstanding Mexican perception that justice often depends on one's
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana, for instance, officials endorse what might be called
community policing. Should neighborhoods want their own patroling
officers, all they must do is collect enough for their salaries,
about $428 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   Victims, without private lawyers to press their cases, are often
bested by criminals with better counsel. And since it is no longer
news when a public official is shot to death in broad daylight,
ordinary victims of even the most horrific crimes must sometimes
struggle for any attention at all.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Ibarra was 26, a restaurant cashier making about $70 a
week, when a man who had often eaten at the restaurant attacked her
as she went home. She said the man raped and mutilated her and then
doused her with gasoline, apparently thinking to burn her body,
before leaving her for dead in a shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibarra's nightmare had only begun. After the suspect in her
attack, Jose Juan Paz Diaz, was arrested two weeks later on assault
charges, he posted his $1,000 bail immediately. (The next day he
lunched at her old restaurant.) But with the city in the midst of a
string of killings of police officials, Ms. Ibarra's attack did not
make the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibarra was all but scalped in the attack, and has since
undergone facial surgery 10 times. But despite the brutality of the
crime, her lawyers did not bother to enter her medical reports into
the court file and never sought to have Paz charged with attempted
murder or rape.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that the lawyers hadn't even read the court
file,'' said Minerva Najera, a human rights lawyer who took over
the case after hearing of it from a hardbitten crime reporter who
was appalled to come upon Paz heckling Ms. Ibarra as she testified
before a judge. ``And the fact that the bail was so low, that the
guy was released right away, are clear indications that the
authorities were being paid off from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after protests by women's groups that Ms. Najera had
rallied, Paz was sentenced to seven years. But before she completed
a successful appeal, raising the sentence to 10 years, he fled
Tijuana, apparently to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad to say it, but there are many Veronicas,'' Ms.
Najera said. ``There is a great deal of impunity, and even minimal
amounts of money can keep men like this from facing justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite bursts of outrage, the public response to the violence
has been remarkably quiet. Last year Tijuana authorities began a
pilot program in schools to discourage violence and build
citizenship. But they appear to have a long struggle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Early one recent evening at the downtown headquarters of
Tijuana's Mutual Assistance Association, a member of that civic
group, Jesus Guzman, looked out glumly at a sea of empty folding
chairs. The lecture topic of the day was ``Public Safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' Guzman said. ``Just this year, just
in my extended family, we have had eight cars stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Blancornelas, a Tijuana editor who was ambushed and nearly
killed by Arellano gunmen two years ago after publishing articles
about their activities, described a very limited sense of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a student gets killed, the students march; when a doctor
gets killed, the doctors march,'' he said. ``But that's about it.
There is still a sense that people have that this really doesn't
involve them.''
</P>
<P>
   When community advocates and political analysts compare the
anger expressed in polls to the apathy and cynicism reflected in
local elections, they see the legacy of a one-party state. For
nearly 50 years in Mexico, they note, political participation meant
compulsory attendance at a PRI rally, compulsory membership in a
PRI trade union or maybe pleading with a PRI official for basic
services repeatedly promised.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when new voter identification cards and a registration
drive by Ruffo's government helped galvanize voters in the state,
the turnout for a midterm election was 81 percent. In 1998 it fell
below 50 percent in a vote for mayors and legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Just how drug violence and crime have influenced the voters'
faith in government is mostly a matter of conjecture. But scandals
of drug-related crime and corruption more than anything else have
likened the current political leaders to their predecessors. And
nothing has left the new generation of state and city officials
looking so inept as their struggles with the Arellanos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the crime problem is influencing this process,''
Gonzalez Alcocer said of the abstention rate. ``It is a factor that
is changing peoples' belief in government.''  &QL;

SLOW GOING IN SHEPHERDSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ From hilltops in this pre-Civil War town
where Israel and Syria have negotiated all week, you can just make
out the farm across the Potomac River where Abraham Lincoln met
Gen. George B. McClellan in a tent and complained that he suffered
from ``the slows'' after the battle of Antietam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, traveling here almost daily to deal with a very
different conflict, Bill Clinton found himself struggling to cure
the same affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, his helicopter would land on a college baseball
field, and he would spend hours trying to get Israel's prime
minister, Ehud Barak, and Syria's foreign minister, Farouk
al-Sharaa, to begin hashing out the details of a deal whose rough
outlines have been obvious for years. And day after day he was
confronted by political posturing over what would be discussed
first, and who would be seen to make the first concessions, all
intended to make a convincing show half a world away that neither
side was willing to give in to a longtime enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, are
betting that this is just a phase in the multi-act performance of
peacemaking, and one that may now have run its course.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they handed Barak and al-Sharaa a seven-page
``working paper'' that the United States hopes will become the
basis for what in diplo-speak is called a ``core agreement''
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   It would lay out the rough boundaries of the land Israel will
surrender, 33 years after it seized the Golan Heights in the
Arab-Israeli war, and how the two sides would share scarce water
resources. And it would roughly define the kind of security
guarantees and steps toward normalized relations an ailing
President Hafez Assad of Syria would be willing to grant in return,
a delicate balancing act for a leader who realizes he can no longer
afford economic and diplomatic isolation, but fears that openness
could threaten the iron control over the country he wants to pass
to his son.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected that the talks that began here in this town of
1,300 would be resolved in a week. As the weekend began, diplomats
said that Barak and al-Sharaa would most likely leave on Sunday or
Monday to ponder the ``working paper'' for a few weeks before
resuming talks. And even then, it is still not clear if either side
is prepared to make the psychological and political leap required
for a deal that would give Israel at least a cold peace with its
immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is difficult stuff,'' Clinton said as he headed out to
Shepherdstown one more time last week, canceling other business in
Washington to stick with the talks. ``They are trying to imagine
the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he disappeared into the heavily guarded hotel, and a news
blackout that is intended to force the two reluctant negotiating
teams to go at it until they actually get something done.
</P>
<P>
   But the slowness of last week's progress, and the carefully
orchestrated, quite public delaying tactics, raise the question of
whether the now well-rehearsed technique of locking Israel and its
adversaries in a negotiating arena, cut off from other
distractions, still works as well as it once did.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in an age of cell phones and e-mail, there is no such
thing as real isolation. Each day, the Syrian delegation would call
the Syrian reporters camped out in a school gymnasium a mile away,
the Israeli delegation would call Israeli reporters, and Americans
would hold news conferences describing the day's efforts to keep
the two sides talking. Few details of actual negotiating positions
seeped out, but it is, as one negotiator said, ``a bit early for
strategic leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked, of course, at Camp David in 1978, during
the Israel-Egypt negotiations, and again at the Wye Plantation in
1998, where a framework for peace with the Palestinians was
hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   That model _ holding talks outside of Washington, but close
enough for President Clinton to fly in within 45 minutes to break
logjams _ is the logic of Shepherdstown. But it also seems as if
the negotiators have adapted to their environment and have learned
to resist some of the pressures that arise from talking endlessly
in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea of putting people into castles with moats, or
even small villages, has at best a marginal impact,'' concluded
Richard Haas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who served on
the National Security Council under President Bush. ``Cell phones
and other technology leapfrog the barriers, of course,'' he said.
``And the issues don't get any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he noted, the issues and the negotiating positions
are so well aired that ``you could hold the whole thing in Dupont
Circle,'' just up the road from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the American mediators are still enamored of the Appalachian
approach, convinced that fresh air and no microphones is the only
real treatment for the slows. By design, it makes the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, the only real television
presence _ preventing the most public forms of grandstanding on the
evening news in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   And it showcases Clinton as the mediator, the only man both
sides will really trust, not a bad image for a leader spending his
last year in office seeking a firm niche in history.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insists that technology notwithstanding, moats still work.
``We do believe that developing a format that is isolated, and that
limits disclosure of each side's positions, focuses energy on the
hard job of real decisions,'' he said Friday. ``To do it without
this kind of isolation it is hard to imagine how any decision could
be made before it is preempted by somebody who doesn't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wye precedent,'' he said, ``showed that the
American-designed cocoon can and does work _ even though it won't
always work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are also betting that the Syrians, far more
isolated than most of the large Mideast players and a lot less
media savvy than Yasser Arafat, have yet to learn the art of spin.
And Barak's government, one diplomat involved in the talks said,
``is less public relations oriented'' than the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu, his predecessor. That may come to haunt Barak,
however, when he tries to sell any eventual deal to the Israeli
public, which would have to approve it in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the atmospherics of the talks may prove less
critical than the strategic calculations behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is betting that the moment for peace has arrived because
the political calculus has changed. Barak, unlike his predecessor,
clearly views the value of the Golan's buffer zone as a diminishing
defensive asset. Continuing to hold it promises continued troubles
in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, where he has vowed to withdraw
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   And with the right mix of early-warning systems, a reduced
Syrian troop presence on the border, new American weaponry and an
agreement to begin normalization of relations, Barak, a former
general, apparently believes he can give up the land without
damaging Israeli security. Selling that position to a public that
has come to view the Golan as the key to national survival,
however, is another matter. That is why he has insisted on talking
security first, and the return of the Golan second.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knows that he has little hope of retaking the Golan by
force. His military power is eroding, along with his economy.
Getting the Golan back in his lifetime would cement his place in
history, assuming he can do it on terms that do not undercut his
regime, or his son's succession. That is why he has insisted on
talking about land and water first, security and ``normal
diplomatic relations'' second.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether that logjam _ and with it the slows
_ is now broken. President Lincoln had to fire McClellan to get the
Army of the Potomac moving. That is not one of the choices open to
Clinton, who must take the generals and diplomats he is dealt.

ATTICA SURVIVORS: RECOVERING FROM HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Lavinski is a piano teacher in Rochester, N.Y., who is
partial to Ravel, Chopin and Chick Corea. Arthur Bobby Harrison
volunteers as a boxing coach in downtown Syracuse. George Alexander
Shorts Jr. is a Brooklyn resident who has never been able to work
because of his broken toes.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is that they are all former inmates at
Attica who survived the bloodiest incident in the history of
America's prisons: the uprising and siege of 1971 in which 43
people were killed and more than 80 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal judge proposed a settlement Tuesday that would
give up to 1,281 inmates a total of $8 million as compensation for
the abuse they suffered at the hands of state police 29 years ago,
it thrust the survivors into the public eye as the men behind the
statistics in so many history books, movies and news accounts of
the siege.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many of the survivors seem to support the settlement,
even though they doubt that it will heal any of their wounds from
that era. But they are also undergoing a cathartic process,
pondering the effect of Attica and how their lives have unfolded _
or in some cases unraveled _ in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my best to forget Attica even existed,'' said Shorts, 63,
who was convicted of robbery in 1965 and was released from prison
in 1972 after his toes were broken by state troopers during the
siege. He has lived on welfare and Supplemental Security Income
since. ``My life is kind of hard: I'm in pain 24/7. The settlement?
A few thousand dollars? It will make no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   To plot the lives of these men, most of whom are
African-American and Latino, is to hear stories about broken
families and broken neighborhoods, bad habits and bad choices. Many
grew up in tough neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx,
or Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Some have reassembled their lives with astonishing success,
starting businesses, nurturing families, serving their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard X. Clark, 53, is a Queens native who grew up in foster
homes, attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and
enlisted in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Six months out of the service, Clark was arrested on charges of
attempted robbery and eventually sent to Attica Correctional
Facility, about 30 miles east of Buffalo. Appalled by prison
conditions, he became active with black Muslim political groups and
became one of the leaders of the 1971 siege.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in 1972, he wrote a book, ``Brothers of
Attica'' (1973, Links), moved to Greensboro, N.C., to give his twin
sons a gentler, slower environment, then returned to New York about
10 years ago. He now works as a case manager for Phase Piggy Back,
a Harlem-based organization that provides drug and alcohol
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay your debts to society,'' Clark said. ``A wrong was
committed against us, we paid our debt, they have to pay theirs.
Money cannot make up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New York City resident, Daniel Sheppard, pursued a
different course. After serving five years on charges of robbery
and manslaughter, crimes he insists he did not commit, Sheppard,
now 57, enrolled at Baruch College in the late 1970s to study
accounting and international marketing. He also took up fencing
while at Baruch, becoming highly ranked nationally in epee.
</P>
<P>
   After he quit the sport, partly because of a bad back that he
says started with the beatings at Attica, Sheppard sold latex
rubber gloves wholesale before becoming a stay-at-home father and
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are ashamed of their pasts,'' he said. ``I was
innocent but couldn't prove it. I felt society committed a wrong
against me, so I hold my head up high.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Lavinski, the piano teacher in Rochester. One of
the relatively few white inmates at Attica, he was only 19 when he
was sentenced on a charge of criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in 1972, Lavinski took up a variety of jobs in
upstate New York and Vermont: waiter, piano player, restaurant
owner, painter, remodeler and now piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me real strong,'' Lavinski, 49, said about his
experience at Attica. ``Just the idea of getting arrested and
thrown in jail just freaks me. My freedom, I really treasure
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But other inmates have never successfully returned to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like shells of men,'' said Harrison, 52, the volunteer
boxing coach. ``They reverted to drugs and alcohol and didn't want
to face the reality of dealing with the system, because the system
was the thing that screwed everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Twiggs Mathis, for instance, has struggled with an assortment of
addictions and arrests. A Rochester native, Mathis, 52, was sent to
Attica in 1971 after violating parole for a grand larceny
conviction. He got out the same year, but not before he and
hundreds of other prisoners were forced to crawl naked over broken
glass while at the mercy of club-wielding state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   He has since drifted in and out of prison, on and off cocaine
and marijuana, unable to keep a steady job, unable to afford
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to stay clean and straighten out my life and do
something positive,'' Mathis said. ``The settlement, it could help
me out a lot and get me some peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Eddie Dingle, a Brooklyn native who served almost 10 years
for robbery and homicide, the settlement is ``long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingle, now 55, lives in the Bronx and works as a supervisor at
the Addicts Rehabilitation Center in Harlem. He has come full
circle: just a few years ago, he was a patient at the center,
trying to end a crack cocaine addiction, come to grips with the
memories of Attica and grapple with his earlier failures as a
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to work out stuff with this Attica thing in my
head, and I'm thinking, how am I going to raise these kids?''
Dingle said, adding that his two sons, 34 and 36, have had their
share of drug problems, too. ``I didn't have a chance to raise
them. I tried to smoke myself out of the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who now have jobs and are settled in their
communities have been rattled, somewhat, by the news of the
settlement. A reporter's questions about Attica caused George
Nieves, a social worker who works with AIDS patients at Mount
Vernon Hospital, to begin a long, emotional description of state
troopers' playing Russian roulette with him, all night long, during
the siege.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Nieves, who was in prison for 11 years on a
manslaughter conviction, is suspicious of authority figures and
occasionally afraid that his telephone has been tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mention Attica, a lot of things come back to me, and
I'm not the same person,'' said Nieves, who was homeless for
several years in Manhattan, addicted to drugs and alcohol, before
getting a boost from his second wife, and Clark of Phase Piggy Back
in Harlem. ``But don't mention Attica, and I feel like a new
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the lawyers who negotiated the proposed settlement are
trying to contact as many of the 1,281 eligible men as possible,
either by phone, public notices or mail in time for a Feb. 14
hearing before Judge Michael Telesca of U.S. District Court in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least 400 people are expected to file claims, said
Daniel Meyers, a Manhattan lawyer representing the inmates. Like
several of his colleagues, Meyers has been involved in the Attica
case for most of his career. The lawyers estimate that 400 more may
be dead, though their heirs can file a claim if they meet a series
of legal requirements. About 50 are still in prison, Meyers said.
The rest may either be impossible to locate or simply uninterested
because of the stigma of having been in Attica and a part of the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, especially in white rural communities of New York
state, have said that in no circumstance would they want their
names or stories to be told,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement still remains subject to approval from Judge
Telesca. And some men may present objections to the amount of the
settlement. The judge will determine individual awards, which are
to vary according to the injuries suffered in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   But many inmates seem to believe that the settlement will be as
good an offer as they can get, even though they would have
preferred that the state formally admit wrongdoing for the
troopers' actions in aggressively ending the siege. If that is the
consensus, then the money _ which excludes $4 million in lawyers'
fees _ should be disbursed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys went crazy waiting for this payoff,'' Harrison
said. ``And they're the same guys who said, `I'll have a drink
today, because I'm getting money from the state.' Well, that day
turned into 10 years, then 20 years, then 30 years. And all of a
sudden, 30 years have gone by, you can't stand up, your kidneys are
gone, and you say, `What took 30 years to come to this point?'''

NEWS ANALYSIS: HALT IN ATTACK ON CHECHNYA SERVES SEVERAL PURPOSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ The suspension of Russia's barrage of Grozny
was not, in a sense, much of a surprise, since it made a virtue out
of a military necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir Putin, attending a Christmas service
for the Orthodox in Moscow late Friday, said that the decision to
suspend the bombardment of Grozny, the Chechen capital, was taken
to spare civilians and to honor both the Orthodox feast and a
Muslim holiday this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's explanation differed from that of the military,
suggesting that the halt to the bombardment was at least partly a
matter of packaging and public relations. And far from signaling an
end to Grozny's ordeal, the suspension appears to be a prelude to
an even more furious assault on the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian generals have said they intend to use the moratorium to
rest and reorganize their forces around the besieged capital of
Chechnya for another round of fighting. They have also suggested
that artillery and air raids will be more intense when they are
resumed, and they have warned the tens of thousands of civilians in
Grozny to use the lull to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the suspension was announced, the dense fog
blanketing much of Chechnya compelled the military to slow down its
operations. Russian spotters have found it difficult to direct
artillery strikes, and much of the Russian air force and the fleet
of helicopter gunships have been grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Firepower is essential for the Russian military's strategy to
take the city. It is an important advantage that Russian forces
have over the rebels, and Russian troops are unable to venture deep
into the streets of Grozny without it.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension also serves another purpose. With Russian
casualties on the rise, Russian commanders want to try again to
persuade the unknown number of civilians still left in Grozny to
leave, so that the military's artillery and aircraft can have a
freer hand in pummeling the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Russian military dropped leaflets warning
residents to flee or risk death, with little effect. Many of the
civilians who remain appear to be too old, too weak or too
frightened to try to run the gantlet out of the city. The halt
gives Russian commanders another chance to try to empty out the
city, and leaflets are once again being dropped imploring civilians
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also use this as a short break for our personnel,''
said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the deputy commander of Russian
forces in the North Caucasus region, at the Russian military base
here, just northwest of Chechnya. ``We will regroup, and when we
feel that the civilians have left Grozny, we will inflict a
resolute and final blow against the militants who sit in Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   Using firepower to hold down Russian military casualties is not
only important for the generals. It is also important for Putin,
who is campaigning to become Russia's second president in elections
on March 26. Putin has been the driving force behind the war and
his popularity has soared among many Russians, who welcome a strong
hand and have never had much love for the predominantly Muslim
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The two peoples have a long history of uneasy accommodation or
open conflict, most recently seen in the 1994-96 war, which ended
in heavy losses and humiliation for the Russian army and left
Chechnya's status unresolved and its territory increasingly
lawless.
</P>
<P>
   As the toll of Russian dead and wounded increases, however, this
current war may emerge as more of a political issue. Russia's
independent NTV television station, for example, recently broadcast
the emotional funeral of senior officers of the Yekaterinburg
militia, who were trapped by rebels in the streets of Grozny and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   While the military aims of the suspension seem clear, the
official justifications have varied.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev, who was removed on Friday as commander of Eastern
forces in Chechnya but retains his parallel responsibility as
deputy commander of the Russian army in the North Caucasus, said
the moratorium was needed because tanks of chlorine and ammonia had
exploded, releasing a poisonous cloud of gas in the city. He called
Grozny a ``zone of ecological danger'' and said it was urgent that
civilians flee.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, however, did not cite the environmental hazard when he
confirmed the suspension on Friday night. He said the halt was
ordered because the bad weather had increased the risk that
civilians might be shelled by mistake, and out of respect for
Christmas and the end of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Grozny, remember what day it is now for Orthodox
Christians and tomorrow for Muslims,'' Putin said. ``We will not
forget that, and we will respect the feelings of believers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It remained unclear, however, why Russian forces intend to mark
the religious holidays in the Grozny area while pressing on with
their campaign in the mountainous areas of southern Chechnya _ an
operation less susceptible to the thick fog that hampers air
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian commanders have suspended artillery and air
strikes against Grozny, Russian motorized infantry units have moved
to surround Vedeno, a southern Chechen town and the birthplace of
Shamil Basayev, the rebel commander. No moratorium appears to have
been declared in that region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension does not mean we will not continue military
actions,'' Troshev said. ``They are conducted 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear how long the suspension will last or what the
Russian military will do if the civilians trapped in Grozny again
decide not to risk trying to escape. Several of the few thousand
refugees who took advantage of Russian pleas last month to get out
of Grozny said they were shot at by unidentified gunmen while
making their perilous flight.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the suspension has not altered the
Kremlin's fundamental political or military strategy. The Russian
government is still not interested in negotiating with the
militants or abandoning its plan to subdue Chechnya by force.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking to reporters in Moscow's vast Orthodox
cathedral, where he attended a Christmas service along with other
politicians, said as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aims remain unchanged and they will be achieved,'' Putin
said. ``Have a good holiday.''

DEMOCRATS WORRY THAT GOP WAR CHEST COULD COST THEM THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Ill., Del., Pa.)   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Many prominent Democrats say they are deeply
troubled that the Republican Party is collecting so much more money
than them that it will enjoy an insurmountable financial advantage
_ perhaps enough to cost the Democrats the White House.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats have a recurring fear: that their nominee,
either Al Gore or Bill Bradley, will emerge in late March from the
peak presidential primary season battered, bruised and broke.
</P>
<P>
   And if at that time the Republican National Committee has a big
surplus of unregulated ``soft money'' over the Democratic
counterpart, they say, the Democratic candidate would face a
relentless blizzard of television commercials condemning Democratic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing other Democratic officials, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of
New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, said the Republicans could ``easily have a 3- or
4-to-1'' advantage over Democrats. ``I'd be surprised if we could
put together more than $30 million in soft money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli even speculated that the Republicans could amass $200
million, a figure Republican officials called overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be faced with a situation where in the early spring
the Republicans begin generic advertising with soft money and never
leave the air,'' Torricelli said. ``And the electorate could
conceivably not hear from the Democratic Party until the national
conventions. You could have, literally, months of unanswered
political advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a reversal from four years ago, when President
Clinton's campaign was flush and the Democrats began to broadcast
commercials against Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, a strategy
credited with badly damaging Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The worries about money have stirred some resentment toward
Clinton. Some Democrats complain that the president _ distracted by
his efforts to collect money for his library; the Senate campaign
in New York of his wife, Hillary; his legal defense fund; and his
support for the millennium festivities _ has neglected his own
party. Several Democrats also said that while their committees to
help House and Senate candidates were doing quite well, they feared
that the Republicans' soft money edge would hurt Democrats running
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While there has traditionally been a financial disparity between
Democrats and Republicans, a confluence of circumstances and events
has created a particularly serious dilemma for the Democratic Party
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors expressed qualms about the party's prospects for the
White House. Others said they had been tapped for other causes,
like the president's library. Another factor is disarray in the
party, which has not had a finance chairman for more than three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Democrats, who start the year with less than $2.5
million in the bank, Republican Party officials said they had
already stockpiled roughly $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   This money is separate from the donations to the presidential
candidates, which is strictly regulated. Soft money given to
parties is intended for ``party building'' activities, not
campaigns, but it is used for advertising on issues and therefore
plays a key role in shaping the broad electoral debates.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said there was time for them to catch
up. But none predicted that the party would be at anywhere near
parity with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is a real one,'' said Alan Solomont, a veteran
Democratic fund-raiser who was the national party's finance
chairman in 1997. ``I don't think our fund-raising operation as a
party has really kicked into high gear. Democrats need a little
kick in the behind. The problem is we have a relatively small base
of donors and so much is asked of them. A lot of us are
stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   The public expressions of alarm could be seen as an attempt to
provide just the kind of ``kick'' Solomont mentioned. And the
worriers do not mention another factor, the huge independent
spending campaigns by organized labor, which mainly favors
Democratic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But in weeks of interviewing, nine other well-connected
Democrats _ including officials on Capitol Hill, at the White House
and at the Democratic Party itself _ have all privately admitted
similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A striking demonstration of the Democrats' lack of preparedness
is that at the start of a crucial election year, the post of
finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee has been
vacant since Beth Dozoretz quit more than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they had been unable to persuade big names
in the fund-raising world to take the job full time and instead
last week settled on three people to share the job. They said they
would announce the triumvirates on Monday: Joel Hyatt, an
unsuccessful Senate candidate from Ohio in 1994, who now runs a
business in Silicon Valley; Joe Cari, a lawyer in Chicago; and
Carol Pensky, a former national party treasurer, who will work out
of Democratic headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Those who resisted entreaties to head the finance effort, party
officials said, were David Steiner, a New Jersey financier; Steven
Rattner, deputy chief executive officer of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.; E.
John Rosenwald Jr., vice chairman of Bear Stearns; and James E.
Dimon and the former president of Citigroup. Party officials also
said they tried to court Orin S. Kramer, an investment banker who
worked in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment for party officials was that Terence
R. McAuliffe, the premier Democratic fund-raiser who has turned his
attention to raising money for several of Clinton's projects, as
well as Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, did not want a major
role with the Democratic National Committee. Peter Knight, a major
fund-raiser and confidant of Gore, also was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Magnifying the dilemma for Democrats is the colossal
fund-raising success of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading
Republican contender. His campaign is so flush that the governor
has eschewed federal matching funds, which come with spending
limits, and is now helping the party collect soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its difficulties, the Democratic Party has experienced
significant setbacks in soliciting money for its national
convention in Los Angeles in August. And there has been such a lack
of coordination between the national party and its House and Senate
campaign committees that those committees, for more than a year,
have been holding joint fund-raising efforts on their own instead
of sharing the proceeds with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, the general chairman of the national committee,
conceded that the competition for the Democratic fund-raising pie
had been fierce because Gore and Bradley were hitting up many of
the same donors as Democratic congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough,'' Rendell said. ``We are a little bit the victim
of our own success. There's a finite pool of money and the pie can
be cut only so many ways. But the good news is we don't have to
match them dollar for dollar. We just have to have enough to get
our message across and I am confident we are going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, a former mayor of Philadelphia, chosen by Clinton
because of his reputation as a prodigious fund-raiser, said the
party was better off today than four years ago, when it was several
million dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the party, with the help of appearances by the
president, was embarking on an aggressive drive for money,
especially in smaller cities not usually tapped by the party like
Wilmington, Del., Trenton, N.J., and Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said the party had been distracted by the
battle between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Democratic supporters and major donors are somewhat
preoccupied at the present time by the hand-to-hand combat going on
in the nominating process,'' said Steven Grossman, a former
chairman of the Democratic National Committee and prolific
fund-raiser, ``once that process resolves and we have a nominee, I
believe there will be intense focus'' on raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democratic officials conceded that donors were
reluctant to give because they were worried about the party's
prospects for the White House and did not consider Gore, the
front-runner for the nomination, a particularly electrifying
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant and inspiring fund-raiser of the last
seven or eight years has been Bill Clinton because he painted a
picture of what we could do and he went out and did it,'' Solomont
said. ``He's one of the reasons why Democrats have been generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Burkle, a wealthy donor in California, put it this way in
an interview last winter: ``With Clinton, in 30 seconds I was
connected with him. Gore doesn't connect as easily as Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roger C. Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary in the
Clinton administration, who now runs an investment firm, said that
Democrats should not be worried. ``The Republican side always out
raises the Democratic side,'' he said. ``Unless the disparity is
historically anomalous _ more than 2-and-a-half to 1 _ I don't
think there's anything particularly noteworthy to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torricelli warned that the disparity might be far greater
than that. ``The Democratic Party still has not established a
significant financial base that can always be depended upon,'' he
said. ``The party has succeeded in raising money, but it takes
time, it is not very efficient. The Republican Party has a natural
fund-raising base.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns about lacking soft money may sound odd given that
the two Democratic candidates have both called on Congress to
eliminate such unregulated contributions. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has made campaign reform such an issue that he said he
would reject soft money if he won the Republican nomination;
Bradley said he would do so only if his Republican counterpart made
such a move as well.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats fret, Mel Sembler, the finance chairman of the
Republican National Committee, said his fund-raising efforts were
moving apace, in large part because party donors think the White
House is within easy reach. ``I get the sense that my contributors
feel they're going to win,'' he said.

IN 2 COUNTRIES, 6-YEAR-OLD CUBAN IS POLITICAL SYMBOL

<P>
   MIAMI _ The heated political battle over the custody of the
6-year-old boy Elian Gonzalez showed no signs of subsiding Saturday
after a House Republican leader subpoenaed the boy to testify
before Congress in an effort to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena was announced late Friday night by Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee,
hours after one of Elian's relatives in Miami took the first step
toward becoming the boy's legal guardian. Burton, in his
announcement, said he subpoenaed Elian to testify before his
committee on Feb. 10 so the boy can remain in the country while the
courts consider his case. A Republican committee aide said it was
unclear whether a hearing would even take place next month.
</P>
<P>
   With his Miami family crying tears of joy behind him on Friday
night, Elian waved the subpoena, a wrinkled piece of paper, back
and forth on his front porch. At least in his family's view, the
subpoena was a temporary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will protect him temporarily, at least until the
judge issues an order'' in state court, said the boy's lawyer, Jose
Garcia-Pedrosa.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats called the subpoena a political ploy, saying
it does not bar people from leaving the country, and they
questioned whether it was even enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged by Burton's effort to keep
his son from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said in
his hometown, Cardenas, where many wept during a rally for Elian,
according to The Associated Press. ``I am the father of Elian and
immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the
father.''
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war over the subpoena was the latest development in
what has become an almost daily battle of words across the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six weeks, both the Cuban exile community in this
city and its nemesis 90 miles away, Fidel Castro, have followed a
common path, turning Elian into a political bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the streets of Little Havana and beyond, where
demonstrators last week were hauled away in handcuffs trying to
keep U.S. immigration officials from sending the boy back to his
father in Cuba, Elian is a martyr in the making, a child who lost
his mother at sea as they fled Cuba..
</P>
<P>
   The political firestorm over Elian was set off on Wednesday by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service here when its
commissioner, citing federal and international law, decided to
honor the request of Elian's father that the boy be returned to his
custody in Cuba. The decision set a deadline of Jan. 14 for the
boy's return. Elian's father has said he did not know his former
wife had planned to take the boy from Cuba in late November. The
boy's mother and nine others drowned in the crossing and the boy
and two adults were found by a fisherman on Thanksgiving Day
clinging to an inner tube in the ocean. Since his rescue, Elian has
been living with his paternal great-aunt and great-uncle in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration decision sparked street protests in Miami, a
visit by local mayors to Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington,
a legal motion to grant the boy's great-uncle legal custody, and,
on Friday night, the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives here and his lawyers have made sure the
limelight stays trained on the boy. There are Elian Web sites and
posters, free trips to Disney World, courtesy of the
publicity-savvy Disney organization, and free school tuition.
Cameras routinely camp out at the boy's house.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the battle for Elian is no less fierce and political.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's hometown, the crumbling city of Cardenas, on the
northwest coast of Cuba, the boy is just as much a martyr, and
Castro delights in the picture he paints of exiles brainwashing
Elian with Pokemon cards and Mickey Mouse hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has dined with the boy's father, a doorman in the beach
resort of Varadero, and his grandparents. Along a main street, a
banner flutters, reading ``Elian's lawyer is the Cuban people.''
Children sing odes to Elian in school for the cameras. There are
regular demonstrations; one on Friday, during which students told
personal stories about Elian, brought relatives and children to
tears.
</P>
<P>
   For some watching the case, even those sympathetic with the
exile plight, it transcends a run-of-the-mill custody case. ``There
is no question he has been turned into a political pawn,'' said
Grover Joseph Rees, a former general counsel for the INS and now
chief counsel on the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights. ``Fidel had dinner with the father and the two
sets of grandparents. How often does that happen? On the other
hand, yeah, our side inevitably sees it as a political struggle
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have seized on the case, even knocking on Elian's
door. One of them, a Miami city commissioner, arrived dressed like
Santa Claus. Last week, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida
delivered a new black Labrador puppy called Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he and
other Republicans wanted to make Elian a full-fledged citizen so he
can stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the ideological divide, Charles B.
Rangel, a New York Democrat who has for years advocated lifting the
economic embargo against Cuba, has volunteered to fly to Cuba to
deliver the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore, who is running for president and is
facing a serious backlash among Dade County's Cuban-American
Democratic voters, has distanced himself from the Clinton
administration's decision. On Friday, he helped pave the way for a
meeting with Miami leaders and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Castro accuses Miami exiles of causing undue trauma to the boy's
psyche. But in Miami, many exiles suspect the father has acquiesced
to Castro's wishes under duress.

AFTER CRISIS, REFORM BILLS LANGUISH IN BRAZIL

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ One year after a currency crisis
sparked fears that the Brazilian economy was heading toward an
Asian-style meltdown, growth has resumed, calm has returned, and it
is once again business as usual here. In other words, Brazil's
Congress is acting as if the crisis never occurred and is
procrastinating about approving the government's economic program.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 budget still not approved, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso has summoned lawmakers back to Brasilia for a
special session that began last week and is intended to force them
to keep working until his agenda can be voted on.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional leaders, clearly mindful of local elections
later this year, have dismissed his austerity package as a mere
``wish list'' and countered with proposals of their own that would
limit presidential powers and dip further into the federal purse.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last week, the governor of Brazil's
second-most-populous state announced a unilateral moratorium on
repayment of his state's debt, a move that alarmed foreign
investors and led them to begin pulling money from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Cardoso had been forced to allow a devaluation of
the Brazilian currency, the real, which led to a sharp 40 percent
decline in its value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In the panic that followed, foreign bankers and Wall Street
analysts at first predicted that Brazil's economy would contract by
as much as 6 percent in 1999, with interest rates rising above 55
percent and the dollar worth as much as 3 reals. In reality, the
economy bounced back quickly from the initial blow, closing the
year with positive growth, and with interest rates at 26 percent
and the real trading at 1.83 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Brazilian legislators simply do not feel the same
urgency or international pressure as they did a year ago. In
addition, it is the middle of a glorious summer here, which may
help explain why fewer than one-fifth of the 594 members of
Congress were on hand for the first quorum call last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This convocation is unnecessary and expensive,'' complained
Geddel Vieira Lima, leader of the delegation of one of the parties
in the government coalition. ``I don't see how we can vote on this
entire agenda in this period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious agenda for the special session, which is scheduled
to last until mid-February, includes renewal of Cardoso's line-item
veto authority over the budget, reform of the tax and pensions
systems and changes in labor laws. Other measures under
consideration are limits on spending by municipalities and states
and salary ceilings for government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that passage of its reform measures is
essential if it is to meet performance targets set in the $41.5
billion economic rescue package it signed with the International
Monetary Fund in November 1998. But with nationwide municipal
elections scheduled for October, legislators want to be generous to
win favor with voters, not to keep belts tightened.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A group of 60 legislators within the government coalition, for
instance, last month blocked a vote on renewal of a measure giving
the executive branch more powers to limit spending, because the
president had refused to include their pet pork-barrel projects in
last year's budget. Cardoso has ``had more problems with his
supporters than the opposition,'' the business daily Gazeta
Mercantil concluded after that incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is also feeling cranky toward Cardoso because he
recently vetoed a bill that would have erased more than $11 million
in fines that were imposed on lawmakers who violated electoral
campaign laws. That amnesty would have applied to more than 80
legislators and nine state governors, many of whom the president
has been counting on to support his legislative package but are now
highly offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veto could induce reprisals from lawmakers and put at risk
the approval of measures that are of obvious urgency to the
country,'' the daily O Estado de Sao Paulo warned in a recent
editorial. The newspaper criticized the behavior of legislators as
``shameful,'' warning that the bill, which Congress is threatening
to override, ``indirectly authorizes an anything-goes attitude'' in
the campaign leading up to the October vote.
</P>
<P>
   Additional grounds for conflict between Congress and the
president exist in a proposal by legislators to give themselves a
50 percent pay increase, to $80,000 a year. In a country where the
minimum wage is $900 a year, the proposal is extremely unpopular
and goes against Cardoso's emphasis on fiscal discipline and
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer that Congress be on the side of public
opinion,'' the president said just after Christmas, referring
specifically to his veto of the electoral amnesty measure. To act
in any other fashion, he added, is ``demoralizing'' to the country
``and leaves a sensation of impunity.''

 &HT;    FOR MIAMI'S EXILES, PASSIONS ABOUT COMMUNIST CUBA, CASTRO RUN
DEEP

<P>
   MIAMI _ Dressed in a stylish business suit and heels, investment
banker Lourdes Blanco didn't look the part of an angry protestor
demonstrating against the decision to send 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But even if she didn't carry a Cuban flag and chant
``Libertad!'' the 30-something executive still felt passionately
enough about the boy's fate to turn out during her lunch hour for
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here at six years old from Cuba, and my family went
through a lot,'' she said, speaking in calm tones and impeccable
English. ``My mother was a political prisoner. She was in jail just
before I was born. People in this country don't understand. You
have to experience living in Cuba to know what goes on in that
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside South Florida, young Elian's story seems sad but simple
to many Americans: Blood ties are more important than politics, so
in the best interests of the child, send him back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cuban-Americans _ or exiles, as they are called _ the
issue is much more complex, and emotional. For many of them,
politics isn't about abstract policies or ideas. It is intensely
personal, born of pain, loss and separation. It is about morals and
principles.
</P>
<P>
   And passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that 75 percent of Cuban-Americans
in this country were born in Cuba,'' said Dario Moreno, himself a
Cuban immigrant who now teaches political science at Miami's
Florida International University. ``They remember Cuba and what
they lost when they left there. For them it is black and white,
good and evil. Fidel is the devil incarnate, Cuba is hell on earth
and sending a six-year-old boy back to that hell is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, students of exile politics say Miami's Cuban
immigrants aren't as unified _ or as rabid _ as televised images of
the protests might make it seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a few hundred people who are going from
place to place to have these protests,'' said Max Castro, another
Cuban immigrant who is a research associate at the University of
Miami's North-South Center. ``Surveys here have shown that about 75
percent of Cuban-Americans want Elian to stay in Miami. But about
68 percent of (Miami-Dade) county's Hispanics don't approve of the
protests blocking the streets and disrupting traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban-American community _ which numbers more than
750,000 _ has captured headlines through the years, earning the
reputation as a place of extreme opinions and a knee-jerk
anti-Communism that at times has provoked disbelief and even scorn
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, the joke goes, is one of the few cities in the country
where a leader's stand on foreign policy issues is more important
than his or her position on garbage collection, property taxes or
the other traditional bread-and-butter issues of local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Miami's leaders have made headlines for
taking stands that would be unheard of in other local political
arenas. In the early 1990s, they triggered a national boycott by
African-Americans when they snubbed visiting South African hero
Nelson Mandela because of his friendship with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, city officials refused to host a Special
Olympics competition on municipal property because handicapped
children from Cuba were to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation that was founded on the principle of tolerance and
strives for a stated goal of inclusion for all, the Cuban exiles
have appeared to some as bombastic, unreasonable, extreme.
</P>
<P>
   And the case of Elian has reinforced that image. Nothing could
be more heart-rending than the story of a child witnessing his
mother drowning at sea and then barely surviving himself. And to
many Americans, nothing could be more heartless than to keep the
child from his loving father, to place politics ahead of one of the
most deeply felt and universal of human emotions, the bond between
parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   For all the show and bluster of the protests, it's clear the
case is very troubling to many Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Cuban, but I'm a parent,'' said Tanay Alonso, who lives
only a few houses down from the home where Elian has been staying
with his relatives in Miami's Little Havana section. ``If something
should happen to my husband, I'd want my kids to be with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service was
absolutely correct and courageous,'' he said. ``None of the facts
can overcome that there is a loving father and four loving
grandparents in Cuba who want this child back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other Cuban immigrants may hold such opinions, but
may be reluctant to state them. Many, too, may feel that while
Elian would be better off in Miami, it is wrong to do anything more
than write a letter or make a telephone call to express that
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the small number of activists will probably continue
to set the agenda _ and get the most media attention _ in Miami.
Protests by a few hundred committed people will create the image of
an entire community on the verge of exploding in anger.
</P>
<P>
   And even the experts who say the range of opinion is more subtle
than news accounts have shown agree that if Elian finally goes to
Cuba, the event will probably draw thousands to the streets instead
of hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Because for too many Cuban-Americans, the pain of their own
experience _ or that of relatives left behind in Castro's Communist
Cuba _ is still too vivid to allow any shadings of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here from Cuba, my own son was six years old,''
said Oscar Garcia, 68, who joined in a protest in downtown Miami
this week. ``It was the hardest decision of my life, because like
everyone, I came with my pockets out. We had nothing. But I did it
for my son. Today, he is a successful architect. That is the kind
of future I want for Elian.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ In 1989, the state of Baja California led
Mexico into a new era by voting out the corrupt political machine
that had dominated its politics for six decades.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a decade of reform-minded opposition government, the
waves of drug-related crime that have coincided with more
democratic politics are eroding citizens' faith that any government
can improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe anymore,'' said Norma Castro, a local
homemaker, describing how the lines at her neighborhood polling
place have grown shorter each year. ``They figure, `What's the
point of voting if nothing is going to change?'''
</P>
<P>
   After years in which Mexicans held to the belief that drugs like
cocaine were a problem that merely passed through their country on
their way to places like Los Angeles and New York, the illicit
trade here has begun to profoundly affect people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Street crime, fed by an explosion of drug abuse, has risen
exponentially. With the police overwhelmed by drug-related killings
and the courts awash in traffickers' bribes, crimes almost unheard
of not long ago _ kidnappings, bank robberies, drive-by shootings _
are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   For people without the means to hire lawyers or bribe judges,
justice has grown steadily more elusive as the system has buckled.
Corrupt police officers are fired by the score; illegal gun
ownership and private security businesses are booming just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Polls that once showed citizens concerned with street lights and
sewer lines now register public safety far ahead of all other
concerns. At the same time, voter participation rates at record
highs in the early 1990s have quickly given way to some of the
highest abstention levels in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main source of support for the opposition was its promise
to fight crime and corruption, and people no longer believe in
that,'' said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, a leftist politician who was
Baja California's first independent human rights ombudsman. ``There
is a cost to the democracy in that disillusionment. People don't
think anyone can solve their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an article of reformist faith in Mexico that free
political choice would be the ultimate solution to corruption and
injustice. With the end of fraudulent elections and authoritarian
rule, the thinking went, leaders would be accountable to the voters
rather than to the system of patronage and payoffs built by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   But in Baja California, things have not gone according to that
plan. While public administration has generally improved under the
National Action Party (known as the PAN, its Spanish acronym),
violence, crime and corruption have redrawn the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   PAN officials move ``emergency'' police trailers from one
neighborhood to another, cutting ribbons each time, but never
leaving the units in place long enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Like the former Communists of Eastern Europe, some local leaders
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (known by its Spanish
acronym as the PRI) have all but embraced its authoritarian past,
hoping for a comeback by harking back to days when the criminals
with whom they colluded were at least under some control.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of trafficking is disproportionate in Baja
California. The state has long been a conduit into the United
States for cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin; it is
also the base of the Arellano Felix brothers' mafia, arguably the
most violent Mexico has known.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of democratic politics and the drug trade, two of
the defining forces of contemporary Mexico, has also posed a
conflict that bears special attention as the country readies for
the most competitive presidential election of its modern history,
which is to take place this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the politicians of Baja California and a few other
crime-ravaged states governed by the opposition, the major
candidates in the presidential race all cite the collapsing justice
system as a crucial issue in the country's future. They have said
little, however, to sustain faith in the power of free political
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows now that the government cannot stop the
criminals here,'' said Armando Gutierrez, a Tijuana radio announcer
whose son, Hodin, a crusading state prosecutor, was killed by
gunmen thought to be working for the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just wish that they would come clean _ say they are afraid
or they are taking payoffs or they don't know what to do,''
Gutierrez went on. ``They tried to pretend this wasn't happening,
and when they finally looked around, it was too late. The criminals
were on top of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the PRI, drug mafias had generally secured the
government's tolerance by dealing in part with senior officials or
their emissaries. After the PRI was ousted from power, there were
fewer government leaders willing to take drug money, said former
officials, so traffickers instead focused on key positions
throughout the criminal-justice apparatus: the district court, the
attorney general's security detail, the state police homicide squad
(to cover up killings), and the car-theft unit (to supply stolen
cars).
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, according to Mexican officials and two Mexican
intelligence reports, the Arellanos made long-term alliances with
up-and-coming police officials and politicians, helping move them
into powerful posts. Not everyone was bought off, officials said,
but in an atmosphere of pervasive fear, not everyone needed to be.
</P>
<P>
   The wider social impact of the drug trade has rarely been
obvious in Baja California. Cities like Tijuana, and Mexicali and
Ensenada brim with new businesses, and the worst of the fear
generated by drug-related violence and crime tends to concentrate
in poor suburbs not seen by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the makeshift drug treatment centers that have popped up
across the state, addicts pack into the same sorts of tiny cells
that might be assigned to migrant laborers or prisons inmates,
which many of them have been. The difference: is that the addicts
must plead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The centers are all full, said the head of one privately funded
treatment network, Miguel Angel Marroquin. ``And you can ask anyone
_ nobody would say that we are reaching even 1 percent of the
addicts out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clients are users of cocaine or crack, which became
more widely available in Mexico as smugglers shifted to payment in
kind for the drugs they transport. Social workers say more of the
addicts are heroin and methamphetamine users, who have watched the
price of their drugs fall even as the purity has increased.
</P>
<P>
   Many Baja Californians say the corrosion of the justice system
by drug corruption and violence has also strengthened the
longstanding Mexican perception that justice often depends on one's
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana, for instance, city officials are openly endorsing a
local version of what might be called community policing. Should
neighborhoods want their own patrolling officers, all they must do
is collect enough contributions to pay for their salaries, about
$428 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   When community advocates and political analysts compare the
anger expressed in opinion polls to the apathy and cynicism
reflected in local elections, they see the legacy of a one-party
state. For nearly 50 years in Mexico, they note, political
participation meant compulsory attendance at a PRI rally,
compulsory membership in a PRI trade union or maybe pleading with a
PRI official for basic services that politicians had repeatedly
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Just how drug violence and crime have influenced the voters'
faith in government is mostly a matter of conjecture. But it has
been scandals of drug-related crime and corruption more than
anything else that have likened the current political leaders to
their predecessors.

FOR CZECHS, BLIND EYE ON HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ When the European Union asks its
applicants for admission what men do to women in the workplace, the
countries of Central Europe will apparently have some explaining to
do.
</P>
<P>
   To the shock of many Czechs, a recent study commissioned by the
newspaper Lidove Noviny indicated that almost half of the country's
working women have been subjected to sexual harassment in the
workplace. Reports from other post-Communist countries indicate
that sexual harassment, though seldom identified as such, is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 45 percent of Czech women had been sexually
harassed, many of them repeatedly. Women's rights advocates said
that the real figures are probably even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual harassment is something like folklore in the Czech
Republic,'' said Lenka Simerska, a sociologist at the Gender
Studies Center in Prague. ``It's omnipresent, but it's not
considered a serious problem. You're supposed to laugh about it and
say that it's a stupid invention of hysterical American feminists,
and that, actually, it does not exist here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it does, she said. Obscene jokes, suggestive remarks,
unwelcome advances, gentle slaps on one's buttocks _ these are all
part of a regular day for many women who work and who do not
complain for fear of being ridiculed or even losing their job.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the term often used for sexual harassment in the Czech
Republic, ``sexualni haraseni,'' discourages serious discussion.
Coined by an exiled Czech writer, Josef Skvorecky, in the early
1990s, sexualni haraseni, phonetically similar to the English term,
translates as ``sexual buzz'' or ``sexual rumble,'' with the tacit
understanding that whoever complains about harassment is making an
unnecessary fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Sex is not considered taboo in this country. But the concept of
sexual harassment is widely perceived as a Western plague that
threatens to spoil ``natural'' relations between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Klepetarova, a foreign-student coordinator at Charles
University in Prague, said that while she agreed that sexual
harassment was a problem, she would hate to see the chemistry
between men and women disappear in the workplace. Flirting, she
noted, is fun, and makes the working day more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a colleague of mine comes to work in a new jacket or a tie,
of course I will compliment him,'' she said. ``By the same token, I
expect to be complimented when I come in something new that looks
good. And if a boss takes his female secretary around her shoulders
and says, `Let's take a look at this problem together,' then I
don't think it's sexual harassment. It's indecent. It's graceless
paternalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, a well-aimed slap can solve anything,'' she added with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not everything. The few lawsuits reported in Central
Europe throughout the 1990s showed that women have a very spare
legal arsenal with which to fight unwelcome advances from their
colleagues. Since none of the Central European countries have
codified sexual harassment as a criminal offense, victims usually
sue for violation of the labor code, which provides a more vaguely
defined right to a harmless working environment.
</P>
<P>
   Centrum Praw Kobiet, the women's rights center in Poland, has
counseled dozens of sexual harassment victims, but only one of them
could claim any sort of legal success. The harassed woman, an
employee of a large multinational corporation, won a payment equal
to a year's salary as compensation, but she was still forced to
leave her job.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was lucky, because the company was international and
was concerned about its reputation,'' said Eleonora Zielinska, a
law professor from Warsaw. ``But usually the victims are entitled
only to three months' pay if they agree to leave the job. That is
nothing compared to the compensation a woman would get in the West.
And if they refuse to leave, they get no compensation at all, and
they still have to cope with the hostile environment, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in Hungary where, despite the
raunchiness of many Budapest night clubs and widely displayed
pornographic magazines, it is considered bad form to discuss sex in
public. ``Sexuality was taboo in Hungary during socialism,'' said
Judit Sandor, the head of the gender studies department at the
Central European University in Budapest. ``People don't feel
comfortable interpreting these problems. And that includes judges,
who are generally unfavorable to women.''
</P>
<P>
   It also includes politicians, Ms. Sandor said, who tend to blame
women for soliciting attention with high heels, short skirts and
low-cut necklines. Very few women in Hungary dare to go public with
their reports of harassment, she said, because they fear a backlash
from the society.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fall of Communism, some things are gradually
changing. Some post-Communist countries have begun the process of
passing laws to combat sexual harassment in order to harmonize
their legislation with laws in the European Union, which all aspire
to join.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia hopes to pass a law sometime in the spring, while the
Czech government just sent a draft law for its first reading in
Parliament. The task still lies ahead for Poland, Hungary and
Slovakia, not to mention Balkan countries further back in the line
to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Legal protection will not immediately change the deeply rooted
attitudes and social climate in the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe, where feminism is a dirty word and debates about
gender issues almost nonexistent. Although almost all women work
and bring home income, they are still expected to take care of the
household and child-rearing. And the few who dare to speak out can
not expect any sympathy from those around them.
</P>
<P>
   Dagmar Frysakova knows all about the difficulty of such cases.
She was the first woman in the Czech Republic to win a sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before her wedding, Ms. Frysakova, a university
student, was approached by a teaching assistant in the library.
When she refused his advances, the man forced her hand to his
genitals and ejaculated on her skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity with the story of Monica Lewinsky's blue dress
did not go unnoticed, especially since the incident happened at the
height of the impeachment proceedings in Washington, and Ms.
Frysakova's story became the subject of jokes at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the stained skirt she won the lawsuit, but the
teaching assistant received only an eight-month suspended sentence
and remained at the university.
</P>
<P>
   The university staff members have become hostile toward her, and
Ms. Frysakova fears that she will be forced to leave the
university. ``If I had known what I was going to go through,'' she
said, ``I would have never said a thing.''

ATOM SCIENTIST TAKES CASE TO COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are really two trials taking shape in the
case of Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist charged with
compromising nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   One is the relatively narrow criminal case brought in New Mexico
by government prosecutors, who charged Lee with transferring secret
nuclear-weapons data from classified computers at Los Alamos
National Laboratory to computer tapes that are now missing.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors have not charged that the Taiwan-born Lee
committed espionage by giving the data to a foreign country, and
because the case first grew from charges of Chinese nuclear
espionage, that has left an opening for Lee's lawyers to try to
conduct their own trials, in two federal courts and in the court of
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Through a media campaign and alliances with Asian-American
groups, and in arguments in both the criminal trial and a separate
civil lawsuit filed against the government, Lee's lawyers are
spotlighting what they say is a racist witch hunt meant to cloak
flaws in the government's counterintelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit filed by Lee and his wife, Sylvia, charges
that the case against Lee was pursued in part to ``divert
attention'' from the government's ``inability to maintain proper
security procedures at the nation's nuclear laboratories.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the government discovered evidence of computer
transfers by Lee, he was investigated at least three times in his
20-year career at Los Alamos. The last of these inquiries led to
his firing.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry in 1995, based on evidence that Beijing had stolen
secrets related to the United States' most advanced nuclear
warhead, the submarine-launched W-88, led to a full criminal
investigation by the FBI in 1996. Lee, then working in the
secretive X Division at Los Alamos, where the W-88 had been
designed, quickly emerged as the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year investigation by the FBI was unable to prove any
involvement by Lee. But last March he was fired for a series of
security violations uncovered in the W-88 inquiry, including his
failure to report contacts with foreign officials, and evidence
that he had mishandled three classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after he was fired that the FBI and Los Alamos
computer experts found the computer downloads that led to his
arrest on Dec. 10. Those transfers are at the core of the
government's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers now argue that flaws in the original W-88
inquiry are largely irrelevant to the case against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation resulting in this indictment has no
connection whatsoever with the original W-88 investigation,'' an
FBI agent, Robert Messemer, told a federal magistrate during a
hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Lee consented to a search of his office and his
office computer before he was fired. Evidence gathered at the lab
led to a search of Lee's home in April. There agents found a
notebook listing the files that he is charged with transferring and
copying.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have indicated that they would challenge the
admissibility of evidence gained from the search of his home.
</P>
<P>
   To convict Lee on all charges, the government must prove that he
acted with the intention of injuring the United States and aiding a
foreign power. Prosecutors must present circumstantial evidence
that Lee intended to pass the data to another country, while
acknowledging they cannot prove he is a spy.
</P>
<P>
   In two hearings in December to determine whether Lee would be
released on bail, Los Alamos officials and a senior FBI agent
provided the first glimpses of how the government hopes to make
that case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Younger, the director of nuclear-weapons programs at
Los Alamos, said the very scale of Lee's computer transfers, which
included 806 megabytes of classified data on virtually every
critical nuclear-weapons code at Los Alamos, indicates his intent
to hurt the United States and aid another country.
</P>
<P>
   The missing tapes would only be useful to a country or group
trying to replicate U.S. nuclear-weapons designs, Younger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These codes and their associated databases, and the input
files, combined with someone that knew how to use them, could, in
my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global strategic
balance,'' Younger said.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer testified that the clandestine manner in which Lee
downloaded and copied the data in 1993, 1994 and 1997 indicated his
intent to keep his actions secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lee did it mostly at night and on weekends, and then copied the
data onto tapes by using computers in other offices at Los Alamos.
And in January and February 1999, after he was questioned in the
W-88 investigation, Lee began deleting the transferred files from
the unclassified network at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer also said that Lee's downloading in 1993 and 1994 came
when he had been notified that he might be laid off as a result of
budget cuts. At the same time, he began sending job inquiries to
Europe and Asia, including Taiwan and Hong Kong. At a subsequent
bail hearing, government witnesses said Lee had remotely accessed
the files he had downloaded, while he was visiting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers hope to outflank the prosecution on several
fronts. The defense argues that Lee downloaded the files after
computer crashes at Los Alamos, and later destroyed the seven tapes
that are now missing. During cross-examinations, the defense has
focused on the government's failure to disprove Lee's explanations.
</P>
<P>
   A defense motion this month cast further light on his planned
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The motion stated that Lee and his lawyers need access to the
portable computer tapes recovered by the government to explore the
possibility that most or all of the downloaded material had
previously been published, so Lee could not have meant to harm the
United States through his transfers. The defense also said it wants
to show that the tapes contained material that Lee needed for his
work, and so possession of it was not unauthorized.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also asked the court to ease restrictions on their
ability to share classified material with defense witnesses, and to
instruct prosecutors to allay concerns among Los Alamos employees
that they might face retribution for talking with the defense.
Those requests suggest that the defense hopes to call witnesses who
will say that downloading of classified data is widespread at Los
Alamos, and that Lee has been the victim of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, however, Lee's lawyers have attacked the W-88
inquiry and the subsequent media coverage that identified Lee as a
suspect long before he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement when Lee was arrested on Dec. 10, Mark Holscher,
his Los Angeles lawyer, argued that the decision to prosecute had
been influenced by ``other branches of government whose political
motives and agendas are suspect.'' That was a reference to a
congressional committee chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
that investigated illicit transfers of technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lee's lawyers have charged in the separate civil
lawsuit in Washington that personal information about Lee that was
published in the press, including articles in The New York Times,
violated his privacy. The ``selectively disclosed information'' was
designed to show that Lee and his wife ``were spies'' for China,
Holscher charged.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has also maintained that Lee was turned into a
scapegoat for the broader security failures at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will use statements by a former Los Alamos
counterintelligence official, Robert Vrooman, that Lee was singled
out for investigation because of his Chinese ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, who was disciplined last year for failures in the W-88
investigation, has claimed that he complained about the targeting
of Lee long before his own mishandling of the inquiry came under
scrutiny, but senior FBI and Energy Department officials dispute
that.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman's charged statements about racism have helped rally
support for Lee from Asian-American groups.

   HARRISON TOWNSHIP, Mich. _ Wearing insulated beige overalls, a
brown camouflage jacket and warm boots, Joe Burkhardt cautiously
walked a few feet onto the ice of Lake St. Clair on Friday morning
as murky light shone through the low, gray clouds above.
</P>
<P>
   He raised high into the air his ``spud'': a basic piece of ice
fishing equipment that consists of a 6-foot-long steel pipe with a
spike on the bottom and is used for testing the firmness of the
ice. He plunged the spud through the ice several times, about 18
inches from his feet; water bubbled in the holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, it goes right through,'' he said. ``I'm not going out.''
</P>
<P>
   A firefighter nearby, Sgt. Frank Share, received a radio call: A
soaked ice fisherman had just staggered out of a canal several
miles away and into the home of an elderly couple. Jumping into his
pickup truck, Share raced across town.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering uncontrollably, Eric Zwierzchowski, the 24-year-old
ice fisherman, stood in the couple's house here on the northeastern
outskirts of Detroit. Two other firefighters were attaching the
leads for a heart monitor to Zwierzchowski's chest. Then they
helped lower him onto a stretcher and wheeled him out to a rescue
truck for the trip to the hospital, where he would be treated for
mild hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in the truck, Zwierzchowski said he was through with ice
fishing. ``I'm done, no question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ice fishing has long been a big part of winter life in Michigan.
Indians engaged in the sport long before white settlers arrived,
and the state's Department of Natural Resources estimates that
300,000 people still go ice fishing each winter. But a string of
accidents, combined with a succession of fairly mild winters, has
provoked an acrimonious fight in the Michigan Legislature over
whether new laws are needed to discourage ice anglers from taking
excessive risks.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious accident took place last winter, when 17
anglers were trapped on an ice floe the size of a city block that
broke off at sunset from the shore of Lake St. Clair. The floe
began floating out across the 20-mile-wide lake just as a powerful
snowstorm arrived. Firefighters began ferrying the anglers to
shore, using a Hovercraft and a skiff.
</P>
<P>
   But with wind speeds reaching 60 mph, the water was soon lashed
into 6-foot waves. The Hovercraft and the skiff sank, plunging
several firefighters into the freezing water. The ice floe broke
into 2-foot-thick blocks, and the waves hurled the blocks together,
knocking firefighters and anglers into the water, where they
struggled to avoid being crushed between the crashing slabs.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of a Coast Guard helicopter had great difficulty
finding people in the water at night in blinding snow and had to
make several trips to rescue everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, no one was killed or injured. But although that
incident involved an unusually large number of anglers, a
surprising number of ice fishermen need to be rescued each year
after falling through the ice or becoming trapped on floes that
float away. The Coast Guard, which tends to handle the most
dangerous cases, has rescued 421 people from ice or ice-filled
water in the last five years in the Great Lakes region. All but 48
were in Michigan and almost all were ice fishermen. Few women
engage in ice fishing. Local fire departments have rescued many
more.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Jaye, a Republican, said he watched the movie
``Titanic'' soon after the 17 anglers were rescued on Lake St.
Clair. One of the movie's last scenes, in which the young man
played by Leonardo DiCaprio freezes to death while clinging to ship
debris in the North Atlantic, inspired him to draft legislation,
Jaye said.
</P>
<P>
   His law would impose a $5 fine the first time someone is rescued
from the ice, a $200 fine the second time and a $500 fine the third
time; after a third rescue, a person's fishing license would also
be revoked for three years. Fines would be imposed only on people
who ventured onto the ice when ``a reasonable individual'' would
have concluded it was unsafe. State and federal agencies would
continue to pay for rescues.
</P>
<P>
   The law passed the Michigan Senate in November, but appears dead
in the House because of opposition from the Michigan United
Conservation Clubs. With 100,000 members and 500 affiliated hunting
and fishing clubs, the group mainly opposes gun control, but has
taken on Jaye's bill out of concern that it would penalize ice
anglers unfairly and might set a precedent for imposing rescue fees
on other outdoorsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Going out on the ice to fish and then needing to be rescued ``is
no different than my going deer hunting and getting my vehicle
stuck and calling'' for help, said State Rep. Dale Sheltrown, a
Republican from central Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   State conservation officers pull hunters' vehicles out of deep
mud and other difficulties. The officers charge nothing, but
sometimes tell hunters with badly stuck vehicles to call commercial
tow trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers interviewed Friday as they fished on the ice of a boat
basin were divided on fines. Dennis Hartwig, a retired lawyer, said
that while irresponsible anglers should be penalized, it was wrong
to penalize others who exercised common sense but had misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   Share said he was opposed to any fines. He said that people
should be allowed to pursue any sport, and that it was the
firefighters' job to rescue those who got in trouble. ``We get paid
to help people out when they make a mistake _ people go out and
drive when there's a winter weather advisory and get in accidents
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaye said such sentiments were so strong that ``it seems
unlikely at this time the House is going to move until there's
another disaster.''

SPORTS COLUMN: LOUNGE ACTS OPEN NFL POSTSEASON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ So confident is the NFL of its hold over the
housebound populace in January that it offers a series of warm-up
acts for the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No sense throwing the headliners out on the stage so soon after
the new year. First, give the public eight teams that by and large
resemble Bill Murray's prototypical cocktail-lounge singer with his
shirt open to his navel, crooning erratically into a squawky mike.
</P>
<P>
   The league did not lack for charisma and excellence this season.
Kurt Warner of St. Louis emerged, Unitas-like, from that spectacle
known as Arena Football, while Peyton Manning became a skilled
veteran in his second season with Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither was on display this weekend while
pear-shaped America settled into the sofa and ripped open a month's
supply of beer and chips.
</P>
<P>
   What with Washington and Detroit clanking helmets here Saturday
afternoon, and three other wild-card games over the weekend, the
league was offering eight teams with a collective record of 78
victories and 50 losses.
</P>
<P>
   This lukewarm record was a monument to parity and a tribute to
the very American concept that all men are created equal. Besides
which, it is generally cold outdoors in January, and what are
people going to watch: C-Span?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was hoping for a nice pleasant weekend of games between
mediocrities, with no throat-slashing gestures, no wounded linemen
whacking officials, no breaking-and-entering arrests, no legal
troubles at all, after a season that included tragedy and
embarrassment. The league was quite willing to settle for the
normal mayhem on the run, even if perpetrated by second-line teams.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't saying much for pro football when the biggest
entertainment of the century to date has been Bill Belichick's
stunning the Jets with his emotional rendition of that old Johnny
Paycheck country music staple, ``Take This Job and Shove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at the numbers. The Lions lumbered in here Saturday with an
8-8 record, while the home team had a 10-6 record and actually
finished first in its dreadful division.
</P>
<P>
   The only matchup with any glitter was in Saturday's early game
in Nashville, where Tennessee held a glowing 13-3 record against
Buffalo (11-5), whose coach, Wade Phillips, planned a mighty gamble
in switching Rob Johnson for Doug Flutie, who merely got the Bills
to the playoffs in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   One hates to be a spoilsport but Sunday is even drearier. Dallas
(8-8) plays in Minnesota (10-6), after which Miami (9-7) plays at
Seattle (also 9-7), not exactly how Dan Marino would like his
career to end.
</P>
<P>
   No other sport offers such also-rans playing each other in the
first round of its tournament. Since 1985, college basketball has
held a 64-team version of March Madness with the Prairie Views and
Coastal Carolinas of the world seeded 16th but with top-seeded
teams also mandated to get out there and produce in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's elongated ``postseason'' (Uncle Bud will come around
and twist your ear lobes if you call it ``the playoffs'') has
cheapened the World Series, but at least the Yanks and the Braves
have to wear down their arms like everyone else in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball and pro hockey playoffs involve just about
everybody, and tend to go on forever. In fact, they may actually
have started, but nobody has notified us. At least the best teams
have to play the dog qualifiers in the first round, which means no
rest for the weary.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, pro football, the most dangerous and
debilitating team sport yet devised by humankind, actually gives
the four best teams a bye in the first round. Doesn't this violate
the Geneva Convention or something?
</P>
<P>
   While these eight pretenders slugged it out on Amateur Weekend,
Indianapolis and St. Louis and Jacksonville and Tampa Bay were
lolling in their respective whirlpools.
</P>
<P>
   They know the odds. Only three teams have lasted four games and
won the Super Bowl _ Oakland in the 1980 season as a wild card,
Washington in 1982 in a 16-team playoff after the labor troubles,
and Denver in 1997 as a wild card. Buffalo in 1992 and New England
in 1985 reached the Super Bowl after three victories and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, neither the players nor the fans stops to think
about this gloomy prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   Cars were streaming into FedEx Stadium, known until recently as
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, after the megalomaniac who built it only
to have his name quickly pried off the facade after his death.
</P>
<P>
   So much change. The new Washington owner, Daniel Snyder, has
dismissed many of his experienced staff members, while threatening
his coach, Norv Turner, with unemployment and taking on other tasks
large and small with Steinbrennerian gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps out of fear of their owner, or just maybe out of skill
and professionalism, the Washington players finished two games
above .500, a veritable dynasty in this league.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit managed to stumble into the wild card despite the loss
of its great running back, Barry Sanders, who got so tired of
losing that he retired. In his absence, the Lions upgraded
themselves to average.
</P>
<P>
   There's a moral to that story somewhere. Maybe it will become
apparent while the secondary teams beat each other into submission,
and the main acts take the stage.

COMMENTARY: TRIUMPH OF THE NERDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend Boston played host to the annual meeting of the
American Economic Association. It was a meeting of college
professors; but it was also a conclave of some of the world's
movers and shakers. Academic economists used to expect to affect
policy only at third or fourth hand; but lately they have, in
unprecedented numbers, moved into the corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous example of the trend is Lawrence Summers,
the academic whiz kid who became treasury secretary. But Harvard
professors have attained high office before, and will again. What
is different this time is that Summers is only the most prominent
of a wave of professors-turned-policy-makers. Even if a year from
now Summers himself is forced to seek alternative employment
(spokesman for Jenny Craig? Sorry, couldn't help myself), there
will still be dozens of other former professors in key policy
positions from the International Monetary Fund to the Bank of
England.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for this growing academic influence over economic
policy? One reason is that in the 1990s the professoriate
effectively repelled the challenges, from both right and left, that
had called its authority into question in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge from the right was more serious. Supply-siders _
who argued that high taxes were the root of all evil and ridiculed
the concern of conventional economists with things like budget
deficits _ were initially dismissed as cranks. But with ready
access to the pages of The Wall Street Journal and Forbes, they had
no trouble getting their message out. And they claimed that the
economic growth of their disciple, Ronald Reagan, vindicated their
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years and counting of expansion under manifestly
non-Reaganite policies that claim is, to put it mildly,
unconvincing. (Yes, the faithful insist that our current prosperity
is the result of their hero's 1982 tax cut; but I don't recall them
giving Lyndon Johnson credit for the boom in 1983.) And 20 years
on, the supply-siders themselves still sound like, well, cranks.
They haven't gone away _ any doctrine that appeals to the
prejudices of rich old men is assured of a certain basic level of
financial support, and its adherents will always be able to find
sinecures in the world of right-wing think tanks _ but they have
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers from the left were suaver, though less well
financed. In the pages of intellectual magazines like The Atlantic
Monthly, well-spoken men argued that the government-guided growth
of Japan and other Asian economies contradicted the free-market
implications of standard economic theory. Economists might shake
their heads at mangled logic and garbled statistics; but in the
early '90s, many thoughtful Americans, William Jefferson Clinton
among them, found them convincing. Then Japan's economic engine
started to sputter; a few years later Asia plunged into crisis; and
those who had trumpeted the superiority of an ``Asian system''
became very quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, in other words, conventional economics has been
vindicated in at least a negative way: ``Not as silly as our
critics'' isn't exactly a stirring slogan, but it more or less sums
it up.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another reason for the new policy prominence
of economists: it is part of a broader social trend, the triumph of
the nerds. Once upon a time important men weren't supposed to be
too obviously clever; the technical brilliance of someone like
Summers or the IMF's Stanley Fischer would in itself have marked
them as unsound. In the business world of the '90s, however, the
propeller heads consistently outperformed the suits, and that
affected overall perceptions of what it takes to get the job done.
A world in which Bill Gates is the ultimate businessman is a world
in which Larry Summers can be treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one suspects that the role of academic economists as
policy makers is a transitory phenomenon _ perhaps even a Pyrrhic
victory. New challenges to orthodoxy, like the growing backlash
against globalization, are already brewing. These challenges may be
ill-informed, but no matter. Economics is an inherently political
subject, on which everyone has an opinion; it is hard to believe
that the public will be willing to defer on a sustained basis to
the expertise of professors, however brilliant.

LIBERTIES: HIS HEARTBREAK HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fun at the Chappaqua hacienda is over. Bill
Clinton has finished the heady business of unpacking that one old
table he hadn't seen in 17 years. Now he faces a new life here as
President Lonely Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Restless and rattling around the empty-nest White House, he
begins dialing. This is the official log of calls he made on his
first night home alone:
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. Call to Hillary in Chappaqua: ``Honey, did you take my
Kenny G CD? I can't find it anywhere. I'm so lonesome I could cry.
This place is Heartbreak Hotel. Just remember, whatever you need me
to do, Madame Candidate ...''
</P>
<P>
   6:15 p.m. Call to Harold Ickes in Georgetown: ``Harold, you were
right to make me go up to Chappaqua that first night Hillary moved
in. But, look, man, about that other thing you want me to do, the
cook-off with Donna Hanover on the food channel? I don't know about
that. Wearing an apron and all ...''
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. Call to Martin Sheen in Hollywood: ``Hey, President
Bartlett? This is President Clinton. I just wanted to tell you how
much I am lovin' the way you play me in `West Wing.' What's your
fax number? I've got some notes for your next show ...''
</P>
<P>
   7:45 p.m. Call to Jenny Craig office in D.C.: ``I've been
watching some of your new ads, and that stuff you sell really seems
to work. I've gained 18 pounds and I am fat as a wood tick. With
Hillary gone, it's surely going to get worse. She made me eat baked
french fries. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Does your plan
allow fried foods? ...''
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. Call to Jimmy Carter in Atlanta: ``Hey, Jimmy. No matter
what you read, I am not taking that job at Lazard Freres for $10
million. I am modeling my life after the presidency on you. Do you
know where I can get a tool belt? ...''
</P>
<P>
   8:15 p.m. Call to Vernon Jordan in New York: ``Hey, buddy. A
measly $10 million a year for a president who got the economy
cookin' again? You're low ballin' me, Vernon. You tell
Laissez-Faire I won't do it for less than $20 mil. Dreamworks
offered me that already ...''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Call to David Geffen in Hollywood: ``David? Oh, sorry,
who are you? The personal trainer and Kabbalah consultant? What's
your name? Listen up, Matt, can you put in a good word for me with
David? I'm still waiting for that offer ...''
</P>
<P>
   9:30 p.m. Call to Al Gore in New Hampshire: ``Hel-lo-o-o? Is
this the same Al Gore who was around in '93 when we were getting
killed over gays in the military? You are a fortunate son, Al, that
Bradley is such a supercilious prig ...''
</P>
<P>
   9:45 p.m. Call to Bill Bradley in Iowa: ``Hey, Bill. Between you
and I, I just wanted you to know that, no matter what Al says,
Hillary and me both think your health care plan is real good ...''
</P>
<P>
   10 p.m. Call to Richard Gephardt in Sterling, Va.: ``Dick, did I
wake you? I'm sorry. I know you're scrappin' for every seat and I
could take that one in Arkansas. It would be a privilege to serve
under you because you'd be a great speaker and I would support you
1,000 percent ...''
</P>
<P>
   10:30 p.m. Call to Dick Morris in New York: ``Hey, man, we need
to start polling right away. If I win that Arkansas House seat in
2002, could I knock off Gephardt as speaker? So, what do you think
is better for my approval rating: one night a week in New York, two
nights a week in New York, or can I get away with no nights at all
in that snakebit suburb? ...''
</P>
<P>
   Midnight. Call to Jennifer Lopez in Miami: ``Jennifer? Hey, it's
your president callin'. You got a bum rap. Puffy is 10 miles of bad
road. I'm calling to enlist your help in an important new gun
control campaign. You could spread our message, `Don't spend
Saturday night with a Saturday night special.' Why don't I send an
Air Force plane for you? ...''
</P>
<P>
   12:30 p.m. Call to Puff Daddy in the Hamptons: ``Puffy? The
witch set you up. I'm going to call Janet Reno right away. Hey, you
know where I could get some TLC? ...''
</P>
<P>
   1:30 a.m. Call to Jack Nicholson in L.A.: ``Jack! My main man!
The coast is clear. Nurse Ratched has flown the nest. She thinks
it's my turn to bake cookies. Mi casa blanca, su casa blanca. Hey,
do you happen to have Jewel's number? ...''
</P>
<P>
   2:00 a.m. Call to Domino's Pizza in D.C.: ``Can y'all deliver
100 large pies with extra cheese right away? Great. I'm in McLean,
Virginia, and my name is Ken Starr, S-T-A-R-R.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When certain applicants arrive at Manhattan apartment
buildings for their co-op board interviews these days, they are not
treated like the run-of-the-mill supplicant. No hurried pass-around
of the hors d'oeuvres tray. No embarrassing questions about old
credit card problems. And only rarely does anyone shake their hand.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't have to jump through hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to the lobby for Fido,'' said Dr. Susan Freeman, a
psychologist who heads the canine interview committee at 200 E.
74th St. ``We want to make sure they'll sit on command for the
doorman. Then perhaps we'll have them interact with another dog,
just to see how they handle it.'' She brings her terrier, Ollie,
down for the test.
</P>
<P>
   The days of whines and noses may be running out for dog owners
hoping to buy a co-op apartment. After decades of more or less
benign acceptance, an increasing number of buildings are changing
their rules to no pets at all, and particularly to no dogs. Even
condominiums, long the bastion of look-the-other-way boards, have
tightened up their pet policies. And many buildings that once
allowed dogs as a matter of course, like 200 E. 74th St., now
require an audition first.
</P>
<P>
   Boards started cracking down several years ago by requiring
owners to ride with their pets in freight elevators and to submit
copies of dog licenses. Sometimes photographs were requested. But
until recently, real estate agents say, buildings did not demand
actual interviews. Eight months ago, the board changed the policy
at Ms. Freeman's building ``because photographs can lie,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews can be traumatic. Dog groomers are routinely called
in for Fifi's last-minute comb-out, and an occasional Valium has
been popped _ by owners and canines alike. Boards are even
requiring applications for pets that document lineage and
schooling.

   ``We're just doing a board package,'' said Sara Settembrini, an
agent with the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate firm,
speaking of one client. ``And we're enclosing pictures of both
dogs, with little kerchiefs around their necks, along with their
bios.''
</P>
<P>
   Bios? ``Oh, you know, how old they are, how they were trained,
who trained them,'' Ms. Settembrini replied, adding that this was
something she had never had to do in the past.

   In this white-hot market, where there are often three or four
bidders on any apartment, many boards say they can afford to be as
tough as they want to be _ and they want to be very, very choosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be tyrants,'' said Andrew Kissel, board
treasurer at 200 E. 74th St. and the proud owner of Bellini, a
Maltese. ``But this is your worst fear: you get somebody in the
building and their dog turns out to be a nightmare. We had one guy
who was an original tenant. He had five Bernese mountain dogs.
After they rode in the elevator, the staff had to fumigate it. It
was just horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of buildings now hold dog interviews, said Bobbi Gitter,
an agent with Charles H. Greenthal. ``They want a certain size, a
certain breed,'' she said. ``It's getting out of hand.'' At the
Brevard, a co-op at 245 E. 54th St., where dogs up to 30 pounds
were welcomed for years, the limit was lowered to 15 pounds, which
might suit a pug or a Pekingese, but not a wire-haired terrier.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows the exact number of buildings that are
tightening their rules, Greg Carlson, president of the Federation
of New York Housing Cooperatives, estimated that it doubled in the
last year. ``If it was 10 percent before, it's 20 percent now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to noise and mess, boards cite the growing number of
animals in apartments. Many real estate agents said that especially
in neighborhoods like Carnegie Hill and Tribeca, co-op applicants
are getting younger _ many earning lots of Wall Street money, of
course _ and younger families tend to have younger children. And
younger children have dogs. ``This building used to be a building
with many more older people,'' Kissel said.
</P>
<P>
   But man's (or child's) best friend may not be the neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   At Dr. Freeman's building, one dog knocked somebody down in the
passenger elevator. The same dog, whose name was withheld in the
spirit of co-op amiability, nipped another shareholder, but didn't
draw blood. ``You get one free bite,'' Dr. Freeman said. ``Then
you're held responsible.'' The board ordered the owner to provide
training; the dog has been on its best behavior ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Vernon, a real estate lawyer who specializes in defending
pets, said that hundreds of complaints had been lodged against dog
owners by co-op boards and landlords in Manhattan who are trying to
evict dogs _ and often, their owners. In the last year he has
handled dozens of disputes with boards, many about barking. He says
he wins most of his cases.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Zand, a real estate lawyer who has represented about 20 dog
owners feuding with their co-ops, said that many ended with an
``amicable resolution: the dog goes into a probationary period.''
Often, as a settlement, the dog heads off to training _ or day
care.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives
and Condominiums, cited two recent proxy fights waged by pro-dog
forces to unseat restrictive boards _ fights that were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ramirez, president of Halstead Property Co., said she
understood the urge to restrict, although it makes her job a lot
harder. There are now fewer apartments for pet owners to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs soil the carpet in the elevator _ their owners are always
sneaking them into the passenger elevator,'' she said. ``They sniff
where you don't want them to sniff. You don't know if they'll freak
out. And if you have a child, it might nip their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the fancier the apartment house, the more chance
there is that your dog (at least) will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Take River House or the Dakota,'' said Joyce West, sales
director at Greenthal, mentioning two candidates for anybody's Top
10 list of luxurious places to live. ``Dogs just get lost in those
apartments, and the walls are thick, anyway _ and there's also
staff to make sure they don't bark.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaggy dog stories abound. ``One couple had a big dog that had
to be interviewed _ a large, rambunctious, jumping dog,'' said
Southerlyn Marino, a spokeswoman at the Corcoran Group. ``So they
gave the dog some mild tranquilizers, and he was just fine. The
couple was accepted, and the dog was especially praised for being
so docile.''
</P>
<P>
   Another couple, fretting that their rather yappy dachshund would
wreck their chance to buy a $400,000 TriBeCa loft, pulled a
bait-and-switch: after the closing, the couple confessed to their
broker that they had substituted another dog at the interview: its
better behaved sister.
</P>
<P>
   To advocates of dogs' rights, these strategies _ by dog owner
and board member _ strike a jarring note.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your daughter doesn't have to sit for the doorman, why does
your dog?'' asked Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals. ``These boards need rules, not
pogroms.'' Dogs, she concluded, ``are not furniture _ they're
family.''

<P>
   The Cavanaughs couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Cavanaugh, 69, said she was devastated when her beloved
Irish wolfhound died suddenly in February. She and her husband,
John M. Cavanaugh, 72, were almost as shocked when, the day after
the dog died, their co-op board dropped them a note saying that the
board had decreed that the Cavanaughs could not replace the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we were still too upset; we weren't even thinking of
that,'' Mrs. Cavanaugh said. ``My husband got very upset, and
called the board president. He said the letter was a little
insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cavanaughs have decided to move to another Manhattan
apartment, which must be dog-friendly because the Cavanaughs have
decided to get another dog. This time, they want a border terrier.
``We hate to move,'' Mrs. Cavanaugh said. ``We kept the apartment
all these years. But we were very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem now is finding an apartment that allows dogs. ``A
lot do not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Woodruff, a 27-year-old disc jockey and record producer
who came to New York City from Georgia two years ago, was lucky to
find a rental for himself and his Jack Russell terrier, Robert, 4.
Now he has spent four months searching for a place to buy. ``It's
such a low percentage of dog-friendly buildings,'' he said. ``It's
a real pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The city is hard on dogs, Woodruff said, yet people are
dependent on them. ``We're all so isolated in our small
apartments,'' he explained. ``I mean, we have girlfriends or
boyfriends or whatever, but in the end, who's going to keep you
company, and always be there for you?'' He paused, wistfully.
``Right, Robert?''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne L'Hernault spent a whole year trying to find a building
that allowed both her and her dog, a Labrador retriever named
Miska.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after she had signed the contract _ but before she had
closed _ the board changed the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was maybe four weeks away from the closing, and they made
it a no-dog building,'' said Ms. L'Hernault (pronounced Renault), a
lawyer for a downtown firm. ``I'd sold my house in New Jersey. I
made quick arrangements. I put a message on the Internet and found
someone to act as a foster parent for the dog.'' She moved in first
without the dog. ``I thought it was such a big building _ 35
stories _ that I could ease the dog in on weekends; nobody would
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   But as luck would have it, the board president lived down the
hall and before long spotted her taking Miska out for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   `'Three days later, I got a letter,'' she said. ``I ended up
selling the apartment nine months after I bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel too sorry for Miska and Ms. L'Hernault. The lawyer
said she made a nice profit on her sale _ and the Lab now lives in
South Orange, N.J., with a nice lawn for frolicking.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A broad flow of high-level winds from west to east will continue
to deliver rather mild Pacific air masses across most of the
nation. As the moist winds impinge upon west-facing mountain
slopes, locally heavy mountain snow will be common from the
Cascades to the central and northern Rockies. Farther east, many
small disturbances embedded in the fast winds aloft will lead to
unsettled conditions from the Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Moist, gusty winds will sweep across the Northwest, promoting
coastal showers and mountain snow in the Northwestern states. Snow
levels between 2,000 and 3,000 feet will be common from the
Cascades to the Bitterroots. East of the Cascades, after a period
of rain in the valleys Sunday morning, gradual drying will develop
in the wake of a front. Farther south, high pressure will keep the
Southwestern states dry and seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   A weak front accompanied by patchy clouds will move east from
the northern and central Plains. In the wake of the front, sunshine
will be ample and temperatures will remain far above the seasonal
average.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds, patchy rain and drizzle will surround a weakening
low-pressure system as it moves toward the eastern Ohio Valley. A
band of heavier showers will occur in the interior Southeast where
humid air will flow north from the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic coasts will have some sunshine early
which will fade behind increasing clouds as increasingly mild and
moist breezes from the south develop.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Two Jet Streams
</P>
<P>
   On average, the jet stream patterns in the northern and southern
hemispheres are very different. Jet stream winds are driven by
horizontal temperature contrasts. The thermal difference from
equator to pole is the primary source of energy for the jet stream.
In the north, which has more land and topography than the south,
the additional temperature contrasts between land and ocean promote
a serpentine jet stream flow. The current straight west-to-east jet
stream winds in the north are similar to the typical southern
hemisphere flow which keeps arctic air restricted to polar regions.

TRUMP FINANCIAL AFFAIRS FACE POLITICAL SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There may be many reasons to run for president of the
United States, but the chance to turn a profit on the campaign
trail is generally not one of them. Unless the office-seeker
happens to be Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only candidate who makes money when he runs,'' said
Trump, who is toying with seeking the Reform Party's nomination for
president. Trump commands $100,000 a speech, he said, adding, with
his trademark hyperbole, that he was the highest-paid lecturer in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that is strictly true _ the Washington Speakers
Bureau, which represents him and other famous speakers, did not
return repeated telephone calls _ most political hopefuls speak
free, at length, to anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   If Trump does decide to run _ and he says he will do so only if
he is confident that he can win _ his financial affairs are likely
to start attracting the kind of attention that until now has been
reserved for his colorful personal style (and colorful personal
life).
</P>
<P>
   That is in part because profits, broadly speaking, are an
important plank in Trump's potential platform. For one thing, if he
runs he has promised to campaign using as much as $100 million of
his own money, money he says he has made primarily as a real estate
developer (he is also a casino operator, advertising icon and
author).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, according to his new book _ ``The America We
Deserve'' (Renaissance Books), written with Dave Shiflett, a
conservative commentator _ Trump's wealth helps qualify him for
higher office. ``Politicians are on the take and looking for job
security,'' he writes. ``Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump has not filed financial disclosure documents, and right
now, even his supporters are not positive that he has $100 million
for a campaign. Using his own $100 million would mean he could not
accept federal matching funds and would not have to rely on
financing from special interest groups, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he really have that money? I don't know,'' said Rick
McCluhan, chairman of the Reform Party in Minnesota. On the other
hand, Trump has ``charisma and chutzpah,'' McCluhan said, as well
as the ability to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   That was in evidence on Wednesday, when Trump signed books in
the marble lobby of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Flanked by two
American flags, Trump faced a phalanx of television crews,
reporters and several hundred fans, political supporters, casino
patrons, autograph seekers, befuddled shoppers and tourists on
their way to Tiffany's next door. In an hour and a half, he said,
he sold 839 copies, at $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   Should Trump run for president? The crowd's opinion appeared to
be mixed. Patricia Joyce and her mother, Alice, were enthusiastic
(and they like his casinos, particularly Trump Plaza in Atlantic
City). Alvin Hirschberg, a retiree from Brooklyn, said no: ``He'll
see he is not as popular outside of New York as he thinks he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro A. Rivera shrugged. ``Well, he's got the money,'' Rivera
said. And in that opulent setting, who could doubt it?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Getting a grip on Trump's financial situation has never been
easy _ just ask the banks that lent him millions in the 1980s,
shortly before his real estate and gambling empire collapsed.
During his ``rough patch,'' as he calls it, in the early 1990s,
Trump personally owed about $900 million; his casinos filed for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Trump says he is worth about $5 billion. But Forbes
Magazine, which annually calculates the wealth of individuals for
its list of the 400 richest people in America, pegs Trump's net
worth at about $1.6 billion. ``That's a pretty aggressive number,''
said Peter Newcomb, the senior editor who supervises the project.
``If anything, it's high.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes tried to calculate what Trump could get if he had to sell
his holdings today. Trump values his properties based on what he
thinks they will be worth when they are completed and fully sold or
leased, Newcomb said. That makes a big difference in the case of
projects like redevelopment of the old rail yards on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, where only two of 16 residential buildings have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty lies in figuring out what Trump's real estate
ventures are worth. The Trump Organization is a private company,
and so does not have to disclose audited financial information.
Crain's New York Business magazine ranks the company as the
second-largest private company in the city, based on figures
supplied by Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Trump contends he is ``by far the biggest developer in New
York,'' a claim that makes other real estate titans roll their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the rather murky issue of ownership. Real estate
deals tend to be financially complex, and Trump's are particularly
complicated. He says he owns 50 percent or 100 percent of most of
his projects, and he does indeed own several, including parts of
the Trump Tower and all of 40 Wall Street, an office building that
he bought for the real estate equivalent of a song just before the
market in lower Manhattan took off.
</P>
<P>
   But in other cases, when Trump says he owns half the building,
what he seems to mean is that he has the right to half the profit
the building may generate in the future. That is the case with the
condominium he is building across from the United Nations (in the
teeth of fierce opposition from its wealthy neighbors and community
groups). The building will have 72 floors, but Trump advertises it
as 90-stories tall. A South Korean company actually put up the
money for the project.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trump's latest prize is the old General Motors building on Fifth
Avenue, which now has the letters T-R-U-M-P emblazoned on its
facade. But Conseco, an Indiana insurance company, put up most of
the down payment on the building, real estate specialists say.
Trump and Conseco are 50-50 partners in the 1998 deal and borrowed
$700 million together. But documents outlining the deal say the
partnership owes Conseco $270 million, and Trump provided a
personal guarantee on $200 million of the building loan. Trump
said, however, that he did not provide any guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors to Manhattan may feel they see the name Trump on
a dozen glittering facades, some of those buildings are
condominiums, and are therefore owned by the people who live in
them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case with the old Gulf and Western building near
Central Park, now called the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
General Electric's pension fund owned the building and hired Trump
to revamp it, which he did by covering it in bronze glass, fixing
its tendency to sway in high winds, and converting its office
spaces into condo apartments and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Trump as the developer received an undisclosed
percentage of the profits on the condos, which he says totaled $301
million. And he retains control of the building's commercial
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   All these fees do add up, and Trump also received $140 million
in 1996, when the Pritzker family bought out his share of the Grand
Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   So although he will not say on the record that he has $100
million in the bank, Trump asserted that he could easily come up
with that sum without selling any assets. ``Money today is very
plentiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Trump does have debts. He borrowed about $25
million from Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts, the public company that
owns three casinos in Atlantic City and a gambling riverboat in
Gary, Ind. That debt is secured by Trump's 40 percent stake in the
company itself, according to documents the company filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Trump borrowed the money so that he could repay a loan from
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the Wall Street firm that in 1995 and
1996 helped sell the casino company's stock to the public. When he
got that loan, Trump's shares were worth a lot of money; the stock
traded for more than $30 a share in the spring of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Trump casino company's shares change hands for less
than $3.50, so that Trump's shares (about 14 million according to
SEC filings, 16 million according to him) are worth $47 million to
$54 million. If he tried to sell them all at once, that would
probably depress the stock price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Trump says he has not repaid the loan not because he does not
have the money to do so, but as a favor to the casino company,
which is making more off his loan than it could get from putting
the money in certificates of deposit. The loan comes due in June,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company seems to need all the cash it can get. In the 12
months ended Sept. 30, it generated just enough cash to pay its
debt service and capital expenses, without much room to spare,
according to John Leupp, a fixed-income analyst at Donaldson
Lufkin. As a result, the company's bonds (it owes about $1.85
billion) are rated at the junkier end of the junk-bond scale, B and
B-minus, by Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Though Trump has just fired the president of his biggest casino,
the Trump Taj Mahal, he said that the casinos were ``doing very
well, making a lot of cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the value of his holdings, Trump said that if he
decided to run for president, he would put his businesses in a
trust, to be managed by someone else. The prospect appears to fill
him with gloom; even someone he trusts ``wouldn't run it the same
way,'' he said somberly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, exploring a bid for president has been ``a
lot of fun,'' Trump said. ``And I'm not spending very much money
doing it.''

FORMER GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA FACES THE TRIAL OF HIS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Calif., Texas)  (bl) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ For a quarter century, Edwin Edwards was
Louisiana's great guilty pleasure, the four-term governor whose
breezy misbehavior amused the voters while infuriating several
generations of federal law-enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   They charged him with rigging hospital licenses for cash in
1985, but the trial ended in a hung jury. They retried him the next
year, and he was acquitted. There has barely been a deal or a
handshake since then that some prosecutor or detective has not
scrutinized. One lawyer who is close to Edwards said that for 25
years, prosecutors had asked suspects in unrelated cases if they
had any damaging information on him.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning Monday, the former governor will face what almost
everyone acknowledges is the most serious prosecution of his
career, one that he may have difficulty eluding with the Cajun wit
that always beguiled previous juries.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when the jury and the people of Louisiana hear his
sleepy drawl in the U.S. Courthouse in Baton Rouge, he will not be
cracking wise about the women or the poker chips that have passed
through his hands. Instead, his voice will resonate from thousands
of hours of audio and video tapes secretly recorded by the FBI in
his home, office, car and a private plane. The government says the
tapes will show him directing extortion and fraud involving
riverboat casino licenses that brought him and his associates more
than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his various prosecutions, the government
will present former accomplices who will testify about repeated
acts of corruption to support the 28 felony counts against him. The
star witness will be Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., the former chairman
of the San Francisco 49ers, who is scheduled to testify that he
gave Edwards a briefcase containing $400,000 after Edwards warned
him that his application for a casino license would otherwise be
imperiled. DeBartolo negotiated a plea agreement in exchange for
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Edwards will be tried not in easygoing New
Orleans, where many black residents still support him, but in this
more conservative and staid capital city. ``Baton Rouge is more
suburban, more middle-class than New Orleans,'' said Bernie
Pinsonat, a local poll taker. ``A Baton Rouge jury is far less
likely to be mesmerized.''
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating of all, from the perspective of a master
charmer like Edwards, is an order from a dour and exacting federal
judge that prohibits him and lawyers for both sides from speaking
publicly about the case in any way, spelling an end to his defense
by uproarious sound bite. The clowning is over _ he will not be
riding to Judge Frank Polozola's courthouse in a horse and buggy,
as he once did in a previous trial.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to a gathering sense in Louisiana that Edwards,
72, is no longer quite as slippery as he used to be. Many Edwards
watchers were particularly surprised that he was careless enough to
be caught on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling now that Governor Edwards could really be on
the ropes,'' said Harry Rosenberg, the former U.S. attorney for the
district that includes New Orleans. ``We don't yet know all of
what's on the tapes, but all indications would lead us to believe
that the contents of those tapes will certainly change the public's
perception of Edwin Edwards. And they will perhaps change the
likelihood of a conviction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Through Edwards' four terms, voters put up with his gambling and
womanizing _ and what most assumed was much worse _ because he
taxed the oil business instead of them, cared about the poor and
kept them smiling even as they shook their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work hard, play hard, move fast and get things done,'' he
once said, and so episodes that would have been scandals for a
lesser politician were just another venial sin for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always believed he was following the law, but he loved to
give the appearance of not following it,'' said an old friend,
former state Sen. Edgar Mouton. ``That was his strength and
weakness at the same time. For everyone who said he was the biggest
thief ever to hit Louisiana, there was someone else who said he was
the greatest governor we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has led some people to believe that he is unshakable,
no matter the evidence against him. ``He's too smart to catch,''
said Donnie Hotard, a contractor at the Exxon chemical plant who
was shopping last week at the Wal-Mart in Port Allen, a grimy city
that is the kind of place where Edwards, a Democrat, has always
been popular. ``I don't think this trial or any trial is ever going
to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 6, 1998, indictment of Edwards and his five
co-defendants, one of whom is his son, Stephen Edwards, depicts a
man far more venal and calculating than his roguish public image.
The indictment says that while he was governor and after he left
office in 1996, Edwards and his aides devised five schemes to
manipulate the awarding of riverboat gambling licenses, extorting
millions from companies seeking the licenses, including
DeBartolo's.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in February 1997, the indictment says, Edwards, his
son and another co-defendant were taped discussing how to disguise
payments from a casino operator. Edwards suggested that they buy a
tugboat and rent it to the casino, then ``jack up the rental'' by
the amount of the payment, about $90,000 a month, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the indictment says, Edwards handed DeBartolo a
piece of paper at a Baton Rouge bar with the figure $400,000 on it,
and told DeBartolo that there would be problems with his casino
application if he did not pay it. A week later, Edwards flew to San
Francisco to pick up the cash, using a money vest to transport the
$100 bills to Louisiana, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   He was also charged with hiring a Mississippi man to wiretap the
home of the lead FBI agent in the case, to learn about the case
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who pleaded not guilty, has not been able to comment
since Polozola restricted his speech a few days after the
indictment. But earlier he said that as strange as it might seem,
he was merely accepting payments as a consultant to the casino
industry. Friends say he remains supremely confident of acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is expected to last up to three months, is only
the first of what may be a series of prosecutions stemming from the
two-year investigation. Edwards was also charged with fraud in a
separate case, in which he was accused of helping Cascade Insurance
Co. evade millions of dollars in state payments. And he was named
an unindicted co-conspirator in a case in which former Houston
Mayor Fred Hofheinz was accused of bribing an Edwards aide in order
to win state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all the charges against him in the casino case,
Edwards would face 350 years in prison and a fine of $7.25 million.
But the United States attorney heading the case, Eddie Jordan, has
made it clear that there is far more at stake here than the final
years of a gambler's life. Along with Edwards, what is really on
trial this week is an acceptance of political corruption that dates
to the days of Huey and Earl Long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Jordan said in charging Edwards, ``our efforts to
hold those accountable for the brazen acts of corruption described
in the indictment will eventually bring about a heightened
awareness among our citizens and those of other states that we will
not tolerate political and economic corruption here in Louisiana.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Lavinski is a piano teacher in Rochester, N.Y., who is
partial to Ravel, Chopin and Chick Corea. Arthur Bobby Harrison
volunteers as a boxing coach in downtown Syracuse. George Alexander
Shorts Jr. is a Brooklyn resident who has never been able to work
because of his broken toes.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is that they are all former inmates at
Attica who survived the bloodiest incident in the history of
America's prisons: the uprising and siege of 1971 in which 43
people were killed and more than 80 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   When a federal judge proposed a settlement Tuesday that would
give up to 1,281 inmates a total of $8 million as compensation for
the abuse they suffered at the hands of state police 29 years ago,
it thrust the survivors into the public eye as the men behind the
statistics in so many history books, movies and news accounts of
the siege.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many of the survivors seem to support the settlement,
even though they doubt that it will heal any of their wounds from
that era. But they are also undergoing a cathartic process,
pondering the effect of Attica and how their lives have unfolded _
or in some cases unraveled _ in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my best to forget Attica even existed,'' said Shorts, 63,
who was convicted of robbery in 1965 and was released from prison
in 1972 after his toes were broken by state troopers during the
siege. He has lived on welfare and Supplemental Security Income
since. ``My life is kind of hard: I'm in pain 24/7. The settlement?
A few thousand dollars? It will make no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   To plot the lives of these men, most of whom are
African-American and Latino, is to hear stories about broken
families and broken neighborhoods, bad habits and bad choices. Many
grew up in tough neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx,
or Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Some have reassembled their lives with astonishing success,
starting businesses, nurturing families, serving their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard X. Clark, 53, is a Queens native who grew up in foster
homes, attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and
enlisted in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Six months out of the service, Clark was arrested on charges of
attempted robbery and eventually sent to Attica Correctional
Facility, about 30 miles east of Buffalo. Appalled by prison
conditions, he became active with black Muslim political groups and
became one of the leaders of the 1971 siege.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in 1972, he wrote a book, ``Brothers of
Attica'' (1973, Links), moved to Greensboro, N.C., to give his twin
sons a gentler, slower environment, then returned to New York about
10 years ago. He now works as a case manager for Phase Piggy Back,
a Harlem-based organization that provides drug and alcohol
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay your debts to society,'' Clark said. ``A wrong was
committed against us, we paid our debt, they have to pay theirs.
Money cannot make up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New York City resident, Daniel Sheppard, pursued a
different course. After serving five years on charges of robbery
and manslaughter, crimes he insists he did not commit, Sheppard,
now 57, enrolled at Baruch College in the late 1970s to study
accounting and international marketing. He also took up fencing
while at Baruch, becoming highly ranked nationally in epee.
</P>
<P>
   After he quit the sport, partly because of a bad back that he
says started with the beatings at Attica, Sheppard sold latex
rubber gloves wholesale before becoming a stay-at-home father and
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are ashamed of their pasts,'' he said. ``I was
innocent but couldn't prove it. I felt society committed a wrong
against me, so I hold my head up high.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Lavinski, the piano teacher in Rochester. One of
the relatively few white inmates at Attica, he was only 19 when he
was sentenced on a charge of criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   After his release in 1972, Lavinski took up a variety of jobs in
upstate New York and Vermont: waiter, piano player, restaurant
owner, painter, remodeler and now piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me real strong,'' Lavinski, 49, said about his
experience at Attica. ``Just the idea of getting arrested and
thrown in jail just freaks me. My freedom, I really treasure
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But other inmates have never successfully returned to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like shells of men,'' said Harrison, 52, the volunteer
boxing coach. ``They reverted to drugs and alcohol and didn't want
to face the reality of dealing with the system, because the system
was the thing that screwed everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Twiggs Mathis, for instance, has struggled with an assortment of
addictions and arrests. A Rochester native, Mathis, 52, was sent to
Attica in 1971 after violating parole for a grand larceny
conviction. He got out the same year, but not before he and
hundreds of other prisoners were forced to crawl naked over broken
glass while at the mercy of club-wielding state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   He has since drifted in and out of prison, on and off cocaine
and marijuana, unable to keep a steady job, unable to afford
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to stay clean and straighten out my life and do
something positive,'' Mathis said. ``The settlement, it could help
me out a lot and get me some peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Eddie Dingle, a Brooklyn native who served almost 10 years
for robbery and homicide, the settlement is ``long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingle, now 55, lives in the Bronx and works as a supervisor at
the Addicts Rehabilitation Center in Harlem. He has come full
circle: just a few years ago, he was a patient at the center,
trying to end a crack cocaine addiction, come to grips with the
memories of Attica and grapple with his earlier failures as a
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to work out stuff with this Attica thing in my
head, and I'm thinking, how am I going to raise these kids?''
Dingle said, adding that his two sons, 34 and 36, have had their
share of drug problems, too. ``I didn't have a chance to raise
them. I tried to smoke myself out of the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who now have jobs and are settled in their
communities have been rattled, somewhat, by the news of the
settlement. A reporter's questions about Attica caused George
Nieves, a social worker who works with AIDS patients at Mount
Vernon Hospital, to begin a long, emotional description of state
troopers' playing Russian roulette with him, all night long, during
the siege.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Nieves, who was in prison for 11 years on a
manslaughter conviction, is suspicious of authority figures and
occasionally afraid that his telephone has been tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mention Attica, a lot of things come back to me, and
I'm not the same person,'' said Nieves, who was homeless for
several years in Manhattan, addicted to drugs and alcohol, before
getting a boost from his second wife, and Clark of Phase Piggy Back
in Harlem. ``But don't mention Attica, and I feel like a new
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the lawyers who negotiated the proposed settlement are
trying to contact as many of the 1,281 eligible men as possible,
either by phone, public notices or mail in time for a Feb. 14
hearing before Judge Michael Telesca of U.S. District Court in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least 400 people are expected to file claims, said
Daniel Meyers, a Manhattan lawyer representing the inmates. Like
several of his colleagues, Meyers has been involved in the Attica
case for most of his career. The lawyers estimate that 400 more may
be dead, though their heirs can file a claim if they meet a series
of legal requirements. About 50 are still in prison, Meyers said.
The rest may either be impossible to locate or simply uninterested
because of the stigma of having been in Attica and a part of the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, especially in white rural communities of New York
state, have said that in no circumstance would they want their
names or stories to be told,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement still remains subject to approval from Judge
Telesca. And some men may present objections to the amount of the
settlement. The judge will determine individual awards, which are
to vary according to the injuries suffered in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   But many inmates seem to believe that the settlement will be as
good an offer as they can get, even though they would have
preferred that the state formally admit wrongdoing for the
troopers' actions in aggressively ending the siege. If that is the
consensus, then the money _ which excludes$4 million in lawyers'
fees _ should be disbursed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys went crazy waiting for this payoff,'' Harrison
said. ``And they're the same guys who said, `I'll have a drink
today, because I'm getting money from the state.' Well, that day
turned into 10 years, then 20 years, then 30 years. And all of a
sudden, 30 years have gone by, you can't stand up, your kidneys are
gone, and you say, `What took 30 years to come to this point?'''

 &HT;    Age bias real, but hard to prove
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six months before she was eligible to retire early
with benefits, Jane M. Broome says she was dismissed from her job.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before, Broome had watched several of her peers take
early retirement as her company merged with a competitor. New
workers were hired, and before long, Broome says, her department
began to look quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dawned on me that I was the oldest lady left from our
original company,'' she says. When she left, ``I was told they
hired a young man,'' she adds. ``I thought it was age
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Broome, 56, is one of a growing number of workers who suspect
that their age is an unfair liability in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are thinking they have been discriminated
against,'' says Linda L. Garland, economic security representative
for AARP, the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced she was treated unfairly, Broome filed her case with
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Atlanta office.
The EEOC dismissed her discrimination complaint but told Broome she
could pursue the issue further in court. She has started that
process.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases can be tough to prove, experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being treated badly is not the same as being treated in a
discriminatory manner,'' Garland says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since its passage in 1967, lawsuits filed under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act have been on the rise, according
to a 1999 report on the employment of older workers published by
the Committee for Economic Development, a nonpartisan, independent
public policy organization made up of academic and business
leaders. Under the law, it is illegal to discriminate against
workers age 40 and older in the areas of salary and compensation
and the privileges and conditions of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The exact reason for the rise in complaints is unclear. ``This
may simply indicate a greater willingness on the part of workers to
pursue legal action or the courts to permit it,'' the committee
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``There is no definitive measure of the prevalence of age
discrimination ... (but) we do have strong evidence that it
occurs'' in the American workplace, the organization asserts,
despite the current booming economy and low unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many instances of discrimination never make it to
court but simply occur in the hiring process, unbeknown to the
older job seeker, labor economist Marc Bendick Jr. illustrated in a
recent study. The study was funded by the AARP and published in the
Journal of Aging and Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Bendick paired job candidates ages 32 and 57 with
similar skills and experience and sent them on job interviews.
About 40 percent of the time, Bendick found that the older workers
encountered some form of discrimination. That's a rate higher than
the approximately 20 percent to 25 percent rate found in similar
tests measuring racial bias, says Bendick, a Washington-based
economist who has been studying employment discrimination for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the question is if there's a level playing field among the
older and younger workers out there, the answer is definitely
not,'' says Bendick.
</P>
<P>
   The result is, said AARP's Garland, ``Older workers are between
a rock and hard place because they are getting (pressure) on two
ends'' _ age-related on-the-job prejudice and age discrimination in
hiring, says Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's work with AARP members begins with sending them the
organization's ``Age Discrimination on the Job'' booklet. If, after
reading what an employer can and cannot do, the person feels
injured under the wording of the the federal law, Garland informs
the worker of the right to argue the claim with the EEOC. She also
passes along a list of attorneys who handle age discrimination
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to file with EEOC and file suit separately,''
she says. ``EEOC prosecutes only one percent of the cases that come
to it,'' she estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Bendick offers this advice for older workers seeking employment
or those still at work:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Steel yourself not to get discouraged,'' he says.
``According to our study, 60 percent of the employers were not
discriminating, so there are jobs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Your job search may take longer, but don't lose heart, he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You do have to recognize the stereotypes the employers have
in mind, even employers that don't intend to discriminate,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers are commonly believed to be less dedicated to
their careers, less energetic, less inventive, harder to supervise
and not technologically up to date, Bendick says. ``Don't let the
implicit stereotypes rule the conversation,'' he cautions.
``Proactively address those stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the story technique,'' Bendick counsels. ``Come into the
interview with concrete, convincing, true and specific stories to
illustrate and provide proof of your qualifications,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Use these anecdotes to show that you are energetic, resourceful,
productive and dedicated to doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your problem with ageism occurs with your current employer,
try to look for lateral moves or other ways to remove yourself from
the center of the conflict, Bendick says.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy: Take personal responsibility for acquiring and
maintaining technological skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days in which you could coast on your performance are
over. Older workers do have to be prepared to face the
competition,'' agrees Bendick.

 &HT;    Resources to aid a career change
 &HT;    By Brian Stevens
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Could the new year mean a new career with new
goals for you? January provides a perfect opportunity to evaluate
careerobjectives. Where do you want your career to go in the new
century and how can you take it there?
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Krueger, director of the Wright State University Office
of Career Services, said exploration is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't have a specific career idea in mind, take
time to do some exploration to know what skills you offer and what
resources are available to you,'' Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger said the best career counselors work one on one to
prompt ideas and identify resources and how best to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your transferable skills,'' Krueger said. Can you put
your skills and knowledge to work for you? For example, experience
may make you competitive in a new field or help you move up in your
present field, Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determine the similarities and differences between where you
are now and where you'd like to be,'' Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger suggests talking with others in and outside your field
``to help you realize skills you don't know you have.''
</P>
<P>
   One career-oriented Web site, with the humble title monster.com,
offers tips on career strategies. On it, career counselor Barbara
Reinhold outlines five steps to success on the job, beginning with
the promise, ``I will prepare for career success in the 21st
century by doing these five things everyday.'' Those five
resolutions:
</P>
<P>
   _ When something goes right, I'll take unqualified credit; when
I goof, I'll answer for it openly without feeling ashamed or
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will learn something new every day and figure out how to
apply it to be even better at my work.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will begin each day by programming into that day three
things that will bring me real pleasure, before, during, or after
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will be sure that I listen attentively more than I talk each
day, no matter my line of work or position.
</P>
<P>
   _ I will give honest feedback to people as an essential part of
how I do my job, emphasizing the positive as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhold suggests selecting a friend or colleague to hold you to
these five steps _ someone who can help you challenge and evaluate
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Boer, another monster.com ``career guru,'' said ``a trusted
and powerful mentor,'' is your best ticket to career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, a mentor shows you the ropes, introduces
you to the right people and points you in the right direction,
suggesting training and professional development opportunities,''
Boer said.
</P>
<P>
   RESOURCES
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Krueger, director of the Wright State University Office
of Career Services, said there is no end to available career
resources. ``There are a lot of different philosophies and
resources out there, and people should take advantage of them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   _ www.labor.state.ny.us: This site, from the New York State
Department of Labor, offers the following career-planning steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a personal profile, including your interests, skills,
personal preferences and needs, accomplishments and values.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investigate careers and occupations that match your personal
profile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand the job market, including occupations, the
employment outlook, industries and the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Identify your goal and then make a plan for achieving it.

 &HT;    Authors prescribe movies as''self-medication'' to improve mood
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For this therapy session, you need to dim the
lights, cuddle a quilt, and pop, pour or scoop a snack plump with
fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   Now insert a movie into the VCR, usurp the remote and let the
therapeutic powers of the illuminated screen channel through your
body.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``cinematherapy.'' And you, the mentally distracted one,
get to choose your own counselor to straighten out the kvetches
forcing your personal world to spin a little lopsided at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling used and abused by your boss and your time clock? Dolly
Parton and Lily Tomlin will let you kick back and listen to their
own complaints about their ``Nine to Five'' job.
</P>
<P>
   Did you get dumped? Are you out for blood? Take some lessons
from Kathy Bates' character in ``Misery,'' (or at least fantasize
about cutting the phone lines and breaking his ankles).
</P>
<P>
   And if it's been an overall bad hair day that's caused your
nervous ends to split, Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman and Peter
Gallagher will help recondition your psyche and massage your aching
head all ``While You Were Sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mood, the funk, or the time of the month, a movie
exists to pull you through _ at least temporarily. That's according
to the authors of the book ``Cinematherapy _ The Girl's Guide to
Movies for Every Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are more than entertainment: they're self-medication,''
said co-author Nancy Peske.
</P>
<P>
   And while she and co-author and first-cousin Beverly West admit
they conducted little psychological research to back their claim,
the self-proclaimed movie fanatics offer plenty of personal
evidence as proof.
</P>
<P>
   Movies helped ease the pain of West's divorce and helped Peske
turn her career efforts from editing to writing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of times women will watch movies to bring up
issues in their lives,'' Peske says. ``Sometimes we want to laugh
at life, sometimes we watch movies in order to wallow in our mood,
and sometimes it's to snap out of it. Even when movies are pure
entertainment, we're connecting to them for very emotional
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting is a basic human need, said Annita Maxwell, a
licensed professional counselor in private practice. When there's
not another human to provide comfort or escape from a situation,
movies are a good way to receive that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes recommend entertainment (in stress-management
seminars) to help change that stress and sometimes even for people
who are mildly depressed,'' she said. ``It's good to be able to see
someone else in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors' prescription was so convincing that cable network
Romance Classics has bought the rights to the book and will begin
airing a nightly program called ``Cinematherapy'' on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, two fictional ``cinematherapists'' will introduce
the night's movie by providing humorous advice on the therapeutic
benefits of that night's featured film. Peske and West serve as
creative consultants and write the scripts for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Advice the cinematherapists dish out could come from the
authors' ``Handy Hunk Chart,'' which rates male movie stars based
on their amount of raw unpredictable masculinity and whether they
have a drowsy drool or bedroom eyes. Or they might classify movies
as having dresses to die for (``Age of Innocence'') or apartments
to die for (``Breakfast at Tiffany's''). Or how to avoid ``Phony
Gal Films'' that make us mad like ``Spice World'' and ``Jerry
Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television acts as somewhere (women) can go to disconnect from
the demands of everyday life,'' said Jennifer Geisser, vice
president of public relations for Romance Classics. ``We want them
to be able to put (''Cinematherapy'') on and relax and unwind and
rejuvenate.''
</P>
<P>
   Film scholars have studied the influence of movies on people's
lives since the beginning of the cinema, said Garth S. Jowett,
professor of communication at the University of Houston and author
of ``Children and the Movies: Media Influences and Payne Fund
Controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no historical research shows that movies impact women
more emotionally than men. But so-called ``chick flicks'' usually
deal with women's emotional needs more than men's because women are
more encouraged to show their emotions publicly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masculine films,'' more action in nature, influence men in
more tangible ways like how to dress or how to behave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jowett said good screenwriters and film makers consider the kind
of mood they will create for the audience when they are making a
film.
</P>
<P>
   But just taking enough time to watch a movie can be therapeutic
for anyone, Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people don't get enough entertainment because they're
too busy with their family and children,'' she said. ``Each of us
have a different demand from ourself to have time alone, and it is
a growth, a regeneration. That's important for good mental
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some movies, such as ``Titanic,'' (recommended as a
``men-behaving-well movie'') are better viewed on the big screen,
Peske said. But most of the time, cinematherapy can be conducted in
your own home, with friends or alone. Just make sure there aren't
any interruptions, including commercials, during your ``session.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The important fact is that it's two hours uninterrupted,''
Peske said. ``Taking that time out for yourself is very important,
and sometimes you want to share it with others, and sometimes you
want to take charge of your own remote. It's so important to
recharge your batteries.''

 &HT;    FOR MIAMI'S EXILES, PASSIONS ABOUT COMMUNIST CUBA, CASTRO RUN
DEEP
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By Mike Williams 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Dressed in a stylish business suit and heels, investment
banker Lourdes Blanco didn't look the part of an angry protestor
demonstrating against the decision to send 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But even if she didn't carry a Cuban flag and chant
``Libertad!'' the 30-something executive still felt passionately
enough about the boy's fate to turn out during her lunch hour for
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here at six years old from Cuba, and my family went
through a lot,'' she said, speaking in calm tones and impeccable
English. ``My mother was a political prisoner. She was in jail just
before I was born. People in this country don't understand. You
have to experience living in Cuba to know what goes on in that
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside South Florida, young Elian's story seems sad but simple
to many Americans: Blood ties are more important than politics, so
in the best interests of the child, send him back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cuban-Americans _ or exiles, as they are called _ the
issue is much more complex, and emotional. For many of them,
politics isn't about abstract policies or ideas. It is intensely
personal, born of pain, loss and separation. It is about morals and
principles.
</P>
<P>
   And passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that 75 percent of Cuban-Americans
in this country were born in Cuba,'' said Dario Moreno, himself a
Cuban immigrant who now teaches political science at Miami's
Florida International University. ``They remember Cuba and what
they lost when they left there. For them it is black and white,
good and evil. Fidel is the devil incarnate, Cuba is hell on earth
and sending a six-year-old boy back to that hell is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, students of exile politics say Miami's Cuban
immigrants aren't as unified _ or as rabid _ as televised images of
the protests might make it seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a few hundred people who are going from
place to place to have these protests,'' said Max Castro, another
Cuban immigrant who is a research associate at the University of
Miami's North-South Center. ``Surveys here have shown that about 75
percent of Cuban-Americans want Elian to stay in Miami. But about
68 percent of (Miami-Dade) county's Hispanics don't approve of the
protests blocking the streets and disrupting traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban-American community _ which numbers more than
750,000 _ has captured headlines through the years, earning the
reputation as a place of extreme opinions and a knee-jerk
anti-Communism that at times has provoked disbelief and even scorn
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, the joke goes, is one of the few cities in the country
where a leader's stand on foreign policy issues is more important
than his or her position on garbage collection, property taxes or
the other traditional bread-and-butter issues of local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Miami's leaders have made headlines for
taking stands that would be unheard of in other local political
arenas. In the early 1990s, they triggered a national boycott by
African-Americans when they snubbed visiting South African hero
Nelson Mandela because of his friendship with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, city officials refused to host a Special
Olympics competition on municipal property because handicapped
children from Cuba were to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation that was founded on the principle of tolerance and
strives for a stated goal of inclusion for all, the Cuban exiles
have appeared to some as bombastic, unreasonable, extreme.
</P>
<P>
   And the case of Elian has reinforced that image. Nothing could
be more heart-rending than the story of a child witnessing his
mother drowning at sea and then barely surviving himself. And to
many Americans, nothing could be more heartless than to keep the
child from his loving father, to place politics ahead of one of the
most deeply felt and universal of human emotions, the bond between
parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   For all the show and bluster of the protests, it's clear the
case is very troubling to many Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Cuban, but I'm a parent,'' said Tanay Alonso, who lives
only a few houses down from the home where Elian has been staying
with his relatives in Miami's Little Havana section. ``If something
should happen to my husband, I'd want my kids to be with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service was
absolutely correct and courageous,'' he said. ``None of the facts
can overcome that there is a loving father and four loving
grandparents in Cuba who want this child back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other Cuban immigrants may hold such opinions, but
may be reluctant to state them. Many, too, may feel that while
Elian would be better off in Miami, it is wrong to do anything more
than write a letter or make a telephone call to express that
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the small number of activists will probably continue
to set the agenda _ and get the most media attention _ in Miami.
Protests by a few hundred committed people will create the image of
an entire community on the verge of exploding in anger.
</P>
<P>
   And even the experts who say the range of opinion is more subtle
than news accounts have shown agree that if Elian finally goes to
Cuba, the event will probably draw thousands to the streets instead
of hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Because for too many Cuban-Americans, the pain of their own
experience _ or that of relatives left behind in Castro's Communist
Cuba _ is still too vivid to allow any shadings of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here from Cuba, my own son was six years old,''
said Oscar Garcia, 68, who joined in a protest in downtown Miami
this week. ``It was the hardest decision of my life, because like
everyone, I came with my pockets out. We had nothing. But I did it
for my son. Today, he is a successful architect. That is the kind
of future I want for Elian.''

 &HT;    Love bridges war, separation and uncertainty for two Rwandan
refugees
 &HT;    By Brad Buchholz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I stumbled onto Gilbert's Story by accident _
which, for me, is a great part of its beauty. I was teaching a
remedial writing class, in 1997, at Austin Community College.
Gilbert was a student. Right away, I noticed that Gilbert carried
himself with a rare sense of grace. He was cheerful, yet earnest
about his studies. He sat in the first row. A teacher's dream.
</P>
<P>
   One day, early in the semester, Gilbert turned in an essay about
marriage. In his paper, he wrote that a good marriage required
patience, and compromise, and faith. In terms of structure, the
paper was flawless. Yet Gilbert was nowhere to be found in his own
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fine essay,'' I said. ``But you left me wondering:
Are these observations grounded in personal experience? Are you
really married?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes!'' Gilbert responded brightly.
</P>
<P>
   We agreed, in his revision, that Gilbert would explain himself _
that he would share with the reader how he came to understand these
great truths.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Gilbert returned with a new essay, rich with
unexpected detail _ about his homeland of Rwanda, about the
genocide of 1994, about tragedy and flight, about his new life as
an African refugee in America. It told the story of how he met his
wife, how he lost his wife and how he feared for her safety even
now _ for she was still stranded in Africa. Would he ever see her
again?
</P>
<P>
   I read Gilbert's Story, during class, as the students took a
test _ and I was numb to the behind-the-books giggles of some of
the students. Then I looked at Gilbert, diligently lost in his
work, a man who exuded the most beautiful sense of optimism in the
face of tragedy. What a remarkable story, I thought. And it had
only just begun ...
</P>
<P>
   THE CHILD OF KIGALI
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda is a small country _ not even twice the size,
geographically, of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. It's a
beautiful place: the country of ``Gorillas in the Mist.'' The
Rwandans have a name for their homeland: Imisozi Igihumbi. The Land
of a Thousand Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Habarurema grew up in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. It
was at a baptism, in 1992, when he met Felicite _ a stately beauty
with soulful dark eyes. They quickly fell in love. ``It was
wonderful,'' says Gilbert shyly, recalling their courtship. It's a
bold statement, for him, for his is a culture of understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, marriage was not an option _ at least not then. ``In
Rwanda, you have to have a way to take care of a wife. And I did
not have that yet,'' says Gilbert. He was 24 in 1992, still living
at home with his parents, splitting time between school and his job
at the bank. Felicite was a year younger, studying economics.
</P>
<P>
   Years passed. The lovers grew close, and a nation cracked apart.
For generations, the sorrow of Rwanda has been the rivalry between
Hutus and Tutsis _ an ethnic division incited by Europeans and
their churches, years ago, as a way to divide the nation from
itself and maintain colonial authority. These tensions continued to
boil in independent Rwanda until April 6, 1994 _ when the country
went berserk on the day its president, moderate Hutu Juvenal
Habyarimana, died in a mysterious airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, radical Hutus ran wild in the streets of Kigali.
They slaughtered Tutsis. They slaughtered Tutsi sympathizers. They
slaughtered Habyarimana's moderate confidants. They slaughtered
Hutus who merely looked like Tutsi's.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's family was slaughtered, too, when the mob overran the
house on the first night _ for his father was known as a Tutsi
sympathizer. Gilbert lost his mother, his father, two brothers and
a sister. Gilbert survived only by hiding in the attic during the
attack. He waited hours _ two full days, actually _ to come down,
never sure if it would be safe in the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING FLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   When he did emerge, Gilbert sought the help of a neighbor _ who
helped him leave Kigali by night and flee to neighboring Zaire, 50
miles to the west. Behind him, the slaughter continued, as more
than 500,000 Rwandans died during the systematic, nationwide
genocide of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When armed Tutsi rebels wrested power from the Hutu militiamen
in July, Gilbert returned to Kigali _ only to find his family's
house overrun by refugees from Burundi. Gilbert's quest to regain
his home was met with indignation. Word spread that he was his
family's sole survivor. What's more, there was no sign of Felicite.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of a plot to kill him, Gilbert fled again in
November 1994 _ crossing the border into Uganda and then into
Kenya, a three-day journey covering more than 500 miles. At the
Uganda-Kenya border, he befriended a pastor who put him on a
midnight bus and bribed a border guard to gain safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he found sanctuary in Nairobi, Kenya, Gilbert had
lost everything: his home, his family, his livelihood, and
certainly his innocence. Through the United Nations, he applied for
refugee status in the United States _ and waited. Nairobi was a
hellhole, swarming with displaced Rwandans. Gilbert still feared
for his life _ for he had to share the streets with radical Hutu
refugees who had participated in the Kigali slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Felicite? ``I could not imagine her,'' says Gilbert,
``because I did not know where she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later _ June 1995 _ Gilbert ran into an old friend
from Kigali who passed on miraculous news: Felicite was alive. He
had seen her, walking on the streets of Mombasa, in eastern Kenya.
Gilbert scrounged money for a bus ticket _ and within a matter of
days, he found her. Felicite was living with a sympathetic Kenyan
family, playing indoors with their young children, when Gilbert
arrived late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Felicite and called her in her name, she looked at
me as if she could not believe it was me,'' he says. ``We hugged
each other and could not restrain our tears. We spent almost 30
minutes without saying any word to each other, mostly because of
the emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Felicite had survived the first wave of genocide _ she had been
on holiday, outside of Kigali, in April 1994 _ but she had been
forced to separate from her mother and father and go into hiding
with another family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were problems with women and soldiers. Rape,'' says
Gilbert. ``A soldier could ask marriage _ by force _ and there was
nothing for the woman to do. And that's why she had to flee'' in
May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert and Felicite returned to Nairobi, where they were
married March 11, 1996. There would be no church wedding; no white
dress; no diamond ring. ``I didn't have much money in Kenya,'' says
Gilbert. ``I bought a ring, outside the court where we got married.
It was very cheap, the kind of ring people on the street sell to
couples who maybe forgot their ring on the way to the wedding. It
was all I could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   As a married couple, Gilbert and Felicite shared a single week
in Nairobi. Then, on March 18, Gilbert reluctantly boarded an
airplane to the United States _ alone _ having been approved for
refugee status. In accordance with U.S. immigration laws, Felicite
would have to apply on her own, a process that could take as long
as four years. Worlds apart, husband and wife would have little to
hold on to _ a $4 band of silver, a wedding photograph and the
reluctant hope that fate might bring them together again.
</P>
<P>
   COMING TO TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Gilbert diligently set up a new life for himself with
the assistance of Caritas. He got a job baking bread at H-E-B. He
took English classes. He enrolled at ACC. He shared an apartment
for a while, then got a place of his own. Surely, his wife would
join him soon. Surely ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going crazy at that time,'' says Gilbert, ``I didn't
know what to do. I would ask everybody, what to do, trying to get
information. I worried about her at night. There are so many
thieves in Nairobi. They might rape her or steal what was in her
bag. Even if there are police watching, it does not matter. There
are so many people who are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time _ 1997 _ that Gilbert attended my class
at ACC. There was no outward sign that he was in pain _ crazy with
doubt and fear. His essays were meticulously prepared, thorough. I
could tell he was investing huge amounts of time on revisions _ a
remarkable act of discipline considering that he was also drafting
letters to U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett and refugee information centers
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert placed out of my class midway through the term. Yet he
asked permission to stay anyway _ for he thought it the responsible
thing to do. Sometimes, he would come to class with letters to
Washington, asking, shyly, if I might make a telephone call to the
State Department on his behalf. I was supposed to be a journalist,
after all. Someone who could make things happen.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, I would run into Gilbert when I shopped at
H-E-B. Always smiling, looking so unfamiliar in his white apron and
paper hat, he would tell me that a breakthrough was expected ``any
day now'' for months on end. He had learned, however, that Felicite
had found refuge in a convent _ an island of safety in crazy
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   One day I encountered Gilbert at a time of great crisis. It
involved a birthday cake. Two college-age women were agitated,
registering their animated complaints to the Rwandan baker.
Everything had been ruined! The party would be spoiled! A name had
been misspelled, perhaps. Or the frosting was pink instead of blue.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert stood behind the counter, patiently taking on all
accusations _ though I'd bet my job that he'd had nothing to do
with the decoration of the hapless cake. He was doing a marvelous
job, in fact, handling the trivial complaint with the familiar
sense of dignity and calm that I had come to know in class. Yet I
couldn't resist butting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave this guy alone,'' I said, so clumsy in the light of
Gilbert's grace. ``You have no idea! This guy is a hero, the
bravest man you'll ever know. ...''
</P>
<P>
   THE REUNION
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's good news came late in 1997. Thanks to changes in U.S.
immigration policy and Rep. Doggett's attention to the petition
process, Felicite's passage to America had been finalized. She
arrived just before Christmas elated and exhausted. She was
hospitalized within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors think she had malaria,'' Gilbert said,
matter-of-factly, at the H-E-B. Then we talked about little things.
After genocide, separation, worry and more separation, a little
skirmish with malaria was nothing. As Gilbert talked, I marveled at
his poise, the way he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY ENDINGS
</P>
<P>
   In the season of Thanksgiving, 1999, I drive to a nondescript
apartment complex to visit Gilbert and Felicite at home for the
first time _ and to speak with them as a journalist. I hesitate at
the door because I know Gilbert doesn't like to talk about his
past. It hurts me to be a party to his pain. Still, I try to
reassure him _ and myself _ that his story is too triumphant, too
relevant, not to share.
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, Gilbert and Felicite lead a difficult
life. Money is tight. Opportunity is limited. Gilbert, now 31, no
longer bakes bread. Instead, he works from 4:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. at
National Instruments, helping to construct computer hardware. He
attends class at ACC during the day, working for his associate's
degree. Felicite works a day-time shift as a housekeeper at Seton
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert and Felicite greet me warmly. Inside their American
apartment, however, my eye wanders. I catch sight of three African
animals _ elephant, antelope, giraffe, carved from wood _ near the
television set. Below: the most delicate little black-and-white
baskets, with tall lids in the shape of inverted funnels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baskets are from Rwanda,'' says Felicite. But even those
were bought on the run, in Kenya. There is no other trace of their
homeland: no photos of lost family, no keepsakes from lost
childhoods. Yet the sad, sweet beauty of Gilbert and Felicite's
story is that they have the most important thing _ each other _ and
now, an 8-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named her Savannah, after the land, so that she'll think of
Kenya whenever she hears her name,'' says Gilbert. In Gilbert's
Story, Kenya means hope, and reunion, and the start of a new life.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Thanksgiving, Gilbert and Felicite hand me a
list of friends who have helped them adjust. They thank their
employers. They thank Rep. Doggett and aide Martha Ralston. They
thank Charles Sikes, who befriended Felicite at the hospital and
rounded up baby clothes and day-care connections for Savannah.
Finally, they thank Jo Ann Diller, a former ACC counselor who
befriended Gilbert and helped him refine his letters to Washington.
Diller has shared Thanksgiving dinner for three years in a row now,
and she was at the hospital for Savannah's birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have one chance to say thank you _ but the words
just aren't enough,'' says Gilbert. He says he's grateful for his
life, grateful to God for the gift of his marriage. ``Living
without her ... I don't know if it would be possible to be happy
right now. I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   GILBERT'S STORY
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Gilbert's Story is that he still dreams, and most
of those dreams involve Savannah. Sitting with his African family
on an American sofa, Gilbert talks about getting married in a
church someday _ to make the union ``official'' _ and for Savannah
to be old enough to stand beside them, to understand the story and
the spirit of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it may be late (in life) for us now, we want to be able
to provide for Savannah,'' he says. ``We know that we don't have
things, here, that our daughter can use to be successful in this
life ... We don't have parents who were born here or would give us
some stuff. Everything must come from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't succeed in this life, in this society, it will be
hard for our children to succeed. That's why I try to work hard so
that I can have a higher education, which would allow me to get a
job that would pay better, so I can provide basic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he once lived in an apartment with no furniture, Gilbert
declines offers of financial aid. He worries that people might not
appreciate his sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may want to know about you, feel sorry about you _ and
sometimes that's not good,'' he says. ``It's better to do yourself
in order to achieve something. Sometimes, the Diller family will
ask, 'What can we do for you?' I say, 'I think it's best (to accept
nothing) until we have maybe a serious problem, that's when we can
tell you we need help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ann Diller, like most who know Gilbert, shakes her head at
such talk _ because she knows that Gilbert frequently works and
studies on two hours' sleep, that he worries about the availability
of child care, that his is a life without luxury. And yet Gilbert
and Felicite would never think to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get excited when I think of Gilbert and his wife _ and I
think so many Americans can learn from their story,'' says Diller.
``Here's a family that's really going to make it, despite all the
heartbreak, all the suffering. There's something very confirming in
their story. ... Gilbert and his wife are survivors. They have
inner strength _ strength they have gained through their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're so pampered in America. There's so much 'woe
is me.' But here's a guy who came here with nothing but the clothes
on his back _ and yet the possibilities of his life are endless! I
think America should make itself available to refugees like Gilbert
because these people are going to be great contributors to society.
They are, in fact, what America is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   I try to explain these things to Gilbert, but he will not hear
them. He sees in me _ the teacher of coordinating conjunctions _
someone who has attained ``insight'' and the ``secure life'' that
will be a part of his future. How can I convey the notion that his
story humbles all of us? I'll never handle the smallest tragedy
with Gilbert's grace. I am his pupil, the one who is still learning
the lessons about courage, and dignity, and thanksgiving. And yes,
even forgiveness _ for Gilbert tells me he still dreams of
returning to Rwanda someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like our baby to know where we came from,'' Gilbert
says softly, glancing at Savannah. ``Yes, I've lost my family. But
it is my country. I mean: You always remember where you grew up,
where you went to school. And one day in life, you want to return
to where you grew up and went to school. Maybe something you knew
is still there. Maybe someone you knew is still there. I don't know
quite how to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving home, I consider Gilbert, and loss, and love _ and the
suggestion of his return to Rwanda. His is a remarkable story. And
it has only just begun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ One year ago, Brig. Gen. Bruce Lawlor was a
small-town Vermont lawyer whose duties in the National Guard
included hauling water to livestock during summer droughts and
rescuing farmers in winter ice storms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Lawlor became the first commander of a sensitive new
military operation that would respond if the United States were
struck by a chemical, germ or nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor, a one-star Army general who had never served on active
duty until last year, was given a position just two links removed
from President Clinton in the chain of command precisely because of
his homespun background.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can talk to civilians,'' said John Hamre, the deputy
secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor's three-story barracks-style headquarters is here, his
budget is a modest $4 million and his staff of 28 experts could be
the vanguard of a much larger operation.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the Pentagon contemplated creating a commander in
chief for the defense of the United States _ a ``homeland defense
command,'' in military shorthand. Civil rights groups of all
political persuasions knocked down that idea out of fear that it
would open the door to an increase in the military's influence
inside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably were premature,'' Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor's scaled-down command is known by a less evocative
phrase: Joint Task Force Civil Support.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pentagon's senior military and civilian leaders first
broached the idea with Clinton, they said the military was the only
institution that could aid citizens after an attack by nuclear,
chemical or germ weapons or a large conventional explosion like the
attack on the Oklahoma City federal building.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before the recent spate of warnings that
terrorists might attack in the United States during Year 2000
celebrations, a threat that seemed especially significant after the
recent arrests of Algerian expatriates charged with planning a
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of an attack, all of the military's resources _
from helicopters and cargo planes to fleets of trucks _ could be
used to haul emergency supplies to devastated cities, but always
under the authority of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Working with civilian agencies, the military would set up
whatever was needed, whether hospitals or decontamination units.
Above all, the military would bring order to the expected chaos and
panic that would follow a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We posed it as an idea,'' Cohen said. ``Who are you going to
turn to when there is a catastrophic event?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears of civil libertarians, the idea has not been
abandoned, and Lawlor's command has been given the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton shares the military's conviction that terrorists
and countries like Libya and North Korea pose the greatest threats
to the United States today, he was intrigued with the homeland
defense idea.
</P>
<P>
   For several years the Pentagon has planned for terrorist attacks
overseas by requiring specific military units to be vaccinated
against anthrax, considered the most likely biological weapon to be
used by terrorists against U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor's mission is to broaden those preparations to care for
civilians throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a war-fighting force and focusing it on public
safety,'' Lawlor said. ``We don't do law enforcement, or arrests.
We will save lives, prevent human suffering and restore as fast as
possible critical life-support systems in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But this command is more than a miniature military version of
the Red Cross. It is nestled in the enormous Joint Forces Command,
formerly known as the Atlantic Command, which supervises more than
half of the nation's armed forces. Through his immediate
supervisor, Adm. Harold Gehman Jr., the commander in chief here,
Lawlor will be able to call on nearly all of the military units
based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and his staff are putting together what
amounts to the Pentagon's first detailed preparation for how to
work with the major civilian agencies to respond to a chemical,
biological or nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   No such plan was in place in 1993 when the World Trade Center in
New York was bombed with a weapon that had been laced with cyanide.
It was meant to explode like a chemical weapon and kill thousands,
but the cyanide burned up in the detonation, said military
officials who cite that attack as one reason the Pentagon set up
this command.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing, New York and 119 other cities have become
part of a Pentagon program that teaches the chiefs of local
services like the fire and police departments how to react to an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, city and state officials would take little
time asking the president for help, especially if terrorists use
nuclear weapons. Then, at the president's direction, the Joint Task
Force Civil Support would jump into action.
</P>
<P>
   The command's job now is to plan for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers working with scientists and civilian experts
will make computer simulations of various attacks, figure out what
will be needed and, with the approval of civilian agencies, write
their playbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the command will test the plans in exercises involving
the military, the National Guards, the FBI, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and others, sometimes including top
administration and congressional officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That kind of coordination was part of Lawlor's life in the
Guard, which is at the governor's disposal. A native of Bellow
Falls, Vt., he was recruited by the CIA while a student at George
Washington University and became an intelligence officer in Vietnam
during the war, working with the South Vietnamese civilian police.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was offered a commission with naval intelligence and
joined the National Guard when he returned home to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer for more than 20 years, and a former member of the
Vermont Legislature, Lawlor said he was especially sensitive to
charges that his command could violate the Posse Comitatus Act,
which prohibits the military from performing police duties in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor said part of his role was to ensure that the public
understood that his command would always be under the control of a
civilian agency and that the military had no intention of expanding
its powers.

STAINS FROM POLICE BLOTTER LEAVE MANY IN NFL FEELING EMBARRASSED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The emergence of Peyton Manning and other talented young
quarterbacks and the decline of fabled franchises like the San
Francisco 49ers have dominated events on the field in the NFL this
season. But the headlines that left the most indelible image of
professional football have come from the police blotter.
</P>
<P>
   A linebacker in Baltimore was arrested on a charge of punching a
woman in a Maryland bar. A safety in Denver was arrested for
punching a topless dancer. Two Buffalo players were arrested for
sexually assaulting off-duty female police officers in a nightclub.
On Long Island, two current and one former member of the Jets were
charged with setting off a barroom brawl.
</P>
<P>
   And in Charlotte, a wide receiver faces the death penalty,
accused of orchestrating the drive-by shooting of his pregnant
girlfriend. Rae Carruth is the first active NFL player to be
charged with murder, the Pro Football Hall of Fame said. A veteran
football executive called Carruth's indictment ``the darkest moment
in the history of our league.''
</P>
<P>
   The spate of off-field violence, nearly all of it directed at
women, has profoundly embarrassed many NFL players, coaches and
owners. They have begun demanding that the league act much more
forcefully against those who do not restrain their aggression when
they leave the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are role models,'' said Cory Schlesinger, a fifth-year
fullback on the Detroit Lions. ``As far as I'm concerned, and I
know other guys on this team and around the league feel the same
way: get rid of the bad apples because they have no place in our
league.''
</P>
<P>
   While nearly a dozen highly publicized arrests of NFL players in
recent months for violence against women have created a public
relations nightmare for professional football, some league
officials say that the image belies a more complicated reality.
</P>
<P>
   The number of players arrested for violent crimes has actually
declined over the last three years, NFL executives say. They
attribute the reduction to programs the league created in March
1997 that use counseling, fines and the threat of suspension or
banishment to deter players from violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with dozens of NFL players, coaches and team
executives showed a deep consensus within professional football:
people think the league is still not doing enough to combat
off-field violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the NFL want the league to come down much harder
on violent criminals in their ranks, with some advocating for the
league to suspend immediately all first-time offenders and to
banish players who commit serious crimes, including domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics note that the NFL has not suspended any player
found guilty of committing a violent crime, although several
individual teams did so last month. They also say that the fines
levied by the league so far have been modest, with most below
$10,000 _ basically an insignificant sum to athletes who make
hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of teeth in the penalties has meant that players do not
fear league sanctions for violent acts the way they fear
suspensions and fines for violating NFL drug and steroid rules,
many players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the statistics, so I can't sit here definitely
and say if the policy works or not,'' Schlesinger said. ``I can
tell you I do know players, and they don't care about this policy.
It doesn't scare anybody. Guys are still getting in fights off the
field and beating up their girlfriends or wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy needs to be, `Beat up your wife, you are out of the
league, period.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson, coach of the Miami Dolphins, had a similar view,
as did Art Modell, majority owner of the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a deterrent?'' Johnson said. ``Maybe, just maybe, for a
player who has already been punished under it. Otherwise, probably
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Modell said he was in favor of ``anything that will try to
reduce some of the problems we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we do have some significant problems now with our players
and violent crime,'' Modell said. ``But you can't outlaw
misbehavior. It is a policy that at best may focus attention on it,
but let's be honest, I don't know if it works. It is not a
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some league executives insist that their policies are having an
impact. ``Most people who criticize the policy are talking off the
cuff,'' said Lem Burnham, the NFL's vice president for player
development, who is one of the league officials overseeing the
anti-violence efforts. ``If they really examined it, they would
know it works.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 38 players were arrested for violent crimes, an NFL
official said. In 1998, 35 players were arrested and last year 26
players were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The number of convictions has also declined, the official said.
In 1997, 23 players were convicted of violent crimes or accepted
plea bargains. In 1998, 14 were convicted or pleaded guilty. Last
year, five players were convicted or pleaded guilty, as of the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are dropping,'' Burnham said. ``There is no
question what we are doing is succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's approach relies heavily on counseling, based on the
NFL's strong belief that therapy helps players curb violent
tendencies. Since the policy was adopted, about 100 players have
been ordered by league officials to seek therapy in anger
management, according to team and league executives. Some coaches
and front office officials have also been ordered into therapy and
fined, according to league executives, who declined to identify the
coaches and officials.
</P>
<P>
   At least two dozen players have been fined by the league, an NFL
executive said. The first was Keith Poole, a third-year wide
receiver for the New Orleans Saints, who was sentenced to two
months of probation in November 1998 for attacking a man with a
golf club. He was fined $4,500, team and league officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm fined $5,000, that's nothing,'' said a player who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``I spend that much money on long
distance phone calls.''

<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of the NFL's 1,600 players have been
accused of serious crimes. But over the last few months, the
notorious nature of many of the charges and the wide coverage
afforded them by the news media have created a broad perception
that pro football players cannot control themselves off the playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, for example, Darrius Johnson, a starting
defensive back in his fourth year with the Broncos, was arrested on
charges of punching an exotic dancer in the face at a strip club
after she rejected his advances, the Denver police said.
</P>
<P>
   That came shortly after Cecil Collins, a rookie running back for
the Miami Dolphins, was charged with breaking into the apartment of
a neighboring couple in the middle of the night. The woman told the
police that Collins had been stalking her and had asked her out,
even though she was married.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was suspended indefinitely by the Dolphins and his
career is in jeopardy, because he faces jail time. In 1998, before
he came to the Dolphins, Collins was charged twice with
unauthorized entry. One of those incidents involved a 17-year-old
girl, who accused Collins of exposing himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations against Johnson and Collins pale when
compared with those confronting Rae Carruth, a third-year wide
receiver for the Carolina Panthers. Carruth was indicted for murder
last month after being accused of plotting with three acquaintances
to kill his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams. Prosecutors have
said they will pursue the death penalty against Carruth.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many other embarrassing charges against players
lately. Steve Muhammad, a rookie defensive back for the
Indianapolis Colts, was charged with misdemeanor battery in
November for beating his pregnant wife. His wife, Nicole, died 10
days after he was arrested, but a coroner determined that her death
had been caused by injuries incurred in a seemingly minor auto
accident, and not by the alleged beating. While the case is
pending, Muhammad is playing for the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, Ray Lewis, a third-year Baltimore Ravens
linebacker, was charged with assault, accused of punching a woman
in a Maryland bar.
</P>
<P>
   Two Jets offensive linemen were indicted last month by a grand
jury in Nassau County on charges stemming from a bar brawl in Long
Beach last July. Tackle Jumbo Elliott, a 12-year veteran in the
league, was charged with assault after having been accused of
punching a woman and a man at the bar; he was also charged with
disorderly conduct for urinating in the women's bathroom sink.
Jason Fabini, a second-year tackle, was charged with disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A former Jets player, Matt O'Dwyer, was also arrested in the
incident. O'Dwyer has been sued by three police officers, who
accused the 300-pound offensive lineman of kicking out the window
of a police car from inside, sending shattered glass into the
officers' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In November, two members of the Buffalo Bills and a former
teammate were arrested after being accused of sexually attacking
two off-duty Buffalo police officers in a downtown nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Spriggs, a third-year offensive tackle; Jeremy McDaniel,
a rookie wide receiver; and Brian Edwards, a former running back,
were hit with a blizzard of serious charges related to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The police accused Edwards of grabbing one of the female
officers by the crotch. When the officer objected, the police said,
McDaniel punched her in the eye and kicked her in the stomach.
Spriggs, who is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs about 300 pounds,
grabbed the second officer, who was trying to help her friend, and
threw the 100-pound woman to the ground, according to the police.
All three men were accused of fighting with other police officers
who tried to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   All of these arrests _ and many more _ occurred even while the
league was trying to use its new programs to curb violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were sitting here in a do-nothing mode, then we should
be harshly criticized,'' said Burnham, the NFL vice president.
``But we are aggressively trying to stop these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some people question whether a sport in which violence is so
integral to the game can effectively prevent players from
misbehaving off the field _ or even if it is reasonable to expect
that the league could.
</P>
<P>
   Some also wonder whether talented players feel a sense of
license, assuming that if a team releases them because of problems
off the field, there will be another team waiting with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our society's worship of elite athletes, because we
coddle and fawn over them, in some ways we've created anti-social
beings who believe their needs come first,'' said Merrill J.
Melnick, a sports sociologist at the State University of New York
at Brockport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Dan Wilkinson, then a third-year defensive lineman with
the Cincinnati Bengals, was found guilty of punching his pregnant
girlfriend in the stomach; he received a suspended sentence and a
$200 fine. Despite the attack, two years later the Washington
Redskins sent the Bengals first- and third-round draft picks in a
trade for Wilkinson, and then signed him to a five-year, $21.4
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it simply the machismo of the sport that affects behavior?
Greg Blache, the Chicago Bears' defensive coordinator, awarded
single bullets to his players this season for big plays, like sacks
or solid tackles. When Blache was asked about the wisdom of using
such a motivational ploy, especially in light of the Carruth
indictment, he shrugged off the question as news media hype. The
NFL contacted the Bears last month and told them to cease the
practice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   No definitive work has ever been done studying the changes, if
any, the sport of football may have on players. But an article last
year by Alfred Blumstein and Jeff Benedict in Chance magazine,
which is published by the American Statistical Association,
reported that the crime rate among professional football players
was much lower than for their counterparts of the same age and
racial background in society.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the litany of violent crimes against women has prompted
many players, coaches and NFL executives to say that the league
should do more to combat off-field violence. Many people said that
the league should drastically increase fines and aggressively
suspend players who are found guilty of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do that and there would be no violence by players,'' said a
Pro Bowl wide receiver who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity. ``It would disappear. Guys would be too afraid to lose
paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials say, however, that there are limits to what
they can do. Burnham said that calls for suspending or banishing
players after a first conviction were based on emotion and not
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just kick guys out of the league immediately, you're
going against a number of right-to-work laws and some state and
federal laws,'' he said. He added that the NFL would be
``contributing to the criminal element of society'' if teams
dismissed players permanently, putting them on the street without
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The league's violent-crime policy was introduced at a meeting of
NFL team owners in March 1997 as the cornerstone of a new attack on
preventing criminal behavior among NFL players. Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said at the time that the league ``felt a growing concern
over detrimental conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to deter the misconduct and one way to deter
misconduct is to impose discipline,'' he said. ``Another way is to
have counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials were no doubt sincere in wanting to address the
problem, but there were also public relations considerations. Then,
as now, the league had to deal with embarrassing arrests of high
profile players.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One was linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who has played in five
Super Bowls with teams in Buffalo and Atlanta. He pleaded guilty to
sexual misconduct in 1997 in an attack on a female acquaintance in
a Buffalo hotel room. Bennett served 35 days in jail and later
received counseling under the league's program.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's policy was in its infancy when Bennett was arrested.
At the time, players accused of violent crimes were subject to
counseling, but not punishment. Would Bennett have feared the
policy in its current form, he was asked, and thus been able to
avoid the sexual abuse charge for fear of fines or suspension by
the league?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, probably not at that time,'' said Bennett, who
now plays for the Indianapolis Colts. ``I thought I was a good
person then, but I wasn't as good a person as I believed. I don't
know if a piece of paper would have changed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crimes that fall under the league's programs include the use or
threat of physical violence, the use of a deadly weapon, illegal
possession of a weapon, hate crimes, the destruction of property
and domestic violence. Any NFL employee or player charged with one
of these crimes must undergo counseling. A conviction or guilty
plea subjects a player to a fine or suspension without pay. A
longer suspension, and possibly banishment, follows a second
conviction. The amount of a fine or the length of suspension is up
to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The league also holds sessions each year for rookies, trying to
impress upon them that off-field misbehavior could end a career.
And the NFL has actors perform skits for teams on subjects like
date rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL has done a better job of coming team to team to talk
about issues like violent crime,'' said Mike Shanahan, the Denver
Broncos' coach. ``The awareness is getting better and better. It's
not a perfect world, but we're getting there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   League executives hope that counseling and tougher sanctions
will cause the number of players arrested each year for violent
crimes to diminish further.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is among the players who believe that therapy can be
extremely useful. ``I made a mistake and where counseling really
helps is that I know I will never make another mistake like that
again,'' he said. ``I can't speak for everybody in the league, but
I don't think the violent crime policy necessarily stops guys from
making mistakes. But if they do, I think therapy can really help.
It helped with me.''  &QL;

WEST HOLLYWOOD DEBATES CONDOM EFFORT FOR BARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Officials, health workers and nightclub
owners have been arguing for months over developing a municipal
policy to get the denizens of the freewheeling night life mecca
here to obtain and use condoms.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the West Hollywood City Council approved a plan to
give 320,000 free condoms this year to 33 gay bars, which would
voluntarily supply the condoms to their clientele by placing
condoms in jars. But, feeling the step insufficient, the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation, which treats 5,000 patients throughout the
Los Angeles area, has proposed a competing initiative that would
ask West Hollywood voters to make the program apply to all bars in
the city _ not just those with a predominantly gay clientele _ and
would require participation, rather than allowing the program to be
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about protecting the public health,'' said Michael
Weinstein, the foundation's president. ``Not only the public health
in HIV transmission, but unwanted pregnancy and other sexually
transmitted diseases. We're in an epidemic in West Hollywood, and
we're not doing all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest opponents may be the bar patrons themselves. To a
man, customers at the gay discotheque Revolver said they were
skeptical of government sponsorship of such programs, because they
believed those matters were a personal responsibility, or better
handled by volunteers, or simply because they believed the programs
would not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put condoms in their faces, but it's up to them if
they use them,'' said Les Kurkendaal, a 33-year-old actor. ``We've
had condoms for years, but people still have unsafe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the debate reveals much about the character of West
Hollywood, a 2-square-mile, 40,000-resident enclave flanked on
three sides by Los Angeles and on the fourth by Beverly Hills. It
is a premier night life destination known for its risque Halloween
parade where costumes have included Monica Lewinsky's cigar and a
bunch of pansies.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has not been about whether the program is right or
wrong, only how extensive it should be.
</P>
<P>
   In West Hollywood, where roughly a third of the residents _ and
many more of its club and bar patrons _ are gay men, there is
concern over a return of promiscuity brought on by the success of
protease inhibitors in treating HIV and AIDS, combined with a new
generation of less careful men who, for the most part, have not
lost friends to the disease the way older gay men have.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and AIDS care workers note that although West
Hollywood has only one-half of 1 percent of Los Angeles County's
population, it has 7 percent of the county's AIDS cases. And, in
data soon to be released as part of a nationwide study by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, half of 548 men under
age 30 surveyed in West Hollywood said they had had unprotected sex
with other men in the previous six months. Among the survey
respondents the rate of HIV infection was 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the House of Blues, which has made free condoms
available to patrons over the years and supports the city program,
West Hollywood's straight bars a few blocks away on Sunset
Boulevard have been silent on the issue. But managers of the gay
bars that line Santa Monica Boulevard have strongly opposed a
mandatory program and chafe at having it specifically tailored to
their gay clientele, saying the proposed measure is an example of
government discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Michel LeChasseur, the general manager at Rage, a dance club,
said his establishment had been making condoms available for five
years, and he accused the AIDS Healthcare Foundation of seeking a
mandatory policy to make money. He contended that the foundation
might benefit financially, perhaps by supplying the condoms. The
foundation rejected the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the government should focus on prevention and
education, and not on dictating how nightclubs should be run.
</P>
<P>
   West Hollywood has had a condom distribution program for eight
years, and in June increased the number it gives out under pressure
from Weinstein's group, which had threatened to force a ballot
initiative if the program did not become more aggressive. When it
became clear that the city's measure would be voluntary, Weinstein
began his petition drive again, and on Wednesday turned in more
than 4,600 signatures in support of the initiative, double the
number required. Supporters hope the measure will be on the
November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safer sex has died as an issue,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do something to say, `We don't want any more
clients. We want this to end.'''

EDITORIAL: THE QUIET BATTLE FOR CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Jan. 9:
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential contest heads toward the showdowns in Iowa
and New Hampshire, the battle to control Congress is shaping up
with considerably less attention from the public. That is
understandable, since only about 30 of the 435 campaigns for House
seats are expected to be close.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in this early phase, the congressional election offers
some important clues about the public mood and the hopes and fears
of party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, convinced they have a good chance of recapturing the
House, plan a series of confrontations this year on health care,
education and other issues. House Republicans, the one-time
revolutionaries, are trying to soften their contentious image. Last
week they even dropped their tried-and-true strategy of pushing
sweeping tax cuts as the centerpiece of their electoral approach.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the congressional Republicans tried to outdo
themselves each new year with more and more extravagant tax cuts.
They apparently have recognized that at a time of extraordinary
prosperity, and in spite of looming budget surpluses, tax cuts take
a back seat among voters to more long-term concerns like health
care, retirement security and education.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert's latest proposal for $135 billion worth
of tax cuts over the next 10 years is only about a tenth of the tax
cut promoted by Gov. George Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination. Could it be that Republican
lawmakers are more attuned to the wishes of voters than the Texas
governor? It would not be the first time that Bush and the House
Republicans have differed on what the voters want.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republicans recaptured the House in 1994, they had one
of the greatest political opportunities of a generation to solidify
their reputation as a party that could govern. They squandered it
with their petulant government shutdowns, their extremist agenda
and the ethical problems of Speaker Newt Gingrich. The impeachment
drive of 1998 hurt them almost as much as it hurt President
Clinton. Gingrich, forced to resign as speaker, was not even
invited to attend a recent celebration of the Contract With America
he founded.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how well the GOP candidate does in the presidential
race, Republicans may not be able to improve much on their
razor-thin margin in the House. Most of the vacant seats up for
grabs this year are held by Republicans, many of them in districts
carried by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This has fed the Democrats' hopes. They believe they have
recruited good candidates, done well raising money and even better
in forging their message. In the Senate, Republicans are likely to
retain control but there are thought to be more vulnerable
Republican incumbents than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who controls Congress, the margins will probably be
small. This means that in 2001, Congress and the new president will
face something that gets left out of election-year rhetoric: the
necessity of bipartisanship. Presidential candidates like to talk
about bold initiatives. But neither Democratic health care reform
nor Republican tax cuts stand much chance unless someone reaches
across the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that at a time of contentiousness among candidates,
the electorate is once again signaling a desire for a different
kind of Congress, one in which the two sides try to work together,
and to get along.

CONNER'S STARS AND STRIPES TRAILS AMERICA ONE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The legal implications of Stars and
Stripes' decision to use a rudder manufactured in Australia earlier
in this round remain uncertain, but as racing resumed Saturday in
the America's Cup challenger semifinals, at least the pecking order
looked clearer.
</P>
<P>
   The leader here is now America One, which represents the St.
Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco and which beat Stars and
Stripes convincingly Saturday by 2 minutes 43 seconds after
building a large lead on the first leg. Paul Cayard's crew has a
4-1 record midway through this round, which will ultimately trim
the challenger field from six to two.
</P>
<P>
   And what makes America One, in its new boat USA 61, look even
more imposing is that it has performed well in very different
weather conditions. Its only loss came when it sustained jib
failure with a significant lead against America True in the second
race of the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel like we're hitting our groove here,'' Cayard
said. ``We're improving as a team with the crew work and the
pre-start and the handling of the boat. We're more confident in
what we're doing, and the boat is a good all-around boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cayard's immediate wake are Stars and Stripes, no longer
unbeaten at 3-1, and Prada Challenge, now 3-2. After compiling the
best record in the preliminary rounds, Prada was on the brink of
crisis on Friday against Le Defi Francais but managed to overcome
two penalties to win. Saturday, it put together one of its more
poised and tactically sound efforts to defeat the Nippon Challenge
by 1:33 .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Prada, Nippon, Stars and Stripes and us are all pretty
close,'' Cayard said. ``It's really hard to predict who will come
out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   In the light winds that prevailed Saturday and delayed racing
for more than an hour, it was easier to predict that Dennis
Conner's team might have a hard time. Stars and Stripes had not
raced since Wednesday, after being granted 48 hours to repair
damage to its stern scoop sustained in a collision. According to
Conner's tactician Tom Whidden, Stars and Stripes' USA 55 ``comes
alive'' at 10 to 12 knots, and the wind was often slightly below
that.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear in this regatta and with little chance of
qualifying for the challenger finals are America True of the San
Francisco Yacht Club and Le Defi, which beat America True by 36
seconds Saturday. America True is now 1-3; Le Defi is 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon is 2-3 and has lost two in a row _ to America One and to
Prada _ but the bigger issue here is whether Nippon can beat Stars
and Stripes off the water. The Japanese, who lost to Conner's boat
on Day 1 of this round, have protested to the international jury
that Stars and Stripes used a rudder that was in breach of article
19 of the America's Cup protocol because it was not made in the
United States or in New Zealand (after the syndicate arrived here).
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the rudder was designed by Americans but
manufactured in Australia at McConaghy Boats in Sydney with
materials shipped from the United States. The rudder was originally
intended for use in the third round-robin preliminaries but did not
arrive in Auckland in time and was installed for the semifinals. It
was then quickly removed after the opening victory over Nippon and
replaced by a rudder of wholly American origin.
</P>
<P>
   Why the hasty change after a victory? Conner isn't telling.
``It's a little bit like Monica Lewinsky talking about her case
while it's still going on; it's not really appropriate,'' Conner
said Saturday. ``But we're quite confident that we'll be fine and
we haven't violated any rules and that we'll be totally
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The other syndicates believe the rudder was replaced because
America True had asked the arbitration panel for an interpretation
of article 19. ``When we heard the rumor about Stars and Stripes'
rudder, we asked for the clarification'' Dawn Riley, America True's
skipper, said.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury met Friday night, the arbitration panel opened
deliberations on the issue Saturday morning and asked each
semifinalist to provide an interpretation of article 19. The panel
plans to reconsider the case on Sunday morning, issue a formal
interpretation and then refer the issue back to the jury for action
if it is required.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties could include forcing Stars and Stripes to rerace
Nippon, granting a point to the Japanese, stripping a point from
the Americans or even expelling Stars and Stripes from the event on
the grounds that it would no longer be eligible to compete in the
America's Cup finals against New Zealand should it win the
challenger series.
</P>
<P>
   Conner has spent much of his career navigating amid America's
Cup controversy. ``There's nothing in the rules that says the
rudder can't be made in Australia,'' he said. ``We'll let the
arbitration panel decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, his crew will be sailing under extra pressure.
``It's a huge issue for us,'' the helmsman Ken Read said. ``But we
have to be very conscious that we don't make it a sailing
distraction. Can we pull that off? History will tell that.
Obviously, we feel like we're right and will fight to the end to
prove we're right.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS' NEW OWNER WILL WANT PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All those early American Football League club owners
must be chuckling. They remember chipping in a few thousand dollars
to save the Jets' ancestors, the New York Titans, when the players'
paychecks from the original owner, Harry Wismer, were bouncing
higher than the Polo Grounds' roof. Now, nearly four decades later,
the Jets' franchise is about to be bought for more than $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than $600 million, for a franchise that doesn't even
have a coach.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the Jets' new owner, either Charles F. Dolan, the
Cablevision impresario, or Robert Wood Johnson IV, the wealthy
philanthropist, has forgotten the business acumen and power of
persuasion that helped each amass his fortune, Bill Parcells will
be the Jets' coach. Again.
</P>
<P>
   If you were putting up more than $600 million for the Jets,
wouldn't you want the best possible coach? Especially when the best
possible coach is already on the franchise payroll. And even though
Parcells would prefer not to coach in the 2000 season, he remains
the best possible coach.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Parcells, who is still the Jets' chief of football
operations, could hire any of the other current National Football
League coaches, none would be a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   With his people-to-people skills, Parcells belongs on the
sideline as a coach, not behind a desk as a club executive.
Prowling the sideline during games, growling at practice during the
week, in the weight room with his players, that's where he's the
best at what he does. All his talents as a coach would be wasted
behind a desk.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi discovered that situation the year after he had
guided the Green Bay Packers to their second straight Super Bowl
victory and to their fifth NFL title in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi would acknowledge having ``missed the fire on Sunday''
in 1968 and the next season he was on the sideline again, this time
as the Washington Redskins' coach. It would be his only season with
the Redskins; he died of colon cancer shortly before the 1970
season.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of Lombardi, like that of any great coach, Parcells'
value is on the sideline, not in an upstairs suite with the club
owner.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells told his players last Monday morning that he was
resigning as coach and that Bill Belichick would be taking over, he
mentioned that he could still ``suck it up'' as coach for another
16-game season, but he would rather not, that Belichick would be in
charge of all football decisions, including the college draft.
</P>
<P>
   But when Belichick surprisingly announced on Tuesday that he was
resigning because of so many uncertainties in the team's future,
Parcells was suddenly in charge again, notably in charge of the
search for a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells keeps saying that his intent is still not to coach
again, but that doesn't mean he can't be persuaded to ``suck it
up'' and coach again if only for one season, especially if Dolan or
Johnson offers to add a million or two or three to his paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells announced his resignation he mentioned Dale
Wimbrow's 1934 poem, ``The Guy in the Glass,'' meaning you can't be
fooled by your reflection in the mirror. Now that he's searching
for a new Jets coach, he should look in the mirror again. The best
coach is in that mirror.
</P>
<P>
   As for Belichick, his departure (probably to the New England
Patriots) leaves the Jets without their defensive guru, but he may
have done the Jets a favor. Whether Parcells returns or not to the
sideline, the Jets will be better off without Belichick as their
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Parcells' maximum value is as a head coach, Belichick's
maximum value is as an X's and O's tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's introverted personality thrives in studying
videotapes of opponents, devising defensive game plans and making
adjustments from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   To use pro football's longtime analogy with warfare, he was a
brilliant colonel on the general's staff. But he has never
projected the aura of a general who could inspire the troops. A
good head coach must do that, the way Parcells does.
</P>
<P>
   In Belichick's five seasons as the Cleveland Browns' head coach
from 1991 to 1995, his records were 6-10, 7-9, 7-9, 11-5 (and a
playoff victory over the Patriots in Parcells' second season in New
England) and 5-11 (the last season in Cleveland before the
franchise moved to Baltimore). That adds up to 36-44 in the regular
season, 1-1 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As if those numbers weren't negative enough, his personality
also alienated the fans and the news media in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After his dismissal from the Browns, Belichick quickly
resurfaced in New England with Parcells, who had been his boss when
the 1986 and 1990 Giants won Super Bowls. When the Jets pursued
Parcells in 1997, Belichick was hired as the temporary head coach
with the contractual promise that he would eventually succeed
Parcells, as he did for less than 24 hours early last week.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL's best-paid assistant coach, Belichick earned more
than $2.5 million over his three seasons on the Jets' staff; his
2000 salary as head coach would have been $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But when Belichick learned last Monday that Robert K. Kraft, the
Patriots' owner whom Parcells despises, had requested permission
(which the Jets didn't grant) to contact him regarding the dual job
of general manager and coach, presumably for much more than $1.4
million, he jumped his signed Jets contract. Now he's challenging
that contract's NFL legality.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Patriots are expected to negotiate a deal with the
Jets that will allow Belichick to join them in return for a few
draft choices, as the Jets did when Parcells was still obligated to
the Patriots. It's the latest chapter in the feud that still
simmers between Parcells and Kraft, but it's also another reason
Parcells can be persuaded to coach again:
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for the Jets (and Parcells) to beat the Patriots
(and Kraft, if not Belichick) twice next season.

DEMOCRATS WORRY THAT GOP WAR CHEST COULD COST THEM THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Ill., Del., Pa.)   (Eds: SUBS first optional graf, Those who ..., to delete
extranesous `and' to make clear that Dimon is the former president
of Citigroup.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Many prominent Democrats say they are deeply
troubled that the Republican Party is collecting so much more money
than them that it will enjoy an insurmountable financial advantage
_ perhaps enough to cost the Democrats the White House.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats have a recurring fear: that their nominee,
either Al Gore or Bill Bradley, will emerge in late March from the
peak presidential primary season battered, bruised and broke.
</P>
<P>
   And if at that time the Republican National Committee has a big
surplus of unregulated ``soft money'' over the Democratic
counterpart, they say, the Democratic candidate would face a
relentless blizzard of television commercials condemning Democratic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing other Democratic officials, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of
New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, said the Republicans could ``easily have a 3- or
4-to-1'' advantage over Democrats. ``I'd be surprised if we could
put together more than $30 million in soft money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli even speculated that the Republicans could amass $200
million, a figure Republican officials called overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be faced with a situation where in the early spring
the Republicans begin generic advertising with soft money and never
leave the air,'' Torricelli said. ``And the electorate could
conceivably not hear from the Democratic Party until the national
conventions. You could have, literally, months of unanswered
political advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a reversal from four years ago, when President
Clinton's campaign was flush and the Democrats began to broadcast
commercials against Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, a strategy
credited with badly damaging Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The worries about money have stirred some resentment toward
Clinton. Some Democrats complain that the president _ distracted by
his efforts to collect money for his library; the Senate campaign
in New York of his wife, Hillary; his legal defense fund; and his
support for the millennium festivities _ has neglected his own
party. Several Democrats also said that while their committees to
help House and Senate candidates were doing quite well, they feared
that the Republicans' soft money edge would hurt Democrats running
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While there has traditionally been a financial disparity between
Democrats and Republicans, a confluence of circumstances and events
has created a particularly serious dilemma for the Democratic Party
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors expressed qualms about the party's prospects for the
White House. Others said they had been tapped for other causes,
like the president's library. Another factor is disarray in the
party, which has not had a finance chairman for more than three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Democrats, who start the year with less than $2.5
million in the bank, Republican Party officials said they had
already stockpiled roughly $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   This money is separate from the donations to the presidential
candidates, which is strictly regulated. Soft money given to
parties is intended for ``party building'' activities, not
campaigns, but it is used for advertising on issues and therefore
plays a key role in shaping the broad electoral debates.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said there was time for them to catch
up. But none predicted that the party would be at anywhere near
parity with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is a real one,'' said Alan Solomont, a veteran
Democratic fund-raiser who was the national party's finance
chairman in 1997. ``I don't think our fund-raising operation as a
party has really kicked into high gear. Democrats need a little
kick in the behind. The problem is we have a relatively small base
of donors and so much is asked of them. A lot of us are
stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   The public expressions of alarm could be seen as an attempt to
provide just the kind of ``kick'' Solomont mentioned. And the
worriers do not mention another factor, the huge independent
spending campaigns by organized labor, which mainly favors
Democratic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But in weeks of interviewing, nine other well-connected
Democrats _ including officials on Capitol Hill, at the White House
and at the Democratic Party itself _ have all privately admitted
similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A striking demonstration of the Democrats' lack of preparedness
is that at the start of a crucial election year, the post of
finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee has been
vacant since Beth Dozoretz quit more than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they had been unable to persuade big names
in the fund-raising world to take the job full time and instead
last week settled on three people to share the job. They said they
would announce the triumvirate on Monday: Joel Hyatt, an
unsuccessful Senate candidate from Ohio in 1994, who now runs a
business in Silicon Valley; Joe Cari, a lawyer in Chicago; and
Carol Pensky, a former national party treasurer, who will work out
of Democratic headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Those who resisted entreaties to head the finance effort, party
officials said, were David Steiner, a New Jersey financier; Steven
Rattner, deputy chief executive officer of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.; E.
John Rosenwald Jr., vice chairman of Bear Stearns; and James E.
Dimon, the former president of Citigroup. Party officials also said
they tried to court Orin S. Kramer, an investment banker who worked
in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment for party officials was that Terence
R. McAuliffe, the premier Democratic fund-raiser who has turned his
attention to raising money for several of Clinton's projects, as
well as Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, did not want a major
role with the Democratic National Committee. Peter Knight, a major
fund-raiser and confidant of Gore, also was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Magnifying the dilemma for Democrats is the colossal
fund-raising success of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading
Republican contender. His campaign is so flush that the governor
has eschewed federal matching funds, which come with spending
limits, and is now helping the party collect soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its difficulties, the Democratic Party has experienced
significant setbacks in soliciting money for its national
convention in Los Angeles in August. And there has been such a lack
of coordination between the national party and its House and Senate
campaign committees that those committees, for more than a year,
have been holding joint fund-raising efforts on their own instead
of sharing the proceeds with the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, the general chairman of the national committee,
conceded that the competition for the Democratic fund-raising pie
had been fierce because Gore and Bradley were hitting up many of
the same donors as Democratic congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough,'' Rendell said. ``We are a little bit the victim
of our own success. There's a finite pool of money and the pie can
be cut only so many ways. But the good news is we don't have to
match them dollar for dollar. We just have to have enough to get
our message across and I am confident we are going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, a former mayor of Philadelphia, chosen by Clinton
because of his reputation as a prodigious fund-raiser, said the
party was better off today than four years ago, when it was several
million dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the party, with the help of appearances by the
president, was embarking on an aggressive drive for money,
especially in smaller cities not usually tapped by the party like
Wilmington, Del., Trenton, N.J., and Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said the party had been distracted by the
battle between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Democratic supporters and major donors are somewhat
preoccupied at the present time by the hand-to-hand combat going on
in the nominating process,'' said Steven Grossman, a former
chairman of the Democratic National Committee and prolific
fund-raiser, ``once that process resolves and we have a nominee, I
believe there will be intense focus'' on raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democratic officials conceded that donors were
reluctant to give because they were worried about the party's
prospects for the White House and did not consider Gore, the
front-runner for the nomination, a particularly electrifying
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant and inspiring fund-raiser of the last
seven or eight years has been Bill Clinton because he painted a
picture of what we could do and he went out and did it,'' Solomont
said. ``He's one of the reasons why Democrats have been generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Burkle, a wealthy donor in California, put it this way in
an interview last winter: ``With Clinton, in 30 seconds I was
connected with him. Gore doesn't connect as easily as Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roger C. Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary in the
Clinton administration, who now runs an investment firm, said that
Democrats should not be worried. ``The Republican side always out
raises the Democratic side,'' he said. ``Unless the disparity is
historically anomalous _ more than 2-and-a-half to 1 _ I don't
think there's anything particularly noteworthy to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torricelli warned that the disparity might be far greater
than that. ``The Democratic Party still has not established a
significant financial base that can always be depended upon,'' he
said. ``The party has succeeded in raising money, but it takes
time, it is not very efficient. The Republican Party has a natural
fund-raising base.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns about lacking soft money may sound odd given that
the two Democratic candidates have both called on Congress to
eliminate such unregulated contributions. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona has made campaign reform such an issue that he said he
would reject soft money if he won the Republican nomination;
Bradley said he would do so only if his Republican counterpart made
such a move as well.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats fret, Mel Sembler, the finance chairman of the
Republican National Committee, said his fund-raising efforts were
moving apace, in large part because party donors think the White
House is within easy reach. ``I get the sense that my contributors
feel they're going to win,'' he said.

   CRUNCH TIMES FOR BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Bill Bradley summed it up with an apt
metaphor on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full-court press is on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three weeks to go before Iowa's
first-in-the-nation caucuses on Jan. 24, the former senator from
New Jersey and New York Knicks star has begun to throw money and
political elbows, every which way as he and Vice President Al Gore
tussle over the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley is essentially locked in a tie with Gore in New
Hampshire, where the first Democratic primary will be held Feb. 1,
he is still struggling to catch up with the vice president in Iowa,
still trailing by about 20 percentage points in the latest poll,
carried out last week by The Des Moines Register, which published
it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In his press to close that gap, Bradley this month is dumping
more than $800,000 into a television campaign that is huge by Iowa
standards and that, to take one example, will blitz the
already-bleary-eyed average Iowa viewer with 14 advertisements this
weekend. The senator has also recently extended his string of
campaign offices the entire length and breadth of Iowa, taken up
temporary residence in a hotel here and, more telling, begun to
import volunteer workers from other states to help him turn out
caucus-goers on Jan. 24, turnout being the real key to caucus
success.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in Iowa, as elsewhere, Bradley has begun to sharpen his
anti-Gore oratory, once limited mostly to wonkish comparisons of
his proposals with those of the vice president. On Friday, for
instance, he called on Gore to muster the courage to propose ``bold
solutions to big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Can Bradley win and add to his momentum heading
for New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   He argues that because Gore can easily match him in spending and
has the support of most of Iowa's top Democrats and labor leaders,
with access to the organizing machinery they control, the contest
already is lopsided. So, he contends, as an underdog ``insurgent''
candidate, he need only do ``well,'' not beat Gore outright.
</P>
<P>
   Most political professionals agree. But their definition of
doing well is not his.
</P>
<P>
   They talk of a Gore-Bradley voting split on the order of
55-to-45 percent. Bradley, on the other hand, talks of a 2-to-1
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   If that has a lowering-expectations sound to it, well, this is
Iowa and it's caucus game time again.
</P>
<P>
   FOR BUSH, IT'S ABOUT MEETING EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republican contest in Iowa, it seems rather bland by
comparison. The Register poll published Saturday had Texas Gov.
George W. Bush continuing to hold a comfortable lead of just under
30 points over his only serious challenger, Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Bush supporters in Iowa are beginning to worry that
the governor is too comfortably ahead and that he and his handlers
are in danger of becoming complacent about the contest.
</P>
<P>
   They say his current schedule calls for him to spend only about
seven days in the state between now and caucus day, with the rest
of the time spent mainly in New Hampshire, where the Republican
contest in much tighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush supporters are not worried that Forbes might overtake
their man in Iowa. But they are concerned about how he might fare
in the expectations game.
</P>
<P>
   Should Forbes narrow the gap somewhat, they say, there would be
damaging talk that the governor did not live up to his advance
billing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona has chosen not to compete in the
Iowa caucuses but the poll published Saturday showed him in a
virtual tie for third place with Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, who are
competing.
</P>
<P>
   WALKING THE TALK IN NORTH DAKOTA
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in a political race, a gimmick will help when name
recognition is a problem. And name recognition was Duane Sand's
problem when he retired from the Navy last week and headed back to
Fargo, N.D., his hometown, to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He had been away for 15 years, was a political novice and faced
not only the problem of beating two other contenders for the
Republican Party's nomination but, if successful at that, then
would have to face the veteran Democratic incumbent, Kent Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   He would campaign, he announced, by walking across the state,
all 346 miles, from Montana in the west to the Red River in the
east.
</P>
<P>
   In January?
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only talk the talk but walk the walk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Forecast: High around 30 on Monday, headed down into the
teens by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FOR MCCAIN, THE PRESS STOPS SINGING
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona can surely take comfort from the way
things are going for him these days in his New Hampshire campaign,
where he leads the Republican field in some polls. But that said,
last week had to have been just about the most uncomfortable for
him, in general, of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   For months he had enjoyed a ``good press,'' as the saying goes,
now and again taking a hit, as when Arizona papers stirred some
debate by writing that he had a bad temper, but otherwise receiving
mostly positive coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Too positive, many of his detractors contended, charging that
the press had become blindly enamored of him and his promises to
``talk straight'' and keep special interests at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of plaint heard in just about every presidential
campaign, justified or not. And it was a good bet, especially if
McCain's poll numbers continued to surge, that sooner or later, the
good press would turn bad, justified or not. It almost always does.
</P>
<P>
   In McCain's case, it came Wednesday. That morning, The Boston
Globe reported that the senator had recently pressed the Federal
Communications Commission to rule on whether a company that had
made a major contribution to his campaign could buy a television
station.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the
F.C.C., said he had asked only that the commission speed up its
decision-making process. At no point, he insisted, had he tried to
tell the commission how to come down on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, justifiably or not, the story was making bold
headlines in newspapers and newscasts from coast to coast, with the
word ``hypocrite'' prominent in a good many. Editorial writers and
columnists found it rich grist. McCain detractors had a field day.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to insist he had done nothing wrong and would
handle the FCC situation in the same manner if he had it to do all
over again. But discussing candidate coverage in general with The
Globe, he lamented philosophically:
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is increased visibility, there's less margin for
error. You could get away with mistakes a month ago that you can't
get away with now. People will be focusing a lot more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   TWISTING INTO EDGE IN ILLINOIS RACE
</P>
<P>
   Since Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., announced he was giving
up his 10th District seat on the state's North Shore, only one
Democrat has expressed interest in replacing him. But on the
Republican side, at least a dozen hopefuls have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   If all run, the Republican primary could turn into a political
free-for-all and be decided by the slimmest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Donnelley, the only woman in the Republican field, has a
plan for achieving that margin _ by working the margins.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions she circulated to get on the primary ballot listed
her name as ``Shawn Donnelley.'' But when the ballot is actually
printed, she wants it to carry her full name, which is Shawn
Margaret Donnelley. sp??
</P>
<P>
   Her reasoning appears to be that ``Shawn Donnelley'' is a
gender-neutral name whereas ``Shawn Margaret Donnelley'' makes it
absolutely clear that she is a women and thus, as she sees it, more
deserving of the support of female voters.
</P>
<P>
   But another Republican hopeful, Andrew Hochberg, a business
executive, objects to the change and has urged election officials
not to sanction it. Illinois law, he argues, requires than the name
on the ballot be the same as the name on the ballot petitions _ no
exceptions.

COWBOYS' SANDERS LOOKS TO FORCE VIKINGS' HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last two times the Dallas Cowboys played the Minnesota
Vikings, injuries reduced Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders to
nothing more than a highly paid, intensely interested bystander.
Vikings receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter had field days against
the Cowboys' undermanned secondary.
</P>
<P>
   It is a different story this time as the Cowboys (8-8) travel to
Minnesota to take on the Vikings (10-6) in a National Football
Conference wild-card playoff game Sunday afternoon. Sanders is
healthy and eager to go against Moss and Carter, who have combined
for 2,654 yards receiving, the second-highest total in National
Football League history. With Sanders, arguably one of the best
cover cornerbacks in NFL history, it is one of the glamour matchups
of the pro football weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better this time,'' Sanders said. ``I think it will allow
us to do more things and not just sit back and wait on what they're
going to do. We'll be able to force them into situations. But even
if you had Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes'' _ the former Oakland
Raiders cornerbacks _ ``I don't know if you'd have enough talent to
match up with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who were 1-7 on the road this season, will need all
healthy hands on deck if they are going to beat the Vikings, who
finished the regular season as one of the hottest teams in the NFC.
Dallas is accustomed to entering the playoffs as the NFC East
champion and having at least one playoff game at home. But now, if
the Cowboys are going to make it to the Super Bowl they will have
to do it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The Cowboys
are confident they can beat the Vikings there in part because
Sanders is healthy. With his speed, he can control an entire half
of the secondary and limit some of the Vikings' big-play capability
in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was limping with an injured groin and hamstring when the
Cowboys lost to Minnesota, 27-17, on Nov. 8. He missed Minnesota's
46-36 victory on Thanksgiving in 1998 because of an injured big
toe.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Moss and Carter accounted for 65 percent of the
Vikings' total offense and seven touchdowns in those two games
against Dallas. Moss caught three touchdown passes and wound up
with 163 yards, and Carter had seven catches for 135 yards in the
victory last season. Then they combined for 15 catches, three
touchdowns and 207 yards in November.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of Dallas' secondary is just as banged-up as
Sanders was the two previous times. Left cornerback Kevin Smith has
been in and out of the lineup for the last month with a hamstring
injury. His backup, Kevin Mathis, has missed the last two games
with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Mathis returned to practice last week and will
probably play. In the Nov. 8 game, Vikings quarterback Jeff George
took advantage of Charles Williams, a converted safety who was
filling in for Smith. Most of the big plays to Moss went against
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coaches will probably mix their coverages to keep George
guessing. So Sanders, who lines up on the right side, probably
won't be locked on Moss all afternoon. In the Nov. 8 game, Sanders
lined up against Moss 15 times and George threw that way only
twice: Moss had an 8-yard reception and Sanders knocked down a long
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion's unbelievable,'' George said. ``When he's not healthy
he's unbelievable. Just his presence on the field is unbelievable.
But that doesn't mean you shy away from the guy. We have confidence
in our receivers and our running game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are counting on their defensive line to give the
secondary some help. Dallas defensive players believe that if they
can get to George and knock him around, he will become so rattled
that he won't get the ball to his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive side of the ball, the Cowboys are hoping that
running back Emmitt Smith will be able to pick up where he left off
in that Nov. 8 game. Smith rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns
to stake the Cowboys to a 17-0 lead before leaving the game in the
first half with a broken hand. Smith is healthy and is coming off a
122-yard rushing game against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys' defensive front can't get to George enough, then
it will be up to Dallas' offense to keep the Vikings' offense off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish our offense would let that clock tick down to the last
second before we snap every ball,'' Sanders said, ``because the
more you keep those guys off the field, the less opportunities they
have.''

DOLPHINS AND SEAHAWKS: 2 TEAMS WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Miami Dolphins and the Seattle Seahawks are concerned
that they enter their American Football Conference wild-card
playoff game in Seattle on Sunday with zero momentum, they are
concealing it well.
</P>
<P>
   Both losers of five of their last six games, and 9-7 overall,
the teams are talking more like Super Bowl contenders. Never mind
that the Dolphins haven't won a road playoff game in 28 years. Or
that the Seahawks rank a woeful 23rd in the league on both offense
and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to our problem is us,'' the veteran Miami defensive
end Trace Armstrong said. ``If you look at the games we've lost,
they've really kind of followed the same theme: turning the ball
over and not getting turnovers. We look at our conference and
there's not that one dominant team. It's a matter of who gets hot,
who doesn't make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have a similar vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been invited to the dance, you can take the prom
queen home,'' linebacker Chad Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Phillip Daniels added, ``We're good enough to win
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be contested in the Kingdome, which figures to be
a significant plus for the Seahawks. It took just 75 minutes for
the team to sell its final 20,000 tickets for the game, and Seattle
is counting on crowd noise to hurt Miami's ability to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be absolutely rocking in there,'' coach Mike
Holmgren said. ``Then we have to play up to our fans'
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have never lost a home playoff game, but that can
be misleading. They haven't had one since 1984, when most of their
current players were adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Each team seems to be drawing strength from the other's
perceived weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're going to a place where the team is a
world-beater with only one loss,'' Miami guard Kevin Donnalley
said. ``It's a team that has had losses like we have. If we can get
back to the way we were playing earlier in the year, we feel real
good about our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami was 8-2 at one point in the season. Of course, so was
Seattle. Eerily, their seasons have nearly mirrored each other.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between them is that the Dolphins' collapse has
been played out amid growing tension between two of the league's
highest-profile individuals, coach Jimmy Johnson, with two Super
Bowl victories from his Dallas tenure, and quarterback Dan Marino,
whose many records include one as the league's career
passing-yardage leader.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has sought for several seasons now to rein in Marino
from his high-risk passing tendencies. Johnson has been stymied in
large part because of the lack of a suitable running game, but that
has not kept him from making his unhappiness known. The coach is
forever talking these days about how turnovers often lead to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has thrown 17 interceptions this season, 12 of them
during the team's 19-turnover siege over the last six games.
Johnson even disclosed a statistic of his own last week. During
Marino's 17-year career, the Dolphins are a lowly 28-46 when Marino
throws at least two interceptions in a game. And under Johnson,
that record is even more stark: 2-13.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason the Dolphins streamlined their offense during
the week, shaping a more conservative game plan that they hope can
include plenty of running. The key there may well be the rookie
running back J.J. Johnson, who has been hobbled by a right
hamstring pull but is expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   A significant subplot is whether Johnson or Marino, or both,
will retire at season's end. Predictably, neither was forthcoming
heading into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in fact, implored the Miami news media ``to put the
soap opera on the back burner for one week'' while the Dolphins try
to refocus against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If this should be Marino's final game, it appears that his
teammates will think about it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is thinking about that right now,''
Donnalley said. ``We're just trying to focus on this game, how can
we win this game for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Seahawks are hoping that quarterback Jon Kitna
will have running back Ricky Watters to deflect some pressure.
Watters, with 1,210 yards rushing, has been dealing with a sprained
right knee ligament but hopes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot that's going to be placed on my shoulders, but
I like it that way,'' Watters said. ``I'm going to have to be out
there showing the guys how it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters, in his ninth year, presumably views this game similarly
to the way Marino does. ``If you don't win, you're going to be
watching,'' Watters said. ``And it's this simple: I'd rather keep
playing.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HISTORY LESSONS FROM THE SLAVES OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While New Yorkers celebrated a new century, a team of biological
anthropologists at Howard University in Washington were intensely
focused on a most grisly aspect of New York City's past. Led by Dr.
Michael Blakey, the team has spent several years examining the
skeletal remains of more than 400 African slaves whose graves were
accidentally uncovered during the construction of a federal office
tower in lower Manhattan nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That the graves existed at all surprised New Yorkers who grew up
believing that theirs was a ``free'' state where there had never
been slavery. But a series of reports from the Blakey team _ the
first due out early this year _ will present statistics to show
that colonial New York was just as dependent on slavery as many
Southern cities, and in some cases even more so. In addition, the
brutality etched on these skeletons easily matches the worst of
what we know of slavery in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The first slave ship that sailed into Jamestown Harbor in
Virginia in 1619 contained a handful of captive Africans. But by
the end of the Atlantic slave trade more than two centuries later,
somewhere between 8 million and 12 million Africans had arrived in
the New World in chains. The historian Ira Berlin, author of ``Many
Thousands Gone,'' estimates that one slave perished for every one
who survived capture in the African interior and made it alive to
the New World _ meaning that as many as 12 million more captive
Africans perished along the way.
</P>
<P>
   During the 16th century, the massive outflow of slaves decimated
countries like the Kingdom of the Kongo, whose monarch, King
Affonso I, wrote letter after letter imploring King Joao III of
Portugal to cease the slave trade because it was generating
``depravity . . . so widespread that our land is entirely
depopulated.'' He said that ``a monstrous greed pushes our
subjects, even Christians, to seize members of their own families,
and of ours, to do business by selling them as captives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stolen Africans ended up in the United States, some
of them in the Dutch colonial city of New Amsterdam, which later
became New York City. The Dutch recruited settlers with an
advertisement that promised to provide them with slaves who ``would
accomplish more work for their masters, at less expense than
[white) farm servants, who must be bribed to go thither by a great
deal of money and promises.'' Integral to the colony from the
start, slaves helped build Trinity Church, the streets of the city
and the wall _ from which Wall Street takes its name _ that
protected the colony from military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In life, slaves lived in attics, hallways and beneath porches,
cheek to jowl with their masters and mistresses. In death, these
same slaves were banished to the Negro Burial Ground, which lay a
mile outside the city limits and contained between 10,000 and
20,000 bodies by the time it was closed in 1794, according to the
historian Dr. Sherrill Wilson. The graveyard was paved over, built
upon and forgotten _ until 1991, when the General Services
Administration excavated the foundation for a new tower. After
protests from black New Yorkers, the agency agreed to finance
research on the skeletons, but failed to budget the necessary money
and generally dragged its feet, putting one of the most important
archaeological projects of the century years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard team has yet to identify among the skeletons the many
Africans who are known to have been burned at the stake during the
rebellion-plot hysteria that swept the colony in 1741. But what the
researchers have found is brutal enough on its own. Of the 400
skeletons taken to Howard, about 40 percent are of children under
the age of 15, and the most common cause of death was malnutrition.
Most of the children had rickets, scurvy, anemia or related
diseases. About twice as many infant girls seem to have died as
boys, suggesting at least some infanticide. As Blakey said, ``Women
who gave birth in these conditions knew that they were bringing
their children into hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult skeletons show that many of these people died of
unrelenting hard labor. Strain on the muscles and ligaments was so
extreme that muscle attachments were commonly ripped away from the
skeleton _ taking chunks of bone with them _ leaving the body in
perpetual pain. The highest mortality rate is found among those
ages 15 to 20. Blakey has concluded that some died of illnesses
acquired in the holds of slave ships or from a first exposure to
the cold _ or from the trauma of being torn from their families and
shipped in chains halfway around the globe. But in many cases, he
said, ``what we see is that these women were worked to death by
owners who could simply go out and buy a new slave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blakey team will conduct two sets of studies in an attempt
to determine more closely where the slaves where born. One study
will analyze tooth enamel for trace minerals that would mark the
captives as having grown up in Africa, the Caribbean or in North
America. If DNA research proceeds as planned, it will further pin
down the country of origin by comparing the dead with known
populations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The skeletons will be returned to their graves by 2002. By then
the burial ground will have rewritten the book on slavery in New
York and given historians something to talk about well into the
next century.

EDITORIAL: REGULATING DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The dietary supplement industry, freed from strict regulation by
the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, has made a
vast variety of herbal remedies as readily available on supermarket
shelves as ordinary vitamins. Millions of consumers now take
supplements, like ginkgo, kava and St. John's wort, that were
largely unknown in mainstream markets even a few years ago.
Although some research suggests that some supplements can produce
positive health effects, there have also been cases where people
have been made ill by supplements, or their conditions have become
worse while they tried to use ineffective dietary supplements to
treat a medical disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite explosive growth in this industry, there is very little
guidance or protection afforded to consumers. The 1994 act severely
limited the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to police
supplements for safety and effectiveness. Now the FDA has made this
situation worse. It will allow supplement makers to make even
broader marketing claims about their products under regulations
that go into effect next month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, manufacturers can make claims that their products
affect the ``structure or function'' of the body without having to
go through the strict FDA approval process required of drugs. But
they are not allowed to claim that the products prevent, treat or
cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the FDA proposed regulations to clarify the distinction
between the two types of claims. The proposal stated that while
pregnancy, menopause or general aging are not diseases, certain
conditions associated with those states may be considered diseases,
and products claiming to treat those conditions could therefore be
subject to prior FDA approval. But after enormous opposition from
the supplement industry and consumers, the FDA reversed itself and
decided that common symptoms associated with life stages would not
be considered ``diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that supplement makers will be allowed to claim that
their products can treat hot flashes in menopause, ordinary morning
sickness during pregnancy and even hair loss associated with aging.
Serious or abnormal conditions would still be considered diseases.
But the new regulations give supplement marketers leeway to make
dubious claims and encourage consumers to treat conditions with
products that may be ineffective or, worse, actually harmful. Given
growing use of dietary supplements in this country, it is more
important than ever that Congress tighten the law to allow greater
regulation of this industry.

EASING REMOVAL OF ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has been to a hardware store in winter knows that
there are scores of products on the market designed to make ice-
and snow-removal less of a backbreaking chore. But sorting through
the various chemicals, compounds, combinations, concentrations and
price-per-ice-melting-pound computations is better suited to a
chemist with a degree in economics than to a homeowner with an inch
of ice on his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all de-icers are created equal,'' said Edward Chouinard,
president of Standard Tar Products, a company based in Milwaukee
that makes Snomelt Instant Ice Melter. ``But virtually all de-icers
work on the same basic principle: They lower the freezing point of
the water produced by the ice they melt.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, whose company manufactures de-icing products used by
homeowners, commercial property managers and state and local
highway departments, explained that while plain water freezes at 32
degrees Fahrenheit, the freezing point of water containing a
de-icing chemical is lower than that _ sometimes much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about Snomelt is that it's exothermic,''
Chouinard said. ``That means that when you mix it with water, it
creates heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some de-icers _ for example, sodium chloride, better known as
halite or rock salt _ are endothermic, meaning that they need to
absorb heat from the atmosphere, sunlight or friction from tires to
melt ice or snow. As a result, while rock salt is the least
expensive de-icing agent available _ selling for anywhere from
$2.50 to $4 for a 50-pound bag _ it is only effective at
temperatures above 15 or 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Products like Snomelt, on the other hand, which is 90 percent to
95 percent calcium chloride and sells for about $15 for a 50-pound
bag, can melt ice or snow at temperatures as low as minus 59
degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the concentration of the chemical
in the solution produced by the melting ice _ a solution that
de-icing experts call brine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is the brine produced by a de-icing product _ rather
than the melting action of the product itself _ that does the work
the homeowner is hoping to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Rick May, marketing manager for Dow Chemical in Midland, Mich.,
said that most de-icing products work by penetrating the ice,
dissolving into brine and then seeping into the pores of the
concrete under the ice. Once there, the brine breaks the bond
between the ice and the sidewalk, making it easier to remove the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   May added that while calcium chloride can indeed melt ice at
minus 59 degrees Farenheit, that is the ``laboratory limit'' of the
chemical's effectiveness. ``In the real world, its practical
effective temperature is more like minus 28 degrees Fahrenheit,''
he said, adding that the effective temperature of the chemical
decreases because its concentration in the brine becomes lower as
more and more ice melts.
</P>
<P>
   He also explained that since calcium chloride is effective at
such a low temperature, products containing it are less likely to
cause problems on concrete surfaces, which are vulnerable to damage
as a result of being exposed to freeze-thaw cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The damage occurs, he said, when water that has been melted by
the de-icer refreezes because the temperature has dropped below the
level at which the de-icer is effective. When that happens, the
concrete may crack.
</P>
<P>
   When de-icers like plain rock salt are used, May said, the
freezing point of the brine is relatively high _ around 15 degrees
to 20 degrees Fahrenheit _ thereby making it more likely that the
temperature will drop to a point where the melted ice will
refreeze. When a de-icer like calcium chloride is used, on the
other hand, the temperature would have to fall below minus 28
degrees for the ice to refreeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``De-icer damage to concrete is usually not a chemical
reaction,'' May said. In addition to products like calcium chloride
and sodium chloride _ the most and least expensive consumer
de-icing chemicals, respectively _ other de-icers on the market
include potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and urea, as well as
various combinations of some or all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meltdown Near Zero, for example, a de-icer manufactured by
EnviroTech Services, a company based in Greeley, Colo., contains a
combination of sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium chlorides.
According to Kenberly Dannatt, a sales assistant for the company,
the product _ which has a dark color to increase its ability to
absorb solar energy, thereby increasing the melting rate _ can work
at temperatures as low as minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that manufacture rock salt are aware of the
virtues of mixing more potent chemical de-icers in with their salt.
Cargill Salt, a company based in Minneapolis, for example,
manufactures Jiffy Melt, a combination of ordinary rock salt and
magnesium chloride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of Jiffy Melt is that the salt gives it a high
melting capacity at higher temperatures while the magnesium
chloride allows it to keep working by dropping the freezing point
down to about minus 10 degrees,'' said David Merriweather, director
of quality assurance for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another de-icer that contains magnesium chloride is Freeze
Fighter, a relatively new product that is intended to prevent snow
or ice from accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeze Fighter is something we've been selling to state
highway departments for about 15 years,'' said Robin Reid,
communications specialist for Reilly Industries, an Indianapolis
company that manufactures the product. ``And this year we decided
that it's something we should be offering to homeowners, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeze Fighter, which is a liquid, is designed to be applied to
a sidewalk or driveway before or shortly after snow has started to
fall, Ms. Reid said, and should prevent as much as two inches of
snow from accumulating. In other words, she said, if only two
inches of snow falls, none should stick on treated surfaces. ``And
if four inches fall, you should only have two inches to shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   The product, which is applied with a garden sprayer and remains
effective until it is washed away by rain or melting snow, costs
about $9 a gallon _ an amount that will provide coverage of about
2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeze Fighter is not just a de-icer, it's an anti-ice and
snow agent,'' Ms. Reid said. ``It allows the homeowner to take a
proactive rather than reactive stance against snow and ice. When
you start seeing flurries, you can get out there and spray.''

   Short relievers are a relatively new phenomenon in baseball, a
result of the evolution of the manner in which starting pitchers
have been used. It has been only 31 years since the rule for
determining saves was defined. But in the coming season, a
statistical standard seemingly possible only for starters may be
challenged by a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the New York Yankees' peerless closer, did not
allow a run after July 21 last year, and he will carry a streak of
30 2-3 scoreless innings into this season. That leaves him 28 1-3
innings short of Orel Hershiser's record of 59 innings, set for the
Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rivera's streak has been compiled in bits and pieces of
games, while Hershiser's came with a burst of complete games,
Rivera's streak will be treated the same as Hershiser's in the
record book, according to Seymour Siwoff, president of the Elias
Sports Bureau. Interestingly, however, Hershiser's mark was counted
differently than Rivera's.
</P>
<P>
   When Hershiser broke Don Drysdale's 1968 record of 58 innings,
the common practice was to count innings as a whole. For example,
if Hershiser allowed a run with two outs in the sixth inning, then
he would be credited with pitching five scoreless innings. But
Rivera can not be held to such a stringent standard, Siwoff notes,
because his particular role often calls for him to pitch in thirds
of an inning. If Rivera's streak was counted in the same way as
Hershiser's, would an appearance of one and one-third innings count
as two scoreless innings or one? (If Rivera was credited with a
scoreless inning if he pitched one-third or two-thirds of an
innings in an outing, then his streak of consecutive scoreless
innings would be 33).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange sort of thing in his case,'' Siwoff said on
Friday. ``In fairness to him, you've got to count it the other
way,'' and include one-third or two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   A reliever may have built a streak longer than Rivera's, but
Siwoff doesn't know about it; records for consecutive scoreless
innings by a reliever are not maintained. ``If he gets into the
40s,'' Siwoff said, referring to Rivera's count of scoreless
innings, ``that would be something we'd take a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not sure what their own team record for
consecutive scoreless innings is, for a starter or reliever. Since
1988, the longest scoreless streak by any Yankees pitcher was by
Lee Guetterman, a reliever who threw 29 2-3 consecutive innings
without allowing a run from April 6 to May 24 in 1989. In 1996,
Rivera pitched 26 straight scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is asked to get anywhere from one to six outs in his
appearances, and so if he does challenge Hershiser's record, his
pursuit will be made slowly and steadily. He needs 28 2-3 innings
of scoreless relief to surpass Hershiser, and last season, he did
not throw his 29th inning until June 26. Going that long without
allowing a run is difficult enough, and power pitchers like Rivera
typically require a few extra weeks to build arm strength and
regain their best fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser carried his streak of 59 consecutive scoreless innings
into opening day of the 1989 season, and in his first inning of
work, Cincinnati's Todd Benzinger singled home Barry Larkin with
two outs. If Rivera moves closer to Hershiser's mark, does this
mean then that those two outs will be added to Hershiser's record?

<P>
   HE CAN HIT, BUT ...
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed power hitters who can catch usually generate
exceptional interest on the open market, but with about five weeks
before the start of spring training, the free agent Dave Nilsson
remains unsigned, strangely.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Nilsson were coming off a bad year. He hit .309
with 21 homers with the Milwaukee Brewers last season, and he is
healthy enough to be a part-time catcher, as well as play first
base or serve as the designated hitter. He has always been viewed
as a good guy, a positive presence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson initially asked for a three-year deal for $4 million to
$5 million a season, executives say. ``That might be too high for
someone who'll play a lot of first base,'' one American League
official said last week. ``There's a glut of good first basemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is, then, that Nilsson _ a native of Australia _ could sign
a huge contract to play in Japan, and then be allowed to play for
his homeland in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   While first base may be a loaded position, there is a general
lack of quality third basemen _ making it odd that there are
several at that position still available.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known since last summer that the Montreal Expos, for
instance, have had designs on shifting Michael Barrett from third
base to his natural position at catcher, but lack a suitable
replacement. What about Ed Sprague, unsigned after hitting 22
homers for Pittsburgh last year? Or Russ Davis, the former Yankees
prospect who was not tendered a contract by Seattle in spite of his
power potential?
</P>
<P>
   There is interest in the remaining pitchers, and now that Aaron
Sele, the best of the free-agent pitchers, signed with Baltimore on
Friday, the others are likely to reach agreements as well. Andy
Benes, for one, signed a three-year, $18 million deal with St.
Louis hours after the Sele announcement. The Cardinals previously
added the pitchers Darryl Kile and Pat Hentgen in trades.
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILIAR ORIOLES ROAD
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Aaron Sele leaves the Orioles almost in the
position they were in a year ago. Their rotation could be among the
best in the American League, with Sele _ a ground-ball pitcher who
should work well in small Camden Yards _ joining Mike Mussina,
Scott Erickson and the talented youngsters Sidney Ponson and Jason
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, starting pitching must drive the Orioles, for
the other elements of the team are questionable, with an unbalanced
and slow lineup, a disparate clubhouse makeup and the same
problematic bullpen. Baltimore's primary goal this off-season was
to improve a bullpen that blew 25 of 58 save chances last year, but
while most of the names have changed, the Orioles' relief corps
could be just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McElroy, a left-hander acquired from the Mets for Jesse
Orosco, is a high-ball pitcher totally ill suited for Camden Yards,
and the other left-handed specialist, Buddy Groom, is not exactly
reliable; the Yankees' left-handed-hitting right fielder Paul
O'Neill, for example, has 10 hits in 14 at-bats in his career
(.714) against Groom.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have tried make-overs as well:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tampa Bay Devil Rays have added the sluggers Vinny
Castilla and Greg Vaughn to a group that already includes Jose
Canseco and Fred McGriff, giving this team a lineup loaded with
high-strikeout bangers. In other words, they are no closer to
qualifying for a playoff spot, except in fantasy leagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Colorado Rockies made the playoffs once in eight years
while fielding a team of heavy hitters who exploited the thin
atmospheric conditions of Denver. So Dan O'Dowd, the team's new
general manager, is trying a different approach, filling his
outfield with speed. That should improve the team's defense, and
its pitching in turn, but until the Rockies figure out a way to
maintain the confidence of young pitchers in such a unusual
environment for baseball, nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Houston Astros dealt outfielders Carl Everett, Derek Bell
and the All-Star pitcher Mike Hampton, as they addressed budget
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Seattle Mariners tried to increase the left-handed
presence in their lineup, adding first baseman John Olerud,
outfielder Stan Javier and second baseman Mark McLemore _ all of
whom can bat left-handed.  &QL;

OUR TOWNS: A DOWNTOWN TOO DECAF FOR STARBUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATT PURDY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ At first, it doesn't hit you. A stroll down Main
Avenue reveals an ordinary, if aging, suburban downtown with a shoe
repair shop, a couple of dry cleaners, a luncheonette here, a
bakery there, a computer store. But soon you realize something is
amiss. Terribly amiss. Your eyes sweep the streetscape, and you can
hardly believe it. There's no Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   In its manifest destiny to caffeinate America, Starbucks appears
to have missed downtown Clifton. More curiously, when local
officials and developers recently informed the Seattle-based
company of its apparent oversight and invited them to open a cafe
as part of a renovation project, Starbucks said thanks, but no
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton became a suburban downtown Starbucks didn't want, and
another front in the emerging class conflict over coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Like other close-in suburbs, Clifton is a crossroads of
industrial grit and middle class comfort. Its face to the world is
a neon clock atop the Tick Tock Diner on Route 3 imploring drivers
to ``Eat Heavy.'' Clifton has its share of commuter subdivisions,
but its downtown sits between Passaic and Paterson, whose South
American, Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants are moving into what
was once a white-ethnic city. Last year, the City Council declared
English the government's official language.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment is a bid ``to distinguish ourselves,'' said
Patrick DeLora Jr., president of DeLuxe Cleaners, who heads the
downtown improvement group. ``We're trying to get more of an
upscale image.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Clifton decided it needed a good $3.30 caramel
macchiato.
</P>
<P>
   But a Starbucks on Main Avenue would violate a largely
unrecognized maxim that all suburban downtowns are divided into two
groups: those with a profusion of expensive coffee places and those
with a profusion of expensive nail salons.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton has many nail shops, three near where developers hoped
Starbucks would sprout. At Choice Nails, Suzanne Garretson had her
hand in a Heat 'N Dry, after having her nails tipped and wrapped
for $45. ``Their coffee is expensive,'' she said of Starbucks.
``You go in, and they say, do you want this one or that one or this
flavor or that flavor, and I am, like, just give me the basic
black.'' Her nails were basic brown.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks is to basic coffee what tips and wraps are to
straight-up nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   The company's mission is ``inspiring and nurturing the human
spirit,'' said Arthur Rubinfeld, senior vice president for store
development at Starbucks, which has 2,200 stores in North America.
``People connect to coffee,'' he said. ``Coffee is the facilitator,
the glue that holds people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Clifton is going to have to make do with regular old
paste. While Starbucks has stores in other faded downtowns _ and
its coffee is sold at Barnes &AMP; Noble, including the one on Route 3
_ Rubinfeld said Main Avenue ``didn't have the retail synergy to
merit the investment we make in our stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the people of Clifton are holding up. A few were
drowning their sorrows the other day with 85-cent coffee at the
Clifton Spa, a luncheonette with Formica counters and swivel stools
that has found synergy on Main Avenue for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a certain type of person who likes Starbucks,'' said
Albina DeLora, the mother of DeLora, the dry cleaner. She has seen
how the other half drinks at the Starbucks in nearby Montclair.
``They like to sit and read their journals and do their laptops and
have their coffee. You have to have a laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubinfeld says Starbucks has brought people in suburbs together,
declaring, ``We are the front porch of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clifton Spa must be the tailgate. ``The backbone of
America,'' Richard Schiro, a security guard, calls it. ``A man
making $300 a week could come in here and feel comfortable. If they
go to Starbucks, they have to first look and see if they can afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at the Clifton Spa. Scott Reid, the owner, will keep a tab
running for you and, as for nurturing the human spirit, when
there's a rare lull in banter at the counter, the TV in the corner
with rabbit-ear antennae gets pretty good reception.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Just like at Starbucks, the Spa's customers love the
coffee and, Reid said, ``they squawk about the price.''

 &HT;    `Fast Eddie' may be fresh out of luck
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ ``Fast Eddie'' has always been a fitting nickname
for Edwin Edwards. The smooth-talking, lady-killing, four-term
former governor of Louisiana has walked _ no, strutted _ out of two
federal racketeering trials a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in a federal court in Baton Rouge, he goes on trial
again, this time with his son Stephen and four other co-defendants.
They are charged with extorting money from the state's casinos and
tampering with the licensing process. There are 28 counts against
Edwards. The former governor, as always, says he is innocent and is
confident a jury will agree.
</P>
<P>
   But something has changed: Observers and even old friends
predict this could be the case that slows him down for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwin Edwards is obviously in a serious situation,'' said Gus
Weill, who was Edwards' political consultant in the 1970s. ``He's
72 years old and he's married to a lovely young woman, and he faces
dying in a federal prison. His son Stephen is also on trial and has
five young children. This is a human tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause for concern is the federal government's mountain of
evidence, collected during almost three years of investigation.
Prosecutors have tapes _ audio and video _ of Edwards and others
talking in vulgar language about extortion and the ``Louisiana
way'' of doing business. Moreover, several old friends and
potential co-defendants, including San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie
DeBartolo Jr., have pleaded guilty and are helping prosecutors in
exchange for lighter punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very salacious testimony,'' said John
Maginnis, publisher of the Louisiana Political Fax Weekly. ``When
this thing first started, people were saying, `They'll never
convict him.' Now they're saying, `This time I think they got
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stem from events in 1991 _ when Edwards was in
his fourth and final term as governor, and the state legalized
gambling _ and in 1996-97, when Edwards was out of office.
Louisiana limits riverboat casinos to 15. And that turns the gaming
licenses into a valuable and coveted commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say Edwards and others took advantage of the
situation and demanded payoffs from casino owners in exchange for
favorable rulings from the state licensing board.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that in 1996 and '97, when DeBartolo was
applying for the state's 15th and final riverboat casino license,
Edwards and son Stephen repeatedly demanded payoffs ranging from
$10,000 a month to a lump sum of $400,000. Despite being out of
office, Edwards continued to wield awesome power in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just one of several schemes alleged by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwards has never faced anything like this,'' Maginnis said.
``And now that he's not governor, people are less afraid of him and
more afraid of the federal government.'' That's why so many old
associates made deals with the prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weill agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time he'll be confronted by allies who have
turned against him,'' he said. ``I think this is a whole new ball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Edwards is acquitted in this trial, which is expected to
last three months, he faces yet another indictment. He and
Insurance Commissioner Jim Brown have been charged with helping the
owner of the failed Cascade Insurance Co. avoid paying millions of
dollars in a legal settlement with the state. In addition, Edwards
is an unindicted co-conspirator in an alleged payoff involving a
New Orleans garbage contract. Former Houston Mayor Fred Hofheinz
and Edwards' close friend Cecil Brown were indicted and have
pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   At Edwards' trials in 1985 and 1986 on federal fraud and
racketeering charges stemming from state hospital licenses, the
case hinged largely on a paper trail. There were no secret tapes or
old friends weaving lurid details of back room deals. Edwards
provided most of the excitement: He taun By Clients of the New York

 &HT;    Parties clearly split this time
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The late George Wallace once complained that there
wasn't ``a dime's worth of difference'' between the Democratic and
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same room on consecutive nights in New Hampshire last
week, the parties' candidates for president showed that Wallace's
lament does not hold in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   You had to strain to hear the word ``tax'' when Democrats Bill
Bradley and Al Gore debated Wednesday. Bradley talked about two
pieces of tax legislation, the most recent of which was 14 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   When the six Republican candidates got together the next night,
taxes were a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his $483 billion proposed tax cut, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas could not think of an occasion where reducing taxes would
not be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a recession, it's important to cut the taxes to
make sure our economy grows,'' he said. ``It's also important to
cut the taxes when there's times of plenty, as an insurance policy
against an economic slowdown.'' To some degree, these kind of
differences are to be expected during primary season, when the most
likely voters also are the most ideological.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps because the candidates spoke in the same place a
day apart, the differences between the parties seemed especially
clear.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Bradley and Gore both mentioned their support for
abortion rights. No Republican favors allowing abortions in any but
the most limited circumstances, and some candidates would appoint
as judges only abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore advocated allowing gays to serve openly in the
armed forces. All the Republicans criticized that idea. Rutgers
University political scientist Ross Baker said he was struck more
by the Democratic message, which he described as moving to the left
to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us thought that Bill Clinton had rewritten the rule
book in '92 by not only being more centrist, but actually going out
of his way in some instances to stiff a couple of liberal
constituencies,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the nominees probably will move toward the
center of the political spectrum in the fall. MCCAIN DRAWS FIRE
OVER AID TO DONOR
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) predicted to reporters in New
Hampshire before the holidays that his high-flying campaign
probably would make an ``egregious'' mistake before long.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, his campaign was mostly on the defensive in the first
week back from a holiday break after the Boston Globe reported that
McCain wrote the Federal Communications Commission urging action in
a matter involving Paxson Communications, a major contributor and
supplier of a corporate jet for his campaign use.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, McCain acknowledged that ``we are under a
cloud of suspicion'' because of the vast sums of money in political
campaigns, and he canceled a planned fund-raising event with
Paxson's founder because he feared it would generate more bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain insisted he had done nothing wrong. ``I'd do the same
thing tomorrow,'' McCain said in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no claim that McCain acted illegally in writing
the FCC and bluntly calling for a decision by Dec. 15 on whether to
approve the purchase of a Pittsburgh television station by Paxson
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   McCain denied any connection between contributions from Paxson
and his action. He said he wrote the letter in his capacity as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC.
And, he said, he has frequently clashed with the FCC's slow-moving
bureaucracy. In fact, the complex issue had been pending for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the harsher criticism of McCain was that he had been shown
to practice the same kind of politics _ acting on behalf of special
interests _ that he rails against at campaign events and is
pledging to eliminate if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paxson matter, McCain received $20,000 from Paxson and
its law firm, Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson, which also represents The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He used a Paxson-owned plane the days
before and after his Dec. 10 letter to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSPOKEN GORE AIDE RIPS REPUBLICANS ON RACE
</P>
<P>
   Gore came to the defense Friday of Donna Brazile, his
sharp-tongued campaign manager, over her comments about retired
Gen. Colin Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because
they have no program, no policy,'' she said in a recent interview
with bloomberg.com. ``They play that game because they have no
other game. They have no love and no joy. They'd rather take
pictures with black children than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said her comments were ``racist,'' while Powell said he
was ``disappointed and offended.'' Brazile, Powell and Watts are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said she would continue in her job, even as he praised
Powell as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile has caused controversy before.In 1988, she quit
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign after she told
reporters to check out rumors about President George Bush's
personal life.

FEWER NEW YORKERS, PAIRED OFF OR NOT, ARE TYING THE KNOT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marriage rates in New York City are at their lowest
levels since the era when the Bee Gees ruled the airwaves, Farrah
Fawcett sold her own shampoo and the first test-tube baby was born
in England.
</P>
<P>
   Economic incentives that make the single life attractive, a
dearth of twentysomethings and an increased social acceptance of
lives lived under one roof without a certificate are among the
chief reasons for the decline, sociologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of marriages in the city fell 30 percent
between 1997 _ the only year in the last decade when marriage rates
soared _ and last year. The 1997 increase was due largely to
anticipated changes in federal immigration laws that sent thousands
on desperate trips to City Hall in an effort to gain proper legal
status. In the last few years, marriage rates in the city have been
at their lowest level since the late 1970s. In 1997, the rate per
thousand was 9.1; in 1999, it was 7.6, according to preliminary
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The New York statistics mirror a national trend: The rate per
1,000 Americans who married in 1998 was 8.3, the lowest since 1958,
when 8.4 people per 1,000 were wed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers basically have all had their initial marriage
by now,'' said Tom Smith, who runs the National Opinion Research
Center at the University of Chicago. ``And we have a relatively
small pool of people in the prime ready-to-get-married age now,''
he added. That age is about 25; the number of births in the United
States declined 16 percent between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Money is a significant factor. Marriage may cause financial
strain for some couples, said Linda Waite, a professor of sociology
at the University of Chicago who recently wrote a book on marriage.
Low-wage earners often find that certain tax credits evaporate with
marriage, and some Medicaid recipients lose their benefits when
they marry someone who works, even at a low-paying job. Among
high-income workers, people bemoan what is known as the marriage
tax.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, at least one incentive for marriage _ health
insurance coverage through a spouse _ has waned. Many state
governments and private corporations now offer benefits to domestic
partners, often with very liberal definitions of a couple.
</P>
<P>
   But economic factors and even an increase in cohabitation do not
fully explain the steep downturn, Waite said, ``unless people are
cohabitating permanently, and then what you have is a big change in
the way we relate to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Speth, 36, who lives in Brooklyn with his girlfriend,
Rebecca Hilton, said that his way of relating pleased him just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be married,'' he said emphatically. ``That
doesn't mean I'll be a bachelor. I don't need the state's
imprimatur. It is enough for me to love and be loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who choose to live together rather than
marry has exploded in the last few decades. Among Americans born in
the 1970s, about 65 percent say their first live-in partner was not
a spouse. Among people born in the 1940s, the average was closer to
26 percent. Put another way, the number of people now cohabitating
is 7 percent of all American couples; in 1960, the figure was 1
percent, according to figures from the National Opinion Research
Center.

<P>
   Pop culture reinforces the notion: Billy and Georgia, the
married couple in ``Ally McBeal,'' are splitsville. Over in
``Friends,'' Chandler and Monica are living in unwedded bliss, so
far.
</P>
<P>
   New York has always had the reputation of breeding intense
careerists who race from the office to the gym to the bedrooms,
where they scarf down a plate of penne with vodka sauce alone in
front of ``Nightline.'' But people all over the country have chosen
to marry later, if at all, after getting set in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Davis of Houston said that as a child, she always
imagined herself married by the time she was in her 30s. But after
a heartbreak in her mid-20s she turned her attention away from
dating and romance and toward building her career as a corporate
travel planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views went a different way,'' said Ms. Davis, now 33. ``I
decided to climb that corporate ladder.'' There were long hours and
lots of overtime. There has also been a boyfriend, whom she kept as
a ``comfort,'' she said, but never considered marrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be disappointed if I never get married,'' Ms. Davis
said. ``But I am an independent person and I absorb a lot of the
family experiences through my own family.''
</P>
<P>
   She is clearly not alone: the number of people who applied for
marriage licenses in Houston last year was 23,987, a 23 percent
decline since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea McGinty, the chairwoman of It's Just Lunch, a dating
service with offices in 28 cities, said that most New Yorkers who
come to her office were hoping to expand their social circle beyond
clients and co-workers. But marriage is often far from their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not coming in here saying, `I've got to get
married,' or `My clock is ticking,''' Ms. McGinty said. ``Half of
the city was transplanted here for career reasons, so marriage is
not as big a priority for them as, say, for people in
Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Benaderet of Manhattan, a publishing account manager,
says that each decade of her life brings her a new reason for not
focusing on getting married. In her 20s, she was a professional
figure skater, which was all-consuming. ``In my early 30s,'' said
Ms. Benaderet, who is 38, ``I was more concentrated on me and
pulling myself together. I was reading books, doing touch therapy,
healing yoga, things for me. Then my father was sick, so he was the
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not believe that any current relationship will result
in marriage, and that is just fine with her. ``I would like a
partner,'' Ms. Benaderet said, ``but not with the marriage tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of studies in recent years have cited the health and
economic benefits of marriage, particularly for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at well over 1,000 studies that overwhelmingly
show the strong and consistent relationship between marriage and
well-being,'' said Waite, whose book ``The Case for Marriage'' is
to be published by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   In studies, married people demonstrate stronger financial
stability, longer life spans, more active and satisfying sex lives,
less alcohol abuse and more sexual fidelity, Waite said. People who
live together do not rate nearly as high in these categories, she
said, and their relationships do not emulate marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cohabitation is a different bargain than marriage,'' she said.
``Unless couples are engaged, they tend to be much less committed.
They are unlikely to have joint checking accounts. They are much
less likely to be faithful. They spend their leisure time
differently. It is not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there something inherent in the New York dating experience
that prevents marriage? Ms. McGinty, whose dating service puts
people together for a single lunch date, leaving the rest to
nature, tried to put it gently. ``New Yorkers need to understand
that it is a date, not a negotiation, and that we need to bring our
manners with us. This is not an hour to interview someone. Being
able to turn off the workday and use this as personal time would
help.''

 &HT;    Hall might be nearing for Morris, Fisk, Perez
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Baseball Writers' Association of America, which
for much of the last decade guarded the gates to Cooperstown as if
protecting the tomb of Abner Doubleday himself, composed itself
last year and waved in a class of three new Hall of Famers last
January.
</P>
<P>
   That largess, which matched the total from the previous three
years, could well be equaled when the Class of 2000 is announced.
Whether the BBWAA remains so magnanimous remains to be seen. It
well could.
</P>
<P>
   A crop of 14 first-year eligibles, led by Jack Morris, joins a
list of 16 holdovers, including Carlton Fisk and long-suffering
Tony Perez, in comprising this year's ballot. While the BBWAA would
be pressed to reach much deeper than those three headliners _ so
sorry, Dale Murphy _ there is another trio banging for admittance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Morris: A five-time All-Star, he won more games than anyone
else in the '80s (162) and while he never won a Cy Young award, he
was in the top 10 seven times. No AL pitcher ever met more
scheduled starts (515) and his 2,478 strikeouts ranks 23rd all
time. He never got close to 300 wins, but his 254 total exceeds
more than half of the 58 pitchers now in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fisk: Just 43 votes short (out of 497 ballots) of gaining
admittance in his first year of eligibility last year, Fisk clearly
belongs. Not only did he catch more major league games than anyone
(2,226), only Ty Cobb, Pete Rose and Rick Dempsey matched his 24
seasons as a major league position player. No catcher matched his
376 homers either.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perez: He's been denied eight years but the timing may be
right for a seven-time All-Star who ranks 18th all-time in RBI
(1,652) and is tied for 40th in home runs (379). He missed by 71
votes (14.2 percent of the electorate) last year.
</P>
<P>
   Up the track again is Murphy, a two-time MVP who was fourth
among first-year eligibles in 1999. But Murphy drew just 19.3
percent of the vote when 75 percent is needed, and how he closes
the gap will say much about his chances in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Take what you might from the fact that Brian Goldberg, Ken
Griffey Jr.'s agent, just committed his client to filming several
in-uniform ads promoting the 2000 Seattle series. The flurry of
Mariners-Kansas City-Pittsburgh-Cincinnati rumors were made of thin
air. ``In all likelihood, it looks like he'll be back in Seattle,
and Junior's certainly fine with that,'' Goldberg said....
</P>
<P>
   What do Terry Adams, Dan Naulty and Gregg Olson have in common?
They will fill out Los Angeles' bullpen, which needs new meat. In
1999, Dodgers relievers ran up a 4.37 ERA and struck out the fewest
(299) and won the fewest (14) of any NL bullpen.... Cleveland's Jim
Thome wound up leading the league in both walks and strikeouts, a
feat unseen in the AL since Mickey Mantle in 1958....
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's wooing of free agent Aaron Sele compounds the lie
that Devil Rays management told two months ago, when the club vowed
it did not have the money for good talent-hunting. If Sele signs
the $30-million, four-year deal the club pitched him last week,
D-Rays payroll in 2000 will soar from $37 million to somewhere
between $58-60 million.... The New York Yankees have functioned
without a club president since the mid-'80s, which explains the
confusion surrounding Randy Levine's arrival this week. The former
deputy mayor of New York, specially courted and signed by owner
George Steinbrenner, arrives without specified duties, although
since the team faces five possible arbitration cases (shortstop
Derek Jeter, closer Mariano Rivera, pitchers Ramiro Mendoza and
Jason Grimsley and catcher Jorge Posada), that's the logical place
to start. After that? Said a front-office veteran, ``This is a
classic George move.''

DESPITE EXPECTATIONS, MAGIC IS DOING WELL
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Orlando Magic's second game of the season, John Gabriel,
the general manager, watched his work-in-progress commit a string
of turnovers that had him genuinely worried. Standing in the tunnel
area underneath the arena, Gabriel looked toward the bench to see
how his new coach, Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers, was coping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were throwing the ball out of bounds over and over,''
Gabriel said. ``All the assistants were sitting there, looking so
frustrated and disgusted. Then I looked at Doc. He had his head in
his hands. I realized then: physically, he's not looking sometimes.
That tells you all you need to know about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Intent on getting his players to buy into a system that involves
pushing the ball upcourt at every juncture, Rivers has resorted to
averting his gaze if it will help his team's patience and
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Less than halfway through the season, both qualities have
materialized under Rivers, the former Knick courted by many teams
in the off-season to take over their franchise in some manner. What
Orlando has done in less than a year approaches the amazing.
</P>
<P>
   A team predicted to finish in the Atlantic Division cellar _ the
team that traded four of its five starters (Anfernee Hardaway,
Horace Grant, Nick Anderson and Ike Austin) and received a bevy of
journeymen in return _ is pushing for better than a .500 season and
perhaps a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Magic is the only team other than the Chicago
Bulls with $10 million or more to offer free agents next summer.
Orlando also has three first-round draft picks, including one from
lottery-bound Golden State that could end up landing the Magic one
of the top three players in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has worked wonders with a collage of players who are not
all-stars. Eleven players on Orlando's roster average more than 15
minutes a game. The point guard Darrell Armstrong and power forward
Bo Outlaw have displayed a work ethic that has caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hardaway is battling another injury in Phoenix,
Anderson is struggling during his worst season statistically in
Sacramento, and Austin, who played so well for Pat Riley in Miami,
has been benched in Washington. Grant has had a decent season thus
far in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be the poster team for trading a guy a year
early than trading him a year late, when his value completely
falls,'' Gabriel said. ``We've set ourselves up pretty well, we
think. But much of it has been Doc. He talked me into some things I
didn't originally want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a variety of wild trades and minimum-salaried players
signed up for training camp, the Magic at one time this summer had
34 players under contract. Rather than holding onto veterans like
Armen Gilliam, Tim Legler and Terry Davis, Rivers persuaded Gabriel
to keep young, hungry, athletic players like Chucky Atkins, Ben
Wallace and John Amaechi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me they would fit better into our style and he was
right,'' Gabriel said. ``I spoke to the fans before our first game
and asked them to be patient, that this isn't what they were used
to. Some people called it a plea. Whatever. I really felt like this
was a year we could rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the depth-chart board of players in my office. I
asked some of our people, `Tell me in the East who doesn't think
they belong in playoffs.' You don't think Rick Pitino told his
owner they had a chance? You don't think Wes Unseld told Abe Pollin
we'll fill the building? It was so wide open, we just felt a team
of our makeup could play .500 in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just an uptempo style, Orlando has outworked many
opponents and caught several teams out of shape early in the
season. Shawn Kemp, for example, has been a nonfactor in two games
against Orlando. His burly frame and half-court game have no
purpose against the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel gives most of the credit to Rivers. ``I've gained a far
greater respect for one's timing in coaching,'' he said. ``Not
necessarily Doc's, but just the fact when you're committed to a
style, you have to coach that style no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc has not done this in a traditional fashion, letting
players make a lot of mistakes and going away from the traditional
NBA rotation of six or seven players. When he's wanted to
overinstruct, yell or pull back the reins, he hasn't. The
boundaries of that style are loose enough where guys are not
inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a rebuilding year, but we didn't bottom out
completely. Doc has been the glue in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel added: ``One time I asked him about covering his eyes.
He told me, `Gabe, sometimes, I just can't look.' I told him, `Doc,
you're a better man than I am.'''

FAN-FRIENDLY OWNERS  
 HILL'S AWESOME ARSENAL
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK-MAGIC) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Pat Croce in Philadelphia to Larry Miller in Utah, the NBA
has no shortage of hands-on owners who hug their players and mingle
with their ticket-buying public. Mark Cuban, the prospective owner
of the Mavericks, should fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old co-founder of Broadcast.com has been e-mailing
Maverick fans on the team's Web site for weeks, intimating that he
will quickly put his stamp on the team. Cuban last week reached a
preliminary agreement to buy a controlling interest in the team for
a reported $280 million. According to a news release from the team,
the Hillwood Development Corp., led by Ross Perot Jr., will retain
a minority share of the Mavericks after completion of the proposed
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native, Cuban became one of the country's richest
people last year when Yahoo, the California-based Internet company,
bought the four-year-old Broadcast.com for about $6 billion.
Cuban's personal take was about $1.5 billion. He is the guy who
invented streaming radio technology, in which subscribers can hear
live sports events broadcast over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's stock market plunge, he was said to have lost
$600 million in net worth. Informed of his projected loss, Cuban
was said to have merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   His purchase means two things for the league. One, franchise
values are not going down. Given that the Nets were sold for a
league-record $227 million in 1998 and the Mavericks will bring
close to $300 million, what will a playoff-bound NBA team
dominating its own sports market bring?
</P>
<P>
   Also, more and more people who spent their college years surfing
the Net _ long ago, these people were referred to simply as
``computer geeks'' _ are continuing to morph into free-spending,
fan-friendly owners. It is all the fault of the Blazers owner Paul
Allen and his Microsoft partner.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has already met with Don Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and
general manager, who said he would not return as coach next season.
Entering the weekend, Dallas had lost five in a row and 9 of 10 to
drop to 9-23 this season under Nelson, whose coaching and personnel
decisions have come under scrutiny. The coach is just a few
victories short of 900 in his career but has a winning percentage
of only .300 with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's Awesome Arsenal
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill did not make a 3-pointer all last season and had made
only 22 in his first five years. But the Pistons' All-Star forward
made a concerted effort to work on the mechanics of his jump shot
during the off-season, and now it has become part of his awesome
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc, Hill has already
connected on 16 3-pointers this season. Always hailed as an
incredible athlete who could slash and score at will, he has
suddenly blossomed into a consistent jump-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Street &AMP; Smith's anointed Hill this past week as a possible most
valuable player based on his numbers and the fact that Detroit had
won six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Hill parlayed back-to-back 42-point games at Orlando and Atlanta
into a 31-point performance against Milwaukee on Thursday night. He
scored 19 points in the fourth quarter against the Bucks, knocking
down two crucial 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have the best player in the NBA, we certainly have
the best noncenter,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said of Hill.
``But the great thing about him, it's all about winning. He doesn't
care if he has to score 46 points or four points; whatever he needs
to do to win the game is what he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is averaging a career-high 27.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and
5.8 assists. He is making 48.5 percent of his shots. Named to the
U.S. Olympic basketball team this past week along with Ray Allen
and Alonzo Mourning, he is gradually becoming the league's most
versatile and productive player.
</P>
<P>
   All that is missing is a signature playoff performance for a
player on a team that has yet to escape the first round during his
career. Hill can exercise an escape clause in his contract this
summer and sign with another team. Depending on how far the Pistons
advance and whether he sees a championship in his future, he may
get antsy soon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he stays or goes, with an improved outside shot and his
team finally on a roll, Hill's market value is soaring. And he
still has more than half a season in which to catch Shaquille
O'Neal, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett in the MVP voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's playing great,'' Hill said last week. ``We have to
continue to maintain this and not get too full of ourselves. It's
only a couple games that we've played well. In the past, we just
felt like we were never going to get it going. But this year, we
expect to do better. We expect to win.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Taking note of the NHL Eastern Conference
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   FROG-GATE
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't gotten the notoriety of John Rocker's mind melt _ at
least not this side of the Canadian provinces. But Ottawa center
Vaclav Prospal came under verbal fire after calling Montreal
defenseman Patrice Brisebois a ``frog'' _ a long-standing slur
against the French and French Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help matters when high-profile agent Rich Winter,
rather than apologize for his client, referred to Brisebois as
``gutless and spineless'' and ``hiding behind his skirt.'' Winter
also said, ``He should have stood up like a real man and settled
this on the ice or in the back lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. The NHL ordered Prospal to attend diversity training,
which seems to be the in-thing these days. Prospal has apologized
to French Canadians but never mentioned anything about Brisebois.
About the diversity training, he said, ``I'll go to the meeting.
That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for repentance. Brisebois, who has clammed up since
initially complaining about the ``frog'' reference to reporters,
doesn't seem to be getting much sympathy, even from other French
Canadians. Edmonton's Georges Laraque, who is both black and a
Montreal native, said, ``Frog sounds more like a joke. I'm
surprised it's bothering him that much, because lots of French guys
have been called that and nobody complains.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY ...
</P>
<P>
   Updating the ever-changing prognosis on Florida goalie Trevor
Kidd (dislocated right shoulder): Kidd said he will start skating
next week and hopes to return in a month. So far, no surgery. ``I'm
not facing any shots, and I won't start facing breakaways the first
time I'm on the ice,'' he said. ``But I'm getting a brace next
week, and I'll take it from there.'' ... Pittsburgh general manager
Craig Patrick, when asked if rookie defenseman Andrew Ference might
be spared being reassigned to the minors: ``Anything's possible.
I've seen crazier things happen. Look at the poor guy who got the
flu when Lou Gehrig came in.'' ... Penguins prospect Milan Kraft
had seven goals in seven games and was named the top forward at the
recent World Junior Championships. He played for the Czech
Republic. ``Our plan is to bring him in next year,'' Patrick said.
...
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ovation at this year's All-Star Game in Toronto
figures to be reserved for an assistant coach, not a player.
Philadelphia coach Roger Neilson, who is battling cancer, will be
an assistant for the North American team. He formerly coached the
Leafs. ... Florida was 1-6-2 in its last nine games in California
after a 4-2 loss to Los Angeles on Thursday. ... Tampa Bay ended a
seven-game losing streak with a 3-3 tie in Vancouver. But the
Lightning gave up 36 goals in the seven games and continues to have
problems in goal. The acquisition of Dan Cloutier from the New York
Rangers was central to GM Rick Dudley's move on draft day, but
Cloutier and Kevin Hodson have been equally dreadful. ``(Cloutier)
and I both stink right now _ there's no other way to put it,''
Hodson said. ``We just stink, and there's no excuse for it. We need
to wake up.''

 &HT;    Salt Lake is U.S. team's shot to get Games right
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the red, white and bruised, Ron Wilson had the
most reason to be bitter. He coached a star-laden team that many,
whether justified or not, projected as a group of gold medalists or
at least finalists.
</P>
<P>
   That same team fizzled, left Japan without gold, silver, bronze
or any other element, and sometime before passing through customs
wrecked a couple of dorm rooms. This was the great Olympic
experience? Fly halfway around the world, lose, then get labeled a
bunch of ``Animal House'' clones? Was that worth a 17-day break in
the NHL schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Wilson says. The NHL has yet to confirm its participation
in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, although it appears
a foregone conclusion. It's one thing to put players through a
logistical nightmare in Nagano, Japan, and suffer through unwatched
3 a.m. telecasts back in the U.S. It's another to bypass the chance
for prime-time Games on American soil. Or ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL belongs in the Olympics,'' said Wilson, the Washington
Capitals coach who was behind the bench in Nagano but has yet to
hear from anybody regarding Salt Lake. ``The best athletes belong
in the Olympics. I don't see that there should be any discussion,
other than making the logistics of it better for all sides. As a
league, we need exposure and the best exposure you can get on an
international basis is the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   It irritates Wilson that the dorm trashings by undisclosed U.S.
player(s) _ three were reported to have been involved, but Wilson
says it was one _ are repeatedly brought up by the media and casts
all NHL players in an unfavorable light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dorm thing, when did that happen? After the tournament,''
Wilson said. ``It had nothing to do with the tournament. Who did
it? The U.S. team did it. The Canadians didn't. The Russians
didn't. It came down to one guy doing something stupid. It didn't
come down to 65 NHL players trashing the village. We just paint
everybody with a wide brush, (saying players) didn't really want to
be there. Why? Because one guy got upset and didn't want to be
there and trashed the village. We look for excuses for everything
and there are no excuses. We went, we lost and we lost to the best
player in the world (Czech goalie Dominik Hasek).''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said U.S. and Canadian hockey fans were right to expect
their countries to win the gold medal, but that those expectations
were a little too optimistic given the circumstances. There was a
reason, he said, that European teams fared better in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have high expectations, you should have
time to prepare,'' Wilson said. ``Personally, I don't know how we
could go about it, unless we had a minicamp at the end of the
summer. At least you could get everybody together and talk about
things before (NHL) teams start their training camps. You'd have to
guess about who would be on the team and pick 25 or 30 guys. But
for the U.S., that's not hard to do. When we won the World Cup we
had three weeks to prepare for it. That's about how long NHL
training camps are. For the Olympics, we had two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson admits Nagano ``was not the Olympic experience you dream
about.'' NHL players and coaches did not march in the Opening or
Closing Ceremonies. Travel was a blur. Salt Lake City would be
better in some ways, the same in others.
</P>
<P>
   As to the U.S.'s gold medal prospects in 2002: ``If we go to
Salt Lake City, we'll probably be one of the favorites again. But
that doesn't guarantee any success.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most noteworthy thing to come out of the recent
World Junior Championships was the poor play of Swedish twins
Daniel and Henrik Sedin. They were the No. 2 and No. 3 picks in the
draft by Vancouver in June. The talented Swedish team did not win a
medal; the Czech Republic defeated Russia in the final, the same
result as the 1998 Olympics. Henrik finished first (13) and Daniel
third (10) in scoring in the tournament, yet scouts thought they
didn't stand out as much as expected. However, their performances
are not expected to have much significance. Canucks general manager
Brian Burke, who swung a series of draft-day trades to get into
position to draft the brothers, said: ``It's real simple: We don't
draft players on the basis of one week. Daniel was nursing a bad
leg. A lot of Swedish players didn't play well. From a development
standpoint, as a GM, I don't mind that they've been put in that
crucible. They'll be better pros for it.''

 &HT;    Taking note of the NHL Western Conference
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   TKACHUK CHUCKS IT ALL
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is being realized in Phoenix. Center
Keith Tkachuk grew so weary of answering questions about his
near-trade to Carolina that he shut it down with the media, but not
before admitting the trade rumors are getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this organization through a lot of lows,'' he
said. ``And now that I've been a part of building this hockey team,
it's just disappointing to hear you might have been traded. It's
hard to hear that, not to think about it every day you walk into
that rink that someday it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some friends who are helping me out, telling me to
try not to think about it. But it's tough not to think about it. If
I think about it too much, it's going to affect my play and I'll
play bad. But I've been in this league for nine years and I'm going
to try to approach it the best I can. I'm still a Coyote _ for
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk missed five consecutive games with back spasms, then was
scoreless and a minus-two at Ottawa on Thursday. Phoenix doesn't
deny the star is being shopped because his salary balloons to $8.3
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY ...
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to Edmonton's Alex Selivanov? After scoring 18
goals in his first 24 games, he went without a goal in the next 16.
``Relax, it's still early,'' he said. ... Phoenix has resumed
negotiations with holdout goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and, should a
deal be struck, likely would move backup Bob Essensa, who was
12-3-2 before suffering a recent groin strain. ... With Rem Murray
back from knee surgery, the Oilers might deal struggling forward
Joseph Beranek, who has only five goals in 37 games. ...
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is unbeaten in 20 straight against Los Angeles (14-0-6).
It's the longest current streak in the league, and one short of the
Stars' franchise record of 21 games, also against the Kings (while
in Minnesota). ... Ziggy Palffy's chronic lower back problems are
starting to become a concern in L.A. Coach Andy Murray said Palffy
isn't risking further damage by playing but added, ``He could use
three months off.'' ... Nashville's unbeaten streak finally ended
at eight games in a loss to Dallas, but GM David Poile said, ``Our
players are starting to believe they belong in this league.'' ...
Despite the streak, the Predators (35 points after 41 games) were
only slightly ahead of last year's midway total (32). ...
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver has won tthree times in the past six weeks (3-12-4)
and general manager Brian Burke is not a happy camper: ``I see a
lot of guys making a lot of money and not playing well.'' Sounds
like somebody is ready for another trade. ... Time for Colorado to
make a move: The Avalanche is 7-1-1 in its last nine home games,
where it plays six of its next seven. ... Detroit is 12-0-1 when
Pat Verbeek gets a point. His reaction? ``Doesn't mean a thing.''
... Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood allowed nine goals in his first
two starts after returning from a broken hand. ``I have difficulty
playing the puck,'' he said. ``I didn't expect to come back as a
world beater.''

CLINTON URGES DROPPING BAN ON FUNDING OVER ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday that he would urge
Congress to reverse course on a law that he reluctantly signed just
months ago that bans U.S. money from going to international
organizations that perform abortions or promote abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans insisted on the abortion language as
part of a spending package eagerly sought by the administration to
free nearly $1 billion that the United States owed to the United
Nations. The White House decision to compromise drew the wrath of
abortion rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to allies on the issue, Clinton said in his radio
address that he would seek more than $200 million in his fiscal
2001 budget proposal for domestic and international family planning
programs and would urge Congress to end the anti-abortion
restrictions imposed on U.S. funds this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am asking Congress to support these funds, to provide them
without restrictions that hamper the work of family planning
organizations, and even bar them from discussing or debating
reproductive health policies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would advocate the largest increase in
domestic family planning services in more than two decades, a $35
million increase to boost spending to $274 million. The funds would
be shared by 4,600 clinics and pay for contraceptives, teen-age
pregnancy programs and health screenings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Clinton will propose a $169 million increase, to $541
million, in family planning services and related reproductive
health services. Under the deal to secure U.N. financing, the
administration accepted limits on the current allocation for
overseas family planning. Foreign family planning groups that
provide abortions or lobby for liberalized laws are now ineligible
for U.S. assistance. But Clinton has retained a waiver allowing him
to allocate up to $15 million in American aid to groups that offer
abortions or lobby for them.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that his approach would best achieve the goal of
both sides of the abortion issue.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time, the fictional immigrant to New York
City struggled mightily to master the New World and then to
assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype was the title character of the 1937 Leo C. Rosten
book, ``The Education of HYMAN KAPLAN,'' that indefatigably earnest
student of America who wrestled with the English language and
emerged from the tussle with his personality astonishingly intact.
</P>
<P>
   Who could not marvel at the adaptive abilities of this
Polish-born sweatshop worker to whom the plural of cat was
``Katz,'' the 16th president of the United States was ``Abram
Lincohen,'' and a verbal blunder was ``a sleeping of the tong''?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a fresh burst of immigrant fiction and memoirs, another
generation of writers is plowing the fertile field where the new
arrival meets the New World. In dozens of books published over the
last decade, these young authors draw on their own experiences to
overturn the classic American tale of the immigrant's metamorphosis
from outsider to mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They introduce us to a world we should know better,'' said
Gilbert H. Muller, an English professor at La Guardia Community
College in New York who analyzed these writers for his book, ``New
Strangers in Paradise'' (University Press of Kentucky, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Hyman Kaplan, creature of a more unquestioning time, might still
recognize himself in some of his 1990s literary counterparts, like
Lourdes Puente. A Cuban immigrant in Cristina Garcia's 1992 novel,
``Dreaming in Cuban,'' Lourdes enthusiastically tries to adapt by
embracing the conventions of her new country.
</P>
<P>
   She makes Jell-O molds with miniature marshmallows _ ``food only
people in Ohio eat,'' complains her daughter, Pilar. She never
misses a Thanksgiving Day parade, dreams of a Statue of Liberty
mural to decorate her Brooklyn bakery, and barbecues the family's
dinner whenever she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we sit around behind the warehouse and stare at each
other with nothing to say,'' Pilar says. ``Like this is it? We're
living the American dream?''
</P>
<P>
   The younger woman's lament _ that becoming American is more
complicated for today's immigrants than just learning the language
and embracing the customs _ reverberates through the modern
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Success, the new authors argue through their writing, is no
longer measured in stages of assimilation. Nor is blending with the
white mainstream an option for those of African or Asian descent.
And, with images of real life in the United States part of
ubiquitous world culture, coming to the New World is no longer a
leap into the unknown or a naive quest for a gilded paradise.
</P>
<P>
   While the characters created by the European-born authors in the
first part of the century struggled against the impersonal and
alien pressures of American life, their fictional descendants take
all that for granted. They struggle, but in the more contemporary
sense. They search, as Muller put it, for ``wholeness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world today is much more complicated than it was 100 years
ago,'' he said. ``We are far more mobile. We have more choices. We
slip in and out of various characters. Still, in one way or
another, the promise of America is validated by many of these
writers because their characters either discover themselves or
persist in the attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is evident not only in the way immigrants are
depicted. It is clear from the texture of their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants in the early part of the century, for example,
emerged from the dark steerage compartments of crowded ships into
the figurative blue skies of a new life. But, deliberately, no
purging ray of sunshine parts the clouds when a Chinese-born
engineer named Ralph Chang arrives in the United States in the 1991
Gish Jen novel, ``Typical American.'' Instead, New York City is
enveloped in fog. Ralph cannot see a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the scenes that are hallmark momentous scenes in the
old literature are typically undermined and played with,'' said Ms.
Jen, who grew up in suburban Scarsdale, N.Y., and plumbs the
tragicomic adjustment of Chinese-American families to the New York
suburbs in her books. ``The earnestness of the earlier writing _
you know, the golden land and all that _ it's hard to write that
with a straight face in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   In her books, the immigrant parents keep a certain distance from
the society around them even as they embrace its opportunities.
When they see something that seems particularly strange or hurtful,
Ralph and his relatives protect themselves by being dismissive.
``Typical American,'' they tell each other with a smug nod.
</P>
<P>
   But their Chinese-American children, born in New York and raised
in its upscale suburbs, eschew protective strategies because they
believe all options are open to them. In ``Mona in the Promised
Land,'' Ms. Jen's 1996 sequel, Ralph's daughter Mona decides to
become Jewish like her best friends in school. In her own quest,
Mona's older sister decides to become even more ethnic than her
parents by making the study of China her life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Their acculturation, in other words, is self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole search for identity, this navel-gazing, is very
American,'' Ms. Jen, who is 44 and the daughter of Chinese
immigrants, said in a phone interview from her home in Boston.
``People in China don't talk about their roots. Once you start
thinking about what it means to be Irish-American or
African-American or Chinese-American, then you're American.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as she and other authors demonstrate in their
writing, plenty of immigrants today believe they cannot drop the
hyphen in their identities even if they wanted. They have a more
complicated relationship with the American dream than their
forebears had, especially the version that says everyone can
reinvent themselves in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Irish and German and Italian and Russian immigrants of earlier
years could lose their accents and change their Old World clothing
and habits. They could eventually fit in _ or if they could not,
their children could _ and camouflage their roots.
</P>
<P>
   The literature reflected this: The tension was over how much had
to be sacrificed on the road to Americanization.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Rise of David Levinsky,'' the 1917 immigrant classic by
Abraham Cahan, the protagonist progressively breaks his religious,
political and family ties and achieves business success. In the
books of Anzia Yezierska, like the overwrought ``Salome of the
Tenements,'' the main characters eagerly liberate themselves by
shedding all vestiges of the past.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write because it was so painful growing up as an immigrant
and never really feeling I belonged,'' said Meri Nana-Ama Danquah,
an essayist who immigrated from Ghana to the United States with her
parents at the age of 6. ``As an immigrant, if you are of color,
you are marginalized. If you are white, you are pulled into the
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently edited a collection of essays called ``Becoming
American,'' to be published in February by Hyperion. In it, 23
immigrant women write of both their disdain for American culture
and their grudging appreciation for the freedoms it grants them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danquah, now 32, said she wanted to give a voice to what she
called ``displaced'' immigrants like herself, who do not fit
familiar American categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, as a black immigrant, there was this assumption or
expectation that I would fit neatly into black America,'' she said.
``I resented the implication that we were the same people, because
we weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Mei Ng, who grew up in Queens, explores the classic literary
theme of estrangement between immigrant parents and their children.
Like other writers of her generation _ she is 33 _ she also expands
it to take in feelings of ethnic and racial alienation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I write about what it means to be hyphenated, with one
foot here in a place they wouldn't have me,'' she said. ``America
is a melting pot and all, but people sometimes say in a fit of
annoyance or anger, `Go back where you came from.' And I'm, like,
OK, I'll go back to Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive such blows, some of the modern literary immigrants
develop their own camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Park, the Korean-American narrator in Chang-rae Lee's 1995
novel ``Native Speaker,'' is a master of disguise in both his
professional and personal lives. Speaking English is presented as
subversive and a method for dissimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is a shadowy industrial spy who helps ruin an
up-and-coming Korean-American politician, thanks to his ability to
slip into a new identity as easily as a silk shirt. He is, perhaps,
the ultimate displaced person, the best proof that assimilation is
an irrelevant theme for many of today's writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way my characters think of it, they are part of and
consider themselves part of, what's new in America,'' said Lee, who
is 35 and lives in New Jersey. ``It's not that that's this heroic
stance. It's just that with the new sense of multiculturalism in
this country, people are starting to suggest what being an American
really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old immigrant would say, `I'm becoming an American,''' he
continued. ``The new person is now starting out saying, `I am
American.'''

 &HT;    Being sidelined not easy for Hardaway
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having missed 20 games with a jammed right knee
heading into the weekend, Heat guard Tim Hardaway still has no idea
when he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, Hardaway told TNT's Craig Sager he would be out
another month, then said later he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Heat coach Pat Riley will explore trading for another point
guard if Hardaway's condition is still in doubt shortly before the
Feb. 24 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to know by six weeks, five weeks,'' Riley said. ``By
then, I think we will know whether we have to go in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Hardaway confident enough to tell Riley not to pursue outside
options?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to do whatever makes him feel secure,'' Hardaway said.
``He has to look out for the future. It's just him being cautious.
He's edgy like I'm edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   GUARDING THE PARQUET
</P>
<P>
   The old parquet floor is still costing the Celtics. The wood is
under 24-hour guard and has been insured for $6 million. That led
one employee to crack, ``They ought to consider burning it. They'll
make more money off the insurance than they'll make off selling the
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT BIRD WANTS
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird says he will not coach after this season, but would
consider staying with the Pacers in management. Bird explains,
``It's like coaching. If you have coaches you work well with, it
makes your job a lot easier. It's the same thing in the front
office. If you have people you can't work with, it's a waste of
time. I don't care about running a franchise, talking to agents,
doing contracts. But ...putting the best team together that you
can, that's very appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT SO SURA
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sura has had a particularly bad stretch. He got a double
technical foul (with Ray Allen) for a dust-up in Milwaukee, then
another technical late at Boston for mocking referee Marc Davis
after Davis finally gave him a call. Sura tried to call a timeout
the Cavs didn't have at the end of their loss to Sacramento with
Chris Webber staring in disbelief. Webber never lived down his
brain-lock timeout call in a national championship game at
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up,'' Sura said, refusing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW VAN GUNDY
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston scored 26 of his 37 points in a 96-88 victory over
the Celtics in the second half. Performances like that will help
coach Jeff Van Gundy with his New Year's resolution to be more
upbeat. ``This is the new me,'' he said. ``I am not dour. I am
upbeat. I want you guys to document each of my smiles, which will
be aplenty. Losses, wins, they're all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   LAYUPS
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Douglas could be lost to the Nets for the season. The
backup point guard has a lesion on his left ankle that will require
surgery. ... Eddie Jones, who had Olympian aspirations, on Ray
Allen, who got the spot he coveted: ``You know something? I'm
happy. If it had been somebody else, maybe I might be a little
bitter. Because it's Ray, I'm really happy and I don't hold
anything against him.''

 &HT;    Shape up, Mavericks
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Dallas Mavericks season-ticket holder who bought the
team last week promised a series of moves that will change the face
of the club. And that face has been pretty ugly lately.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, a Mavs fan who happens to be the founder of
Broadcast.com, paid Ross Perot Jr. $280 million for the club and
promises to be a proactive owner similar to the Dallas Cowboys'
Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That means bad news for Don Nelson, the coach and general
manager who has compiled a two-year record of 44-102 going into the
weekend and who has shipped away, among others, Jason Kidd, Jamal
Mashburn, Sam Cassell, Jim Jackson, Chris Gatling, Oliver Miller,
George McCloud, Derek Harper, Samaki Walker and A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Mavericks got Shawn Bradley, among other busts.
So, Cuban has made it clear Nelson is in the final days of his
coaching career in Dallas and could be bought out of the GM
position, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban can afford it. The 41-year-old bachelor with no kids
started his company four years ago. Yahoo bought him out last
summer for $6 billion. He recently purchased a 24,000-square-foot
home for $16 million. Cuban also owns a $40 million jet.
</P>
<P>
   As an owner, he plans to be free with his money a la Portland's
Paul Allen and to form relationships with his players like
Philadelphia's Pat Croce.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan, he has seen the mess that the club has become under
Nelson, who had designated his son, Donn, as his successor at coach
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has put the kabosh on that. After meeting with Cuban, the
elder Nelson said, ``It's not going to happen. . ... It's probably
best that (Donn Nelson) get a chance somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Since firing coach Jim Cleamons after one season, Don Nelson has
compiled a .301 winning percentage while securing Dallas' place as
one of the league's worst situations. His courtside conduct also
has drawn unwanted attention. Thursday, he was ejected from a game
engaged in a bumping match with an opposing player _ the Jazz's
Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson met with Cuban on Wednesday, he came out saying, ``I
feel very secure at this particular time. But if somebody wants to
make a change, then, you know, that's part of life. If I'm part of
the change, I think that's fine, too. If that's best for the
franchise, I'll accept that and go along my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson made similar comments when he coached the Knicks in 1996
and was fired the next day. Cuban is less hesitant to run off
Nelson now because he's not comfortable with bringing in an interim
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is developing a short list of coaching prospects. He'll
likely add former Mavericks guard Derek Harper to the front-office
staff.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted his primary interest is the team on the court, not
the business side of things as Perot's was. Cuban wants results.
He's seen enough from his baseline seat as a fan to realize the
Nelsons will not get the results he wants. So starts Cuban's NBA
legacy.

 &HT;    Mourning not 'Zo angry anymore
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn and Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once, Alonzo Mourning was an NBA pariah, a player the
league least wanted to represent it on a national stage. The Miami
Heat center was a brazen, disobliging bully who seemed to carry and
express perpetual anger.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the former Georgetown star has had an
ephipany of sorts. He realized that being a jerk took more energy
than being a nice guy. Since then, Mourning's personal growth has
coincided with his professional rise.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA has taken notice. It could not be more evident than
in USA Basketball's selection of Mourning to the 2000 Sydney
Olympic Games squad.
</P>
<P>
   This for a player who helped personify the anti-American
sentiment in the 1994 World Championships in Toronto when he, among
others, put on a display of sportsmanship that embarrassed the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning also seemed to go out of his way to be a media
adversary, using intimidation tactics when presented with tough
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's an NBA darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alonzo has matured a great deal since then,'' said NBA vice
president Rod Thorn, head of the selection committee. ``I think
he's way beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mourning rehabilitated his reputation by abandoning the
us-against-the-world posture and uncovering a well-spoken,
even-tempered gentleman. Since then, he's been the best center in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice for the Olympic committee to put whatever happened
in the past,'' Mourning said. ``I do what I can to better myself.''
</P>
<P>
   GET THIS
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers are the only team in the NBA with two players
who jumped directly from high schools to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Al Harrington and Jonathan Bender addressed an
Indianapolis public school full of students who wanted to hear
their words of wisdom, which were ... stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advice, both players contend they are happy with
their decisions to make the quantum leap.
</P>
<P>
   JUMAINE IN THE HALL
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia star Jumaine Jones has huge aspirations, but not
even he expected to make the Basketball Hall of Fame as a
Philadelphia 76ers rookie.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened. The Sixer played in the last game of
the 1990s and Jones scored the final basket of the1900s _ a 3-point
bank shot.
</P>
<P>
   So, the 76ers were asked to provide Jones' uniform and shoes for
display in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware they wanted my stuff,'' Jones said, ``but when
they said they did, I said, `Oh, really?' I didn't call for it to
be a bank, but it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone on the court would've been likely to make the
last one, but it was me. Good things come to those who wait.''

 &HT;    Sloan, Issel bristle
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't invite Utah's Jerry Sloan and Denver's Dan Issel
to your party. The feud started last week when the Jazz broke open
a tight game to lead by 20 with two minutes left and left Karl
Malone, John Stockton and Bryon Russell in the game against Nuggets
scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   After Stockton threw ahead to Malone for a fast-break dunk,
Issel stormed to midcourt and yelled at Sloan, ``I'll remember
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan ambled up and asked, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Issel retorted, ``Kiss my (bleep).''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Issel said, ``That's all right. I shouldn't have
reacted the way I did. But I have a long memory.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sloan said, ``I guess he thought I was keeping (starters) in
there too long. The clock hadn't stopped when I planned to put
(substitutes) in there. I told them to take a foul; they didn't
take a foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he remembered it. I remember when he quit right in the
middle of the year, too, when he was coaching. ... I've never done
anything to run the score up. And I've been here long enough to
know I certainly wouldn't quit on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ABDUR-RAHIM'S CLOUT
</P>
<P>
   In not-so-veiled terms, Vancouver's newspapers are suggesting
Shareef Abdur-Rahim influenced the club's decision to oust coach
Brian Hill. The former Wheeler High star says that's not the case,
but that he does prefer the replacement, Lionel Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with what Brian was doing or
wasn't doing. It's just how I'm feeling since Lionel took over _
the things `Train' has us doing, the way we're going out and
playing as a team and conducting ourselves. It's the best I've felt
playing basketball in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim also remains loyal to general manager Stu Jackson,
saying his ``future is a concern of mine. When I re-signed (six
years, $71 million), the owner kind of assured me that Stu was
their guy and I've always said Stu is the reason I re-signed here.
I'd feel like I was misled'' if Jackson is fired.
</P>
<P>
   LAYUPS
</P>
<P>
   It could only happen in Clipperville: Michael Olowokandi misses
practice one day after Maurice Taylor rips his work ethic. Derek
Anderson doesn't show because he thinks coach Chris Ford gave the
club the day off. Lamar Odom isn't there because Charlie Jones had
an excused absence, and Jones drives Odom to practice because the
rookie does not have a driver's license. ...
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe it was a fit of pique that drove Shaquille O'Neal to
resist his agents' pleas and say no to the Olympics. ``The last
time I played, I only played two minutes and the coach (Lenny
Wilkens) put in David Robinson the whole game. I'm not going
through that (stuff) anymore.'' ... The Lakers went 14-1 last
month, their best December mark since 1971-72, when the Wilt
Chamberlain-Jerry West squad went 16-0 en route to their record 33
wins in a row.

BELICHICK SOLUTION IS PROBABLY CLOSE BY
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-LIPSYTE-COLUMN) 
(nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The feud is taking on proportions worthy of historical
conflicts: Bill Parcells makes a move, Robert K. Kraft summons his
minions in Boston to quell this guy from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with people familiar with the latest dispute
between the Jets and the Patriots, it seems clear that this episode
will end with the Jets letting former coach Bill Belichick join the
Patriots _ in exchange for some draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it is likely to play out:
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Jets will give the NFL their reply to Belichick's
claim that the team is preventing him from making a living. NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will then take another look at the
contract he already has ruled is valid _ and again conclude that
Belichick's services belong to the Jets. At that point, Tagliabue
will sweetly suggest that this can be settled if the two sides use
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all of this, Parcells is trying to keep together a Jets
team he believed could have made a Super Bowl run in the 1999
season. He knows that if he steps outside the organization for
another head coach, everything is changed. His most likely move is
to appoint Al Groh, the linebackers coach, as the new head coach _
unless the new owner, who is to be announced this month, is happy
only with Parcells as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, the Patriots' owner, does not want to wait either; he has
already interviewed three candidates for the vacant head coaching
job.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly quickly, then, the Patriots will make an offer to the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this could be sticky for a few days. Don't think the Jets
have forgotten that they paid the Patriots handsomely in 1997 to
allow Parcells out of a contract he thought had been in his favor.
Tagliabue arbitrated that dispute and gave the Patriots a total of
four draft picks over three years, including this past season's
first-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also gave the Patriots their first- and third-round
draft choices in 1998 as part of their deal to sign running back
Curtis Martin away from New England. In all then, the Jets have
lost six draft picks to New England in three seasons.
Interestingly, none of those has developed into a starter for the
Patriots. Belichick, though, would be the ultimate first-stringer
if Kraft is able to hire him as coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Belichick worth in draft choices? If the Jets were
speaking publicly, they would say ``four draft picks over three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, though, people are muttering that the Jets
orchestrated all of this. They know that the day the regular season
ended, Parcells notified both Belichick and Jets' president Steve
Gutman he was quitting, a move that made Belichick the Jets' head
coach, since his contract called for his ascension when Parcells
stepped down. The suspicion of those who see this from the
Patriots' point of view is that Parcells had learned that the
Patriots were going to try to hire Belichick. By stepping down
before they could do so, Parcells thought he could keep Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   There are those on the Jets' side who believe that New England
had somehow made it known to Belichick that as soon as Pete Carroll
was dismissed as Patriots coach, Belichick would be offered the
job, along with the general manager's post _ more power than he
would have had with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   However it happened, Belichick was Jets coach for a day _
shorter than his previous tenure. Remember February 1997? For six
days he was the coach while the Jets were trying to hire Parcells
away from the Patriots by naming him as a ``consultant.'' In theory
he would hang around for a year, until his contract was up, and
then become coach. Soon, though, the Jets parted with the draft
picks that allowed them to make Parcells the head coach
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years later, Belichick is trying to reverse the
process, this time contending that his contract with the Jets was
not valid. One of the points his lawyer, Neil Cornrich, makes in
the eight-page grievance he filed with the NFL office is that
Belichick signed it with Jets owner Leon Hess, but that Hess died
shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean,'' asked a person with knowledge of the
contract, ``that when Leon Hess died all the Jets became free
agents, too?''
</P>
<P>
   There is another twist to this situation. A person familiar with
Belichick's contract contends that the Patriots can make him a
``consultant,'' as the Jets did with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   According to this scenario, Belichick could be hired by the
Patriots in this vague capacity, but not as a coach or general
manager. The problem with this is that Belichick has three years
remaining on his Jets contract. That is a long time to be the
ruler-in-waiting. In football these days, it is a lifetime.

PLENTY OF Y2K SUPPLIES READY FOR A REAL DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Wash., Calif., Ga.) (js) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New Year's Day arrived with no sign of millennial mayhem, a
lot of people found themselves with more jugs of water and cases of
Dinty Moore stew than they could possibly use in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   But unwilling to admit defeat _ or embarrassment _ many of those
people say they have no regrets, and are now ready for whatever
sundry disasters _ natural or otherwise they could face between now
and the expiration dates on their dehydrated carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that his water would stop flowing, John Pfuelb, 56, had
dug a six-foot hole in his backyard, in full view of his suburban
neighbors in Clinton, N.J. Now, he said, he has to fill it back in.
He said he devoted an hour a day to his preparations for the
breakdown of the world's computers, even though his family thought
he was nuts.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to put up with teasing from his co-workers, who made
up a mock cover of ``Y2K for Dummies'' with his picture on it.
``The kidding was unbelievable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfuelb said he figured that if Fortune 500 companies were
worried enough to spend hundreds of millions of dollars preparing,
his $2,000 investment in supplies and food made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old expression: `I'd rather have it and not need
it, than need it and not have it,''' said Pfuelb, an advertising
salesman who works out of his home. ``I thought we were looking at
something kind of serious here, and I don't regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he said, he learned a lot about food and water
filtration, and has decided that time away from the television
might be good for his family, even if electricity continues to
reach his home.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he will eventually eat three-quarters of the food,
and plans to donate the rest to charity.
</P>
<P>
   J. Candy Arnold, 53, wrote a cookbook, ``Y2Kitchen,'' to help
people prepare for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might say the cookbook was out of date as soon as
the clock ticked 12:01 on New Year's morning. But Ms. Arnold thinks
she can still fill a need. The book, which includes recipes for
healthful meals that can be prepared during times of crisis, will
be renamed for use in natural and man-made disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arnold, who lives near Seattle, estimated that she spent
$1,500 on her preparations for emergency supplies, including
solar-powered flashlights, radios and lights, two 55-gallon drums
full of water, and a three-month supply of dehydrated and canned
food. She also installed a wood stove in her mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm an example of a person who hasn't gone
overboard,'' she said, adding that the food and other supplies she
bought could easily be used on camping trips.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet is any reflection of day-to-day consumer trends,
survival gear can be had cheaply now, for a variety of
nonmillennial purposes. Saturday on eBay, the online auction
service, bidders vied for a Y2K Hand Water Pump, which the seller
said ``would make a nice landscape piece. Easily painted to make it
fit your color scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   A Y2K solar oven, which had attracted no bidders Saturday
afternoon, was called ``great for camping, fishing, outdoor
parties, or just trying it out for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After the disaster-free arrival of the new year, many of the
well prepared said they considered themselves ready for the the
next catastrophe to come along: a winter storm, hurricane or
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Poduska, president of First Millennium, an e-commerce
startup company, had put together an emergency checklist for the
turn of the year, posted at www.baat.com. He has decided to
continue it, modifying it for other kinds of potential disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help California if there were an 8.0 earthquake,'' he
said. ``My house would slide down two blocks. But these things can
be prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Osborne, 29, a public relations executive in Atlanta,
stocked up on imported sauces and other ingredients that she and
her husband rely on for the Mexican dishes they like to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's always wise to take preparations for this,
or for any winter storm that might come along,'' said Ms. Osborne
Saturday, adding that she had no regrets about stocking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly do it again,'' she said, ``should we be
around at the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, a number of common reactions have been seen
to false apocalyptic prophecies, said David Kessler, executive
administrator for the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston
University. They include simply shifting doomsday back a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Y2K, it would be very difficult to redate,'' Kessler
said. So many people are just redirecting their preparations toward
other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   He harked back to the biblical tale of Jonah, who, after being
swallowed by the whale, emerged to warn Nineveh to change its evil
ways or risk disaster. The citizens repented and nothing terrible
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at Jonah and say he was wrong, not `Oh, we're so
happy he warned us,' but `He was wrong,''' Kessler said. ``What's
going on in Y2K, you could call it a Nineveh syndrome.''

OUTDOORS: THE YIELD OF A GORGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENTWORTH LOCATION, N.H. _ ``Come with me to Hellgate Gorge,'' I
said to my companion, Ruth Kirchmeier, and borrowing from
Christopher Marlowe, I continued, ``where we will all the pleasures
prove that hills and valleys, dales and fields, woods or steepy
mountain yields.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellgate Gorge, located on the Dead Diamond River at the north
end of Dartmouth College's Second College Grant _ 27,000 acres of
wilderness _ in the rugged northeast tip of New Hampshire, was
short on dales and fields, but had, I knew, no lack of woods and
steepy mountains, and I believed that Ruth would be pleased by
them, and by the log cabin above the gorge that is always filled
with the moaning of the river as it pours through the gorge,
burnishing and sculpting the ledges.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth acquiesced, although knowing full well that in addition to
my desire for us to spend a little time alone together was my
equally compelling urge to go deer hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The past decade, having become accustomed to venison in the
freezer year-round, whether from Anticosti Island in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence or from the river bottoms and flat agricultural lands
of northern Minnesota, I found myself well into November with no
deer hunts in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Miscalculations and happenstance were responsible for this. I
had planned a hunt with my sons on our newly acquired land in Maine
and had canceled a trip to Minnesota because of that. But a visit
that I made to the Maine holdings during a snowy, wet and cold week
in October revealed that the cavernous lodge on that property
couldn't be adequately heated for winter hunting. Then I came down
with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   My friends, including my brother, each got a deer in Minnesota.
A few weeks later, Ruth and I were on our way to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of snow when we drove up the logging road that
runs for about 11 miles along the Dead Diamond from the Grant's
Gate Camp to Hellgate Gorge. The temperature was in the teens, and
there was ice along the edges of the river and in its oxbows.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gate Camp I had learned from the Grant's caretaker,
Lorraine Turner, that Put Blodgett of Lyme, N.H., had a party of
eight at Merrill Brook cabin, which is about halfway up the road to
Hellgate. Over the years, the Blodgett clan always included Put's
uncle, Pete Blodgett of Dover, Mass. Pete, who hunted the Grant
over a span of more than 70 years, died this summer in his late
90s.
</P>
<P>
   I also learned from the deer log at the Gate Camp that, with
only four more days of the deer season left, 17 deer had been taken
from the Grant since the season opened on Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth and I arrived at the Hellgate Gorge cabin shortly after
noon on Dec. 2 and spent most of the remaining daylight hours
getting our gear inside and setting up camp, lugging water from the
river and kindling a good fire in the wood stove. She immediately
succumbed to the magic of the place and as the light was dying made
a few sketches of the river rushing through the gorge while I
turned on the gas lamps and set about preparing supper.
</P>
<P>
   The weather turned around that night. The temperature rose to
above freezing, and save for brief periods we never saw the sun
again during our remaining three days.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Put Blodgett and his oldest son, Peter, paid us a
visit. They then departed to hike up to Hellgate and Lamb Valley
Ponds. They were the nonhunting members of their party. Once a
dedicated hunter, Put quit about a decade ago and now gathers
hardwood burls, from which he fashions bowls, and there were
several of them in the back of his pickup. But two members of his
group had already taken deer, his youngest son, Boo, getting a
six-pointer of 140 pounds on Dec. 4 and Dave Clements shooting a
five-pointer of 110 pounds on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth doesn't hunt, but I took her on a hike to Finnson's Ledge
the following afternoon. I wanted her to see the view over the
river valley from that sheer cliff and reasoned that the two
remaining days would provide ample time for me to get my deer while
she poked about with her sketch pad.
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong. Fog draped the hills and there were times when I
couldn't see 75 yards through the woods. At one point after
wambling through a dense stand of young spruces on my way uphill to
a hardwood ridge, I put up a moose, and the cover was so thick all
that I saw was a big patch of black hide 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Although I encountered no deer, their signs were plentiful. When
we left the Grant, I checked the deer log at the Gate Camp and
learned that the Blodgett party had scored a third time, with Mark
Clements shooting a 10-pointer that weighed 180 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Put Blodgett later told me that in a last-ditch effort to bag a
deer on the final morning, Mark and his brother Dave were driving
along the logging road between Merrill Brook and Hellgate when they
saw what they first thought was a snag floating down the river. A
few seconds later, they realized that the branches of the snag were
the horns of a splendid buck. It went out of sight around a bend.
They drove downstream to get ahead of the animal. Pressed by the
need for speed, Mark grabbed a single cartridge and his rifle and
ran down through the woods to the river. The big animal had emerged
from the river on the opposite shore and was headed into the woods.
Mark fired his one shot, killing it instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The young men then waded the icy river _ more than waist deep at
that point _fully clothed to get the deer and drove back to Merrill
Brook cabin, where they poured the water out of their boots, dried
their clothes and reveled in their success.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades that I have hunted here I have always scanned the
river and its gravel bars while driving along the logging road, but
the only mammals I have ever spotted were beaver, mink and moose.
Perhaps, I mused, it would be more rewarding to become a hunter of
burls.

WILLIAMS AND SAINTS PLAY THE BLAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans running back Ricky Williams is considered one of the
most easygoing players in the NFL. But on the telephone last week,
he sounded miserable, even angry. It's understandable. He went
through the Saints' terrible three-victory season. He said he was
treated poorly, at times, by coach Mike Ditka, and it turned out
that his rookie contract with the Saints was so one-sided in favor
of the team that he might try to restructure it.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka traded all of the New Orleans draft choices to get
Williams, but then completely misused the Heisman Trophy winner
once he put on a Saints uniform, so it cannot be said that Williams
was sorry to see the coach fired along with general manager Bill
Kuharich. Indeed, Williams feels change at the top was desperately
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst year of my life in terms of football,''
Williams said. ``I think every player probably felt that way. This
season was a horror story. No question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka's stint with the Saints will be remembered as one of the
more pathetic in the organization's history, which is rich in bad
times. New Orleans went 3-13 this past season, matching the
second-worst mark in franchise history, and in his three years as
head coach, Ditka was 15-33, including 6-23 in his last 29 games.
Under Ditka, the Saints lost 14 consecutive road games.
</P>
<P>
   No one endured the brunt of the losing like Williams, last
year's first-round pick out of the University of Texas. Ditka
traded the team's eight 1999 draft choices, and the No. 1 and No. 3
picks in 2000, to get Williams. Their relationship started on a
good note, but it became strained in the end, and it was Williams
who began receiving the blame, probably unfairly, for the team's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said fans, teammates and even some coaches and front
office personnel transferred their misery over the losing season to
him, since the franchise had given up so much to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask coach Ditka to trade all of those picks for me,''
Williams said. ``But I think he blamed me for how bad the season
went. But coach Ditka has to look at himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the season, Ditka publicly admonished Williams
for being overweight and out of shape. ``Once I missed a meeting
and was late for practice one morning,'' Williams said. ``He sat me
down and said I was letting the team down, and also that I did not
want to play hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added: ``I made some mistakes. And coach Ditka is not
going to like this, but he made mistakes, too, and he treated me
really unfairly. I played hurt most of the year, almost all of the
time. For him to say I didn't was not true. With coach I always
felt like he wanted to overuse me as a way of proving that the
trade was the right thing to do. I wasn't treated like a person. I
was treated like a piece of property.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka could not be reached for comment but said after his firing
that he understood it. ``You're 3-13, you have the expectations we
do, you bring in Ricky Williams, and it doesn't work out,'' Ditka
said at a brief news conference. ``I mean, we've got to be
realists.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also expressed resentment over his contract situation.
Williams used an agent inexperienced in making NFL deals, and he
negotiated one of the worst contracts a rookie has signed in 10
years. The main problem with the seven-year, $57.3 million deal is
that much of the money is tied up in practically unreachable
clauses. Williams did receive an $8.84 million signing bonus, but
as the contract now stands he must run for 1,600 yards in each of
the next three seasons _ something that no back in NFL history has
done _ or he will never get most of the $57.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said many of his teammates resented the fact that he
signed a contract that was so one-sided toward the team. ``I think
a lot of players on the team don't respect me,'' he said. ``It all
started with my contract. It's obvious that because of the problems
with my contract, it hurt my chances of making money. I think a lot
of players looked at me as ignorant or naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he planned to address the contract with the
Saints, although he would not say exactly how, or if he was
considering hiring a new agent. ``I am definitely going to fix some
things with my deal,'' he said. ``I think the team should fix it,
but I don't know if they will. I'm not going to hold out. But I did
do the contract so I could get on the playing field quickly. The
team took advantage of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's sad what happened with my contract. I played
through pain, did the right thing, and I get very little monetarily
for it. There are other players on this team who did not do half of
what I did and got paid a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ditka's biggest mistakes was how he used Williams. While
Williams does possess a power running style, he is also a good
receiver out of the backfield, and has enough speed to get outside
on end runs.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, Williams was the complete back, but in New Orleans,
Ditka mostly ran Williams up the middle, and he was rarely asked to
catch the football. One NFC West defensive coordinator, who twice
drew up game plans against the Saints, said: ``Put Williams on a
team with a coach who knows how to use him, and Williams gets 1,300
or 1,400 yards rushing a season easy. And he wouldn't be hurt as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Williams was mostly pounded up the middle, his body took
the maximum amount of punishment possible, which led to a number of
injuries, including ankle problems. Williams finished with 884
yards rushing and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike just saw me as a guy to stuff up the middle down after
down,'' Williams said. ``I was drafted because in college I did
everything. But suddenly here I was being limited.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Williams is still considered a premier
back, and there is speculation that several teams may inquire about
a trade for Williams once the Saints hire a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wants to succeed in New Orleans. ``I want to be a
part of turning this thing around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling Out of Buffalo?
</P>
<P>
   Only several days before their playoff game at Tennessee,
quarterback Doug Flutie and receiver Andre Reed of the Bills each
voiced displeasure with the organization. Flutie remains angry at
being benched in favor of Rob Johnson, and Reed is bothered by his
diminished role.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player is likely to be back next season, as the Bills
will look to younger players. But Flutie and Reed are only part of
what could be a rapid facelift across pro football.
</P>
<P>
   In one off-season, Barry Sanders could leave Detroit, Jerry Rice
and Steve Young could leave San Francisco, and Miami might trade
Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Griese's Ailment Revealed
</P>
<P>
   One of the most startling physical feats this year was
accomplished quietly by Brian Griese, the Denver Broncos
quarterback who played much of this season even though the
cartilage in his throwing shoulder was basically torn in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the surgeon got in there, he said, `Oh, my gosh, I can't
believe this guy played with this,''' said Denver's trainer, Steve
Antonopulos.
</P>
<P>
   Griese is expected to recover from the surgery in several
months. Despite the injury, Griese played better as the season
progressed and he should be the starter next year.

REAL ESTATE: FOR NEW YORK LANDLORDS, IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas Falus, president of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's New
York metropolitan area operations, put it simply: ``1999 was the
best year of the 25-plus years I have been in real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   A booming national economy, a stock market that soared through
the year and the rapid growth of companies related to the Internet
have increased demand for office and retail space in the region,
and the prospect, real estate executives say, is that the good
times will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The average vacancy rate for Class A office properties in
midtown is about 6 percent, with space all but unavailable in some
locations, and average asking rental rates for new leases are close
to $55 a square foot a year.
</P>
<P>
   The figures vary in other parts of the region, but the trend is
the same: there is less space available and what is on the market
is getting steadily more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate executives say there is nothing on the horizon
to prevent this year from being as good as the one just past, at
least from the landlords' point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Employment is rising, they note, and there is little risk of
overbuilding, since all the construction projects now under way,
such as the full-block Bear, Stearns headquarters on Madison Avenue
between 46th and 47th streets, and the Reuters building at Seventh
Avenue from 42nd to 43rd streets, had a principal tenant signed up
before a shovel went into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has begun to pick up again, after falling to nearly
nothing in the mid-1990s. According to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield,
1,477,631 square feet of new office building was completed in 1999
compared to just 112,000 square feet the year before. The big real
estate services company reported that an additional 3,292,689
square feet was under construction during the year, but this is
still small compared with the 9,028,767 completed in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   New construction aside, the search for space is driving some
clients to former industrial properties on Manhattan's far west
side, and others to the waterfront in Jersey City, where developers
cannot build fast enough to satisfy eager clients.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, conditions that favor landlords mean difficult times
for tenants, who find their choices diminished and costs rising.
``There may not be any clouds in the sky for owners, but if you are
a space user there are plenty of clouds and they are dark and
stormy,'' said Michael Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate
Co., a brokerage concern.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the general ebullience, some real estate executives
warn that history has demonstrated that the industry is cyclical
and what is up now can come down fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back 50 years in New York real estate, you will
see that the market is an unbroken sine wave with a period of eight
to nine years,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern
Consolidated Properties, referring to the up and down nature of the
mathematical expression. ``We are 11 years into the current period,
so something is coming soon. It's different every time, but it will
probably be the equivalent of the savings and loan crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The insolvency of many savings institutions in the 1980s
prompted the government to dump large amounts of property on the
market, greatly depressing prices. Hauspurg noted that the value of
property in New York fell 60 percent from 1989 to the bottom in
1993 before recovering by last year.
</P>
<P>
   One economic sector that some identify as a possible danger zone
is Internet-related companies, which include those writing software
and offering electronic services, news and advertising. They have
been among the fastest-growing employers in the city, many doubling
in size annually. This has helped lessen New York's traditional
dependence on financial services, which has shown only modest job
growth despite the soaring stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Internet-related companies are start-ups, with
no current earnings and no prospects of profitability any time
soon. Most are living on funding from venture capitalists or stock
offerings and many are burning through that financing rapidly as
they seek to dominate market segments by growing quickly.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the Internet is going away, but some
real estate executives fear that if some prominent companies fail,
markets could sour on the whole industry, cutting off its source of
cash. A rash of bankruptcies could put a lot of office space back
on the market with a depressing effect on rental rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look out for risks in 2000, that is No. 1 on the list,''
said Steve Kohn, a managing director at Sonnenblick-Goldman, a real
estate investment banking company. ``They are not generating their
own cash flow and they are burning through what they have at a fast
rate. Most only have enough cash for 16 to 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The large number of Internet-related companies is inflating
demand for professional services as well as building materials and
trades, said Anthony Malkin, president of W&AMP;M Properties, a real
estate management and development company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are spending a lot of on architects, accountants,
lawyers as well as on wiring, hardware and installation,'' he said.
``But it looks as though it is an industry that will have a few
winners and a lot of losers. So when it shakes out, there are going
to be vacancies by the companies themselves and vacancies by the
service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say these companies are occupying space in outlying
areas of Manhattan that are not attractive to mainstream companies.
``They are on the fringe, in Chelsea, Ninth and 10th Avenue and
downtown,'' said Stephen Green, the chairman of S.L. Green Realty,
a real estate investment trust that owns 9 million square feet of
older office space, mostly in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Internet companies can be precarious
tenants, since they are dependent on securing outside financing.
``We recognize that if the capital spigot dries up they are not
operationally profitable,'' he said. ``We take some high-tech
tenants, but not many. They are well under 10 percent, probably in
the 5 to 6 percent range.''
</P>
<P>
   Other landlords and property managers also speak of limiting the
concentration of Internet-related companies, but those companies
have certainly become an important factor in some parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by Insignia/ESG, a real estate
services company, fully one-third of the leases signed last year in
Midtown South were by Internet companies or the telecommunications
firms that support them. But in midtown they only accounted for 4
percent of leases, and were at the 10.5 percent level downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a short-term phenomenon, and we are going to have
to learn to deal with it,'' said David Levinson, an executive
managing director of Insignia/ESG. ``Think about the cut-and-sew
operations that used to be in the Garment District. They were not
credit tenants,'' he said, referring to companies with more than
enough financial resources to make lease payments. ``My view is
that we're replacing them with tenants that manufacture software.''

</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how they are regarded by landlords, these new
companies are preoccupied with growth. Since they need people to
fuel that growth they are willing to do what it takes to find the
space to put those employees.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick Inc. and ActBig.com are both Internet-related
companies, but they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick, which supplies services to advertising agencies and
tracks the effectiveness of advertising, has successfully sold
stock to the public. With financing in hand, its solution to having
people spread over six floors in two buildings in Midtown South was
to move the whole operation to the west side.
</P>
<P>
   The company leased 150,000 square feet at 450 West 33rd St., at
10th Avenue, a property that included the old Sky Rink space on the
top floor. In addition to consolidating all New York employees at
one location, Kevin O'Connor, the chairman of the company, said,
the column-free space was built out to burnish the company's
new-media image.
</P>
<P>
   ActBig.com is a start-up that tries to increase the purchasing
power of consumers by pooling orders electronically. It is in
sublet space in the rear of the third floor of a building at 222
Fifth Ave. between 26th and 27th streets.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people are crammed into three small offices, with boxes
piled up between the desks and chairs. Stephen Tsai, the chief
executive, said the critical need was to find more space on terms
that are tolerable to a start-up company that closed its first
round of financing last July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to map our space needs with our finances,'' Tsai said.
``This is the right space for a start-up, and we need another short
stop until the next round of financing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that another sublet would avoid draining the company's
capital into the large deposits being demanded by some landlords as
the condition of signing a lease with young companies lacking
established credit. But sublets are hard to find because those who
currently have extra space often decide to keep it for their own
growth.
</P>
<P>
   With the company hiring at the rate of a person a week, finding
more space has become urgent. ``It has become a huge part of my
day-to-day operations,'' Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that some landlords are seeking to use the shortage of
space as a means of investing in the Internet. ``Some of them want
to use real estate as investment currency,'' Tsai said. ``They will
exchange space for a piece of your company.'' To avoid having to do
this, he said, the company was now willing to sign a lease.
</P>

   Midtown
</P>
<P>
   Rents Still Rise, Tenants Still Eager
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern, the chairman of Hartz Mountain Industries had a
floor come vacant recently in the tower of the lavishly appointed
building the company owns overlooking Central Park at 667 Madison
Ave. at 61st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenant asked us to take back the space on Monday,'' he
said. The next morning, ``At 8:30 Tuesday, a broker showed up with
a tenant and by 8:40 we shook hands on a 10-year lease at $95 a
square foot for the first five years and $100 a square foot for the
second five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day another prospective tenant offered $100 a
square foot annually for all 10 years, he said, and later in the
week another offered $110 a square foot for 10 years. Stern said he
was going to stick with the first tenant.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it was in midtown office market, particularly in
well located buildings with the right amenities. Average annual
asking rents in such buildings are pushing closer to $60 a square
foot, with $70 to $75 a square foot not uncommon, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   Since most real estate executives say rents over $70 a square
foot financially justifies new construction, some projects are
expected to go forward, although the scarcity of sites suitable for
building is expected to limit their number.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York needs a speculative building or two,'' said Kevin
Haggarty, the executive managing director of Insignia/ESG's capital
advisers group. ``There's nothing to worry about; they would lease
up without trouble. There's not enough sites in the city to
overbuild if we wanted two.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said rental costs were not a significant factor to the
boutique money management firms that have broken away from the big
Wall Street companies. ``Our floors are 7,700 square feet,'' he
said. ``You can manage $2 billion in that amount of space, so rent
is not an onerous cost for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown
</P>
<P>
   Apartment Developers Think Commercial
</P>
<P>
   Downtown continues to be a lower-cost alternative for companies
reluctant to pay midtown rates. The vacancy rate in Class A
buildings fell to 7.7 percent near the end of the year, while Class
A asking rentals have reached almost $37 a square foot annually.
</P>
<P>
   These rising rents have been changing the plans of property
owners in the area. ``A lot of would-be residential developers are
reconsidering their plans,'' said William Cohen, an executive vice
president of Newmark &AMP; Company Real Estate. In the early part of
the decade, when older office buildings were declared functionally
obsolete and doomed to stand empty, conversion to residences seemed
the only opportunity to realize value from them.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising rental rates _ even Class B buildings can command
$27 a square foot annually _ are changing the economics of those
conversions, he said. ``Residential rents approximate $42 a square
foot, but it costs 40 to 50 percent more to do residential than
commercial,'' Cohen said. ``When you can get $27 a foot with a 3
percent compounded annual escalation, most people are leaning
toward staying commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   One good example of this trend is the building at 48 Wall St.,
the former headquarters of the Bank of New York. ``That building
was held vacant for residential conversion,'' said Michael Cohen of
Williams. ``But it is not being converted. It is going to be used
for offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as demand for office space continues to outstrip
supply this year more of the older buildings concentrated downtown
would become candidates for upgrading for modern tenants.
</P>

<P>
   Building Sales
</P>
<P>
   Prices Recover After Late '98 Decline
</P>
<P>
   Prices of buildings in New York recovered last year, after
declining in late 1998 because of the turmoil in capital markets in
the fall of that year, sales brokers reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices peaked in the summer of 1998 and then fell back,'' said
Warren Heller, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle's investment
banking group. ``But midtown has recovered back to the highs of the
1980s, although downtown is two years behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the outlook for pricing this year is firmly connected to
the direction of rents. ``It is difficult to see any case where
rents do not grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of sales fell last year compared to 1998, said
Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated. ``The number of transactions
declined, although pricing remained strong,'' he said. ``The people
who wanted to be sellers have sold.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of capital available to finance purchases, said
John Lyons, executive managing director of Granite Partners, a real
estate investment banking firm. But, he said, higher prices for
properties have meant lower returns, and some of the money raised
to buy real estate was not invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, opportunity funds raised approximately $30 billion to
invest in real estate,'' he said. ``Some of it went overseas, but a
lot of capital stayed on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   He said funds that had returns of 30 percent to 40 percent in
years past were reluctant to invest for a 20 percent return on
their capital. And he said there might be a burst of sales activity
early this year as transactions that were postponed in the fourth
quarter of 1999 for fear of computer problems begin to close.
</P>
<P>
   The Suburbs
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Market Is the Most Active
</P>
<P>
   The waterfront in Jersey City, N.J., is filling up and brokers
predict that sites well inland from the Hudson River are the next
target for development. Meanwhile, the consolidation of the
pharmaceutical industry in New Jersey is filling up buildings and
causing the start of new projects in Morris and Somerset counties.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is the most active market in the metropolitan area,
with some speculative construction under way on Long Island, N.Y.,
and lesser levels of activity in Westchester County, N.Y., and
Fairfield County, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waterfront will be filled in soon by people moving from
New York,'' said Franklin Speyer, executive director of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield of Northern New Jersey. ``The demand is double for what
is being planned to be built over the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the definition of the waterfront market would
expand, with areas several blocks away from the water becoming
development sites as long as they are conveniently located in
relation to the PATH trains that are the vital link to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in full development mode,'' said Emanuel Stern, the
president of Hartz Mountain and the son of Leonard. He said the
company is building 70 Hudson St., a 410,000-square-foot
speculative office building in Jersey City and the 205-room TriBeCa
Grand Hotel in Manhattan, and is rebuilding the Chart House
Restaurant at the end of a pier in Weehawken, N.J. It is also, he
said, working on plans for Waverly Yards, a 65-acre mixed-use
development near Newark Airport in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the merger of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc to form
Aventis Pharmaceuticals last year is prompting the construction of
two 310,000-square-foot buildings at SJP Properties' Somerset
Corporate Center in Bridgewater, N.J. The first is expected to be
ready for occupancy in the first quarter of 2001 and will be the
company's North American commercial headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Aventis leased 340,000 square feet in SJP's Morris
Corporate Center in Parsippany, N.J., as an interim headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, Reckson Associates Realty Trust is building a
speculative 277,000-square-foot office building in Melville that is
scheduled to be completed this fall. Mitchell Rechler, the co-chief
operating officer of the real estate investment trust, said that
pre-leasing, often a must to get financing in New York City, is
rare on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built over 4 million square feet of property on
speculation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The market in Fairfield County in Connecticut remained tight,
with a 10.4 percent vacancy rate at the end of the third quarter.
The vacancy rate in nearby Westchester remained considerably higher
at 16.2 percent, which real estate executives said was the result
of the abandoning of hard-to-divide headquarters buildings by large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Retail
</P>
<P>
   Prime-Area Rents Hit New Highs
</P>
<P>
   Rents in prime shopping areas of the city hit new heights last
year, according to Faith Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick-Aug
Associates, a brokerage company specializing in retail properties.
``On Madison Avenue between 57th and 72nd Street, rents went up to
$700 a square foot, and for new properties in 2000 they are asking
$1,000 a square foot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Consolo said that $100 a square foot was the minimum today
in almost any area of Manhattan, but that some property owners were
in danger of pricing themselves out of the market because retailers
paying high rents have difficulty earning profits.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Victor, an executive vice president of Lansco Corp., said
some retailers have grown resistant to demands for higher rents
from landlords. ``It is getting tougher to make deals,'' he said.
``The market has gotten tighter everywhere on Madison, Fifth Avenue
and SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   This has led some retailers to move into areas once considered
off the beaten track. ``Chelsea is a big play right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy Steady, Room Rates Up
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates at New York hotels declined in the first half of
1999 compared with the previous year, but picked up in the second
half to close at 82.4 percent, just a 0.4 percent decline from
1998, according to figures compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The average daily rate for hotel rooms increased 3.9 percent to
$200.96 during the year, but the increase was well below the 10.6
percent and 11 percent increases in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-priced hotels may see a falloff in occupancy this
year, said Sean Hennessey, director of the firm's New York
hospitality practice. ``At the upper levels,'' he said, ``New York
is priced out of the market for the common guy.'' Average room
rates in the deluxe segment, which includes the Four Seasons and
the Pierre, are $408 a night, he said, while those in the luxury
segment, covering hotels such as the Waldorf and the Plaza, have
been averaging $266 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Several new hotels are scheduled to open this year, including a
Doubletree on 41st Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, a
Sofitel at 45 West 44th St., and an Embassy Suites in Battery Park
City.

TOP STRATEGIST FOR POLICE JOINS FORCE IN BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Norris, the deputy police commissioner who has
helped oversee New York City's crime-fighting strategies for the
last three and a half years, is leaving his post to take a senior
position with the Baltimore police force, officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who joined the New York Police Department in 1980 and
was appointed to the civilian post of deputy commissioner for
operations in April 1996, will be the No. 2 official in the
Baltimore department, said Marilyn Mode, the deputy commissioner
for public information in the New York department.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Inspector Garry McCarthy, who commands
the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn, said Police Commissioner Howard
Safir. To hold the title of deputy commissioner for operations,
McCarthy is required to take a leave of absence from the uniformed
service.
</P>
<P>
   Norris' primary responsibilities were advising Safir on
anti-crime strategies and coordinating the program that holds
commanders accountable for crime in their precincts and boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Norris, 40, blamed the news media for a rise in the
city's homicide rate, contending that negative news coverage of the
Police Department had so intimidated officers that they were
reluctant to patrol aggressively and that their reluctance had led
to an increase in killings. Norris singled out the coverage in The
New York Times, although he did not cite specific articles. His
statement was generally viewed as reflecting Safir's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Safir praised Norris, calling him ``a very smart
young strategist who has a real sense of what strategies result in
crime reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris was a protege of Jack Maple, who oversaw the department's
crime strategies until he resigned in April 1996, and Louis
Anemone, the brash former chief of department.
</P>
<P>
   His career took off in 1994, under William Bratton, the police
commissioner at the time. During Bratton's tenure, Norris was
promoted rapidly, jumping three ranks from his position as a
lieutenant commanding a detective squad to deputy inspector in
about three years.
</P>
<P>
   After Safir became police commissioner, he promoted Norris to
deputy chief in 1996 and to deputy commissioner later that year.
Norris' Police Department salary is $126,951.
</P>
<P>
   Norris would not comment, and Baltimore police officials and a
spokesman for Martin O'Malley, the mayor of Baltimore, would not
discuss Norris' new position.
</P>
<P>
   Norris will be chief of department under the new police
commissioner of Baltimore, Ronald Daniel, a department insider who
was named to that post last month and is awaiting confirmation by
the Baltimore City Council.

TITANS SHOCK BILLS, 22-16, ON `MIRACLE' LATERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Time stood still at Adelphia Coliseum
Saturday afternoon. The clock was stuck at the final three seconds
for what seemed like three days. The referee, Phil Luckett, had his
head stuck in a replay booth, a few Buffalo Bills had their worried
heads stuck in their hands and more than a few Tennessee Titans
looked for intervention _ divine, miraculous, lucky or otherwise _
to save their season.
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The most divine, miraculous, lucky play of the season. Luckett
said it was good.
</P>
<P>
   A kickoff gathered by Tennessee with 16 seconds left in the
game, handed to another player, lateraled to another and then
swoosh! A 75-yard kickoff return for a touchdown that counted.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee play called Home Run Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, after Luckett finally trotted back onto the field, the
clock still said 0:03 as he said that the return was indeed good,
that the lateral was legal and that the Titans had won, 22-16,
eliminating the Bills from the playoffs and, finally, turning
history kindly toward the Tennessee franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans used to be the Houston Oilers, and in 1993
they lost a playoff game, 41-38, at Buffalo, where the Bills'
staged one of the most dramatic comebacks in the history of pro
football _ a 32-point comeback.
</P>
<P>
   This one was just as sweet for Tennessee (14-3), and especially
for the record crowd of 66,782.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud of our team, our fans, our franchise,''
Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said. ``This was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Divine, miraculous and lucky, too.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (11-6) entered the fourth quarter trailing by 12-7 and
then scored with 11 minutes 8 seconds to play on Antowain Smith's
1-yard run. Buffalo's 2-point conversion attempt failed, and the
Bills led, 13-12.
</P>
<P>
   But then Tennessee's Al Del Greco kicked a 36-yard field goal
with 1:48 left to give the Titans a 15-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Steve Christie of Buffalo topped that, connecting on
a 41-yard field goal with only 16 seconds left to give Buffalo a
16-15 lead. The Bills certainly looked like winners. What could top
that?
</P>
<P>
   How about a kickoff that was gathered by Lorenzo Neal near the
Tennessee 25 and was then handed to Frank Wycheck? He ran toward
the right side of the field and lateraled the ball back to Kevin
Dyson. Dyson took off with a convoy of blockers and Buffalo was
completely fooled. Dyson ran 75 yards into the end zone and it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it? Three seconds remained. Instant replay took a look.
Was the lateral legal or was it a forward pass?
</P>
<P>
   Luckett looked.
</P>
<P>
   Divine, miraculous, lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee moves on.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played through a scoreless first quarter, testing each
other in formation, run schemes, pass protection, blitz packages
and by continually searching for weaknesses. The Tennessee offense
struggled early _ it did not gain a first down until the final
seconds of the quarter. In the quarter, Titans quarterback Steve
McNair was 2 of 7 passing for 11 yards, with 10 of those yards on
one pass. Buffalo managed only three first downs and 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:50 left in the first quarter, Tennessee blew the game's
first chance for a score. Jevon Kearse had ripped around right end,
stripped the ball from quarterback Brad Johnson in the pocket and
sacked him. Tennessee linebacker Barron Wortham fell on the ball at
the Buffalo 39. But the Titans offense could move only 3 yards in
three plays, which set up Del Greco's field goal attempt from 43
yards. It sailed wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse decided in the second quarter that what the offenses
could not do, he would do. He would score.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo began a drive at its 4 with 12:08 left in the half.
Johnson fumbled the snap, tripped on a lineman's leg while running
into the end zone and then found Kearse about to pounce on him near
the back of the end zone. Kearse pounced and the ball fluttered
from Johnson's hands and through the back of the end zone. With
11:19 left, Tennessee gained a 2-0 lead on its first safety since
the franchise's 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   The only offensive scoring drive of the half ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo free kick after the safety was gathered by Titans
returner Derrick Mason, who sped up the middle and through the
heart of the defense for a 42-yard return to the Buffalo 28.
Tennessee's big plays in its five-play drive were Eddie George's
9-yard run around right end to the Buffalo 2 and McNair's 1-yard
no-huddle bootleg scoring run. With 7:55 left in the half,
Tennessee took a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo kept tripping over itself in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was poor (5 of 12 for 64 yards) and hurried (five
Tennessee sacks). The Bills rushed for only 30 yards and did not
gain a first down in the second quarter. Buffalo also committed
nine penalties for 44 yards while Tennessee committed none.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties hurt the Bills' chances. Del Greco tried a 45-yard
field goal for Tennessee, which missed left as the first half
expired, but Buffalo was penalized for holding on the play. Del
Greco gained another chance with no time left on the clock and
converted from 40 yards, giving the Titans a 12-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   For the half, Tennessee led in plays (38-27) and in possession
time (17:18 to 12:42).
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo needed the game to turn: It required a dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the third quarter, Smith dashed 44 yards to the
Titans' 18. Smith later scored on a 4-yard run and suddenly _ no
doubt after a Bills halftime locker room full of introspection and
in-your-face challenges _ Buffalo trailed by just 12-7 three
minutes into the third quarter. And that score held as both teams
entered the fourth quarter.

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 JOHN BALDWIN, 76, CONDUCTOR OF GLEE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Low Baldwin, who conducted the University Glee Club of New
York City, an exuberant and exclusive throwback to the era when
groups like the Whiffenpoofs _ meaning men and only men _ ruled the
risers, died Dec. 31 of lung cancer at a Morristown, N.J.,
hospital. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, an accomplished organist who also led other singing
groups, brought a highly personalized blend of playfulness and
perfectionism to his direction of the 130-member glee club, which
was founded in 1894.
</P>
<P>
   At the group's concerts, which are held in rented halls and are
not open to the general public, the audiences are expected to wear
black tie; the glee club wears white tie and tails. The repertory
includes such diverse pieces as college drinking songs, Latin
hymns, African lullabies and drinking songs from operas.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who was the club's fourth and longest-serving
conductor, at 39 years, did not shrink from flamboyance. In an
article in The New York Times in 1987, Holcomb B. Noble, a reporter
for The Times and a club member, described a typical rehearsal
scene. Baldwin, he wrote, ``will march around the podium, grab
himself by the seat of the pants, moan, warble and shout:
`O-O-O-O-oh, am I hearing a bunch of tired old men _ or singers?'''
</P>
<P>
   John Low Baldwin was born and raised in Parsippany, N.J. When he
was 9, a churchgoer impressed with his lucid voice recommended him
for a place in the boy soprano choir of the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in New York. He startled the music director of the
Episcopal choir by auditioning with the Presbyterian gospel hymn
``The Old Rugged Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   He passed the audition, and by the time he was 16 he was the
cathedral's associate organist and the master of choristers. That
year, he graduated from high school and passed the examination of
the American Guild of Organists; at the time, he was the youngest
person to pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Army, where he was assigned to the Rainbow
Division of the 8th Army in World War II. Some music-loving
colonels put him in charge of 200 singers picked from a regiment of
10,000. Just as he was about to start a round of war-bond rallies,
he was sent overseas and served at the front lines as an assistant
to a Mormon chaplain. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge and
helped to liberate Dachau.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the war, Low was a sergeant directing a glee club
of 60 men in Vienna, Austria. They raised money to restore damaged
cathedrals, while living in Salzburg Castle with servants at their
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's first civilian post was as organist at Grace Church in
Utica, N.Y. In 1947, he joined the faculty of nearby Hamilton
College, though he had not been to college. In 18 years at
Hamilton, he served as chairman of the music department and founded
the Root Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   He became conductor of the University Glee Club in 1961 while
still at Hamilton. Although he held one of just two paying
positions at the club, he insisted on being a dues-paying member
and a leading contributor to the club's endowment as well. In 1965,
he became a professor of music at Fairleigh Dickinson University in
Madison, N.J. In 1969, he took the post of organist and choir
director of the Church of St. John on the Mountain in
Bernardsville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drew as much perfection out of us as he possibly, possibly
could,'' said Susan Ely of Bernardsville.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Baldwin was vigorously preparing the glee
club at weekly rehearsals for its January concert, one of the
club's two main annual events. A club member, Paul Loewenwarter,
recalled how Baldwin's back was typically ramrod straight and how
energy seemed to burst forth from his barrel chest.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was equally at home with mixed and male choruses. ``He
would let a donkey sing, if he thought the donkey would make the
right noise,'' Ms. Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin lived in a 200-year-old stone house in the Willow Wood
Arboretum in Far Hills, N.J. He was not married, and his three
brothers died before him.
</P>
<P>
   He died minutes after being told that the year 2000 had dawned
in Paris, where for many summers he served as an organist at the
American Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. In his last hours, he was
asked what music he wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you play, just play it loud,'' Baldwin said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regina Jacobs of California and Mark Carroll of
Ireland left the Armory Track and Field Center in Upper Manhattan
on Saturday with a lot more money than when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs and Carroll won the women's and men's elite miles in the
New Balance Games _ and the $12,000 each that came with them.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, the silver medalist in the 1,500 meters last year at the
world championships, ran a sizzling 4 minutes 21.79 seconds, which
shattered the previous meet record of 4:31.96 set by Sinead
Delahunty last year. Delahunty was second Saturday in 4:30.41.
Jacobs took the lead with three laps to go and ran away from the
field with a 64-second last quarter. Her winning time is the
second-fastest run indoors by an American woman. Mary Slaney has
the fastest time of 4:20.5.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll earned his money the hard way. The 28-year-old
Providence College graduate, captured the men's Elite one-mile run
in a sparkling 3:54.98 Saturday. The victory earned him $10,000 for
breaking the meet record of 3:56.85 and another $2,000 for winning
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Boulet, the defending champion who set the previous
record last year, finished second in the race in 3:57.00 with Paul
McMullen, an Olympian out of Eastern Michigan University, third in
3:57.88.

 &HT;    Farm policy forms focus of Gore-Bradley debate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa - In their first Iowa debate of Campaign 2000,
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
clashed Saturday over farm policy, Medicare and health insurance
for the nation's uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates broke no new ground in their 60 minute encounter
and kept a largely civil tone with one another. But the exchange
differed from their debate Wednesday in New Hampshire, where Gore
played the underdog and Bradley appeared more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a new Iowa poll showing him leading Bradley in the
Hawkeye State, Gore took the offensive Saturday on agricultural
policy, a key issue in Iowa and one of Bradley's greatest
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore peppered Bradley repeatedly with questions about his votes
against emergency farm aid to Iowa and other Midwestern states in
the 1990s. In an obviously scripted moment, Gore singled out a
member of the studio audience who he said was a family farmer whose
400-acre farm was nearly consumed by floods in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you vote against the disaster relief?'' Gore demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to explain his vote against a 1993 aid package,
Bradley said, ``This is not about the past. This is about the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can understand why you don't want to talk about the
past,'' Gore retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ultimately got in the last word on the issue, however,
devoting some of his closing remarks to a broadside against the
Clinton-Gore administration's record in helping family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's been hammering on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,''
Bradley said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today: Are you better off than you were seven years ago, or do we
need a change?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sought to put Bradley on the defensive over Medicare
and health care coverage, charging that Bradley's plan to insure
Americans would leave no money to extend the solvency of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has pledged to devote $374 billion over 10 years to help
extend Medicare's solvency from 2015 to 2027. Bradley repeated his
claim that the continuing health of the economy would extend the
insurance program for the elderly without any action now.
</P>
<P>
   On health insurance, Gore charged that Bradley's plan to enroll
uninsured Americans in the federal insurance program for government
workers was insufficient because his proposed subsidy won't cover
most plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed spending $1,200 for each uninsured child
and $1,800 for each uninsured adult living at or near the poverty
level. As he did in the New Hampshire debate Wednesday, Gore
produced a list of federal insurance plans showing that none of the
federal plans offered in Iowa would cover Bradley's subsidies for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his estimate was only a weighted average and that
federally subsidized premiums in some areas would be higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' Bradley retorted. ``I
reject that kind of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates were asked no questions about gays in the
military, which became a flash point in the New Hampshire debate
when Gore suggested that he would make open service for gay and
lesbian military personnel a litmus test for his selection of
members to the joint chiefs of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore subsequently backed off those comments, but the spokesman
for the Republican National Committee appeared outside Saturday's
debate to announce that the RNC was purchasing television
advertising time in Iowa and New Hampshire to hammer Gore on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A script provided by RNC spokesman Mike Collins features a
picture of Gore and concludes with the line, ``Call Al Gore. Tell
him the only litmus test ought to be patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' fifth debate of the campaign came as a new poll
here showed Gore holding a solid lead over Bradley in the Hawkeye
State.
</P>
<P>
   A Des Moines Register poll of 501 likely Democratic caucus
participants found Gore holding a 54 percent to 33 percent lead
over Bradley, virtually the same spread as a similar poll taken two
months ago. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of caucus voters tend to be less reliable than those of
primary voters, but the showing was heartening news for Gore, who
trails Bradley in polls in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses, scheduled for Jan. 24, are the first
presidential preference contest of the 2000 campaign. Although
generally less significant nationally than the New Hampshire
primary a week later, the caucuses are a chance for Bradley to
upset Gore in a state where the institutional backing of the state
party generally gives the incumbent an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has poured money and manpower into Iowa, buying up
$800,000 of television advertising before the caucuses, in hopes of
embarrassing Gore with an exceptionally strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's poll, however, indicated that Bradley has a lot
of ground to make up in just 16 days. The poll found that he
trailed Gore among every voting group except college students.

REAL ESTATE: A $4-BILLION MIX OF USES IS ON TAP FOR SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A 400,000-square-foot university laboratory is
the first building to rise in Mission Bay, the site of a former
rail yard on the city's waterfront that has become San Francisco's
largest redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   On a 303-acre site that is now a tangle of unused railroad
tracks, industrial buildings and empty lots just south of the new
San Francisco Giants baseball park, developers plan a
biotechnology-oriented commercial district and a large residential
neighborhood. The centerpiece of the project is a 43-acre
life-sciences campus for the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   If fully realized, developers say, the 20-year, $4 billion
Mission Bay project will contain 5 million square feet of
commercial space, including office buildings and commercial
laboratory buildings; 2.65 million square feet of university
buildings; 6,000 housing units, and parks and open space.
</P>
<P>
   The primary landowner in the area, Catellus Development Corp. of
San Francisco, the developer for the commercial portion of the
project, donated 30 acres to the university for the new campus,
while the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency donated an additional
13 acres of adjoining land.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and city officials expect the university campus to
serve as a magnet for biotech companies, and the promise of
high-paying technology jobs has made Mission Bay a pet project of
Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Development officials hope to recreate the synergy between
research institutions and high-tech industry that gave birth to
Silicon Valley, where students and faculty members of Stanford
University in Palo Alto originated hundreds of computer-related
companies. At least 46 biotech companies have already originated at
the University of California campus here, said Bruce Spaulding,
vice chancellor for advancement and planning.
</P>
<P>
   The life sciences campus is expected to attract 31,000 jobs to
Mission Bay, or about 5 percent of the jobs in San Francisco now,
said Amy Neches, senior project manager for the city's
redevelopment agency.
</P>
<P>
   Originally part of San Francisco Bay, the Mission Bay area arose
out of a 19th-century landfill; the area was the city's primary
depository for rubble after the 1906 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1920s, the area served as a rail yard for the
city's then-busy harbor. Changes in shipping, notably the rise of
shipping containers, led to the demise of Mission Bay as a cargo
hub in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, developers have searched for ways to
redevelop the land in a city where buildable land is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a steady demand for land, however, city officials and
developers took a decade to agree on a plan. After considerable
controversy about the density of the development and the amount of
public parkland to be developed, the city and county Board of
Supervisors approved a plan in 1991. Soon after, however, the
recession hit California, and the project died.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the future of Mission Bay became linked with
the development plans of the University of California at San
Francisco. At that time, its life sciences division was on the
crowded main campus on Parnassus Avenue, just south of Golden Gate
Park. By the late 1970s, the rapidly expanding university had
already outgrown its campus, but a proposal to build new
laboratories in the neighborhood met with protests and multiple
lawsuits from homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the university agreed to cap the size of the Parnassus
Avenue campus at its existing 3.5 million square feet. Unable to
expand on its central campus, the fast-growing university chose to
decentralize, renting or buying satellite campuses throughout the
city. But that scattering ultimately displeased university
officials, who believed that the ``folks in the disparate sites
didn't feel the sense of community which one expects in an academic
environment,'' Spaulding said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, resolved to relocate, the university looked
at 150 sites, many outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the university, or even a part of it, leaving the
city alarmed business leaders and government officials, who began
lobbying the university to stay in town.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rising, president and chief executive of Catellus, was a
key force behind the university's eventual decision to stay here,
according to Spaulding. ``When Nelson took over as CEO of
Catellus,'' Spaulding said, ``on his very first day he came up to
see me in my office and said, `I want to turn things around.'''
</P>
<P>
   The regents of the University of California approved the Mission
Bay campus in 1997. Last October, construction began on a $143
million laboratory building, one of three that are to make up the
first phase of the university portion of the project. Part of the
financing for the lab buildings comes from a $50 million payment by
Genentech Inc., of South San Francisco, which provided the money as
partial settlement of a patent-infringement lawsuit filed against
the company by the university.
</P>
<P>
   (The university had charged that the company used technology
developed decades earlier at the university; the settlement, in
which Genentech did not admit any wrongdoing, gives the company
naming rights for the building.)
</P>
<P>
   The lab building, designed by SMP/SHG Architects of San
Francisco in association with the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership
of Portland, Ore., has an entrance facing an eight-acre park, which
is meant to create a campus atmosphere from the start, said William
Diefenbach, a senior vice president of SMP/SHG.
</P>
<P>
   After Catellus persuaded the university to build the campus at
Mission Bay, the developer decided to scrap its approved master
plan and redesign the Mission Bay project, this time as a
technology-related business park surrounding the campus like a
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to earlier plans, which envisioned Mission Bay as
almost a self-contained area within the larger city, the new plan
tries to make it part of the city.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, designed by the architectural firm of Johnson Fain
Partners of Los Angeles, proposes a regular street grid for Mission
Bay, with blocks nearly identical in dimension to those in downtown
San Francisco. William H. Fain Jr., the urban-design principal at
Johnson Fain, said the block size was based on an 1839 surveyor's
map that laid out the first nine blocks of the downtown. The plan
also arranges the streets in a simple grid to allow uninterrupted
waterfront views, a feature missing in earlier plans.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the campus, which was prepared by another firm,
Machado and Silvetti Associates of Boston, conforms to the street
grid pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its biotech component, Mission Bay will be a
significant housing resource for a city with a severe housing
shortage, said Ms. Neches, the redevelopment official.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 28 percent of the 6,000 housing units will be moderately
priced, she said. Unlike the housing in many other new
developments, the lower-priced apartments and town houses will be
integrated with the market-rate units, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus selected AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., a
national apartment developer, to build most of the housing. The
city's redevelopment agency plans to start construction this summer
on 90 moderately priced apartments on an acre Catellus donated to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In late 2000, Catellus plans to begin work on 160,000 square
feet of retail space, 25,000 square feet of office space and about
500 housing units on a spot the size of a city block, north of the
university campus. At the center of the block will be an
85-foot-wide walkway, or paseo.
</P>
<P>
   To Rising, Mission Bay represents a good example of urban
development: a mixed-use environment that has been designed for
people on foot as much as for those in cars.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of housing, university and workplace may enable
many people to walk to work _ a rarity in this city of clogged
freeways and far-flung suburbs. ``This is the way we have got to go
in the future,'' he said.

NEW YORK MAYOR KEEPS A FIRM HAND ON THROTTLE OF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani prepares for his annual
State of the City address and luxuriates in the afterglow from the
city's New Year's Eve celebration _ when he gave no fewer than
eight television interviews in one day _ his campaign for U.S.
Senate is at the end of the runway, apparently weighed down with
cash and semiorganized, but ready to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The official line from City Hall remains, amusingly, the same:
The mayor has not yet decided whether he will do Republicans the
favor of taking on Hillary Rodham Clinton, the new Westchester
County resident who is at the White House this weekend packing up
more boxes. Nonetheless, Giuliani essentially outlined his ``City
Hall'' strategy when he told a recent caller to his radio show, ``I
think the best thing for me to do is to do my job the way I've
always done it, and then to try to point out to people why, if they
agree with me, I would be a more effective senator from their point
of view.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, his Senate exploratory committee, with headquarters
in ramshackle offices in a high-rise on Maiden Lane in Lower
Manhattan, now has seven full-time employees and has taken in more
than $6.6 million in campaign contributions, officials say. Bruce
Teitelbaum, the director of the exploratory committee, who is to be
Giuliani's campaign manager whenever the mayor gets around to
officially announcing, is interviewing for a campaign press
secretary, and has talked to two women, one from Washington, the
other from New York.
</P>
<P>
   A woman is desirable, one adviser close to the mayor said,
because it will be easier for her to criticize Mrs. Clinton.
Teitelbaum's position at the campaign is assured for now; his
lawyer announced last week that, according to federal prosecutors
and the Brooklyn district attorney's office, he is ``presently
neither a target nor a subject'' in the criminal investigation into
the collapse of a Brooklyn building that killed a construction
worker in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, William D. Powers, the state Republican Party
chairman, is in the early planning stages of a trip he wants
Giuliani to take this spring to the North Country, the counties
north of Albany, as well as other cities upstate _ a reprise of the
mayor's fall travels to endorse local Republicans, whom he had
never bothered with before.
</P>
<P>
   Powers rejected any notion that Giuliani is less than
enthusiastic about the race. ``I think as much as people have asked
me that question, one can only demonstrate by looking at him,''
Powers said last week. ``If somebody is not interested in running
for statewide office, why are they dragging themselves to
Binghamton, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Troy and Long
Island?''
</P>
<P>
   Powers also dismissed the talk of a new rift between the state's
frequently warring alpha male Republicans, Giuliani and Gov. George
E. Pataki (although some might call the deceptively relaxed Pataki
a secret alpha male), who incurred the mayor's invective in late
December when he signed a pension bill that the mayor said would
cost the city $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get off the government page and on the political page,
they're doing fine,'' Powers said, meaning that Pataki is so far
cooperating with Giuliani in his race against Mrs. Clinton. Until
August, Pataki was promoting the candidacy of Rep. Rick Lazio, a
Republican from Long Island, much to the fury of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In two polls conducted last month, Giuliani remained slightly
ahead, but with the margin of error he was essentially tied with
Mrs. Clinton. Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's support has dropped
significantly since she first announced that she was considering
the race last winter, a time after President Clinton's impeachment
hearings when the public's sympathy for her was enormous. Both
polls, by Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn., and Marist College
in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., also showed Giuliani slightly ahead of Mrs.
Clinton among registered white female voters. In addition, the
Marist poll showed that even among Democratic women, Mrs. Clinton's
core constituency, support for her had dropped 20 points from the
beginning to the end of 1999. The mayor's support went up 10 points
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, the poll reported, 81 percent of the Democratic
women polled supported Mrs. Clinton, compared with 17 percent for
Giuliani. By December, the poll reported, 61 percent of Democratic
women supported Mrs. Clinton, compared with 27 percent for
Giuliani. But the number of polled women in that category was small
_ only 144 in December _ and the margin of sampling error was
large.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's political advisers note that the election is a
long way off, and predict that those women will come back to the
first lady once she settles into her new house in Chappaqua and
begins talking more forcefully about issues like health care and
education. Giuliani's political advisers agree that the election is
a long way off, and are restraining themselves from sounding too
triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the manner in which she has engaged has been
frustrating to people,'' said one of Giuliani's senior campaign
officials. ``One day she's here, the next day she's not, one day
she's to the right, one day she's to the left. People were
expecting strong, decisive, independent _ and they're not getting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's political advisers also contend that the mayor could
win the race with as little as 32 percent of the vote in
overwhelmingly Democratic New York City, meaning that the mayor has
to do exceptionally well upstate and in the New York suburbs. So
far, polls show Giuliani running stronger than Republicans
traditionally do in the suburbs _ that is, in Westchester, Nassau,
Suffolk, Orange and Rockland Counties _ but not as strong as
Republicans often do upstate, where the mayor is not as well known.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac poll, conducted early last month, showed 59
percent of suburban voters favoring Giuliani, compared with 32
percent for Mrs. Clinton. Upstate, the poll showed 47 percent of
voters favoring Giuliani and 38 percent favoring Mrs. Clinton.
(Although the mayor says regularly that he never pays attention to
polls, he often has his advisers call and complain to the pollsters
when he doesn't like the results.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, aides say, Giuliani is entirely focused on his State of
the City speech, in essence his first campaign document of 2000.
The mayor will highlight his accomplishments of 1999, when even
Democrats were grudgingly impressed with how he used his mayoralty
to set the stage for a run for the Senate, particularly in heading
off a transit strike and making sure that Times Square was safe for
New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his aides say they have no idea when he will officially
announce for the Senate. Powers, who encouraged Giuliani to
announce last year, said the mayor has to say something official by
June, when the state party holds its convention. ``I suppose I can
hold my breath until then,'' Powers said.

WHEN IT COMES TO BOSTON AND NEW YORK, IT'S PERSONAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was the Belichick Shuttle about Oedipus, money, power,
personality disorders and football, or was it about something
really important, the sports rivalry between Boston and New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivalry is mostly a media creation,'' said Dr. Howard
Katz, a Boston psychiatrist who grew up in Chicago as a White Sox
fan. ``It's what you're doing. Every day you have a sports page to
fill. And here we have several sports talk radio shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Klein, an anthropologist at Northeastern University in
Boston, thinks the rivalry is real and positive. ``It provides a
social cohesion in a fragmented city,'' he said. ``We can all think
of ourselves as losers together. A major fear is that Pedro
Martinez will pitch the Red Sox into the World Series and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach, who lived in Washington even when he coached the
Boston Celtics, said: ``I like both cities, but there is a
cockiness about New York that makes you really want to beat them. I
always really wanted to beat them. Most of it was personal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Belichick was reported to have quit as Jets head coach
after holding the job for only a day, the analytic waters churned.
Was he getting a better deal with the New England Patriots, or just
afraid to step into Bill Parcells' shoes? Had Parcells masterminded
this to demand draft choices for his former assistant and also to
tighten his control of the club under the new ownership? Perhaps it
was Belichick, more devious and angry than any had ever imagined;
he would slay Parcells-the-father by going to work for his
archenemy, Robert K. Kraft, and then coaching the Patriots to the
Super Bowl championship that under Coach Bill had just eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the key _ ``just eluded them.'' Boston seems
always a tittle away from the title, in a field of dreams that will
never come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wistful `day late, dollar short, yet we still love our
teams' has often been portrayed as a Boston characteristic,'' said
Katz, a prime mover in the sports wing of the American
Psychoanalytic Association. ``But I'm not sure there is one
unifying Boston mentality. The Red Sox mentality is different from
the Bruins mentality and from the Celtics mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach would agree to that. As the Celtics' coach and chief
executive, he is still the NBA prototype patriarch of a winning
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always like to win in New York,'' said Auerbach, who was
born and raised in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. ``Like the
saying goes, `if you're outside New York, you're in the country.'
It was hard to beat New York because they always got the breaks.
Referees were afraid of incurring the wrath of the New York media,
which was national. Anything negative would get back to the league
office.''
</P>
<P>
   So how come you beat New York so often?
</P>
<P>
   ``You always keep fighting them,'' growled Auerbach, 82, who
still plays racquetball three times a week. Then his voice became
confidential with a story he has only told for 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, as a point guard at George Washington University, young
Red looked forward to playing in Madison Square Garden in the
National Invitation Tournament, then the pinnacle of collegiate
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hell of a team and we were promised a spot,'' he
said. ``Ned Irish at the Garden asked us to play NYU at the
Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, and we beat 'em twice and then he
gave our spot to St. John's. We were double-crossed. He was
protecting the New York teams from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it fueled a personal vendetta against New York, the
personal was political; that kind of double-cross, Auerbach said,
was very New York.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Sonny Werblin made him an offer to take over the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach was on his way to New York with his lawyer, but
Bostonians on the street begged him to stay. He deferred the
decision, which was left open. The Celtics were soon sold to more
congenial owners. Auerbach said he never regretted not switching
jobs. He didn't say whether he would have moved to New York if he
had switched; it was because of a daughter's asthma, he said, that
he always commuted from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dislike New York,'' he said. ``And how can you not
like Boston, all that culture, the energy of the young people?''
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologist, Klein, who was born and raised in Buffalo,
has been in Boston for 20 years. He is the author of ``Baseball on
the Border: A Tale of Two Laredos'' (Princeton), among other books.
He said: ``I think the rivalry plays a larger role in Boston than
it does in New York. Bostonians feel that so much has been taken
from us. As a frame of reference, losing Babe Ruth to the Yankees,
the so-called Curse of the Bambino, is right on the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, I went to some interleague games at Fenway and I
was amazed at the loud-mouthed arrogance of some New York fans. We
would have beaten them up in Buffalo. Remarkably, nothing happened
in Boston. I don't think it was good manners. I think it was, and
this is sad, deference.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say that Boston has much to be deferential about.
Mookie Wilson's ground ball through Bill Buckner's legs. Bucky
(epithet deleted) Dent. The fact that long before the Dodgers and
the Giants left New York for California, the Braves quit Boston for
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   And the possibility that the real reason Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
endorsed Vice President Al Gore last week was because Bill Bradley
used to play for New York. &QL;

JAMES WALTER, 77, BELIEVER IN DO-IT-YOURSELF HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Del.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James W. Walter, the former chairman of Walter Industries, who
built a billion-dollar housing business and oversaw its subsequent
bankruptcy in the face of complaints by people who said they had
been injured by asbestos produced by a Walter subsidiary, died on
Thursday at his home in Tampa, Fla. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from lung cancer, said David
Townsend, a spokesman for the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, when Walter was a recently discharged sailor earning a
living in Tampa as a truck driver, he read a newspaper
advertisement for something described as a shell home, a
factory-built unfinished house, for $1,195.
</P>
<P>
   Believing he had found a bargain, he borrowed the money from a
local bank and bought one.
</P>
<P>
   So delighted was Walter with his purchase that he borrowed more
money from the bank to go into partnership with the shell-home
builder. In 1948, he bought out his partner. In 1955, he formed Jim
Walter Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the company offered 45 styles of shell homes and employed
530 three- to five-person crews of subcontractors who set up the
shell on the buyer's property.
</P>
<P>
   From that beginning, Walter guided the corporation to over $2.4
billion in annual revenue and 25,000 employees at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walter Corp. was acquired by an investment group led by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. for $2.4 billion in the 1980s. Two
years later the company became swamped with litigation from people
who said they had been injured by asbestos produced by a Walter
subsidiary, Celotex Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This asbestos was never used in Walter homes,'' Townsend said.
``Mr. Walter acquired the Celotex Corporation, and several other
building-related companies, as a means of growing the Jim Walter
Corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, and Kohlberg Kravis lost control of it.
</P>
<P>
   The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in March 1995 as
a new public company, Walter Industries, with 7,700 employees and
revenue of $1.3 billion. Walter retired seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   James Willis Walter was born on Sept. 18, 1922, in Lewes, Del.
As an infant he moved with his family to Florida, and he grew up
around Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Walter is survived by his wife, Connie Spoto Walter; two sons,
James Jr. and Robert, both of Tampa; a stepdaughter; and a
grandson.

SLOW GOING IN SHEPHERDSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change spelling of name to Haass in 1st graf of 2nd
take.) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ From hilltops in this pre-Civil War town
where Israel and Syria have negotiated all week, you can just make
out the farm across the Potomac River where Abraham Lincoln met
Gen. George B. McClellan in a tent and complained that he suffered
from ``the slows'' after the battle of Antietam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, traveling here almost daily to deal with a very
different conflict, Bill Clinton found himself struggling to cure
the same affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, his helicopter would land on a college baseball
field, and he would spend hours trying to get Israel's prime
minister, Ehud Barak, and Syria's foreign minister, Farouk
al-Sharaa, to begin hashing out the details of a deal whose rough
outlines have been obvious for years. And day after day he was
confronted by political posturing over what would be discussed
first, and who would be seen to make the first concessions, all
intended to make a convincing show half a world away that neither
side was willing to give in to a longtime enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, are
betting that this is just a phase in the multi-act performance of
peacemaking, and one that may now have run its course.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they handed Barak and al-Sharaa a seven-page
``working paper'' that the United States hopes will become the
basis for what in diplo-speak is called a ``core agreement''
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   It would lay out the rough boundaries of the land Israel will
surrender, 33 years after it seized the Golan Heights in the
Arab-Israeli war, and how the two sides would share scarce water
resources. And it would roughly define the kind of security
guarantees and steps toward normalized relations an ailing
President Hafez Assad of Syria would be willing to grant in return,
a delicate balancing act for a leader who realizes he can no longer
afford economic and diplomatic isolation, but fears that openness
could threaten the iron control over the country he wants to pass
to his son.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected that the talks that began here in this town of
1,300 would be resolved in a week. As the weekend began, diplomats
said that Barak and al-Sharaa would most likely leave on Sunday or
Monday to ponder the ``working paper'' for a few weeks before
resuming talks. And even then, it is still not clear if either side
is prepared to make the psychological and political leap required
for a deal that would give Israel at least a cold peace with its
immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is difficult stuff,'' Clinton said as he headed out to
Shepherdstown one more time last week, canceling other business in
Washington to stick with the talks. ``They are trying to imagine
the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he disappeared into the heavily guarded hotel, and a news
blackout that is intended to force the two reluctant negotiating
teams to go at it until they actually get something done.
</P>
<P>
   But the slowness of last week's progress, and the carefully
orchestrated, quite public delaying tactics, raise the question of
whether the now well-rehearsed technique of locking Israel and its
adversaries in a negotiating arena, cut off from other
distractions, still works as well as it once did.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in an age of cell phones and e-mail, there is no such
thing as real isolation. Each day, the Syrian delegation would call
the Syrian reporters camped out in a school gymnasium a mile away,
the Israeli delegation would call Israeli reporters, and Americans
would hold news conferences describing the day's efforts to keep
the two sides talking. Few details of actual negotiating positions
seeped out, but it is, as one negotiator said, ``a bit early for
strategic leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked, of course, at Camp David in 1978, during
the Israel-Egypt negotiations, and again at the Wye Plantation in
1998, where a framework for peace with the Palestinians was
hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   That model _ holding talks outside of Washington, but close
enough for President Clinton to fly in within 45 minutes to break
logjams _ is the logic of Shepherdstown. But it also seems as if
the negotiators have adapted to their environment and have learned
to resist some of the pressures that arise from talking endlessly
in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea of putting people into castles with moats, or
even small villages, has at best a marginal impact,'' concluded
Richard Haass, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who served on
the National Security Council under President Bush. ``Cell phones
and other technology leapfrog the barriers, of course,'' he said.
``And the issues don't get any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he noted, the issues and the negotiating positions
are so well aired that ``you could hold the whole thing in Dupont
Circle,'' just up the road from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the American mediators are still enamored of the Appalachian
approach, convinced that fresh air and no microphones is the only
real treatment for the slows. By design, it makes the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, the only real television
presence _ preventing the most public forms of grandstanding on the
evening news in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   And it showcases Clinton as the mediator, the only man both
sides will really trust, not a bad image for a leader spending his
last year in office seeking a firm niche in history.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insists that technology notwithstanding, moats still work.
``We do believe that developing a format that is isolated, and that
limits disclosure of each side's positions, focuses energy on the
hard job of real decisions,'' he said Friday. ``To do it without
this kind of isolation it is hard to imagine how any decision could
be made before it is preempted by somebody who doesn't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wye precedent,'' he said, ``showed that the
American-designed cocoon can and does work _ even though it won't
always work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are also betting that the Syrians, far more
isolated than most of the large Mideast players and a lot less
media savvy than Yasser Arafat, have yet to learn the art of spin.
And Barak's government, one diplomat involved in the talks said,
``is less public relations oriented'' than the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu, his predecessor. That may come to haunt Barak,
however, when he tries to sell any eventual deal to the Israeli
public, which would have to approve it in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the atmospherics of the talks may prove less
critical than the strategic calculations behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is betting that the moment for peace has arrived because
the political calculus has changed. Barak, unlike his predecessor,
clearly views the value of the Golan's buffer zone as a diminishing
defensive asset. Continuing to hold it promises continued troubles
in Syrian-controlled Lebanon, where he has vowed to withdraw
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   And with the right mix of early-warning systems, a reduced
Syrian troop presence on the border, new American weaponry and an
agreement to begin normalization of relations, Barak, a former
general, apparently believes he can give up the land without
damaging Israeli security. Selling that position to a public that
has come to view the Golan as the key to national survival,
however, is another matter. That is why he has insisted on talking
security first, and the return of the Golan second.
</P>
<P>
   Assad knows that he has little hope of retaking the Golan by
force. His military power is eroding, along with his economy.
Getting the Golan back in his lifetime would cement his place in
history, assuming he can do it on terms that do not undercut his
regime, or his son's succession. That is why he has insisted on
talking about land and water first, security and ``normal
diplomatic relations'' second.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether that logjam _ and with it the slows
_ is now broken. President Lincoln had to fire McClellan to get the
Army of the Potomac moving. That is not one of the choices open to
Clinton, who must take the generals and diplomats he is dealt.

ORANGEMEN RUN INTO NO PROBLEM ON ROAD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Going on the road for the first time this season did not
turn out to be such a problem for the Syracuse Orangemen Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After fashioning a 10-0 record in the friendly Carrier Dome, the
Orangemen were able to repel a Miami team hungry for
recognition,67-55, at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It took the senior forward Etan Thomas' block of a Mario Bland
jump shot late in the game to assure the Orangemen's victory. They
led by only five points at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we needed to win this game,'' coach Jim Boeheim
said. ``If we lost, all everybody would be writing is how we
couldn't handle playing on the road for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse has its top seven players returning from last season,
Boeheim pointed out, and that unit went 7-2 on the road in Big East
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a real good first half,'' Boeheim said, ``and in the
second half, our offense just went south. And we had too many
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse shot just 35.7 percent in the second half and had 21
turnovers for the game. But it built such a lead that Miami, now
8-6, could not recover. ``It looked like we forced them out of
their offense in the first half,'' Boeheim said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story in the second half, as Miami closed
once to within four points. Still, Damone Brown and Ryan Blackwell,
who tied Jason Hart for top scorer with 14 points each, contributed
mightily through the game's latter stages to help hold off the
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse outrebounded Miami, 39-36, and blocked more shots, 5-2,
including two by Thomas. Boeheim went to a spread offense more in
the second half, and he was not pleased with the results. ``It
should be good for us,'' he said. ``Maybe the more we use it, the
better we'll do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, the Big East's best defensive team thus far with
a 58.1-point average yield coming into the game, put a strong clamp
on Miami's scorers as Syracuse molded what appeared to be a
commanding 36-21 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami shot a paltry 8 for 34 from the field, a 23.5 percentage,
as Syracuse moved ahead 11-1 at the game's start and soon had a
15-4 edge. Hart helped the visitors early with a 3-pointer that
opened the game's scoring, another that staked them to a 7-1 lead
and then a driving layup that increased their margin to 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Syracuse turned the ball over in the next two
possessions _ on bad passes by Brown and guard Tony Bland _ the
Hurricanes could not penetrate its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami didn't get its first field goal until 6 minutes 49 seconds
into the game, and then it took a follow-up by Mario Bland after
Elton Tyler's jump shot had been altered by Syracuse's active
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes used four points by James Jones to draw within
16-11, but then Syracuse went on an eight-point run. The substitute
guard Preston Shumpert contributed two free throws and a layup,
while Blackwell had a 3-point play and then a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Blackwell was in the right spot when a rebound
deflected off Thomas' shoulder. He stuffed the ball for a 26-13
lead. The Orangemen's biggest lead of the half was 19 points, after
Hart's steal and layup made it 34-19 with 3:21 left. But then the
visitors went cold. Miami scored six of the half's last eight
points.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Syracuse's career blocks leader and top scorer this
season, had a quiet first half. He had four points, four rebounds
and no blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes climbed back in the game early in the second
half, with guard Johnny Hemsley, the team's stop scorer,
contributing eight points in the first 5 minutes. Hemsley, who came
in averaging 19 points a game, had been a miserable 1 for 9 in
field goal attempts in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hemsley didn't score until 13:38 into the game, his hot
hand early in the second half brought Miami to within 38-34.
Syracuse countered with field goals by Hart and Thomas, but the
hosts closed to within six, backed now by a wildly cheering crowd.
</P>

   The Orangemen quickly expanded their lead to nine, then after
two free throws by Miami made it 48-41, went on a nine-point run to

KARL STRAUCH, 77, WHO STUDIED UNIVERSE'S STRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Germany)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Strauch, a high-energy physicist who helped provide
insights into the fundamental structure of matter and energy, died
on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston. He was 77 and
lived in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He had Parkinson's disease, but the immediate cause was
pneumonia, said Harvard University, where Strauch formerly headed
the physics department.
</P>
<P>
   Strauch's research used giant accelerators smashing subatomic
particles together in search of the basic building blocks of the
universe. In the early 1970s his experiments produced hints of the
existence of the quark, a previously uncharted category of matter.
At the time, he was directing the Cambridge Electron Accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Strauch also took part in colliding-beam experiments at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva, known as CERN; the
Stanford Linear Accelerator, and the DESY laboratory in Hamburg,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Strauch was born in Giessen, Germany, and moved to the
United States in 1939. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1943 and served in the Navy
in World War II. He returned to Berkeley and received a doctorate
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to Harvard for advanced studies and joined the
faculty in 1953. He was named a professor in 1962, and from 1967 to
1974 directed the Cambridge accelerator. In 1975 he became the
George Vasmer Leverett professor of physics and from 1978 to 1982
he headed the physics department. He retired in 1993 with emeritus
status.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote nearly 150 scientific papers and was a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Strauch is survived by his wife of 49 years, Maria Gerson
Strauch; two sons, Roger of Piedmont, Calif., and Hans of Belmont,
Mass., and five grandchildren.

GORE ATTACKS BRADLEY ON AGRICULTURE VOTES AND MEDICARE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Setting aside the bitter sarcasm of their
previous encounters, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley Saturday made direct appeals to farmers and senior
citizens, two important voting segments in Iowa, in the first of
their series of debates to be held in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore prodded Bradley on several Senate votes that Gore said went
against the interest of agriculture, including those against
ethanol, crop insurance and price supports for farmers. Perhaps
most dramatically, Gore highlighted Bradley's vote against federal
disaster relief for farmers by singling out Chris Peterson, a
farmer in the audience, and describing the 1993 flooding of 300 of
his 400 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used the question to say that the nation needed real
leadership and a change in its agriculture policy. He noted that
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been criticized as being
bad for farmers, appointed an Iowa farm boy, Henry Wallace, as his
agriculture secretary, implying he would appoint someone of similar
stature in the farming community.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley later asked: ``Are you better off than you were seven
years ago, or do we need to take a step to change?'' The question
served the double purpose of evoking the insurgent spirit of Ronald
Reagan, who used the same thought against President Jimmy Carter in
1980, and highlighting the difficulties faced by farmers in an
otherwise booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also hammered Bradley on the subject of Medicare. He
faulted Bradley for not offering a proposal to bolster Medicare,
the government health-care program for the elderly, which is
expected to be insolvent by the year 2015. He also asserted that a
proposal by Bradley to expand Medicare's coverage of prescription
drugs would fall well short of helping low-income people. The
elderly represent the largest bloc of voters in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said of Bradley's lack of urgency about Medicare: ``It kind
of reminds me of the guy who fell out of the 10-story building and,
as he passed the fifth floor, he shouted, `Well, so far, so
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has invoked Roosevelt in recent weeks as an example
of a president who was able to enact several major programs at
once, said that because the federal surplus has continued to grow,
there would be enough money to establish universal health care and
to preserve Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do both,'' he said, repeating the phrase for
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates here under the auspices of Iowa
Public Television just 16 days before voters here attend their
caucuses and begin each party's selection of its presidential
candidates. Gore came into the encounter buoyed by the news
trumpeted in The Des Moines Register Saturday that Gore is leading
Bradley among likely voters here in a new Register poll, 54 percent
to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were coming off a particularly edgy debate
Wednesday, and Gore, for one, seemed decidedly determined to shuck
the label of combatant. He resisted opportunities to snipe back at
his opponent, though a couple of times he corrected Bradley and
repeated his message of the last week, that Bradley is too
theoretical and impractical for the rough world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's goal was to raise questions about Gore's leadership
qualities and to suggest that he, Bradley, would be the true agent
of change.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of revamping the campaign finance system, for
instance, he said, ``There is a question here, who's going to
mobilize and get this change? I have put it out there and talked
about it in every meeting I go to, because I believe the American
people have to take over here. I believe the American people, by
voting for me to give me the mandate, will overcome the special
interests in Washington.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He did not raise the matter of gays in the military. The matter
has dogged Gore since their Wednesday debate, when he suggested he
would apply a litmus test to any appointee to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff by requiring that appointee to agree with him that gays
should be allowed to serve openly in the military. Gore backpedaled
from his remarks on Friday, saying he did not mean to suggest that
he would conduct inquiries into the political views of his military
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, Gore responded to a remark by Bradley
in the previous debate, when he accused the vice president of
having a ``bunker mentality'' after having spent so many years in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start by telling you what we were doing in that
Washington bunker,'' Gore said. ``We created 20 million new jobs,
cut the welfare rolls in half, passed the toughest gun control in a
generation and created the strongest economy in the history of the
United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a fight to continue our future with prosperity,''
he continued. ``I want universal health care, dramatic improvements
in all of our schools and help for farmers. That's not a bunker;
those are the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his opening statement to remind his Iowa audience
that he was born and raised in a small Midwestern town in Missouri
just to the south. ``A lot of the small towns that I've gone
through and met people in Iowa remind me of that small town in
Missouri,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates were offered opportunities to ask each other
a question, and each used his time to hit at what he considered a
central weakness of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has run as an outsider, trying to capitalize on
anger toward President Clinton, asked Gore why so many fewer people
trusted government today.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began in a somewhat rambling way, saying that after college
``I thought politics would be the very last thing I ever did with
my life.'' But he was quickly able to find his footing by turning
the question around and re-issuing his challenge to Bradley to
replace campaign commercials with frequent debates. Bradley has
refused the challenge, arguing that he is less known than the vice
president and needs 30-second commercials to get his message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that
millionaire show, is that your final answer?'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied, ``I think there's another element too, and that
is candidates going out and telling people what they believe, not
thinking polls but telling people what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in a display of what he could accomplish in a 30-second
commercial, he said: ``And in 30 seconds, you can say a lot. I'm
for a woman's right to choose. I'm for affordable quality health
care accessible to all Americans. I'm for education improvement in
this country. I am for trying to make sure campaign finance reform
is a reality, that working families have a better chance to advance
and that we eliminate child poverty in this country. How's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Given his opportunity to ask Bradley a question, Gore asked a
member of the audience to stand and introduced Peterson, the owner
of a farm that had been devastated in floods in 1993. He then asked
Bradley why he voted in the Senate against a disaster relief bill
that would have helped Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sidestepped the question and instead criticized the
Clinton administration's farm policy, saying it had failed to stem
to closing of family farms. ``You know Al, I think that the premise
of your question is wrong,'' Bradley replied. ``This is not about
the past. This is about the future. This is about what we are going
to do to change the agriculture policy we've had over the last
eight to 10 years, during Republicans and Democrats.''

IMMIGRANT-LITERATURE-3 -- Writer Chang-rae Lee, 35, is a young
author who draws on his own experiences to overturn the classic
American tale of the immigrant's metamorphosis from outsider to
mainstream success. Henry Park, a Korean-American narrator in Lee's
1995 novel ``Native Speaker,'' is a master of disguise in both his
professional and personal lives. Speaking English is presented as
subversive and a method for dissimulation. (Richard Perry/The New

Woodruff, a 27-year-old disc jockey and record producer who came to
New York City from Georgia two years ago, with his Jack Russell
terrier, Robert, 4, has had trouble finding dog-friendly buildings
in Manhattan. Now he has spent four months searching for a place to
buy. ``There is such a low percentage of dog-friendly buildings,''
he says. ``It's a real pain.'' (Andrea Mohin/The New York Times)

Dr. Freeman is on a canine interview committee of the co-op board
of her building in Manahttan. The days of whines and noses may be
running out for dog owners hoping to buy a co-op apartment. After
decades of more or less benign acceptance, an increasing number of
buildings are changing their rules to no pets at all, and
particularly to no dogs. Even condominiums, long the bastion of
look-the-other-way boards, have tightened up their pet policies.

then to assimilate. The prototype was the title character of the

indefatigably earnest student of America who wrestled with the
English language and emerged from the tussle with his personality
astonishingly intact. (The New York Times)

<P>
   (NYT6) NEW YORK -- Jan. 8, 2000 -- IMMIGRANT-LITERATURE-1 -- Mei
Ng, 33, who grew up in Queens, explores the classic literary theme
of estrangement between immigrant parents and their children. Like
other writers of her generation she also expands it to take in
feelings of ethnic and racial alienation. ``Now I write about what
it means to be hyphenated, with one foot here in a place they
wouldn't have me,'' says Ng. ``America is a melting pot and all,
but people sometimes say in a fit of annoyance or anger, 'Go back
where you came from.' And I'm, like, OK, I'll go back to Queens.''

Brig. Gen. Bruce M. Lawlor, a one-star Army general, commander of
the Joint Task Force Civil Support, leads an operation that would
respond in the event of a germ or nuclear attack. In the event of
an attack, all of the military's resources, from helicopters and
cargo planes to fleets of trucks, could be used to haul emergency
supplies to devastated cities, but always under the authority of
civilians. Working with civilian agencies, the military would set
up whatever was needed, whether hospitals or decontamination units.

Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
conversion, was among the experts whose Congressional testimony in
March overestimated the degree of the world's dependence on
computers. Once adjustments were made for technology dependence,
some analysts say, the investment of the United States and other
pacesetters in year 2000 preparations was not that far out of line
with those that started late. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teddy Brenner, the longtime Madison Square Garden
matchmaker whose keen eye for appraising fighters was matched by
his clever ability to deal with their managers, died on Friday at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 82 and had been
suffering from Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Judith.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that carried him from the dusty, smoke-filled arenas
that used to dot the New York metropolitan area to Madison Square
Garden, Brenner had an unswerving question when he got fighters
together: Will the public like the fight and will it make a buck?
</P>
<P>
   Brenner's skill was in employing the boxing axiom that styles
make fights. But it wasn't always easy to bring them to fruition.
Fighters are nervous about their opponents, and fighters' managers
are suspicious that the other side is getting a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brenner was able to swing his most noted effort in 1971:
bringing together the unbeaten heavyweights Muhammad Ali and Joe
Frazier to the Garden in the first of their epic battles.
</P>
<P>
   Each wanted to be paid more than the other. Each had a manager
who wanted the upper hand: Ali's was Herbert Muhammad, a disciple
of Elijah Muhammad of the Temple of Islam; Frazier's managers were
Philadelphia business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner not only guaranteed each fighter $5 million but also
watched Frazier win one of the great battles, a 15-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Even for smaller purses, Brenner had trials. There was one
manager at Eastern Parkway Arena in Brooklyn who turned down every
opponent Brenner offered. Finally _ Brenner enjoyed telling the
story _ he went to the manager and gave him the names of three
possible opponents. What Brenner didn't tell the manager was that
they didn't exist. He made up the names to see if he could have a
starting point for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the first two you gave me,'' the manager told
Brenner, ``but I'll take the third guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner came to the sport as a shirt salesman. He was a fight
buff, though, and used to talk to the promoters _ the men who ran
the arenas or put up the money for fights _ about his ideal
matches. He was given his chance in a small arena in New Brunswick,
N.J., and then moved to Eastern Parkway, where he showcased Floyd
Patterson, the 1952 Olympic light-heavyweight champion. Under
Brenner, Eastern Parkway became known as the House of Upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner joined the Garden in 1959 and was the matchmaker for 14
years. He became head of the boxing department when Harry Markson
retired, and remained until 1978, when Sonny Werblin became the
Garden's president and teamed with Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Brenner had run-ins with promoters and managers
over what he interpreted as suggestions to fix fights. He detailed
many of these incidents in a book he wrote with Barney Nagler in
1981, ``When Only the Ring Was Square.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Brenner is survived by a son, Richard,
of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Marsha, of Berkeley, Calif.; a brother,
Albert, of Los Angeles; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his book Brenner told of being in Sonny Liston's dressing
room before his rematch with Muhammad Ali in 1965. Joe Louis was
visiting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Liston looked at the old champion and said, ``Joe, I don't feel
so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis replied: ``What do you mean, you don't feel so good? You
gonna win.''
</P>
<P>
   Liston looked down, according to Brenner, and then raised his
head and said, ``Just ain't right, Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Liston was knocked out in the first round by what came to be
known as a phantom punch.

IMMIGRANT-LITERATURE-3 -- Writer Chang-rae Lee, 35, is a young
author who draws on his own experiences to overturn the classic
American tale of the immigrant's metamorphosis from outsider to
mainstream success. Henry Park, a Korean-American narrator in Lee's
1995 novel ``Native Speaker,'' is a master of disguise in both his
professional and personal lives. Speaking English is presented as
subversive and a method for dissimulation. (Richard Perry/The New

particularly to no dogs. Even condominiums, long the bastion of

other writers of her generation she also expands it to take in
feelings of ethnic and racial alienation. ``Now I write about what
it means to be hyphenated, with one foot here in a place they

JAMES WETMORE, 84, EPISCOPAL SUFFRAGAN BISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., R.I., Canada)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bishop James Stuart Wetmore, the longest-serving
suffragan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York and a staunch
advocate of ecumenism, died Dec. 28 at the Lutheran Care Center in
Poughkeepsie. A resident of Millbrook, he was 84.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a long illness, the diocesan office at the Cathedral
Church of St. John the Divine reported.
</P>
<P>
   Elected by a diocesan convention of priests and laity, he served
as the bishop's principal aide from 1960 until his retirement in
1987. His duties as suffragan were whatever the head of the New
York diocese assigned him, and Wetmore's most visible presence was
in the Episcopal efforts toward cooperation with other churches and
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in 1968, he became the first non-Catholic to preach from
the pulpit of St. Patrick's Cathedral, seat of the Roman Catholic
archbishop of New York. He served as chairman of the diocesan
Ecumenical Commission from 1969 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He headed the group that founded the Council of the Churches of
the City of New York in 1960 and served as a council director from
1962 until his death. He was a past president of the Episcopal
Housing Corp. and vice president of the Seamen's Church Institute,
and until his death he was president of St. Peter's School in
Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hampton, New Brunswick, Canada, he graduated in 1938
from Kings College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he received a
licentiate in theology the following year. He was ordained a deacon
in 1938 and a priest in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York in 1953 to direct the Department of
Christian Education of the Diocese of New York. He held the
director's post until his election as bishop suffragan.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the North American section of Christian education
for the World Council of Churches from 1954 to 1964. In the 1960s
he also was a trustee of St. Hilda and St. Hugh's School in
Morningside Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Wetmore is survived by his wife of 59 years, Francis Howard
Robinson Wetmore; three daughters, Nancy Faulds of Putnam Valley,
Mary Bohun of Cortland Manor and Jane Robin Gulotta of New Paltz;
two sons, Charles of Bethlehem, Pa., and Stuart of Warwick, R.I.;
11 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Stamboulidis, a retired textile executive who
was active in the Greek-American community, died Thursday at New
York Hospital. He was 70 and lived in Whitestone, N.Y., in Queens
County. The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1990 as director of administration and market
research of Westpoint Peperell, now Stevens Peperell, after 38
years in the textile business.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Piraeus, Greece, he came to the United States in
1949 as a member of the Greek air force engaged in the transfer of
U.S. planes to Greece under the Marshall Plan. Stamboulidis was
active in the American Hellenic Educational and Progressive
Association and other civic and Greek Orthodox organizations. He
served repeatedly as chairman of the annual Greek Independence Day
parade in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis is survived by his wife of 46 years, Sophia
Nicholas Stamboulidis; a daughter, Elizabeth Simadis, and two sons,
Ted Stamas and George Stamboulidis, all of Queens; a sister, Marika
Apostolidis of Piraeus; and seven grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the Democratic presidential debate
Saturday in Johnston, Iowa, involving Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, as recorded by The New York
Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Genetically engineered products meet heavy resistance in the
West _ in European countries and in Japan. ... What can we do
today?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: I think the most important thing we can do is to use
our authority under the World Trade Organization in order to
petition to get access to markets. When, for example, Europe
blocked our beef because of beef hormones, we went to the WTO. We
farmed a dispute settlement mechanism, we presented our case and
they ruled in our favor. ...
</P>
<P>
   But we all know that the problem of agriculture in this country
is serious. In Iowa, it's dead serious. I've talked to thousands of
family farmers over the last year. And it means we have to change
policy.
</P>
<P>
   It means we have to get the antitrust division to get after
these large packers that are discriminating against family farmers.
It means that we have to have a conservation reserve program
expanded. It means that we have to provide income supplements to
farmers based upon the relationship between price and their costs
and it has to go to them with a cap so it only goes to family
farmers and not to big corporate farmers. ...
</P>
<P>
   GORE: The question is about genetically modified organisms, and
you know the key point is we can't let Europe and Japan determine
our farm policy. The decisions ... really ought to be based on
sound science, not science controlled by people working for the
companies that profit from these new technologies, but neutral
dispassionate experts who will give us the best and most accurate
conclusions about their safety. If they're safe and if they enhance
productivity at no risk, then we ought to be able to use them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now of course, we have got to also address these other issues,
including it's time to get rid of almost all of the so-called
freedom to farm act, because it's been the freedom to fail and it's
not working. ...
</P>
<P>
   Let me introduce a friend of mine to you. Chris Peterson is
here. Could you stand up Chris? Chris is a farmer. ... Back in
1993, 300 of his 400 acres were flooded out. ... Why did you vote
against the disaster relief for Chris Peterson when he and
thousands of other farmers here in Iowa needed it after those '93
floods? ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: This is not about the past. This is about the future.
This is about what we're going to do to change the agriculture
policy we've had the last eight, 10 years, during Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The family farmers that I've talked to in this state, who are
the backbone of this agricultural economy, have had no real help.
Freedom to farm failed. There was supposed to be a safety net; the
administration said they were going to put a safety net in and the
first year after it passed, no safety net whatsoever. The reality
is that we need to have a change in agriculture policy. ...
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the suggestions that I've made for a change in
agricultural policy aim to dramatically improve the circumstance
for small family farms in this country. So you can talk about the
past, but I prefer to talk about the future. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: If elected president, what would you do that would result in
improved learning for all students in public school classrooms?
Senator?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: Well, first of all, what I would do is look at
education a little more broadly. I think we should have a strong
federal commitment to education. I think it should begin at birth
and extend for lifetime and be available for everyone. So I think
we need a major investment in early education and early child care.
I would get kids ready to learn by doubling the slots in Head
Start.
</P>
<P>
   I would then propose adding 600,000 great new teachers to the
public schools of this country over the next decade. I would
increase dramatically the number of after-school programs that are
available to children in this country between the hours of 3:00 and
8:00, which is when most of the juvenile crime takes place.
</P>
<P>
   But I think there are other things, too, that are relevant to
education. I think when a child arrives at the first grade and
hasn't had any health care and is sick, a good health care
insurance is education policy as well. I think last year when
800,000 kids took a gun to school that sensible gun control is good
education policy as well.
</P>
<P>
   So you can look at education in terms of where people live their
lives, and that's the way I look at it, or you can look at it as if
it's some bureaucratic box that says education that's unrelated to
everything else we do in our lives. I think it's a different
perspective on how we view education in this country. I have the
perspective of life and I think the vice president has the
perspective that it's a box called education.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. Vice President?
</P>
<P>
   GORE: Well, you're right that I've made it my top priority for
investing in the future. And I'm proud to have the support of the
Iowa teachers for this plan and for my candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I came here to Iowa ... and presented a comprehensive
plan for education reform. And here's what it has. It has a plan to
turn around every failing school, a proposal that is not in Senator
Bradley's proposal. ...
</P>
<P>
   It will reduce the size of each class so that teachers have more
one-on-one time to spend with their students. It is designed to
provide universal preschool all across the United States for every
child and every family all across our nation. It is designed to put
new resources, not just technical assistance for the community
college buildings, but new resources in the form of a national
tuition savings plan and a 401-J for lifelong learning to pay the
tuition for those who want to go to college and their families
don't have the income. ...
</P>
<P>
   And finally, I want to connect every classroom and library to
the Internet and give the teachers they need in the new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY: You know, when I was growing up in that small town in
Missouri, I went to public school: public grade school, public high
school. My mother was a public school teacher, my aunt was a public
school teacher. I'm committed to public education.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing that we can do to improve public
education in this country in the next decade is to make sure that
there's a great teacher in every classroom. We have to be focused
in order to achieve these things. We can spread our interest over
the horizon, but if we're focused, we can get a great new teacher
in every public school classroom in this country and that is what's
important.

 &HT;    Confederate flag supporters wage war in S.C.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Confederate flag supporters declared political
war Saturday on both the NAACP and South Carolina legislators who
back the group's campaign to remove the divisive banner from atop
the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If any House or Senate members vote to bring down this flag,
will you work to destroy them?'' yelled Ron Wilson, lieutenant
commander in chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes!'' shouted back several thousand flag-wavers, crowding the
Statehouse grounds against the backdrop of a huge Confederate flag
flowing down the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, the South
Carolina Heritage Commission and other groups announced plans for a
lobbying campaign aimed at pressuring state legislators to keep the
flag ''flying permanently'' over the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed ''Keep it Flying'' political action committee
will rally support with statewide commercials, field director Jim
Freeman said. It also will campaign for sympathetic candidates in
state elections.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts aim to counteract the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People's tourism boycott of South Carolina
and its threat to impose other economic sanctions against the state
until legislators vote to remove the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Five miles away from Saturday's rally, officials with the state
NAACP planned a parade and rally scheduled for Martin Luther King
Jr. Day on Jan. 17. The officials discussed intensifying the
group's sanctions aimed at pressuring
</P>
<P>
   legislators to vote to remove the flag, but they weren't
prepared to announce further steps, said state NAACP executive
director Dwight James.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a clear right side in this debate,'' said James,
reiterating the NAACP's view that the Rebel flag is an insulting
symbol of slavery. ''I clearly believe the flag has no legitimate
place on the Statehouse grounds.'' In Saturday's chill, the flag
dominated the grounds. Thousands fluttered in the breeze, flying
atop poles that supporters hoisted and waved when speakers defended
the flag as honoring the 26,000 Confederates who died fighting for
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by Confederate banners and bumper stickers and the
banner emblazoned on hats, shirts, belts and socks, flag supporters
relished attacking their foes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you they picked the wrong state this time,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for legislators who side with flag opponents, Wilson said,
''We will take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly convenes Tuesday, with wrangling over
whether to move the flag threatening to overshadow other business,
House and Senate leaders have warned.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Carolina's flag supporters have been gathering
momentum in recent years, claiming partial credit for Gov. David
Beasley's surprising defeat in 1998, this weekend's rally is the
biggest show of force yet in defense of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The rectangular Union Jack, a red flag with a blue X studded
with white stars, has flown atop the Capitol since 1962, when
legislators raised it as part of the Civil War centennial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to stay right there; it ought to stay right
there,'' said Conrad Mizzell, 49, of Marietta, Ga., wearing a black
feather in his gray cap. ''It is a living monument of the boys who
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Confederate monuments, the Statehouse has become a
symbolic setting for the latest showdown over the Rebel banner. Its
granite walls are still marred by Union shells fired in 1864.
Occupying Columbia, Gen. William Sherman's troops burned the
building.
</P>
<P>
   But it survived, and 136 years later it is the last Statehouse
in the South to fly the Confederate flag. The state flags of
Georgia and Mississippi incorporate the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Flag supporters gathered in Columbia warned that, if it falls in
South Carolina, opponents will target the Georgia and Mississippi
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this can only steamroll into something else,'' said
Stan Dilcher, 39, of Marietta. He was one of several hundred
Georgians who traveled to Columbia for what many view as a pivotal
defense of Confederate history, which they claim has been unfairly
labeled as racist for the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Confederate flag comes down, the truth of Confederate
history will be lost to political correctness,'' said the Rev.
Bobby Eubanks, presenting a statement from ministers defending as
''noble Christians'' Confederate officers such as Gen. Robert E.
Lee and Stonewall Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ''May the South rise again to tell the truth ...'' Eubanks
shouted as the crowd drowned him out.
</P>
<P>
   Many among the estimated 6,000 flag supporters wore uniforms of
Confederate gray. Women wore hoop skirts, some in black mourning
dresses, and children wore bonnets and floppy hats.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration started at Elmwood Cemetery, where a regimental
band from Georgia played ''Dixie'' following a roll call of the
Confederate dead buried on a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Gray smoke rose from musket fire, starting the mile-long march
through downtown Columbia to the Capitol lawn, a river of red,
white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the rear, marchers cut loose with high-pitched
Rebel yells, which others repeated all the way to the front of the
parade. As they neared the tall granite monument honoring the
Confederate dead, on the Capitol grounds, the singing of ''Dixie''
and other songs grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   Several black people who watched the parade defended the group's
right to assemble, but they disagreed with their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've still got people, no matter how much they smile at you,
who hate black people,'' said Janice Hallman, 38, standing on Main
Street with her 3-year-old son, Michael. ''If you went to their
house, right now, they'd probably tell you to go through the back
door.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Old South is gone; it is not coming back,'' said David
Smith, 49. ''This is the last symbol of the Old South. Until it
comes down, we will not go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding a hand-drawn sign reading ''Worship God! Not Flag,'' the
Rev. Louis Rivers, 46, said, ''I think we are spending too much
time on this flag, both black and white, and not enough on the
moral issues on which this country was founded.''

 &HT;    Marino: `I'm not done'
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A football institution will call it quits today.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Kingdome, not Dan Marino. The Seahawks'
stadium will close its doors if Seattle loses, but the Miami
quarterback has given no indication that his career will end with
the Dolphins' season.
</P>
<P>
   As critics clamor for the 38-year-old Marino to be benched in
the first round of the AFC playoffs, coach Jimmy Johnson has said
Dan's the man. That's quite an endorsement, because their
relationship, which was already strained, has worsened with
Marino's declining performance on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is our starting quarterback,'' Johnson said. ``Let's put
the soap opera on the back burner for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   But it still simmers. It seems fairly certain that either Marino
or Johnson will be with Miami next year, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that last week would be Marino's last, Dolphins
owner Wayne Huizenga flew Marino's family to Washington in a
private jet. Miami lost 21-10 for a 9-7 record but already knew it
would be in the playoffs because Seattle lost earlier in the day.
The owner has said he wants to be involved in any management
decision about Marino, who is immensely popular with Miami fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, when the season's over, I see what's gone
on in the year and how I feel,'' said Marino, the NFL's all-time
leading passer who went over the 60,000-yard mark this season.
``Right now my focus is more on, `Let's go to Seattle and win this
game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marino bristles at retirement talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been answering this question, and I'm tired of answering
it,'' said Marino, who missed five weeks with a pinched nerve in
his neck and has a 1-5 record since returning at Thanksgiving.
``You never know when your last game is going to be. ... Who knows
what the future holds?''
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas, Marino let off some steam, and some people
read between the lines that he wanted an 18th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not done,'' Marino said. ``The people who know football
understand that. This is my job, and I take great pride in what I
do. To hear people say I'm finished, well, I don't let that kind of
criticism bother me. I'm past that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino will take a pared-down offense into today's game, hoping
to cut down on turnovers. He has thrown 17 interceptions this year
and only 12 touchdown passes. Marino's decision-making has been
questioned as often as his arm strength, which was affected by the
pinched nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh native has looked mechanical while his
quarterback rating plummeted to 69.1, second-worst among starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the things Dan is most comfortable using, and
that's what we're going to concentrate on,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   What Miami needs is a solid running game, which has been
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running game has been a problem for the Miami Dolphins for
20 years,'' Johnson said. ``It's not like it's all of a sudden
cropped up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, Marino could carry the team. The future Hall of
Famer's biography and stats fill 47 pages of the Dolphins media
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was injured, he was the AFC player of the week in the
first and fifth weeks of the season. He took himself out of the
Oct. 17 game against New England in the first quarter because he
didn't have enough strength in his throwing arm. The weakness
resulted from the pinched nerve the week before at Indianapolis,
when he led the team to a last-minute victory.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Damon Huard came in against the Patriots to engineer a
31-30 victory, then helped the Dolphins win four of their next five
games. When Marino returned against Dallas, he threw five
interceptions in a 20-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably rushed Dan back into the lineup,'' Johnson said.
``He was rusty, so we turned the ball over a bunch, even though we
played pretty good defense. We lost the next game against (the
Colts), and since that time our confidence has been shaken, and
that's really been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that despite Huard's success, ``I think it's best
for us to go with Dan right now. I think Dan is our best chance to
win. I would anticipate that we would stay with him throughout the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He played down talk of a feud, in which they supposedly barely
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan and I have a great relationship,'' Johnson said. ``We have
respect for each other. We keep getting questions about our
relationship. I don't think that has affected either one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino said ``The press made a much bigger deal out of
everything than there really is. I've said all along (that) Coach
Johnson is the head coach of the team and I'm the quarterback. I
have to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   And after nine operations, two bad knees and some pain remaining
in his neck, he still thinks that he can get the job done. If
Marino wins one more game, he ties John Elway for most games won in
a career with 148.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my consistency factor over 17 years,'' said
Marino, who in June signed a two-year extension through 2001. ``The
games I've started, the team was able to rely on me every week. I
felt like I always played my position at a very high level. What's
disappointing is not being able to win a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   As the father of five prepares for his 17th playoff game in his
17th season, he said he just wants to take advantage of the chance
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Marino said, ``when it might be your last
opportunity.''

 &HT;    Vikings focused on Cowboys first
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pictures of a team in despair remain imbedded in
the minds of the Minnesota Vikings. The most lucent might be
Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   After Morten Andersen kicked the overtime field goal in the
Metrodome to win the NFC Championship, the Falcons hysterically
celebrated their berth in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, on his knees, pounded the turf with both hands, just
as Moses did in ``The Ten Commandments'' after his trooops drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Such images, the Vikings insist, serve as motivation as they
begin their quest to make amends for last year's devastating
failure. Redemption starts this afternoon against the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more focused this year than last year,'' receiver Randy
Moss said. ``When Atlanta came in here, there was a lot of hype
being talked, and even though we didn't say it, I think we bought
into the hype. Guys talking about what we're going to do when we
get to Miami, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No such discussions have taken place among the Vikings this
time. When the Falcons brought Minnesota to its knees, the Vikings
learned a painful lesson about overconfidence. Sufficiently
humbled, their outlook is specfic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Moss said, ``we're just talking about, `Let's get to
the Super Bowl.' We're not talking about how we're going to get
there, where we're going to party, we're going to do this or we're
going to do that. We're just talking about going through the
playoffs and just win and hope we go to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they do not have the best record in the NFC, as they
did last year, the Vikings consider themselves the class of the
conference. Cunningham has been replaced by former Falcon Jeff
George, and Minnesota has responded with eight wins in its past 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   The offense is not as explosive as the record-setting unit of
last season, but it remains one of the most feared in the NFL. And
so, Moss, for one, believes the Vikings' promise is limitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be 16-0,'' the brash receiver said. ``We can't
really be satisfied with what we've done so far. Everybody's goal
is the Super Bowl. Simple as that. If we don't get there, it'll
just be a big disappointment for the second year in a row. But if
we get there, we'll make a lot of things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham could not make it happen for the Minnesota offense as
he did in 1998, but George has. George waited patiently and,
significantly, without disruption. When coach Dennis Green pulled
the plug on Cunningham, George injected some power into a
high-voltage unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're peaking at the right time,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not mean they've reached maximum efficiency. Moss
said last year's loss prevents any contentment. The Vikings have
the physical talent to prevail. Defensively, John Randle moved back
to defensive tackle and has solidified that unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some things we have to work on,'' veteran Chirs
Doleman said. ``We're not a complete package. But guys have been
working hard. Right now, it's just starting to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year, it's more about the way they approach the
prospects than anything else, according to Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as our momentum and the desire and being hungry to go
out there and fight for a championship, I don't think we're there
yet,'' Moss said. ``It's about how bad we want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss said he wants it so much that he'll take the responsibility
as the team's leader. It's very likely that the Cowboys' Deion
Sanders will defend against him today in a highly anticipated
glamour matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm prepared for it,'' said Moss, who had a
team-record 1,413 yards this season. ``Hopefully, they'll continue
to ride my shoulders all the way to the Super Bowl, man. I think
I'm just going to have to take that challenge and meet it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge could be George's. His playoff experience
is nominal, and his reputation for having blow-up games is
solidified. That's why it's important for the Vikings to establish
a sound running game with Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to run is something you have to do in the
playoffs,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings do as they believe they should, and run to the
Super Bowl, George returns to Atlanta as something many Falcon fans
thought he never would be: a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better scenario,'' he said.

 &HT;    Several key calls go against Buffalo
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The NFL brought back instant replay this
season so officials wouldn't blow critical plays in big games.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't get any bigger than the playoffs, but officials
may have dropped the ball in Saturday's AFC wild-card game at
Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kevin Dyson's disputed 75-yard kickoff return, which
lifted the Titans to a 22-16 victory against the Bills, there also
were two other controversial plays.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bills trailing 9-0 late in the second quarter, Buffalo
quarterback Rob Johnson appeared to complete a long pass to rookie
Peerless Price down the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   But line judge Byron Boston ruled that Price bobbled the ball
before falling out of bounds. Boston, father of Arizona Cardinals
receiver David Boston, is the official who was accused of nepotism
earlier this season by Washington receiver Michael Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   This call didn't help the Cardinals, but it certainly hurt the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays appeared to show that Price made the catch,
which would have given Buffalo a first down in Titans' territory
with 1:53 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But because Boston said Price bobbled the ball, replay official
Bob Boylston wasn't allowed to review the play under replay rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, they wouldn't even review Peerless'
catch,'' Johnson said. ``He caught that ball, but I really can't
say where he was at.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were forced to punt, giving the Titans possession at
their 22-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth play of the drive, Tennessee faced third-and-10 at
its 33. Titans quarterback Steve McNair faked a handoff and ran
around right end, gaining 9 yards before he was pulled down by
safety Henry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ruled that McNair was less than 1 yard short of a
first down. But after a replay delay of more than five minutes, the
ball was moved up a few inches, giving Tennessee a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Six plays later, the Titans took a 12-0 lead on Al Del Greco's
40-yard field goal as time expired in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why the system doesn't work,'' Bills general manager
John Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   SHOELESS JOHNSON
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo was forced to line up for Steve Christie's 41-yard field
goal with 16 seconds left, instead of taking a couple of shots at
the end zone. Christie made the kick, which gave the Bills a 16-15
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays earlier, Buffalo had first-and-10 at the Tennessee 35.
Johnson ran around left end for a 3-yard gain, but Titans defensive
tackle John Thornton pulled off the quarterback's right shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were out of timeouts, so Johnson didn't have enough
time to put the shoe back on. On second down, Johnson completed a
9-yard pass to Price for a first down _ while wearing only one
shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any timeouts. Our quarterback didn't have a
shoe,'' Bills coach Wade Phillips said. ``We decided we need to go
ahead and kick the field goal because we had a chance to win the
game. I didn't want to risk him slipping or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   REED'S FAREWELL?
</P>
<P>
   Bills receiver Andre Reed, who criticized the team and
quarterback Doug Flutie last week, finished the game without a
catch. Reed has been critical of his lack of involvement on offense
this season, his 15th with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to come back here next year,'' Reed said. ``I don't
know if that's going to happen. Right now, I don't know whether I'm
a part of this team in the future. It sure didn't look like it
today.''

DEFEAT TODAY WOULD LEAVE BLAME SQUARELY WITH GAILEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chan Gailey has heard no glowing endorsements lately from the
owner. Gailey doesn't know about his job security status after
today.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Cowboys lose, even as a seven-point 'dog to the
Minnesota Vikings, and Jerry Jones' verdict could follow a natural
course, based on already a disappointing 8-8 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gailey think about his neck being on the line today? That
the wild-card round of the playoffs could push him into the
coaching no-no land of the fired?
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it ever enter my mind? Sure,'' answered Gailey. ``But is
it anything more than a passing thought? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm dwelling on that, then I'm not preparing properly for
Minnesota. I would never allow that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gailey, you can believe every word of the above. He is,
without question, the good soldier, the good company man, the
zoned-in-tuned-out-on-distractions kind of coach that every
football boss will kill for.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey does not put his private thoughts _ pro or con _ on the
street. Nor does he put ``any'' company business on the street.
Gailey is not nearly as boring as his public perception _ what he
says to the media is exactly what he wants you to know about the
Cowboys or about Chan Gailey. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes Gailey the perfect coach to work under the
large shadow Jones want to cast. Except ...
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't there. Gailey's offensive philosophy has come
under question, and rightfully so. He was hired two years ago to
put points on the board. Then there's the seasonlong disaster with
penalties. It has been a team consumed by yellow hankies. This is a
direct reflection on the head coach. So is the 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the public criticism of Gailey has reached the
immense stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you don't hear it and it doesn't affect you a little
bit would be a lie,'' he replied. ``But again, if I let it get to
me personally, then it impacts my job. My responsibility is to not
get caught up in the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching the Cowboys may be the hardest job in sports. The
spotlight is large and the expectations can be unreasonable, based
on the talent available. For example, some of the same media types
who in August were writing off the Cowboys as a .500 team are now
calling for Gailey's head. With a .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is certainly among those who allows expectations to exceed
football reality. But what owner doesn't? Jones, however, has gone
public lately with a demand from Gailey for a change in offensive
philosophy, an indication the owner was blaming the coach. And also
an indication the owner is now meddling in football.
</P>
<P>
   Voices inside Valley Ranch say Gailey brought this meddling on
himself with an unwillingness to listen to offensive coaching staff
members who suggested ideas different from the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard-headed'' is the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of truth to that,'' said Gailey,
``but also some untruth. I believe in listening, and in using new
ideas as long as they stay with the parameters of the base offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if those ideas get too far out there, then you would be
changing everything, including blocking schemes. I don't think you
can go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, quarterback Troy Aikman has a strong
presence in all things having to do with the Cowboys' offense.
There have been constant theories from many, including Fox analyst
Terry Bradshaw, that the Gailey offense is not best-suited for
Aikman's talents.
</P>
<P>
   To shorten a long football explanation, Aikman is considered an
aggressive, go-right-after-a-defense kind of quarterback, using
downfield slant patterns and 15- to 20-yard ``outs.'' Gailey's
offense is more about deception, or ``trick 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Gailey disgrees with that definition of his
offensive system. But while many have blamed Aikman's troubles this
season on his distrust of young receivers, that may be untrue.
Could it be he is struggling with the Gailey offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy and I have talked about it, and shared ideas,'' said
Gailey. ``But there hasn't been any indication of a strong
displeasure on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman agrees with that, or at least he does in talking to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Jones hired Gailey two years ago after Jones
said he had carefully studied the offensive system Gailey would
bring to Dallas. Jerry called this offense a perfect fit for
Aikman. If it's not, then blame Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, if there's a loss today to the Vikings, Jerry's
blame will point elsewhere. Like right to Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   What about the notion Gailey already has made up his mind to
resign after this season, no matter what happens today in
Minnesota?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that will cross your mind, but I'd
never do it,'' he said. ``I'm not going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   So does it come down to win or be fired? Maybe. Probably. Stay
tuned.

 &HT;    Disputed play lifts Titans in a stunner
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ So much for the Immaculate Reception.
</P>
<P>
   Titans receiver Kevin Dyson's 75-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown, which stunned the Buffalo Bills 22-16 in Saturday's AFC
wild-card game, may be remembered as the most disputed play in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   Just call it the Immaculate Deception.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, a late substitute on the play, caught a lateral pass from
tight end Frank Wycheck, then ran down the left sideline behind a
wall of blockers, reaching the end zone for the game-winning score
with only three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in miracles,'' Titans safety Blaine Bishop said.
``This is something special. It is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory sends Tennessee into next week's divisional
playoffs. If Seattle beats Miami in today's other AFC wild-card
game, the Titans will travel to Jacksonville. If the Dolphins win,
the Titans will play at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   It took a miracle _ and inconclusive video evidence _ to keep
Tennessee alive in the march to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't in the hands of the officials,'' Titans coach Jeff
Fisher said. ``It was higher up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a few anxious moments, replay official Bob Boylston,
who sits above the field in the instant-replay booth, was deciding
the outcome of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Boylston and referee Phil Luckett reviewed Dyson's return,
questioning whether Wycheck's throw was a lateral. If Wycheck's
pass was thrown forward, it was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But when Luckett returned to the field from behind the Titans'
bench, he announced the throw was legal, sending the record crowd
of 66,782 fans into delirium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line judge's initial ruling was that it was not a forward
pass,'' Luckett said. ``We went to the instant replay. Taking from
where the pass left (Wycheck's) hand right on that yard line, the
receiver catches it right there on that yard line. It did not
appear to be a forward pass, therefore it is not a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bills were crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope those referees that called this game never work another
one,'' Buffalo linebacker Gabe Northern said, ``because they'll do
something like that to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Buffalo defensive end Marcellus Wiley: ``If I was sitting
in the Titans locker room, I'd by saying I'm lucky. It's one thing
to be opportunistic and fortunate, but that was just given to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, which had trailed the entire game, took a 16-15 lead on
kicker Steve Christie's 41-yard field goal with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Titans fullback Lorenzo Neal fielded the ensuing kickoff in a
group of Tennessee players and then handed the ball off to Wycheck
near the 25-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck took two steps, then threw the ball toward the left
sideline to Dyson, who took a step back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked to perfection,'' Wycheck said of the play, called
``Home Run Throwback.'' ``It was like being a little kid again,
drawing something up in the dirt and then going out and doing it,''
Wycheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, a second-year pro from Utah, was near the 25-yard line
when Wycheck threw. Whether he was in front of or behind the line
will be debated forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Frank catch the ball,'' Dyson said. ``I wasn't supposed
to catch the lateral. It was supposed to be (receiver Isaac Byrd).
I made sure I got behind (Wycheck). I took one hard step out to
make sure it was a lateral. I was sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The play recalled another memorable playoff play in 1972.
Pittsburgh defeated Oakland in the first round when Franco Harris
caught a deflected pass from Terry Bradshaw for the decisive
touchdown in the final seconds. It went down in NFL history as the
Immaculate Reception.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first touchdown on a kickoff return for the Titans
since 1988, when they were the Houston Oilers, and the first
kickoff return ever for Dyson, who was replacing two other players
slated for that job on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Christie said. ``I can't believe it. They had a
wall of blockers, and I knew I couldn't get to him. When I saw
that, my heart started to sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was no way anyone was going to get him.''

MCCAIN DEALS WITH CRITICS BY RELEASING LETTERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona released hundreds of
letters on Saturday that he has sent to federal agencies under the
jurisdiction of his powerful Senate committee, including more than
a dozen involving the businesses of contributors to his campaign
for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was acting to defuse criticism of his
interventions before the Federal Communications Commission on
behalf of companies regulated by that agency, one of many
supervised by the Commerce Committee, which he has headed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer volume, the release of more than two years of committee
correspondence was both a remarkable display of openness and an
effort to show that there was nothing unusual in what McCain has
done by writing to agencies that regulate the companies whose
employees have supported his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people view them in their entirety, they will see that I
have acted on one fundamental principle, to protect the consumer,''
the senator said on Saturday while on a campaign swing through
South Carolina. ``The overwhelming majority of these communications
are: `Please act, please act.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's actions have drawn attention because he has made
campaign finance reform a centerpiece of his presidential bid. He
had to defend his actions at length in televised presidential
debates in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on Saturday whether the disclosures had thrown him
off stride, he said, ``The key to a successful campaign is not to
let it.'' He added: ``Don't get defensive, don't let it divert
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents McCain released on Saturday were 15 letters,
identified by his staff as having been sent to regulators, that
mentioned or sought help for companies or individuals who had
contributed more than $2,000 to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were letters to the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, and had already been released to The New
York Times by the commission under a Freedom of Information Act
request.
</P>
<P>
   The screening of the documents by his staff may have omitted
instances in which people employed by the affected companies
contributed less than $2,000, or contributed to his Senate
campaigns. Also, it is sometimes difficult to connect contributions
by lobbyists or lawyers to the companies they represent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the letters where the staff identified
connections with donors, the staff of the Commerce Committee
released about 500 other letters and correspondence to agencies on
behalf of constituents and others who had either given less than
$2,000 or had not given McCain any money.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his effort to further disclose any of his attempts to
intervene with regulators, McCain also plans to ask government
agencies on Monday to release all the letters he has written to
them since he entered Congress in 1983, his staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that the senator, who is often
described as a political maverick, has responded to criticism with
a torrent of documents. Not long ago, he released hundreds of pages
of medical records, including psychological evaluations done during
his military service and after his release from a prisoner of war
camp in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's disclosures on Saturday were designed to address
inquiries about the matter that began recently when it was reported
that he had written letters to the Federal Communications
Commission in November and again in December seeking a speedy vote
on a complex swap of television station licenses in Pittsburgh that
would enable the company of a McCain contributor to buy one of the
stations in the only big market where it lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sent the letters after he and his aides had met with and
received more than $20,000 in contributions from executives for the
company, Paxson Communications, and lobbyists. The head of the
company, Lowell Paxson, had also lent McCain his corporate jet four
times last year for campaign travel.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that he did nothing wrong in the Paxson case,
but the question has taken on additional importance in the
presidential campaign in large part because the senator has made
cleaning up the corrosive influence of campaign donations such a
key issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain's willingness to intervene with regulators
on licensing and other technical issues that relate to pending
deals for specific companies, rather than limiting himself to
broader policy matters, has prompted criticism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain seems somewhat vulnerable on that score, as his greatest
political crisis came more than a decade ago after he intervened
with regulators on behalf of a campaign contributor, Charles H.
Keating Jr., an Arizona executive whose savings and loan failed at
a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion. A Senate ethics investigation
concluded that McCain had exhibited poor judgment but had not
violated ethics rules. Still, McCain was branded as one of the
``Keating Five,'' lawmakers whose careers were clouded by the
savings and loan investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The letters to the FCC show that in several instances, McCain
sought help for companies in telecommunications and related fields
that have also given to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from both the McCain campaign and the Senate
committee stressed on Saturday that the letters were sometimes sent
without prompting from lobbyists and contributors, and that they
reflected McCain's longtime policy positions. Some were also
written jointly with other members of the Commerce panel, including
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 19, 1998, letter to William Kennard, the FCC
chairman, McCain expressed concern about a court ruling that
restricted satellite television service providers from distributing
network programming.
</P>
<P>
   He took the side that benefited satellite television providers
like EchoStar Communications, a company based in Denver that along
with its employees has contributed $18,000 to his campaign. McCain
met with representatives from both EchoStar and DirecTV, another
satellite provider, his staff members said. The issue was also
important to Arizona, since the limitations on satellite providers
hurt rural customers.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, he intervened on behalf of BellSouth Corp.,
a large regional telephone company, on a series of complex
telecommunications rules with the FCC. BellSouth and its employees
have given $22,000 to his campaign, and a BellSouth executive has
been a fund-raiser for McCain.

 &HT;    Several 'Skins to miss Bucs matchup
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ The Redskins had no trouble beating the Lions
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday's divisional playoff game at Tampa Bay figures to
be a much different story, especially if running back Stephen Davis
and two of his offensive linemen miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are certain to be without left tackle Andy Heck,
who tore a hamstring in the first quarter at FedEx Field. He was
replaced by fifth-year pro Kip Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sprained his right knee in the second quarter, after
rushing for 119 yards and two touchdowns on his first 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-yard run, Davis got leg-whipped by Lions free safety Mark
Carrier, and then middle linebacker Stephen Boyd rolled across him.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, with the Redskins leading 27-0, Boyd
intercepted a Brad Johnson pass, and as Boyd returned it, Detroit
Pro Bowl defensive end Robert Porcher went after Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They got in a scrap, and as they grappled to the earth referee
Bob McElwee got knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   As several players from both sides went at it, Washington Pro
Bowl right guard Tre Johnson swang his right arm like an axe, and
whacked back judge Bill Leavy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   That got him ejected, and it could earn him a suspension by the
NFL office for next week.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   It would be a tough call deciding who had a tougher go of it
Saturday, the Lions or the officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:57 left in the third quarter, McElwee's microphone got
stuck in the ``on'' position, and people in the stadium and Shirley
Povich press box were privy to about four minutes of unusual
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the microphone is turned on only when the referee is
announcing a penalty, ruling or key substitution.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McElwee and head linesman Terry Gierke were
discussing the fight, and unbeknownst to McElwee, everybody was
listening _ and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the number of the guy,'' McElwee said. ``Then, we
got this clown (Johnson).''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody on the sideline ran on the field and told McElwee his
mike was stuck on. He said, ``OK,'' but the fiasco continued.
</P>
<P>
   He got ticked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' he said, with 7:25 left in the period.
``I can't work ...''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was soon fixed.
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   FedEx Field was sold out, and in fact fans seeking season
tickets _ and the playoff ticket privileges that come with them _
spend years on a waiting list before qualifying to buy season
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell the game was soldout, though, as officials
estimated some 10,000 fans were delayed because there was a suicide
attempt on nearby Wilson Bridge, over the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was halted both ways.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Georgia natives helped the Redskins. Rookie cornerback
Champ Bailey, Washington's first-round draft choice out of the
University of Georgia, and a native of Folkston, Ga., had an
interception in the first quarter. That led to the first of two
first-half field goals by kicker Brett Conway, who was a soccer
star seven years ago at Parkview High School in Lilburn.... On
Vickers' first play, he threw the key block, on Detroit defensive
end Tracy Scroggins, to spring Davis on a franchise-record 58-yard
run off left tackle. That tied the 58-yard run by former Washington
running back Timmy Smith in Super Bowl XXII for the longest in
Redskins' post-season history.... The Lions had fits with crowd
noise Saturday, much as the Redskins had problems with crowd noise
in the SilverDome when they lost 33-17 at Detroit Dec. 5. In that
game, nine of Washington's 14 penalties were on the offensive line,
either holding, or jumping offsides. The Lions held or jumped
offsides six times in the first three quarters Saturday....
Attendance was announced at 79,411, a Redskins record, but there
were never that many fans in the house.

MAVS' OWNER-TO-BE NEEDS TO KISS NELLIE ADIOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ When Mark Cuban phoned the house to introduce
himself Thursday _ an unprecedented move by a sports owner in more
than 30 years of sports coverage in this area _ my first thought
was that he'd somehow made a mistake and was about to yell at me
for that morning's column.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the one where colleague Randy Galloway welcomed the
Mavericks' new ``Yahoo'' to town. It dang sure wouldn't be the
first time Galloway got me into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   My second thought was that this was probably the first
billionaire who'd ever called just to say hello, a suspicion
confirmed by a quick scan of Caller ID. Nope, no other billionaires
on there.
</P>
<P>
   No question about it, Cuban is an original.
</P>
<P>
   He just wanted to say hello and invite me to the Mavericks Club
before the Mavs' game with Utah on Thursday night to have a cold
one. I was on the list with a number of local media wags. I
couldn't make it, but Cuban obviously knows the way to a sports
writer's heart.
</P>
<P>
   And if he overpaid for the Mavs, who cares? It's his money. Easy
come, easy go.
</P>
<P>
   But I just can't help offering one piece of advice: Kiss Nellie
goodbye and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't repeat the mistake the Mavs made when they hired Jim
Cleamons as coach, ``then'' Don Nelson as GM. If Nelson isn't going
to be the long-term general manager here, then get rid of him, hire
a capable new man and let him hire the coach. That way you get a
tandem on the same page with, hopefully, the same philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing Nelson, who will happily pad his bank account at the
Mavs' expense as long as they let him, to bring in a new coach
would be a disaster. In fact, if Nelson's going to stick around,
I'd keep him as coach and hire a new GM to run the team. It's his
decisions and judgment as a general manager that should get Nelson
fired, not his coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Cuban didn't exactly ask for the advice when he
phoned but hey, it's no problem. What are friends for?  &LR; subheds:A
TIDY PROFIT  &LR; body:Mark Cuban will make some of the Mavs' wealthy
investors even richer once his offer to buy the club is approved by
the NBA. One minority stockholder who invested about $1.5 million,
for instance, will walk away with a cool $8.5 million off this
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone will take the money and run. Don Carter, the
team's original owner, still holds just over 4 percent of the club.
He could take Cuban's check for almost $10 million and walk, but he
has advised the team's new owner-to-be that he intends to hold onto
his stock.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Carter figures Cuban will make him even more money in the
long run. Or maybe his Mavs' ties just run too deep.  &LR; subheds:WHEN
HE SPEAKS ...  &LR; body:Rafael Palmeiro is emerging as the Rangers'
vocal leader and conscience, unafraid to speak his mind for what he
feels is best for the team. Not only was he pushing hard for the
Rangers to re-sign pitcher Aaron Sele to the end but he said of the
Todd Zeile situation: ``I'm not sure what happened. But one thing I
can say, if we were going to sign him, we should have signed him
sooner. I'm not sure what approach they took but the same thing
happened in Baltimore with me. I said all along I wanted to remain
in Baltimore and the earlier they try to sign me, the better chance
they had. I told \Rowner Peter\S Angelos that but he waited and
waited and I ended up back here with the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening, Doug Melvin? There's something wrong when
Sele winds up signing with a team that has a state income tax for
just $1 million more over four years than what the Rangers were
offering. Either his agent messed up badly (not out of the
question) or the GM did. How about it?  &LR; subheds:LINEUP CONCERNS
 &LR; body:There's no question that the Rangers' lineup, as it currently
stacks up, presents some major concerns. Melvin is worried about
the overall on-base percentage of the team (Palmeiro and Rusty
Greer are the only ones with decent numbers in that category) and
manager Johnny Oates is concerned about who will protect Palmeiro
in the middle of the order. One solution could be to bat Palmeiro
third and Ivan Rodriguez fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Greer is willing to bat leadoff, and the Rangers like the fact
that he collects a lot of doubles and has a high on-base
percentage. But he doesn't want to bat leadoff against
right-handers, then drop to the middle of the order when Chad
Curtis bats leadoff against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   One solution to the leadoff situation is to play Curtis every
day against both LHP and RHP and trade Lee Stevens. But Melvin said
he doesn't want to do that after losing both Juan Gonzalez and
Zeile in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers need is for either Ruben Mateo, Gabe Kapler or
Mike Lamb to have a breakthrough season and become a force in the
fifth spot in the batting order.  &LR; subheds:FAMILIAR ACE  &LR; body:Kenny
Rogers still believes he can be a No. 1 pitcher and is willing to
take that role and match up with other teams' aces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to beat them more than anybody,'' Rogers said,
which may tell you all you need to know about the Rangers'
rotation.  &LR; subheds:CALL HIM MACK OSTRICH  &LR; body:Talk about burying
your head and hiding, Texas coach Mack Brown did just that
regarding the suspensions of four players before the Cotton Bowl.
Brown adamantly refused to provide details of the suspensions,
hiding behind the Buckley Amendment, which protects the release of
information regarding students (UT is currently embroiled in two
lawsuits for just such violations). Keeping the lid on so tight
only fueled more speculation and rumor. Both teams were given
random drug tests before the game, in accordance with NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all-Big 12 receiver Kwame Cavil has announced he'll
move on to the NFL after setting school records for receptions and
yards (1,188) as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the street in Austin is that the other two underclassmen
involved, defensive end J.J. Kelly and reserve linebacker Jamal
Joyner, may not be back for spring drills and could transfer
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, Cavil wished the Longhorns
luck, and said he ``honestly believe they will make a run at a
national championship in the very near future.'' Come again? Since
the Cotton Bowl this team has lost its leading TD scorer (Chris
Robertson), its record-setting receiver (Cavil) and its
record-setting quarterback (Major Applewhite) to major knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the best way to kick off a national championship
run.  &LR; subheds:FRAN THE MAN  &LR; body:Interesting, isn't it, that of the
four schools TCU head coach Dennis Franchione can opt out of his
contract for should they come calling, two _ Notre Dame and Arizona
State _ could be in big trouble next year. New coach kind of
trouble.

<P>
   You don't think Fran would be a huge hit at Notre Dame, do you?
Keep an eye on this situation.  &LR; subheds:AUTHOR! AUTHOR!  &LR; body:Just
when Jim Dent, author of ``The Junction Boys,'' has landed himself
a real job again _ sports columnist at the ``San Antonio
Express-News'' _ comes word that he's also landed a contract to
write a book about Oklahoma's 47-game winning streak under Bud
Wilkinson from 1954-57.  &LR; subheds:KLIF MASSACRE  &LR; body:Norm Hitzges'
run at KLIF/AM 570 ended almost exactly 15 years to the day he
started his morning sports talk show there on Jan. 8, 1985. His
departure _ his last show is Tuesday morning _ leaves WBAP's Randy
Galloway with the longest running sports talk show at the same
venue. Galloway has been at WBAP for 15 years, too, but started
there shortly after Hitzges, who is moving into the 10 a.m.-noon
slot on KTCK/AM 1310, arrived at KLIF.
</P>
<P>
   The KLIF move away from sports _ the station terminated Hitzges'
partner, Leon Simon and evening sports talk hosts Wally Lynn and
Mike Fisher _ wasn't totally unexpected. The station has not been
doing well in the ratings for some time and there was concern that
its sports shows were competing against those of sister station
KTCK, three floors down in the same building. Rumors had abounded
for the past couple of years that changes were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping sports talk, however, is not good for the consumer, any
more than the death of the ``Dallas Times Herald'' was good for the
newspaper business. We're never better off when our options are
narrowed and competition is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and Fisher say they intend to start up some sort of sports
talk show over the Internet through connections with Mark Cuban's
Broadcast.com. Simon hasn't indicated whether he'll attempt to stay
in the radio business. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7760

   YANKEE BEATER? He failed miserably trying to pitch for the
Yankees in the playoffs two years ago. He walked in the winning run
in the deciding game while pitching for the Mets against the Braves
last October. Surely the Rangers aren't trying to tell us that the
man they expect to make the difference next October, in front of
60,000 screaming lunatics at Yankee Stadium, is Kenny Rogers. Are
they?
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING'S ROTTEN SOMEWHERE: The Rangers wanted Aaron Sele and
Todd Zeile back next season. Instead, when state income taxes are
figured in, both will make less money playing next year somewhere
besides Texas. Maybe Doug Melvin needs to try a different mouthwash
or deodorant or something.
</P>
<P>
   OFF HIS ROCKER: So baseball wants John Rocker to undergo
psychological testing after his ridiculous statements in ``Sports
Illustrated'' a few weeks ago. Gee, can we get Albert Belle and
Kevin Brown on that list, too? And can I volunteer for the job? I
think I can get a rubber stamp made up that says ``Idiot'` without
too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   CALL IT CHARACTER: Philadelphia guard Allen Iverson is
complaining that he was left off the U.S. Olympic basketball team
because of his image. Gee, you think so? Maybe he should have
thought of that when he was cultivating his ``bad boy'' image.

<P>
   INVISIBLE DEFENSE: Hey, if Billy Tubbs can't sell his Horned
Frog hoopsters as candidates for the NCAA Tournament, at least he
still has a headliner in Marquise Gainous, who can somehow make
himself disappear in front of your very eyes. Three points in 23
minutes against Tulsa? You've got to be kidding.

TITANS BEAT BILLS, 22-16  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The play was the most familiar and folksy of
backyard, old-school calls _ the old across-the-field lateral on a
kickoff with 16 seconds remaining _ and it left the Buffalo Bills
in shambles and lifted the Tennessee Titans to a dramatic,
thumping, 22-16 wild-card playoff victory before 66,782 fans on
Saturday at Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Many who saw it still cannot believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a play!'' said Tennessee's Bruce Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   What a game. What a show. What victory. What a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say?'' asked Tennessee's Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won the game with three seconds left on a 75-yard
kickoff return for a touchdown by receiver Kevin Dyson. In a fourth
quarter that featured four lead changes, Tennessee thought it had
the game won when it kicked a 36-yard field goal with 1 minute 48
seconds left to lead by 15-13. Buffalo thought it had it won when
Steve Christie made a 41-yard field goal with 16 seconds left to
lead by 16-15.
</P>
<P>
   But then Christie kicked off, Lorenzo Neal gathered the short
boot near the Tennessee 25, ran toward his right and then handed
the ball off to teammate Frank Wycheck. Wycheck, a tight end, spun
and threw the ball across the field to Dyson. Dyson caught the low
toss and took off down the left sideline with a convoy of blockers.
Buffalo was completely fooled, its players a few steps behind
Dyson, and he raced 75 yards into the end zone. The play took 13
seconds, but the big question _ did Wycheck throw a forward pass to
Dyson? _ would be answered by instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Phil Luckett studied the play at his sideline replay
booth while players and coaches from both teams stood and paced on
the field, waiting. The clock said :03. It seemed as if Luckett was
taking three days to decide.
</P>
<P>
   What would he rule?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to No. 25 on their team while we waited,'' said
the Titans' Anthony Dorsett of Buffalo's Donovan Greer. ``We both
were saying: `This is crazy. What if it's our way? What if its your
way?' Nobody knew what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' owner, Ralph Wilson, said he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it went from the replay booth into the hands of the
officials on the field, I knew we were through _ and you can print
that,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckett finally appeared and said the play stood as called.
Touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (14-3) wins. Buffalo (11-6) loses. Tennessee marches
on in the playoffs. The Buffalo season is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Luckett is no stranger to controversy. In 1998, he was involved
in two decisions that accelerated the return of instant replay this
season _ the botched overtime coin toss between the Lions and
Steelerson Thanksgiving and the phantom Vinny Testaverde touchdown
against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``The line judge's initial ruling was that it was
not a forward pass. We went to the instant replay. Taking from
where the pass left the passer's hand right on that yard line, the
receiver catches it right there on that yard line. It did not
appear to be a forward pass, therefore there is not a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckett said the key in his ruling is not where the players
involved in the lateral were standing but the points from where the
ball was thrown to where it was touched. It was a lateral, he said.
Case closed. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   That was not good enough for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew that was illegal _ it was a forward pass,''
said cornerback Thomas Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they didn't beat us; we beat them,'' said defensive
lineman Marcellus Wiley. ``We didn't lose; we just got taken. I
could be fined next week. But thanks to this mess, we don't play
next week, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee sideline had a different perspective. ``I saw no
flags and that's when I celebrated,'' quarterback Steve McNair
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a beautiful thing!'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned and stung. That was the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate leaving things to chance and we did that the whole
day,'' said defensive end Bruce Smith. ``That being said, it's sad
to have a game come down to the officials _ and that's  &UR; with &LR; 
instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not real,'' Wiley said. ``That ball was thrown
forward. I'm depressed. I wish Tennessee the best. I wish them the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee led by 12-0 at halftime. Buffalo needed a swift
momentum change and got it in the third quarter when it scored on
an Antowain Smith 4-yard run fewer than three minutes into the
second half. The Buffalo defense shut out Tennessee in the third
quarter, so Buffalo entered the final 15 minutes trailing by 12-7.
</P>
<P>
   And then it swiped the lead. And lost it. And grabbed it back
again. And then lost it for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of them, but I haven't seen one like that
before,'' Wade Phillips, Buffalo's head coach, said of the final
play. ``I thought we played well enough to win. We had a heck of a
year. It's a shame it had to end this way because I though we
outplayed them, especially in the second half when we settled
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A lateral. On a kickoff. The winning touchdown on a play called
Homerun Throwback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said about destiny and belief and
expectation,'' said Jeff Fisher, the Tennessee head coach. ``We say
those things all year. We had them even when things looked gloomy.
My heart goes out to the other locker room right now, but our
players and our fans, they deserve this.''

STICKS NO PROBLEM, BUT WORDS SEEM TO BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; OR ABRIDGING
THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, or of the press; or of the right of the
people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a
redress of grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress doesn't have to. The NHL, just like Major League
Baseball, will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, you've heard that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman insisted
Ottawa Senators forward Vaclav Prospal attend sensitivity training
because during a game he called Montreal Canadiens defenseman
Patrice Brisebois, a  &LR; %!&AMP; frog.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? The word frog.
</P>
<P>
   It's considered a racial slur by some French Canadians, as
volatile as the N-word is to most black Americans. In
precedent-setting decisions, the NHL has suspended players in the
past for use of the N-word toward black players.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, Prospal shouldn't have said it. Just as
there shouldn't be any racist or sexist comments in any workplace.
Just as there shouldn't be breast cancer. Just as athletes
shouldn't make more than teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the world isn't perfect, and sometimes people say
things that aren't nice.
</P>
<P>
   But what we are forgetting is that, unlike cancer or salary
inequity, these are just words. Their ability to hurt comes only
from the credence we give to the person saying them.
</P>
<P>
   Racial slurs, sexist comments, they reflect poorly on the person
using them, not the person or persons whom they are about. Yet,
every time we react to the rantings of a person like Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker or a slur by Prospal we do just that.
</P>
<P>
   What the NHL and Major League Baseball should do, not that
either asked, is ignore the words. What the Prospals and Rockers of
the world will find is while the Constitution protects their right
to say whatever they want, it says nothing about the public's
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Public and not-so-public opinion, and there are a lot of French
Canadians in the NHL, are a lot more persuasive than some
$100-an-hour class on being sensitive. Many have suggested that
Brisebois should've just turned around and slashed Prospal. End of
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Deliver a stick to the face. Two minutes in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Say something mean. It's off to New York for sensitivity
training.
</P>
<P>
   And does the NHL really expect us to believe that racial slurs
are more dangerous than the kind of stick work that goes on during
the course of your average NHL game?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least, the NHL hasn't totally discounted the whole
Constitution thing. They like that Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
free state, THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, shall
not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticks and stones may break players' bones, but according to the
NHL, it's words that really hurt.
Shawn Baldwin A little more offense would make a great sport even
better, says Pittsburgh Penguins legend Mario Lemieux.
A hero of the game predicts a bright future for hockey Pittsburgh
Penguins legend Mario Lemieux nabbed just about every award
possible while playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cups, Hart Trophies, you name it. He won it.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, along with Lou Vairo, director of special projects for
U.S.A. Hockey, and Penguins general manager Craig Patrick, added
another honor to his packed resume. All were recipients of this
year's Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to hockey in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have won a few awards in my career throughout my career on
the ice, but this one is very special since I have been on the
business side for a few months now,'' Lemieux said. ``So I am very
excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For what feat did he owe the pleasure of this award?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing short of the tiny task of saving hockey in Pittsburgh.
When he bought the team, they were broke and U-Haul looked to be
the next call. Now, they are once again Lemieux's Penguins. Only,
he has a receipt to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   So where does he see hockey heading now?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, this could be the most exciting game in
the world, and from my perspective I feel that it is right now,''
Lemieux said. ``But we can always improve our game by, what I have
been preaching for the last five or six years, having more offense
in the game; letting our star players display their talent to their
full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing when your random, average NHL players say that
there is too much clutching and grabbing. It's quite another when
Mario Lemieux says it. After all, part of the reason he chose to
retire when he did was he didn't like the direction the game was
headed.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's getting better. He says it needs to get even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to do a better job as a league to protect our
star players and to promote them, like they did in basketball with
Michael Jordan and the way they do it in football with the
quarterbacks and the receivers,'' Lemieux said. ``They protect the
offense and the players that sell their game and it only makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to do a better job as owners and GMs and
players to realize that; and if we do, I think hockey is going to
be much better in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For what he has done and he continues to do for hockey in the
states, there can never been enough awards for Mario Lemieux.
\Nsubheds:around the east If his chemotherapy treatments go well,
Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger Neilson will be in Toronto for
All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson has been selected as an assistant to Maple Leafs coach
Pat Quinn on the North American All-Star squad. A week later,
Neilson is scheduled to have a bone marrow stem cell transplant,
sidelining him for at least six weeks. He has a leukemia-like
cancer that attacks plasma in bone marrow, generating malignant
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've been there \Rto All-Star
weekend\S, so I'm excited about it,'' Neilson said. ``If everything
the doctor says is right and if it continues this way, I'm planning
on going.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Carolina owner Peter Karmanos said he doesn't want to
contribute to escalating salaries in the NHL. That's why he isn't
caving into salary demands of restricted free agent Keith Primeau
and why he supposedly nixed a trade of Primeau for Coyotes forward
Keith Tkachuk. Tkachuk's $8.3 million contract next season is
``stupid,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So, why did he sign Detroit forward Sergei Fedorov to an offer
sheet worth $12 million for less than a half of a season that the
Red Wings were forced to match?
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Around the West How often is it that you hear the
general manager of a team sounding like the fans on talk radio?
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Vancouver Canucks GM Brian Burke:

   ``I put the blame on the players,'' Burke told the ``Vancouver
Province''. ``I see a lot of guys making a lot of money and not
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville goalie Tomas Vokoun was demoted not once, but twice,
to the Predators' minor-league affiliate in Milwaukee. Let's just
say the demotions got his attention.
</P>
<P>
   He was 0-8-1 with a 3.54 goals-against average before getting
demoted.
</P>
<P>
   He is 4-1-1 since his return, the lone loss in that stretch
coming against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's just like the beginning of the season,'' Vokoun
told the ``Nashville Tennessean''. ``If someone had told me I
wasn't going to get my first win for a couple of months, I'd have
said: `You're crazy.' You never know what is going to happen, and
that's the beauty of the game.''

WITH NEW OWNER, MAVERICKS HOPE THE DOMINOES FALL FOR THE GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The theory goes that a new owner will bring in a new
president, who will go find a new general manager, who will hire a
new coach, who will draft new players.
</P>
<P>
   It's all still theory for Mavericks owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban,
but one of the most memorable weeks in the team's 20-year history
ended with everyone _ management, coaches, players, fans, the NBA _
wondering if Cuban will make the dominoes fall in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban admits he is too busy delighting in his latest trinket _
the pending purchase of the Mavericks for $280 million _ to rock
anybody's world just yet. ``I don't want to blow this thing up,''
he said. ``I don't know enough about the NBA business to just come
in here and make a lot of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even outgoing Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. said changes are
inevitable, especially for an organization that posted the worst
winning percentage in all of professional sports during the 1990s.
The potential for change is part of the buzz Cuban, 41, has
generated, a buzz not heard from the Mavericks since the 1980s,
when the franchise was battling the Los Angeles Lakers for Western
Conference supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How exciting would it be to hit the winning jumper in the NCAA
basketball tournament?'' Cuban said. ``That's not even half as
excited as I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban will benefit from the NBA's new television contract
starting next season and a new arena, the American Airlines Center,
in 2001. The team's roster also includes at least two players,
guard Michael Finley and forward Dirk Nowitzki, other NBA teams
covet.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Cuban to put the pieces together, including a
team president, general manager, coach and players _ even new
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be a fabulous owner,'' said Terdema
Ussery, the Mavericks' president and chief executive officer.
``He's a guy who is going to bring a lot of innovative ideas into
this business that's going to benefit not only us, the Dallas
Mavericks, but the whole league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has incredible energy, and he has a laser focus on the
things that he turns his attention to. He has infused the
organization with a mission and a passion to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ussery and coach/general manager Don Nelson will have two years
remaining on their contract after this season. For now, Cuban said
Nelson will be the team's GM next season. However, Nelson said this
week neither he nor his son Donnie, an assistant, will coach the
Mavericks next season.
</P>
<P>
   One possible coaching candidate might be Isiah Thomas, a star at
Indiana University, where Cuban went to college. As GM, Thomas
helped the Toronto Raptors acquire a talent base that once included
Damon Stoudamire, Marcus Camby, John Wallace and Walt Williams, and
currently includes Tracy McGrady and Doug Christie. The Raptors, an
expansion team in 1995, came within one victory of reaching the
playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is commissioner of the Continental Basketball
Association, a sort of minor league for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is just like every other CBA player's dream, and
that's to get back in the NBA,'' Thomas said. ``If it's the right
situation with the right people, yeah, I'm interested in coaching
because I love basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assembling a management team, Cuban knows his
mission to bring an NBA championship to Dallas also includes
acquiring quality players. He said he will spare no expense to add
players like Tim Duncan and Grant Hill, who become free agents this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Several Mavericks might be playing their last season with the
team, including forward Gary Trent, who could opt to become a free
agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about center Shawn Bradley during a radio interview
this week, Cuban referred to him as ``Stone Cold Shawn Bradley.''
Bradley, whom Nelson acquired from New Jersey in a nine-player deal
in 1997, has one year left on an eight-year contract that pays him
$44.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, Nelson said on his radio show that he might have
overpaid injured point guard Steve Nash, whom Nelson signed to a
six-year, $33 million contract last year before Nash became a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento Kings general manager Jerry Reynolds said if he were
running the Mavericks, he would make Finley and Nowitzki
``untouchable'' and start dealing from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two big-time talents there in Finley and
Nowitzki,'' Reynolds said. ``Both are all-star caliber players _
Finley already and Nowitzki later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are two guys you wouldn't, under any circumstance,
consider trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds transformed the Kings from paupers into one of the
NBA's regal young teams by drafting Jason Williams in 1998 and
trading for Chris Webber and Vlade Divac, all within a span of
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also have new owners in Gavin Maloof, 42, and his
brother Joe, 43. They have the same gold standard and come from the
same generation as Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our owners are really fans of the game, are very positive, and
they have fun with it,'' Reynolds said. ``The fact that the guys
like the NBA as a fan before they bought the team is neat in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real honeymoon. I've been here a long time. This

   Cuban, who made $1.5 billion when he sold his Internet company,
Broadcast.com, has been trying to learn as much as he can about the
Mavericks' business side. From his baseline seats as a
season-ticket holder since 1994, he knows what's wrong with the
product on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems the Mavs have is getting people
into the arena,'' Cuban said. ``A part of that is they don't
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just a fan of the game, and I hope it turns around
quickly now that I'm a huge part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominoes are now in his hands.

TONY PEREZ DESERVES A SPOT IN THE HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk's dramatic home run is part of baseball lore.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox catcher frantically waved his arms, imploring to
ball to stay fair. It did, hitting the foul pole atop the Green
Monster in Fenway Park, giving his team a victory over the
Cincinnati Reds in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, ending one of
the greatest baseball games ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone remember that Tony Perez hit a home run the next
day? He did, and while it wasn't as dramatic as Fisk's it was
equally as important.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox led Game 7, 3-0, when Perez came up against Bill Lee
in the sixth inning with a runner on base. Perez timed Lee's
blooper pitch perfectly and sent it soaring over the net above the
Green Monster for a two-run shot that propelled the Reds to a 4-3
victory and the World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   In a microcosm, that's the story of Perez's career.
</P>
<P>
   He almost single-handedly won Game 5 against the Red Sox,
hitting two home runs and driving in six runs in a 6-2 victory. The
Reds wouldn't win Game 7 without his home run off Lee. But the
indelible memory of the '75 Series is Fisk's arm-waving home run to
win Game 6 in the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Perez's vital contributions were overshadowed by Fisk in
the World Series, so it was on his own team. Think of the Big Red
Machine, and the first names likely to come to mind are Johnny
Bench, Joe Morgan and Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, though, was just as important a cog in one of the best
teams of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He was the cleanup hitter, the clutch hitter, the quietly
efficient RBI machine. He drove in at least 90 runs for 11
consecutive seasons, in 1967-77 (although the last one came with
the Expos). He topped the century mark seven times, with a high of
129 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his career with 1,652 RBI, 18th in major-league
history, to go along with a .279 batting average and 379 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame balloting will be announced Tuesday. Bench
already is in. So is Morgan. Rose would be if not for his lifetime
ban. Fisk, who fell 43 votes short last year in his first year of
eligibility, will get in this time.
</P>
<P>
   This is Perez's ninth time on the ballot, his ninth chance. It's
time for him to emerge from the shadows and take his place among
baseball's best.
Catch as catch can Carlton Fisk will get in this year. Deservedly
so. After all, he is the major-league record holder for games
played (2,226) and home runs (351) by a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Gary Carter? He remains a long shot, despite very
similar career numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk played 24 seasons, 11 with the Red Sox and 13 with the
White Sox. He was an 11-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Carter played 19 seasons, 12 with the Expos, five with the Mets
and one each with the Giants and Dodgers. He also was an 11-time
All-Star and twice was MVP of the mid-season classic.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was the superior defensive player, winning three Gold
Gloves to Fisk's one and setting major-league records for putouts
and chances.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also was at least Fisk's equal with the bat. He had nine
seasons with 20 or more home runs; Fisk had eight. Carter had four
seasons of 100 or more RBI, including a league-leading 106 in 1984.
Fisk had two.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's career edge in home runs (376-324) and RBI (1,330-1,225)
are functions of longevity, not superior skills.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the difference between the two? Fisk's extra five
seasons, certainly. And of course that arm-waving home run,
although Carter also was part of a dramatic postseason moment. The
Mets were down to their last out in Game 6 of the '86 Series
against the Red Sox when Carter singled, starting the three-run
rally that culminated with Mookie Wilson's ground ball trickling
through Bill Buckner's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Carter holds his own.
</P>
<P>
   So if Fisk deserves to be in the Hall _ and he does _ so does
Carter. Back for more Dwight Gooden once was the best pitcher in
baseball. He's still only 35, two years younger than Roger Clemens.
That's why he keeps getting chances, despite mediocre records and
high earned-run averages the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chance comes courtesy of the Astros. They gave Gooden
a minor-league contract, but he's a candidate for a spot in the
rotation behind Jose Lima, Shane Reynolds, Scott Elarton and Chris
Holt.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one of the best stories of the year if Gooden could
regain his old form, but that's about as big a long shot as the
Royals and Twins battling for the American League Central title.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden hasn't been the same since his once promising career was
sidetracked by drug problems. Since missing all of the '95 season
because of a suspension, he is 31-22 with a 4.94 ERA, including 3-4
with a 6.26 ERA in 26 games (22 starts) for the Indians last year.
Best of the best ``The Sporting News'' polled 20 top baseball
executives and asked them to name the top five players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez is the
best player. Rodriguez received 77 points, four more than teammate
Ken Griffey Jr., although Griffey had eight first-place votes, two
more than Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the list, with vote totals: Pedro Martinez, 52;
Nomar Garciaparra, 21; Derek Jeter, 16; Ivan Rodriguez, 14; Larry
Walker, 10; Sammy Sosa and Manny Ramirez, 6; Vladimir Guerrero and
Chipper Jones, 5; Roberto Alomar 4; Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and
Randy Johnson 3; Bernie Williams and Jeff Bagwell, 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that the highest ranking player from
the National League was Walker, who came in 7th. Right choice,
wrong choice More evidence that Rangers GM Doug Melvin made the
right choice in signing Kenny Rogers to a three-year, $22.5 million
deal: Rogers allowed opponents an OPS (on-base percentage plus
slugging average) last year of .730. That was just a shade higher
than Chuck Finley (.716), who received a three-year, $27 million
deal from the Indians. It was much better than the .802 of Aaron
Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, by the way, erred in turning down the Rangers' four-year,
$28 million deal. He agreed to a four-year, $29 million contract
with the Orioles, but he would have netted more by staying in Texas
because of the lack of a state income tax. Hot stove embers Houston
has talked about sending Moises Alou to the Pirates for Jason
Schmidt or Francisco Cordova, but Alou would have to waive a
no-trade clause. That would leave the increasingly emasculated
Astros with an outfield of Roger Cedeno in center and youngsters
Richard Hidalgo, Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman battling for the two
corner positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals want to sign free agent Ricky Bottalico to replace
the retired Jeff Montgomery as their closer.
</P>
<P>
   The A's offered prospects Adam Piatt, Brett Laxton and Mario
Encarnacion for Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds. With the Angels
dragging their feet, the Angels dangling the same package for Twins
ace Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will take a close look at 19-year-old shortstop
Rafael Furcal in spring training. The phenom hit .322 and stole 96
bases at the Class-A level, and if he isn't overmatched, the job
could be his. If he is, the Braves will look at Blue Jays shortstop
Alex Gonzalez, who is on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   With Aaron Sele and Andy Benes agreeing to deals Friday, Omar
Olivares could be the next free agent pitcher to sign. The Rockies
are interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates are looking for a closer and might trade Al Martin
to the Mariners for Jose Mesa or Jose Paniagua.

CONNECTICUT BEATS TENNESSEE, 74-67  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Sue Bird remembers sitting behind the
Connecticut bench last year, her left knee still in a cast,
watching Tennessee wrench the No.1 ranking and a 54-game home
winning streak away from the Huskies in Storrs. The guard from
Syosset, N.Y., squirmed then, the discomfort of her surgically
repaired knee compounded by the knowledge that the Huskies were
losing in large part because she was not on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bird, now a sophomore and the starting point guard,
was on the court for the intense rematch, weaving the Huskies
around and through Tennessee's pressure defense, screaming
instructions over the din in the raucous Thompson-Boling Arena and
hitting a stream of big shots in the second half to lead No.1
Connecticut to a 74-67 victory over the No.2 Lady Vols that not
only handed Tennessee its second home loss of the season but also
solidified the Huskies' dominance of women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early January, but Connecticut has already beaten
the No.14, No.6, No.3 and now the No.2 teams in the nation, and an
enormous part of their supremacy is Bird's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really took over the game for us,'' UConn's Shea Ralph
said of her teammate's play in front of 20,789. ``She did it almost
single-handedly. Their pressure defense is the best part of their
game and she not only handled it but made big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird, who has averaged 10 points per game this season, finished
with a career high 25 points on 8-of-10 shooting and also had 4
steals. During the most critical stretch of the game, after
Tennessee had used a ratcheted up press to whittle a 13-point
Connecticut lead to just 5 points, Bird scored 8 consecutive
points, including two 3-pointers that opened the Huskies' lead back
to 11 points with 5 minutes 57 seconds remaining. With the lead
again down to 5 with 1:10 left, she hit both ends of a one-and-one
to solidify the lead. As the final second ticked off the clock,
Bird flung the ball in the air, an exultation for which she had
waited a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I wasn't in very many games, especially big ones,''
said Bird, who started the first eight games of the season before
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. ``I was
dying to be out there. It's really hard to sit there and know
there's nothing you can do. It's a helpless feeling. I'm not saying
if I were playing we would have won. But it was killing me to be
sitting behind the bench. Because of that experience, I value each
game much more. You have to play every game like it's your last
because it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma teases that Bird, who went to
Christ the King High School in Queens County, N.Y., may technically
be one of the fabled group of New York point guards, but that she
really grew up on the not-at-all mean streets of Syosset where
``the last thing that was stolen was the newspaper off the porch,''
Auriemma says. But Bird, who has the face of Snow White and the
giggle of a cheerleader, also has the same toughness _ if more
well-concealed _ that the top scorers Ralph and Svetlana Abrosimova
possess, Auriemma says, and she controlled Connecticut in one of
the best _ and most highly anticipated _ game on the women's
schedule this season. The Huskies did not trail after the first
five minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's pressure defense was superb and rattled the Lady
Vols, particularly point guard Kristen Clement, who finished with
seven turnovers and no points. Connecticut thrived on those
turnovers with its speedy transition offense, scoring 21 points off
turnovers. Auriemma said he did not try to focus his game plan on
slowing Clement, but instead wanted to limit how many times Tamika
Catchings, one of Tennessee's All-Americans, touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked. Connecticut packed in its defense and
Catchings, the forward who was the team's leading scorer averaging
16.2 points entering the game, took just nine shots and scored just
8 points, forcing Tennessee to rely on center Michelle Snow (21
points) and guard Semeka Randall (20 points) almost exclusively.
Connecticut led by 43-37 at the half but Tennessee's haplessness
was encapsulated in the opening moments of the second half. With
the Tennessee fans standing and clapping in anticipation of the
Volunteers' first points, Connecticut reeled off 7 points in a row
on their first three possessions. It was a deficit that sent
Tennessee into a hole from which they would never fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played on our heels,'' Summitt said. ``We didn't get back
in transition. They were more aggressive, more confident, more
mentally tough. We were very tentative in the beginning of both
halves.''
</P>
<P>
   These two teams _ the premier teams in the game today _ will
meet again Feb. 2 in Storrs and then, perhaps, again sometime late
in the post-season tournament in March. Auriemma thinks he sees a
pattern in games like this. Saturday, the pattern was a pretty one
for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much pressure on your best players _ Shea, Svet,
Tamika, Semeka _ in games like this and they feel it,'' Auriemma
said. ``Usually somebody else steps up and that was Sue. Today, we
got more from our other guys than they got. That's why we won.''

 MCCAIN WROTE LETTERS on behalf of donors 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain raised about $80,000 from
broadcast and telecommunications companies in four instances
shortly before or soon after he interceded on their behalf with
federal regulators in 1998 and 1999, according to campaign records
reviewed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides released about 500 letters that McCain has written as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee since 1997, with little
evidence that many of them had involved major contributors to his
campaign. And McCain, who was campaigning in South Carolina
Saturday, said his only interest was to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But in several cases, according to federal campaign finance
records that were matched against the letters, the correspondence
to the Federal Communications Commission, which his committee
oversees, coincided with substantial fund-raising efforts by the
companies that stood to benefit from his letters.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, officials of BellSouth Corp. donated $16,750 to the
Arizona senator at a fund-raiser on May 6, 1998. Four months later,
McCain asked the FCC in a letter to give ``serious consideration''
to allowing BellSouth to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has long favored the so-called Baby Bells, he
also wrote to the FCC on behalf of AT&AMP;T, Sprint, and MCI Worldcom
in June 1998. Two weeks later, Sprint officers donated $2,000. In
October, 1998, McCain raised another $25,800 from AT&AMP;T officials at
a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has built his campaign around denunciations of
special interest money and power in Washington, was put on the
defensive last week, when The Boston Globe reported that he
interceded last month with the FCC on behalf of Paxson
Communications, which owns or operates 73 television stations.
McCain's letter-writing began soon after the company helped him
raise $20,000, and in a period when he was using Paxson's corporate
jet.
</P>
<P>
   After the report last week, McCain canceled a fund-raiser that
Paxson's chairman, Lowell Paxson, was to have held for him Saturday
in Florida, an event that had been expected to raise $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported last week that McCain last May rebuked
the FCC for bias against two Baby Bells, SBC Communications and
Ameritech, which were seeking FCC permission to merge. Just before
that May 12 letter, officials of the two companies contributed or
solicited donations of about $120,000 to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The letters made public Saturday also include an April 1999
letter McCain wrote to the FCC on Ameritech. That was just after
the company's chairman at the time, Richard Notebaert, a friend of
McCain's, cohosted a Chicago fund-raiser for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's communications director,
acknowledged Saturday that McCain's contributors get access to him,
but not preferential treatment. ``Big- money contributors to both
parties get access that other people don't,'' Schnur said. But, he
said, McCain ``and the people who work for him do their level best
to make sure those contributors are not given different
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, McCain has criticized the campaign finance
system, saying that it leaves influential lawmakers like himself
beholden to business interests that provide the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has said he too is a victim of the system, his
rhetoric often suggests that he himself has been scrupulous in not
taking actions that benefit campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign records examined Saturday include funds that McCain
raised for his presidential campaign during the first three
quarters of 1999, and funds donated to his 1998 Senate reelection
camapaign. In 1998, McCain faced only token opposition, and was
able to transfer about half the $4 million he raised to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of BellSouth are among his largest contributors. In
1999 officials of BellSouth, a regional Bell operating company,
have contributed nearly $30,000 to McCain's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth wanted entry into the lucrative long-distance
business, and petitioned the FCC to that end. The FCC was then
required to judge whether there was enough competition in the local
market to warrant their entry into long distance. McCain wrote two
letters _ one on March 6, 1998, and the other on Sept. 15, 1998 _
arguing that wireless service should be taken into account as
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The $16,750 fund-raising event was on May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the September letter, McCain said: ``I encourage you to give
serious consideration to whether PCS is providing competition to
the local exchange market.'' He said the FCC ``should be focused on
implementing the Telecommunications Act to encourage competition,
not maintain the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote to the commission to express his view as to the
law,'' said Mark Buse, the Commerce Committee staff director. ``The
FCC ignored this, and denied BellSouth's petition in 1998 to get
into the long-distance business.''
</P>
<P>
   Echostar chairman Charles W. Ergen has long sought permission to
broadcast the network affiliate programming into homes. But the
company was stymied by a 1998 court case. McCain wrote a letter on
Aug. 19, 1998, to the FCC chairman, William E. Kennard, in order to
``raise our concerns'' over the case.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wrote that the case _ which led to a ruling in favor of
the networks and against the satellite companies _ ``threatens to
undermine the progress we have made in promoting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard replied that he essentially agreed. Correspondence led
to the Satellite Home Viewers Act, passed last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echostar and DirecTV did both come in and meet the chairman,''
Buse said. ``They did not ask him to do anything specific.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and its major long-distance competitors had a far different
concern, according to Buse _ the so-called ``Gore tax'' on
long-distance carriers. The money goes to the installation of the
Internet in classrooms and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The big three long-distance carriers wanted to be able to
itemize this tax on phone bills, so customers would know this was a
federal imposition rather than a rate increase by the phone
companies. The FCC wanted the companies to bury the tax in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wrote a letter on June 2, 1998, on behalf of the
long-distance carriers arguing that ``consumers have an absolute
right to know how much their bills are going up and why their bills
are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Buse said, ``None of these companies came to us on this
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the amount of the tax was lower than people had
expected. But most companies are still unable to itemize it the way
they had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T fund-raiser was held on Oct. 13, 1998. It netted
McCain's campaign $25,800.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has consistently said, as he did again Saturday, that his
only goal has been to prod the FCC, which often moves slowly, to
take action. And he has also insisted that there has been no
connection between the fund-raising and any action he has taken as
the Commerce Committee chairman.

   MOSCOW _ Insisting nothing has changed in its military campaign
against separatist rebels, the Kremlin  &UR; yesterday &LR;  played down a
shakeup among its top field generals in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir V. Putin also cited concern for
civilians and the weekend's Orthodox Christian and Muslim holidays
as reasons for the announcement Friday of a temporary halt in the
bombardment of Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the announcement, television stations in Russia reported
fighting and artillery strikes  &UR; yesterday &LR;  on the outskirts of
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   As officials scrambled to explain away the command shakeup,
military analysts said the reason was simple: Russian forces have
lost the initiative to the outnumbered but determined Chechen
rebels. After easily winning control of northern Chechnya, Russian
forces have been bogged down for weeks on the outskirts of Grozny
and desperately need to regroup, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told reporters the removal Friday of his top two generals
in Chechnya _ Lieutenant General Gennady Troshev, who commanded
forces in eastern Chechnya, and Major General Vladimir Shamanov,
who led troops on the west _ was not a reflection on their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia doesn't throw away such generals as Troshev and
Shamanov. There has been no replacement and no replacement has been
planned. It is a technical question,'' Putin said early  &UR; yesterday &LR; 
 &UR; morning  &LR; after leaving an Orthodox Christmas Divine Liturgy. He
gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's statement went against the Defense Ministry announcement
naming new leaders. Troshev's replacement, Sergei Makarov, told NTV
television that Troshev had been given a promotion and would serve
as deputy head of the Northern Caucasus military district.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also offered various reasons for the bombing halt,
including respect for the Orthodox Christmas and for Muslims who
were celebrating the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Another
reason, according to Putin, was concern for the civilians trapped
in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not forget that and we will respect the feelings of
believers,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin leader also repeated accusations that Chechen rebels
had blown up containers of toxic chemicals as a means of defense.
Putin said that in such circumstances, artillery attacks and
airstrikes against Grozny ``are not safe for the civilian
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst, said Russia's
bombing pause was unrelated to humanitarian or religious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian forces are losing the initiative and the Chechens
are effectively counterattacking. Russian troops are bogged down
and the reserves are depleted, and they need to regroup,''
Felgenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the rotation of field generals is often
routine, the timing of the reshuffle, made after Russian troops
have been stuck in Grozny's outskirts for weeks, looked suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the situation is due to the bad work of the generals
in the field, who have split the troops into many small units that
cannot help each other,'' Felgenhauer said, adding that the shakeup
may be a prelude to a change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin launched its military assault on Chechnya in late
September after a series of apartment bombings that killed hundreds
of people in Russian cities. Authorities blamed Chechen rebels for
the bombings. The rebels contend they were not involved in the
attacks.

IT'S TIME FOR WORST TO PONDER WHO'S BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's clear the Lakers and Blazers are the top two
teams in the NBA, but it's even clearer the Bulls, Warriors,
Grizzlies, Mavericks and Wizards are the worst.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, scouts for those teams have begun to get
serious, flying to as many college basketball conference games as
possible to see how players react in pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean these teams don't already have their cheat
sheets handy with a list of their top 10 prospects.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's a sneak peek at the top 10, if the draft were held
today:
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon Martin, power forward, 6-8, 230, Cincinnati, Sr.: Thebest
senior in the draft, and perhaps best player. Martin has great
shot-blocking ability, can score facing the basket and has shown
this season he can hit a jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mihm, center, 7-0, 262, Texas, Jr.: The top true center
prospect in the country, he has the defensive skills to be an
impact player and has an underrated perimeter game. All he lacks is
maturity, which might come if he stays in school for his senior
year.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Richardson, shooting guard, 6-6, 215, DePaul, So.: He
was a projected lottery pick after his freshman season, and has
made it known he will not be back next year. He can rebound as well
as any guard in college basketball, although his outside shot is
still under review.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Morris, small forward, 6-9, 205, Maryland, Jr.: Needs to
bulk up, but makes everyone's top-10 list. He's a scorer and
leader, and has that wonderful ``upside'' NBA experts seek.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Woods, center, 7-1, 225, Arizona, Jr.: After sitting out
last season, the Wake Forest transfer has returned with a
vengeance. He could be joined by teammate Michael Wright in the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Hanno Mottola, power forward, 6-10, 245, Utah, Sr.: He's as
likely to shoot a 3-pointer as grab a rebound inside. Scouts love
to compare him to former Ute Keith Van Horn, minus all the
preseason hype.
</P>
<P>
   DerMarr Johnson, small forward, 6-9, 200, Cincinnati, Fr.: He's
played only a handful of games, but has been so dominant in the
Bearcats' preseason schedule that he zoomed up the charts. He can
shoot, run and rebound with grace.
</P>
<P>
   Stromile Swift, power forward, 6-9, 235, Louisiana State, So.:
There's a reason Louisiana State got off to a 12-0 start, and it
wasn't just a soft schedule. How he fares in the SEC will determine
if this early projection holds.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Przybilla, center, 7-1, 260, Minnesota, So.: A still-raw
prospect, his shot-blocking ability alone is expected to make him a
top-10 pick, if he chooses to come out this season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Porter, small forward, 6-7, 218, Auburn, Sr.: He started
out as a preseason choice for player of the year, but his stock has
dropped because of poor shooting and questions about effort.
</P>
<P>
   Deals, deals, deals: The Sixers' latest target is Phoenix
forward Tom Gugliotta, who survived his recent encounter with an
herbal supplement. Philadelphia is believed to have suggested Larry
Hughes andMatt Geiger as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington is trying to figure out what to do with
disgruntled center Ike Austin, provided coach Gar Heard doesn't get
fired first.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards have offered Austin to Milwaukee for Tim Thomas and
Robert Traylor. The Lakers have also reportedly expressed interest
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks continue to fruitlessly offer Kurt Thomas and Charlie
Ward for Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz has dangled Jacque Vaughn and Howard Eisley to Indiana
for Chris Mullin and Portland for Detlef Schrempf. The Blazers
don't want to deal Schrempf, but he's become frustrated over a lack
playing time. Just like the other six players on Mike Dunleavy's
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Doubletalk: If you want to know why New Jersey players
couldn't stand former coach John Calipari, listen to him speak out
of both sides of his mouth, regarding his desire to return to
college coaching instead of the hectic pace of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good college situation, I'd be interested,'' Calipari said.
``A good pro situation, I'd have to be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari has already interviewed with the University of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call me coach: One of the most outlandish cases of
nepotism quietly dissolved in Dallas this week, when coach Don
Nelson said his son, Donnie, would not take over the team next
season.
</P>
<P>
   A case of Nelson Sr. coming to his senses? Hardly. He just
realized that with new owner Mark Cuban taking over the team, he
wouldn't have the power to make such a decision anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, that was obviously a mistake,'' Donnie Nelson
said. ``Butpeople who really know me know that titles are not a big
thing to me. I've said it a gazillion times and I'm getting tired
of saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Genius at work: Sacramento point guard Jason Williams continues
to demonstrate why he can confound and astound simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   He made 2 of 14 shots in the first 40 minutes against Cleveland
on Tuesday, then hit three straight 3-point shots in 90 seconds to
lead the Kings to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss shots,'' Williams said. ``But you miss 100
percent of the shots you don't take. So I'm just going to keep
jacking them up there until they go in.''
</P>
<P>
   To weave or not to weave: After Orlando's Ben Wallace switched
his hairstyle from cornrows to an Afro, the Magic went 7-3.
Teammates asked Wallace to retain the Afro, and the team conducted
an online poll. More than 60 percent of the fans also asked for the
Afro.
</P>
<P>
   Historic moment: Sixers rookie Jumaine Jones scored the last
basket of the millennium on a 25-footer with 3.6 seconds left. In
case you're wondering, the NBA intends to place his jersey in the
Hall of Fame.

GORE, BRADLEY DEBATE HEALTH CARE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Vice President Al Gore raised questions about Bill
Bradley's health care plan and commitment to farmers, while the
former New Jersey senator accused his rival of repeated
misrepresentations during their debate here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the pair largely covered ground they plowed earlier in
their race for the Democratic presidential nomination, there were
moments of sharp repartee involving some of Bradley's votes in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to press for twice-weekly debates in exchange for
an agreement not to use TV commercials. And focusing on a key issue
for Iowans as they head into the state's Jan. 24 caucuses, Gore
said, ``I think we ought to come back to Iowa and have a debate on
farm policy.'' Bradley dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also renewed his attacks on Bradley's health
care proposal, claiming the plan would not only cancel Medicaid,
but make Medicare insolvent by denying government surpluses to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slight misrepresentation,'' Bradley said, explaining that
under his program, Medicaid would be replaced with ``something
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded by calling Bradley's plan ``a little old
$150-a-month HMO voucher'' that would be insufficient for coverage
in Iowa. He presented the moderator, Des Moines Register Editor
Dennis Ryerson, with a list of Iowa health programs and invited the
newspaper to check out his charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, you're misrepresenting,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley's approach to Medicare reminded him ``of the
guy who fell off a 10-floor building, and as he passed the fifth
floor, he shouted: `So far, so good!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his rebuttal time on a question regarding farm
issues to return to the Medicare debate, rejecting Gore's
assertions. ``For 18 years in the United States Senate I fought to
protect Medicare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the tenacity of a courtroom prosecutor, Gore also used
sympathetic spectators in the audience as props to try to keep
Bradley off balance. At one point, the vice president called on an
Iowa farmer to stand up as Gore described a 1993 flood that
inundated the man's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you oppose disaster relief?'' Gore asked Bradley, who
served in the Senate at the time of a vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ignored the question. ``This is not about the past, but
about the future,'' he told Gore, and suggested that Iowa farmers
suffered from the failed agricultural policies of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point Bradley returned to in his closing remarks, when
he adapted a question used by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 campaign
against Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,''
Bradley said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago? Or do we
need a change? Do we need to take a step to make things happen?''
</P>
<P>
   From his opening remarks, Gore was the aggressor. He recalled
that Bradley had accused him of holing up in a ``Washington
bunker'' during their debate in New Hampshire Wednesday. Rather
than working in siege conditions, Gore said, he and ``other
Democrats'' had been laboring to create 20 million new jobs, win
passage of major gun control legislation, and sustain a booming
economy. ``That's a front line in the fight for the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After being put on the defensive for the first half of the
hour-long debate, Bradley began to counterattack. In response to a
question involving national security, he said the Clinton-Gore
administration had failed to press for a reduction in the number of
nuclear weapons held by the US and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also charged that Gore wanted to use the budget surplus
``to spend another $120 billion on the military and less than that
on education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he was ``proud to have the support of
the Iowa teachers,'' whose statewide organization has endorsed his
candidacy. He introduced another spectator, a teacher, and said,
``She needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his education program would ``start at birth and
extend for a lifetime.'' He vowed to double the Head Start program,
add 600,000 ``great new teachers'' to the public schools, and
invest in community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also exchanged implicit barbs aimed at each
other's backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times, Gore mentioned that he was a Vietnam
veteran. Bradley served in the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley described himself as the product of a
small Missouri town. His father had been a banker ``who never
foreclosed on a single home.'' His mother was a public school
teacher, Bradley said, while he attended public schools. Gore, the
son of a US senator, attended an exclusive prep school in
Washington.

REDSKINS BEAT LIONS, 27-13  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Unfortunately for the National Football League,
the best action during Washington's 27-13 rout of the Detroit Lions
during a National Conference wild-card game Saturday occurred in
the third quarter, in a World Wrestling Federation smackdown type
of scrum between Redskins and Lions players. It led to the ejection
of a key offensive lineman, to an official getting punched in the
back of the head and to an embarrassing situation in which the
microphone of Referee Bob McElwee remained stuck on and he could be
heard referring to one of the fighting players as a ``clown.''
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was a blowout early. The Redskins scored 27
consecutive points, thanks mainly to running back Stephen Davis,
who torched the Lions before leaving the game in the first half
with what team officials described as a mild injury to his right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis used both cutback and power running to finish with 15
carries for 119 yards and 2 touchdowns in less than two quarters.
One of Davis' runs was spectacular. It occurred in the first
quarter when he sprinted up the middle, was surrounded by three
Lions defensive backs, and outran them all for a 58-yard gain. It
tied running back Tim Smith's run in Super Bowl XXII as the longest
run in Washington's postseason history. Before that run, Davis had
a 1-yard touchdown score.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins will travel to Tampa Bay for a second-round playoff
game next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions scored five minutes into the fourth period on Ron
Rice's 94-year fumble return and then got their lone offensive
touchdown as time ran out on Gus Frerotte's 5-yard pass to Ron
Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bad news for Washington was the loss of its
starting left tackle, Andy Heck, who tore his hamstring. He is out
for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured one of the most bizarre moments of the season.
Washington led by 27-0 midway through the third quarter when
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson and Lions defensive end Robert
Porcher got into a nasty bout. Johnson, who weighs about 60 pounds
less than Porcher, flipped the hulking defensive end like a
hamburger, and the two fought on the ground while officials tried
to break it up.
</P>
<P>
   Then other players got in on the action. One was Redskins
offensive lineman Tre Johnson, who threw a punch at an unidentified
Lions player, but missed, and hit the back judge, Bill Leavy, in
the back of the head. Leavy slowly walked away from the crowd of
players, looking slightly stunned. Johnson was tossed from the game
and will very likely be fined by the league in the coming weeks.
There is also the chance that he could be suspended for the
Redskins' next playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But the weirdness was not over. Brad Johnson, after finally
being separated from Porcher, raised his hands triumphantly, as if
he were Ali after beating Frazier. Then Johnson added to his
pyrotechnics by doing a Hulk Hogan type of pose, as the record
crowd of 79,411 cheered.
</P>
<P>
   As this was happening, McElwee, during a television timeout,
started describing in detail what happened in the fight to another
official. Only McElwee seemed unaware his microphone was stuck
open, and he called Tre Johnson a ``clown.'' McElwee's microphone
remained on for much of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the game was long over. There has not been any doubt
about the talent of Washington's offense _ only St. Louis scored
more points than the Redskins did this season. Washington has been
able to destroy most defenses, using a steady running attack from
Davis, and a passing game headed by Johnson, one of the more
accurate throwers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Washington has been its defense. The unit has
improved its play slightly in the last eight games of the regular
season, but for Washington to have any chance to advance deep into
the playoffs, it needs to play even better.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was not expected to give the Redskins much of a game,
despite the fact the Lions beat Washington in the regular season,
ending an 18-game Redskins winning streak against them. Still,
Detroit lost its final four games of the season, backing into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, 8-8 during the season, had other omens to deal with
as well. The Lions are now 0-20 on the road against the Redskins
since that franchise moved to Washington in 1937, and continued a
league tradition of no team .500 or below ever winning a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's defense played one of its better games of the
season. On the first play from scrimmage, Frerotte was sacked by
linebacker Greg Jones. Frerotte was jumpy for much of the first
half. He was Washington's quarterback until the Redskins released
him after the 1998 season after trading for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte had a poor game until it didn't matter. Some of his
passes were uncatchable, except the one right into the hands of the
Redskins rookie cornerback Champ Bailey for an interception in the
first quarter. Frerotte finished 21 for 46 for 251 yards and 2
interceptions and was sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Lions were equally neurotic, and terrible. The
team had six penalties in the first quarter and three false starts
after two. Lions safety Allen Aldridge was called for
unsportsmanlike conduct after going to the head of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, scoring five of the first six times they had the
ball, took advantage of the numerous Detroit mistakes, and rode the
back of Davis, who has deceptive cat-like moves for someone who is
234 pounds, and can run up the middle with power.
</P>
<P>
   After his first touchdown, Davis smacked the Lions in the teeth
again, running for a 4-yard score. The Redskins later added two
Brett Conway field goals of 33 and 23 yards and a Johnson-to-Albert
Connell 30-yard pass for a 27-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, Washington got a scare when Davis had
his right leg caught in an awkward position after players from both
teams went scrambling for a loose ball. It looked like it could be
a terrible injury until the Redskins announced that Davis had a
mild sprain of his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   After lying on the ground for several minutes, Davis got up and
ran off the field to the sideline. If the score was not so
lopsided, he would have probably returned.

SYRACUSE BEATS MIAMI, 67-55  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ University of Miami basketball fans heckled the senior
forward Etan Thomas of Syracuse throughout Saturday's Big East
game. But by the end, Thomas had won over the hecklers and the
undefeated Orangemen had won again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Thomas said following Syracuse's 67-55 victory
before 3,511 at Miami Arena. ``After the game, they started talking
about me coming down to play for the Miami Heat. I guess I got
their respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Syracuse's career leader in blocked shots and its top
scorer this season, had a rather quiet game by his standards. He
made 5 of 7 field-goal attempts along the way to 12 points and
managed a team-leading 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Thomas' block of Mario Bland's shot with 19 seconds
left that sealed the victory, Syracuse's 11th straight and second
in the Big East. Miami trailed by just 5 points at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the shots _ they just didn't go,'' said Bland, Miami's
center, after his team shot a season-low 31.3 percent from the
field, its worst since February 1996 against Syracuse. ``They won,
but in my opinion, they shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, going on the road for the first time this season did
not turn out to be so taxing for the Orangemen. After fashioning a
10-0 start in the Carrier Dome, they were able to put
recognition-hungry Miami on its heels early and hold on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we needed to win this game,'' Syracuse Coach Jim
Boeheim said. ``If we lost, all everybody would be writing is how
we couldn't handle playing on the road for the first time. It's a
good thing we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to win on the road was not much of a concern, though,
Boeheim said. Syracuse has its top seven players returning from a
team that went 7-2 on the road in Big East games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a real good first half,'' Boeheim said, ``and in the
second half, our offense just went south. And we had too many
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse shot just 35.7 percent in the second half and had 21
turnovers for the game. But it built such a lead _ 17 points late
in the first half _ that Miami (8-6, 1-1 Big East) could not
recover. ``It looked like we forced them out of their offense in
the first half,'' Boeheim said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story in the second half, as Miami closed
once to 4 points. Still, the senior forwards Damone Brown and Ryan
Blackwell contributed mightily through the game's late stages. They
accounted for 15 of Syracuse's final 21 points and wound up with 14
each.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim went to a spread offense more in the second half in
trying to protect a lead, and he was not pleased with the results,
citing his team's poor shooting percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But one big shot that fell came from Jason Hart, a senior guard
who also had 14 points. Miami had moved within 38-34 with 13
minutes 35 seconds to play when Hart sank a 3-pointer to complete a
13-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to go in,'' Hart said. ``We've got three
guys who know how high the stakes are every night. We know what to
do to close out games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, the Big East's best defensive team with a
58.1-point-against average coming into Saturday, put strong clamps
on Miami's scorers in molding a commanding 36-21 halftime lead.
Miami shot a paltry 8 for 34 from the field, 23.5 percent, as
Syracuse moved ahead by 11-1 at the game's start and soon had a
15-4 edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed a wake-up call at halftime,'' Thomas said. ``And
it looks like they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Hurricanes climbed back in the game early in the
second half, with guard Johnny Hemsley contributing 8 points in the
first five minutes.

FISHER-COLUMN -- Near midnight a week ago Friday, as clocks moved
toward the year 2000, a goodly number of Plato's 75 residents
gathered at the gazebo on the south side of Missouri 32.
</P>
<P>
   A bonfire provided light and some warmth. The Bank of Plato
across the road was serving coffee, hot chocolate and snacks. The
crowd was festive.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight _ 12:00:01 a.m. to be exact _ the crowd
cheered. At that moment Plato, founded in 1858 deep in the Ozarks
and unaccountably named for the Greek philosopher, became an
incorporated village.

   BANKRUPTCIES-GAMBLING -- Cathy, a 34-year-old saleswoman in
Kansas City, had several platinum cards as proof of her good
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Then she started gambling at area riverboats.
</P>
<P>
   She'd bet a few hundred dollars in cash. When she lost that,
she'd get cash advances on her credit cards at the casinos'
customer service counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me sick, but the more sick it made me, the more I
would go back,'' she said. ``They weren't going to beat me; I was
going to beat them. But they won.''
</P>
<P>
   She gambled away an estimated $10,000 to $20,000 between 1996
and 1998. In late 1998, faced with credit card debts of more than
$45,000, she declared personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Bankruptcies citing gambling debts as a
contributing factor have jumped since the riverboats entered the
Kansas City market in mid-1994.

   SUMMER-BASKETBALL -- One of the most successful high school
basketball coaches in the country, Raytown South's Bud Lathrop,
feels a bit lonely these days.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that when Lathrop had a top prospect, college
coaches would flock to his gym on recruiting trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Owens, Digger Phelps, Nolan Richardson all have come
through here,'' Lathrop said. But, he said, college coaches don't
come around as much now.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Summer basketball. College coaches now do much of
their recruiting during the summer _ at games, tournaments and
camps completely unrelated to the athletes' high schools. Some
athletes are playing more games for their summer league teams than
for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Issues surrounding summer leagues are at the heart of a federal
grand jury probe that has sidelined three university basketball
players from Kansas City. The players _ Kareem Rush, JaRon Rush and
Andre Williams _ all have reportedly acknowledged receiving
payments or benefits from their former summer league coach, a
Kansas City businessman or a Los Angeles sports agent.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is exploring whether somebody paid amateur
athletes to play basketball, thereby endangering their eligibility
and potentially defrauding federally funded universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury isn't alone in looking at summer basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This week in San Diego the NCAA will discuss changes to
basketball recruiting rules to limit the influence of summer
coaches.

   DEBATE-DEMOCRATS (JOHNSTON, Iowa) -- In an hour of polite
slights and digs at nuanced policy differences, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley demonstrated Saturday that they mostly agreed on
government's role in this new century.

<P>
   Yet the men also showed how starkly their campaigns and
characters differ in manner and mode.

WITH FOCUS ON NEW YEAR, TOWN GRABS ATTENTION WITH INCORPORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   PLATO, Mo. _ Near midnight a week ago
Friday, as clocks moved toward the year 2000, a goodly number of
Plato's 75 residents gathered at the gazebo on the south side of
Missouri 32.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bonfire provided light and some warmth. The Bank of Plato
across the road was serving coffee, hot chocolate and snacks. The
crowd was festive.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight _ 12:00:01 a.m. to be exact _ the crowd
cheered. At that moment Plato, founded in 1858 deep in the Ozarks
and unaccountably named for the Greek philosopher, became an
incorporated village.
</P>
<P>
   The timing _ one second after midnight _ was a outright gambit
to grab media coverage. Plato _ bonfire, snacks and cheering _
would be one of those good-news stories. It would be the first new
town in Missouri in the year 2000 and, likely as not, the newest
incorporated entity in the nation in a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know,'' said Lyle Adcock, president of the bank.
``Some people say the millennium doesn't start until 2001. But give
us a break. We were having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was a serious underpinning to what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   Plato, like every other place, is looking for money,
specifically state and federal grants and loans to build sewers,
improve its all-but-nonexistent infrastructure and treat
wastewater. Now, instead of going hat in hand to the township or
county and asking for the little money those bodies have,
incorporation allows Plato to be a player on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The incorporation takes in 220 acres in and around town. For the
first time, a village board of trustees can pass ordinances and
establish zoning regulations. In short, setting a house trailer
willy-nilly is likely a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Plato's incorporation was not a rarity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Ballard of Ashland, Mo., a former governmental affairs
specialist with the Missouri Cooperative Extension Service who now
does small-town strategy consulting, says that each year about a
dozen towns _ most in the eastern part of the state _ incorporate.
Another recent incorporation was Irena in Worth County.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporation, said Ballard, gets the bureaucrats' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato can now go to the government on its own and get grants,
loans and all kinds of expertise,'' he said. ``The days of having a
bake sale for town improvements are gone. They're just too
expensive, and things like sewers and water systems have gotten too
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Biram, a village trustee, said: ``This sounds crazy, but
we've got to get a handle on our growth. We should have done this
years and years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth and Plato would seem antonyms. Tucked in the northwest
corner of Texas County, the community is much like it was a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   There's a smattering of houses, the bank, a school, a cafe, a
post office, a store and a gas station. The streets are unpaved
except for the highway, which until the 1950s was a gravel trace
through the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Until a couple of years ago, Cecil Benson, now in his 90s and in
a rest home, charged a single dollar for a haircut here.
</P>
<P>
   Plato on the surface seems untouched _ where farmers and
cattlemen come to drink morning coffee and the only traffic
problems come when school starts or lets out. A Springfield
newspaper a few years ago termed it ``The Town That Time Forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been stirrings. Roughly 1,000 homes have hooked
onto the water system in the past couple of years. The bank, once
said to be the smallest in the United States, has seen its assets
grow from $3 million in 1991 to $14 million today.
</P>
<P>
   Off the road and out of sight are acreages holding new,
six-figure houses that would meld seamlessly into tonier parts of
St. Louis and Kansas City. And the school now has 600 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Adcock said Plato was becoming _ of all things _ a bedroom
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draw a circle around Plato and you come up with six fair-sized
towns or cities all within about 30 miles,'' he said. ``Mountain
Grove, Hartville, Lebanon, Waynesville, Licking and Houston. Those
towns have jobs. Professional people. Factories. And, of course, up
at Fort Leonard Wood, the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Adcock said the conventional wisdom had been that only big
cities are subject to people heading out to the countryside for a
quieter, allegedly safer and less harried life. Not so, he said.
There's sprawl here also.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Licking,'' he said. ``It has a new prison. People will
have good state jobs with benefits. And I guarantee you that some
of them will start looking around first thing for some acreage.
What I'm seeing as a banker in the past few years is a lot less
materialism. A lot less desire for `stuff.' People want to be out
in the country. Some of them will be coming our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard said the nature of commuting had been redefined with
dependable cars, better tires, cell phones and essentially cheap
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you see commutes that you would have shook your head at 20
years ago,'' he said. ``Sixty, 70 miles one way is nothing
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Willia ``Tiny'' Duncan, who sells real estate a dozen miles
north of here at Evening Shade, said eight housing developments,
most with an acre or more per dwelling, had sprung up in the area
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the back gate of Fort Leonard,'' she said. ``You hear
of the military downsizing. But the fort's grown with the new
engineers school. The tour of duty is five years, plenty of time to
buy a house. And the retirees _ they look at this country and
figure they can't do any better than here _ cost of living, space,
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is helping with a petition drive to incorporate Evening
Shade. Like Plato, Evening Shade's overriding challenge is sewers
and wastewater.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde McWilliams, soon to be 88, who lives in the country north
of Plato, said he was pleased with the incorporation. But he said,
grinning, that he would be seeing fewer of his Plato friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old-timer,'' he said. ``I try to stay out of `town'
much as I can.''

THE SIX DEGREES OF DON NELSON: THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE DON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slide over, Kevin Bacon, it's time you share the epicenter of
the universe ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Bacon starred in ``Wild Things'' with Matt Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dillon appeared in ``Malcolm X'' with Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee directed ``He Got Game'' starring Ray Allen.
</P>
<P>
   4. Allen plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, coached by George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   5. Karl was head coach for the Golden State Warriors in '88,
under a GM named Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: As difficult as it is to watch a movie without
connections to Bacon, it's going to be equally impossible for
prospective Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to hire a coach completely
clean of Nelson's greasy fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is no longer the NBA's best coach, but he's certainly the
best connected.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bacon whose bevy of movies and often convoluted traces to
other actors has spawned a Web site, a book, a board game and a
nationwide cult-fad called the ``Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.'' But
_ given that even Bacon can be saddled with a Nellie Number (5) _
it's Nelson who has developed connections to be undisputed
epicenter of basketball coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, in fact, is the Kevin Bacon of basketball. Or is Bacon
merely the Nellie of Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   Like Bacon, Nelson's career is more about quantity than quality,
with too much ``Footloose'' and not enough ``A Few Good Men''. Both
are active (Bacon has starred in 35 movies since debuting in
``Animal House'' in '78; Nelson has 895 coaching victories in 21
years). Both are decorated (Bacon earned a Golden Globe award for
his role in ``The River Wild''; Nelson was named one of the NBA's
Top 10 Greatest Coaches). Both are innovative (Bacon's sadistic
scientist role in ``Flatliners''; Nelson's introduction of quirky
lineups, point forwards and trapping defenses).
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, however, both are very, very well connected in
their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ``Six Degrees of Separation'' theory that posits we
are all connected by six or fewer stages of circumstance or
acquaintance, Pennsylvania college students armed with free time
and cheap whiskey researched that everyone from Marlon Brando, to
Queen Latifah, to Bob Barker, to O.J. Simpson and even Liberace
could be connected to Bacon. In fact, according to a University of
Virginia computer program dubbed ``The Oracle of Bacon,'' he has
six-step links to 240,000 actors and actresses with the exception
of Lassie.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as eerie is Nelson, who has forged more organized labor
connections than John Gotti during his coaching stints in Milwaukee
('76-87), Golden State ('89-95), New York ('95-96) and Dallas
('97-present). His far-reaching tentacles grew over an
unprecedented 38 years in the NBA, earning him five titles as a
player with the Celtics, three coach of the year awards and
participation in more than 3,000 games, second only to Atlanta's
Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   Of the league's 28 other head coaches, 20 of them can be linked
to Nelson in two moves or less.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dan Issel of the Nuggets has a Nellie Number of 2.
An assistant on Issel's staff is John Lucas, who played for Nelson
in Milwaukee in '87. Also a 2 is Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who
recently hired assistant Jim Cleamons, whom Nelson fired in Dallas
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eight coaches are direct branches off the Nelson coaching tree,
including the Bucks' George Karl (head coach for '88 Warriors under
GM Nelson), the Knicks' Jeff Van Gundy (assistant with the '95
Knicks under head coach Nelson) and the Blazers' Mike Dunleavy
(played on '85 Bucks coached by Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's coaching fraternity is so Nellie-knit, in fact, that
only four are more than three separations from Nelson. The New
Jersey Nets' Don Casey is the farthest removed, taking six steps:
1. Casey was an assistant on '98 Nets under head coach John
Calipari. 2. Calipari is an assistant on '00 Sixers under head
coach Larry Brown. 3. Brown coached '94 Pacers with assistant Gar
Heard. 4. Heard was an assistant with '98 Pistons under head coach
Alvin Gentry. 5. Gentry was an assistant on '91 Clippers under head
coach Mike Schuler. 6. Schuler was an assistant with '86 Bucks
under a head coach named Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to roots, there is no Whoa! in Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   It's been easy to trace him _ to everyone from Ozzie and Harriet
to Bugs Bunny (1. Bugs starred in ``Space Jam'' with Shawn Bradley.
2. Bradley was acquired by the Mavericks in a trade made by
Nelson.) Now, it's time to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nelson will not return to the bench, the Mavericks will
have a new coach next season. And since the new coach probably will
not be a one-step move like son, Donnie, it could be as complicated
as a four-step connection like Jerry Sloan. Whatever the case,
chances are the ``Six Degrees of Separation from Nellie'' will
provide at least a bitter Nelson aftertaste to the flavor of his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if Bacon is available?
chart \Nsubheds:SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM NELLIE
\Nagatea:Given Don Nelson's 44-104 record in Dallas, the Mavericks'
league-high streak of 10 consecutive nonplayoff seasons and their
epitaph as ``Worst Professional Sports Franchise of the '90s,''
logic would dictate hiring a successor with a high Nellie Number
next season. But, given the fact seemingly all NBA coaching careers
run through him at some point, finding the missing link in the
Nelson chain won't be easy.

VINCE CARTER DESERVED OLYMPIC STRIPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who voted against Toronto's Vince Carter being on the
2000 U.S. Olympic basketball team ought to never vote for anything
else for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   How anyone could exclude the game's greatest showman is beyond
me. But the nine-person USA Basketball selection committee voted,
6-3, to have Milwaukee's Ray Allen in the Olympic Games rather than
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is one of the reasons why the NBA went to great lengths
to change the rules during the off-season. He is Mr. Excitement,
able to put goosebumps on even the most casual basketball fan.
</P>
<P>
   We, as sportswriters, are often fans of the sports we cover. We
get in free and have some pretty good seats. But we're there
because we love the game. We're there because we also love to be
entertained by players like Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, we all rush home to see ESPN SportsCenter to
watch highlights of Carter soaring through the air. Why he won't be
able to soar through the air while representing our country in the
Olympics does nothing but cheat basketball fans all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all fans at heart,'' said Isiah Thomas, a 12-time
all-star named to the 1980 U.S. Olympic team that boycotted the
Moscow Summer Games. ``And at the end of the day you want to be
able to sit down at home and eat some popcorn and a hotdog, get
something to drink, and watch the game and maybe somebody will make
you go oooh and aaah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, when you look at Vince Carter, if he's not the best
two-guard that's playing right now, then he's got to be the second-
or third-best behind Kobe Bryant and Allan Houston. I don't know
what the people were looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the movie he stars in, Ray Allen's got game, but his is
below the rim where most of us fat-belly folks play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is really good, but it's hard to put Ray Allen ahead of
Vince Carter,'' said Sacramento Kings general manager Jerry
Reynolds. ``Vince is about flash, youth and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the USA Basketball selection committee wanted to
pick someone who would accept 12th-man status. Hey, I think Chuck
Nevitt or Bruno Sundov might relish such a role.
</P>
<P>
   At least real basketball fans know the score. They continue to
pour in more votes for Carter _ almost a million _ than any other
player for the Feb. 13 NBA All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks fans are still buzzing about the spectacular four-dunk
display Carter put on at Reunion Arena on Dec. 30. Thomas saw it,
too, from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a real 360-degree dunk,'' Thomas raved. ``Most players
do a 180. But that was a real 360.''
</P>
<P>
   Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said hes very disappointed
Carter was left off the Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves to be on the team,'' Grunwald said. ``He's one of
the best players in the world right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someone should have slipped a reminder to the USA
Basketball selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:AROUND THE EAST  &LR; agatea:The return of New Jersey Nets
forward Jayson Williams has been pushed back another six-to-eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hoping to start practicing this past week, but his
leg is just too weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a significant strength deficiency in the surgically
repaired leg, so it would be foolhardy, if not irresponsible, to
allow him to practice,'' Nets GM John Nash said. ``As a result,
we're just going to work on strengthening the leg in order to allow
him to play at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Now what's Isaiah Rider up to? He has been suspended twice by
the Atlanta Hawks, and now has the gall to think the Hawks will
re-sign him when he becomes a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they want me,'' Rider said. ``It's a great situation.
They let me do my thing on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls forward Toni Kukoc is back, and that could be bad
news for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc had been out since the fourth game of the season with back
spasms. The poor Bulls have doubled their win total _ from two to
four _ since Kukoc returned this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the Mavericks were only four games ahead of the
Bulls, who have the worst record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 12-6 with Mavericks castoff Anthony Carter starting at
point guard in place of the injured Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:AROUND THE WEST  &LR; agatea:The Minnesota Timberwovles
followed an eight-game losing streak by winning eight of their next
nine games, including Thursday's 98-96 victory against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, a Timberwolves executive denied a published report
that they're trying to trade Terrell Brandon to the New York Knicks
for Kurt Thomas, Chris Childs and John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in waste management,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Just call the Vancouver Grizzlies road warriors.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3-52 in their previous 55 road games, the Grizzlies
have now won three of their past 12 road games. That includes
breaking a 30-game road losing streak in Dallas, and winning the
second game played in Miami's brand new AmericanAirlines Arena this
past Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal averages 34 points
and 16 rebounds in his last six games and is the leading candidate
to win this year's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for Denver Nuggets point guard Nick Van Exel is $77
million for five years. Five years are guaranteed for $50.5
million, with years six and seven guaranteed if he meets certain
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; subheds:SPOTLIGHT ON Malone stands his ground In his 14-plus
seasons in the NBA, perennial Utah Jazz all-star forward Karl
Malone thought he had seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mavericks coach/gerneral manager Don Nelson bumped him
in the chest Thursday night during a scene worthy of professional
wrestling, Malone couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out there playing a game, whether you like the way I
play or not, I think you're totally out of line to get in a
player's face like that,'' Malone said. ``I have the utmost respect
for every coach because of their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's a fine line that you don't cross, and I think
\RNelson\S crossed that line and I have no respect for that in this
game. He was up in my face. You don't go and pick an argument with
a player. I don't appreciate it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who was fined $10,000 and suspended by the NBA from last
night's game against Atlanta, said he was merely defending his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Malone defended the rough way he attacks the basket, with his
knee out high. One of those high knees caught Mavericks center
Shawn Bradley squarely in the stomach, prompting Nelson to blow his
stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm going to the basket, how many guys are really trying
to block my shots, or how many guys are really fouling me hard?''
Malone asked. ``I've played this game for 15 years, and I know when
a guy is going to block my shot and when he's going to commit a
hard foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I go to the hole, and I'm going to go to the hole
like that until I walk away from this game. I go hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, 36, who said he doesn't know when he'll retire, said
Nelson is the first coach to bump him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to apologize for and I will not apologize to
anybody for anything,'' said Malone, who was fined $10,000 by the
NBA for the incident. ``If my kids were watching that and they ask
me what happened when this old man walked up to me in my face, I'm
going to say he was out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the court, you defend your territory. And no
one has a right to come out there, especially off the bench as a
coach and do anything like that.''

COWBOYS SHOULD TOSS CONSERVATIVE GAME PLAN AND AIR IT OUT AGAINST
VIKINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Conventional wisdom screams for the Cowboys to
avoid getting into a shootout with the Minnesota Vikings today.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom, in this instance, may be a blueprint
for narrow defeat. And the Cowboys are interested in more than
keeping it close.
</P>
<P>
   As a seven-point underdog against the Vikings, the Cowboys take
a seven-game road losing streak into this NFC wild-card game at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Cowboys learned from their Monday night loss
inside this building Nov. 8 is that no lead _ even a 17-0 lead _ is
safe against the Vikings because the Minnesota offense most likely
will find the end zone a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota set an NFL record last season by scoring 558 points.
This season, the Vikings scored 399 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have averaged 29.8 points per game the past two
seasons. By comparison, the Cowboys have scored 29 or more points
only 10 times in 33 games during the same two seasons. This
includes a scant three times in 1999 and none since beating
Washington, 38-20, nearly 21/2 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In their Nov. 8 meeting, the Cowboys (albeit they lost Emmitt
Smith to a broken hand and Troy Aikman to a concussion) blew a 17-0
lead as the Vikings ran off 27 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings quarterback Jeff George threw three touchdown passes
that night: two to Randy Moss, including a 47-yarder, and one to
Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they like it or not, the Cowboys are going to have to
throw downfield with Troy Aikman looking for Raghib Ismail on the
slant or Jason Tucker on the deep post or Chris Brazzell on the
``go'' route.
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, must be set up by the play-action pass. And
the play-action pass must gain its credibility from a successful
running game.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns before breaking
his right hand with six minutes remaining in the first half Nov. 8.
He has some unfinished business ahead of him today.
</P>
<P>
   So does the entire Cowboys offense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey was asked this week about ``shortening'' the
game _ thereby keeping Moss &AMP; Co. off the field as much as possible
_ by controlling the ball, staying in the huddle an extra couple of
seconds, maybe using long snap counts, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we want to keep the score down ... when the ``Vikings''
have the ball,'' said Gailey, who wouldn't tip his hand on exact
offensive strategy, except to say that he is less interested in how
the Cowboys score than he is in how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes two minutes \Rto score\S ... fine. Just score,''
Gailey emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   No one around Valley Ranch this week has been naive enough to
think that the Vikings can be shut out, or even shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In their last two games against the Cowboys (Nov. 8 game and
1998 Thanksgiving Day), the Vikings have 779 total yards, 73 points
and two victories.
</P>
<P>
   Moss and Carter have combined for 25 catches for 505 yards and
seven touchdowns in those two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, meanwhile, have 841 total yards, 53 points and two
losses to show for those two games.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between these two offenses (and, to some
extent, these two teams overall) is that the Vikings do a better
job of finishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have won eight of their past 10 games, averaging
27.9 points per game. The Cowboys have lost six of their past 10
games, including two of their past three, averaging 24.3 points per
game during the last 21/2 months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the difference of a missed field goal per game.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Richie Cunningham, the Cowboys now have a field-goal
kicker Gailey can trust. Eddie Murray, 43, who last kicked for
these Vikings in '97 before coming out of retirement last month,
has made 7 of 9 field-goal attempts, including his past five.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cowboys being able to score touchdowns rather
than field goals and being able to run off some clock in the
process of scoring points are factors in which team wins or loses
today.
</P>
<P>
   What we know is that the Vikings need to be outscored.
</P>
<P>
   They will score points, and they can do it by striking quickly
or putting together long drives.
</P>
<P>
   With George capable of seeing the whole field, and with Moss,
Carter and Jake Reed all running through the Cowboys' secondary,
the Vikings are able to attack deep as well as keep opposing
defenders honest by working the underneath routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit back there and rot ... not against these guys,''
said Cowboys free safety George Teague. ``Our philosophy each week
is to make the other team go the hard way, make 'em go on 10- or
11-play drives. We feel most teams, eventually, will make a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Vikings are smart enough to see if you're playing deep
just to \Rprevent\S giving up the deep ball,'' Teague explained.
``So at some point, you've got to make a play back there.''
</P>
<P>
   No team turned the ball over more than the Vikings in 1999 _ 40
times (21 interceptions, 19 fumbles), tied with Arizona for the
NFL's worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys need turnovers to get Moss, Carter, et al., off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   And put the ball in the hands of Aikman and Smith. Because what
the Cowboys know is this:
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kansas City's Elvis Grbac was able to get the Chiefs
not only into a shootout with the Vikings, but was able to win it,
31-28. If Grbac can do that, then why not Aikman?
</P>
<P>
   In late November, San Diego's Jim Harbaugh and Kenny Bynum
pushed the Vikings to the brink while getting the Chargers involved
in a high-scoring affair (35-27 loss for the Chargers). If Harbaugh
and Bynum can do that, then why not Aikman and Smith?
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the Chiefs and Chargers went against conventional
wisdom, which should tell the underdog Cowboys that they might want
to find the nearest window inside the Metrodome today.
</P>
<P>
   And give conventional wisdom a toss.

VIKINGS' PLAYMAKERS POSE SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hip-hop world that is the NFL 2000, there are two types
of creatures: players and player haters.
</P>
<P>
   No team fields more players (read: playmakers) than the
shot-calling Minnesota Vikings (10-6), who play the 8-8 Cowboys in
today's NFC wild-card game in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Cris Carter and Randy Moss are the second-most-productive
pass-catching duo in league history. Running back Robert Smith can
score from anywhere on the field, and quarterback Jeff George's
right arm has few equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have Carter and Moss, and now Robert Smith is
back,'' Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith lamented. ``It's not even
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, ready or not...
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who were the original players in their title years,
have been given their charge for today's game: Be player haters or
get played.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings and their playmakers have been held to less than 20
points only three times in the past two seasons _ and they scored
17 in each of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who set a rookie record with 17 receiving touchdowns last
season, did anything but slump, catching more passes for more
yardage. Despite facing defenses designed to stop him, Moss caught
80 passes for an NFC-high 1,413 yards. He scored 12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, fourth in the NFL in career receptions, caught 90 passes
for 1,241 yards and 13 touchdowns this season, improving in each
category over 1998. Moss and Carter came within 41 yards of the
record for a receiving duo in a season, set by Miami's Mark Duper
and Mark Clayton in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings used a lot of three-receiver sets last season with
Jake Reed. In 1999, they thrived with more two-receiver formations,
and Carter credits his improvement to that and Moss' presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing opposite Randy at the X-receiver spot that Michael
Irvin played so well is better for my style,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the early-season quarterback change _ from Randall
Cunningham to George _ was a key factor as well. George has the
third-highest quarterback rating in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff gets me the ball more and allows me to do things I like
in the offense,'' Carter said. ``They try to get me the ball
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings turned to George after Cunningham struggled during a
2-4 start. George _ signed as a free agent in the off-season after
stints in Indianapolis, Atlanta and Oakland _ led Minnesota to an
8-2 record the rest of the way. He passed for 2,816 yards and 23
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Cowboys will try to contain the Vikings. The defensive
line will try to rattle George with pressure to take the heat off
the secondary, which is healthier than it has been in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders, who was hobbled during the first
meeting between the two teams Nov. 8 with groin and hamstring
strains, said he's as injury-free as he has been in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith, who missed the past three games with a
strained hamstring, might start, and nickel cornerback Kevin
Mathis, who missed the past month with a sprained knee, is expected
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you had Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes, I don't know if
you have enough talent to make up for those two guys,'' Sanders
said. ``But I'm better this time. I think it will allow us to do
more things and not just sit back and wait on what they are going
to do. We are going to have some fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kevin Smith said earlier, the addition of Robert Smith to
the Vikings' offense is ``unfair.'' Smith rushed for 1,015 yards _
including a 70-yard touchdown run two weeks ago _ despite missing
three games with a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can take the ball to the house,'' Cowboys defensive
coach Dave Campo said. ``It's like picking your poison. You are not
going to stop them. So it will be a chess game out there. Where are
we at? What are they tempted to do? What do we need to do to slow
them down? They have outstanding receivers, a great running back
and an outstanding quarterback. You can put them all together,
shake them around and see what's the best way to get the job
done.'' Added Sanders: ``I wish our offense would let the clock
tick down to the last second before every snap. Because the more
you keep those guys off the field the less opportunities they
have.''

NFL BECOMES A PARODY OF PARITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL playoffs have turned into a lottery. Go ahead, pick a
team. Any team.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams? The Jacksonville Jaguars? The Indianapolis
Colts? The Minnesota Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is playing favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, the fifth-seeded Cowboys (8-8) might have as good a
chance as the top-seeded St. Louis Rams (13-3). Of the six teams in
the NFC playoffs, the Cowboys have the only quarterback who has won
a playoff game. The Rams, whose opponents combined for an NFL-worst
93-163 record, have only 12 players with playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, the second-seeded Indianapolis Colts (13-3) have the
same record as the fourth-seeded Tennessee Titans (13-3). And the
Titans, who have won four in a row, sport the longest winning
streak of the 12 playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wide-open,'' Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders
said. ``I think anybody could win it. There's a movie out right now
called /Any Given Sunday''.''
</P>
<P>
   The only given this postseason is that there are none.
</P>
<P>
   In NFL history, five wild-card teams have reached the Super
Bowl. The 1980 Oakland Raiders and the 1997 Denver Broncos are the
only wild-card teams to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   However, jokers are wild this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Most Las Vegas oddsmakers like the Rams to win Super Bowl XXXIV,
but even the Cowboys are given a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been invited to the dance, you can take the prom
queen home,'' Seattle Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown said. ``You're
in the dance. Everybody has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Super Bowl contenders entered the playoffs doing the
moonwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Only three postseason qualifiers ended the regular season with
at least three consecutive victories. The Miami Dolphins went 2-6
in the second half of the season. The Cowboys are 4-6 in their past
10 games. The Seattle Seahawks have lost five of six. The Detroit
Lions ended the regular season with a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl Shuffle began yesterday, and until the music
stops Jan. 30 in Atlanta, this postseason promises to play out at
78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the word is `watered down' or not, but there's
not a great or dominant team out there,'' FOX-TV analyst John
Madden said. ``In that, there's no real givens where you can say,
`This is a team that is going to the Super Bowl and win the Super
Bowl.' Therefore, it's wide-open. As a football purist and
traditionalist, I really don't like it. I don't think that that's
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think because of that, this has been one of the most
interesting years. Not a good year. Not a talented year. But an
interesting year. I think that's going to carry through the
playoffs. I don't think there's going to be great football, but I
think they're going to be interesting games.''
</P>
<P>
   Parity has become parody.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL brags that for the first time in history four teams
finished with 13 or more victories, but the league declined to
publicize the fact that a record nine teams finished .500. The
previous high was six in 1974 and '83.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions and the Cowboys both got in this postseason tournament
despite going .500. Before this season, only three 8-8 teams ever
had secured postseason berths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good year for the NFC,'' New York Giants
quarterback Kerry Collins said. ``I don't know what the explanation
is for it. I don't know if these things go in cycles or what, but
... there are a lot of football teams that obviously didn't play
the way they wanted to play all season and their record shows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville was the only one of the six division winners from
last season to repeat, and seven of the 12 playoff teams from 1998
failed to qualify this season. Three of those teams _ the New York
Jets, the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers _ lost
their head coaches last week.
</P>
<P>
   The other five division winners this season finished at .500 or
below a year ago. The Colts established the biggest turnaround in
NFL history, going from 3-13 to 13-3. The Rams finished 4-12 a year
ago, and the Redskins were 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little difference between the top teams and the
bottom teams,'' said Coach Dan Reeves, whose Atlanta Falcons went
from 7-9 in 1997 to 14-2 and the NFC title last season to 5-11 this
season. ``I think our season last year gave everybody hope that you
can go from a real poor football team to a real good football team
in one year. Or vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two things missing from the playoffs this year: the
San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966-98, the Cowboys, the 49ers and the Packers had 54
playoff appearances, 17 Super Bowl appearances and 13 Super Bowl
titles. The league's three premier teams have missed the playoffs
in the same season only once.
</P>
<P>
   But Green Bay and San Francisco are home this postseason, and
the Cowboys barely survived the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this thing as the salary cap finally coming home,''
FOX-TV analyst Cris Collinsworth said. ``We saw immediately when
free agency and the salary cap were put into place that teams like
Dallas and San Francisco were able to buy their way around it, but
now they're having to pay that price. And the teams that weren't
able to do that big up-front spending all of a sudden are getting
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings receiver Cris Carter took offense earlier this
week when asked about the ``mediocrity'' in the NFL this season. He
said that is an inaccurate perception based on down years by the
Cowboys, San Francisco, Green Bay and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the emergence of St. Louis and Indianapolis,
they are very good football teams _ in any year,'' Carter said.
``You can make yourself think that they wouldn't be good teams if
it was another year, but that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is picking the Rams or the Colts to end up
meeting in the Super Bowl. For perhaps the first time in history,
these playoffs are missing a prohibitive Super Bowl favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says they like parity, but in reality, everybody
likes the dominant team,'' Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said. ``Then
you can root against them. Or if it happens to be your team, then
you're happy. I think sports has always flourished with the
dominant team, and I think that's the way most fans deep down
inside would like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone is meeting in the middle, someone has to come
out on top. Which team that will be is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be anyone's race,'' Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ``I don't think anyone looks at it and says, `This is
definitely the team. If they don't make it, something is clearly
wrong.' You've got a lot of teams that are pretty much lumped in
there together. A lot of different people are going to have a lot
of different opinions \Rabout who is going to win it\S.''

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cathy, a 34-year-old saleswoman in Kansas
City, had several platinum cards as proof of her good credit.
</P>
<P>
   Then she started gambling at area riverboats.
</P>
<P>
   She'd bet a few hundred dollars in cash. When she lost that,
she'd get cash advances on her credit cards at the casinos'
customer service counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me sick, but the more sick it made me, the more I
would go back,'' she said. ``They weren't going to beat me _ I was
going to beat them. But they won.''
</P>
<P>
   She gambled away an estimated $10,000 to $20,000 between 1996
and 1998. In late 1998, faced with credit card debts of more than
$45,000, she declared personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Bankruptcies citing gambling debts as a
contributing factor have jumped since the riverboats entered the
Kansas City market in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star has examined more than 22,000 bankruptcy
filings from 1994 through 1998 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Kansas
City, the busiest of four federal courthouses in the Western
District of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look in as great detail at bankruptcy filings
in Kansas. But bankruptcy lawyers interviewed for this story
reported similar increases in gambling-related bankruptcies
throughout the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not divided along state lines,'' said Eric
Rajala, an Overland Park lawyer who handles bankruptcy cases.
</P>
<P>
   While bankruptcy filings at the Kansas City courthouse increased
each year, echoing the trend nationwide, bankruptcies citing
gambling as a contributing factor increased at a much faster rate.
</P>
<P>
   The first Kansas City area riverboat casino opened in mid-1994.
In that year, only 13 of the 3,501 bankruptcy filings in Kansas
City _ 0.37 percent _ listed gambling losses. Those citing gambling
as a factor in their bankruptcies had unsecured debts of $241,232.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, 194 of the 5,618 persons who filed _ 3.5 percent _ said
gambling was a contributing factor in their bankruptcies. They
listed unsecured debts of more than $7.5 million, much of it to
credit card companies. (Missouri law prohibits casinos from
directly extending credit, or ``markers,'' to gamblers.)
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy lawyers and gambling counselors say actual figures
might be higher because people are reluctant to admit they have a
gambling problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only debt-ridden gamblers who are the losers. Experts
say consumers pay higher costs because of bankruptcies _ regardless
of cause _ in the form of higher interest rates and fees on credit
cards. Other costs can range from more expensive credit insurance
to footing the bill when problem gamblers enter the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the increase in bankruptcies and you know gambling
has a social cost,'' said William Thompson, a gambling economist
and chairman of the Department of Public Administration at the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not people that can control their gambling,'' he
said. ``The question is what happens after bankruptcy court? Do
they go into treatment or do they just go back home and the next
day someone sends them a new credit card?''
</P>
<P>
   SMR Research Corp. of Hackettstown, N.J., a leading publisher of
in-depth research about consumer financial issues, has studied the
frequency of bankruptcies in counties with legalized casino
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   SMR examined 1996 bankruptcies and found that the filing rate in
2,844 counties with no casinos was 3.96 per thousand. In 298
counties with legalized gambling within their borders, the rate was
4.67 per thousand. And 23 counties with five or more casinos had a
bankruptcy rate of 5.33 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't actually have a problem with the (gambling) industry,
but the odds favor the house,'' said Stu Feldstein of SMR Research.
``Outside the gambling industry itself, does anyone really think
that increased gambling helps consumers' bill-paying ability more
than it hurts?''
</P>
<P>
   Area casino executives referred questions on the topic to the
American Gaming Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president and chief executive officer
of the gaming association, downplayed the role of gambling in
bankruptcies and emphasized the broader economic effect of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there were far bigger factors behind bankruptcies,
including job loss, illness and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to say, `Wow, oh boy, bankruptcies went up
because gambling came to Kansas City,' '' Fahrenkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the December issue of International Gaming &AMP; Wagering
Business, Fahrenkopf also noted that many casinos had been built in
economically depressed areas to create jobs and spur local
economies, including East St. Louis, Ill.; Gary, Ind.; and Tunica,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have debated the link between gambling and the
overall increases in personal bankruptcy filings across the nation
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent rise in consumer bankruptcies is the result of a
number of factors, the relative importance of which is a matter of
sharp and unresolved debate,'' the U.S. Treasury Department said in
a July 1999 report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequent high-risk gambling does appear to be associated with
a greater likelihood of declaring bankruptcy, but the low
prevalence of this type of gambling suggests that it has a
relatively minor impact on the overall bankruptcy rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury report, however, concluded that frequent, high-risk
gamblers had about a 6 percent greater likelihood of filing
bankruptcy. And it called for further study of the issue.

 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Debtors filing for bankruptcy fill out a
Statement of Financial Affairs, a form listing income, property,
gifts, garnishments and other financial information.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Line eight on the form asks for losses within the past year due
to fire, theft, other casualty or gambling. Debtors describe any
losses in those categories or check the box for none.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the debtors in The Star's analysis listed gambling
losses at $100 or less, but owed thousands of dollars. If they were
truthful about their losses, gambling appears to be a trivial
factor in those bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   But most cases citing gambling as a factor noted significant
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, 11 out of 175 Kansas City area debtors who
cited gambling as a contributing factor in their bankruptcies did
not specifically declare the amount of their debts due to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   But of the remaining 164 debtors, the average debt due to
gambling was $9,443. Their average total of unsecured debt was
$45,022.
</P>
<P>
   Many debtors declined to be interviewed or could not be reached
for comment. But here are some examples from public court files:
</P>
<P>
   - A Blue Springs couple who won $6,000 gambling at the
riverboats also lost $30,000, most of it in credit card cash
advances that helped push their credit card debt to more than
$37,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   - A Raytown, Mo., woman earned $22,600 a year but lost $40,000
gambling in a 12-month period. She owed nearly $75,000 to credit
card companies and borrowed an additional $15,000 from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   - A Gladstone, Mo., man lost $80,000 gambling over a two-year
period and owed more than $80,000 to credit card companies.
</P>
<P>
   - A Warrensburg, Mo., man tapped into his 401(k) to offset his
gambling losses of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the riverboats opened in the Kansas City area,
Independence bankruptcy lawyer Joyce Kerber was filing so many
gambling-related bankruptcies that her paralegal suggested she
advertise on a billboard by the casinos. Some clients seemed in
denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one client who didn't admit to having any gambling debt
or gambling losses,'' Kerber said. ``But when the client did his
new budget under Chapter 13 (reorganization), he listed $1,200 a
month he would need for gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the latest national prevalence studies _ one by the
Harvard Medical School, the other commissioned by Congress _ agree
that around 1.6 percent of adults are at risk to develop a
``pathological'' gambling problem at some time in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychiatric Association recognizes pathological
gambling as a disease, one of many impulse control disorders listed
in its diagnostic manual. Recent research, including some projects
financed by the gambling industry, suggests addictive behaviors may
be linked to a genetic flaw.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer last week said gambling addiction played a role in the
botched attempt to hold up an Olathe bank on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Pheng Siriboury, charged with attempting to rob the Bank of
America, was ``addicted to gambling'' and had run up debts _
``maybe as high as $150,000,'' said her attorney, Michael Harris.
Some of those debts were on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   According to SMR Research, four groups are at high risk for
personal bankruptcy: approximately 40 million Americans who have no
health insurance, recently divorced men and women, drivers who do
not have auto insurance, and compulsive gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Although compulsive gamblers represent the smallest of the four
groups, according to the SMR study, they are the fastest-growing
group.
</P>
<P>
   If gambling was an addiction of the '90s, then credit card
issuers indirectly fed the habit by promoting easy credit, some
researchers and debtors' attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit card companies are wanting to push this credit on
anybody that has a pulse,'' said Rajala, the Overland Park, Kan.,
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure to them using their credit cards to go gamble with is
just another version of using the cards. But when they put (ATMs)
in a casino, it's like giving a bottle to an alcoholic and saying,
`Don't get drunk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One bank card issuer went to court to get nearly $90,000 from a
client of Kerber's who acknowledged much of his debt was cash
advances for gambling. The credit card company wanted the
bankruptcy discharged because it said the debtor was running up
charges he knew he could never pay.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the availability of credit cards grows, the credit card
industry is backing bills in Congress seeking to stiffen laws to
make it more difficult to file bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Visa International in New York had no comment on
gambling-related bankruptcies. But a spokesman for MasterCard
International emphasized that bankruptcies for credit card holders
were relatively rare and usually tied to unpredictable life events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 1 percent of bank card accounts end up in bankruptcy,''
said William Binzel, spokesman for MasterCard International in
Washington. ``No credit granter extends credit to anybody with the
assumption that they're not going to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Binzel declined to comment on the effect of ATMs on riverboats.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years ATMs in casinos have been an issue in the
Missouri General Assembly and even within the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf said some members of his industry would like to see
ATMs banned so gamblers would have to step away from gambling
tables. Others argue the machines are a customer convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the UNLV professor who has studied the social and
economic effects of gambling, said ATMs in casinos were a ``major
problem'' because they make it harder for the compulsive gambler to
take a cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone gets in this little tizzy of compulsive gambling,
they should get away from it and go home,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the gambling industry's Fahrenkopf says banning ATMs on
riverboats could be politically problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 7-Eleven in the country that sells lottery tickets has
an ATM in it,'' he said. ``Are we now going to remove all ATMs from
convenience stores or lottery sites?''
</P>
<P>
   As more people accept gambling as legitimate adult
entertainment, the number of gamblers _ and the number of problem
gamblers _ is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Gerstein is a Washington-based researcher with the National
Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago, which
researched the consequences of gambling for Congress last year. He
said gambling debts were a small part of the bankruptcy problem _
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you are going to see more gambling-related bankruptcies
when gambling becomes more accessible,'' Gerstein said. ``There is
a high prevalence of bankruptcy among problem gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers say moving ATMs out of the casinos and changing
bankruptcy laws to make it tougher to discharge gambling debts
might be part of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Looney, executive director with the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey Inc., says compulsive gamblers need to pay
back their debts as part of their recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling awareness should be taught in schools and prisons,
Looney said, and gambling advertisements should be restricted like
tobacco promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Fahrenkopf's American Gaming Association has
established the nonprofit National Center for Responsible Gaming.
The center is providing millions of dollars in research grants to
universities and others to study causes and treatment of
pathological gambling.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the number of gambling-related bankruptcies remains
relatively limited in the bigger picture, each case may tell a tiny
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some debtors interviewed by The Star, including Cathy, said they
started gambling as an escape from stress.
</P>
<P>
   In Cathy's case, it was a troubled marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a drug. I could forget about my home problems,''
she said. ``But it sure didn't help our marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, who has since emerged from Chapter 7 liquidation, still
goes to the riverboats and acknowledges losing $500 as recently as
April.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, she says her 15-year-old son confiscates all her
money before she goes out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to help me control it,'' she said. ``If someone
wants me to go to the boats with them, they have to pay. I'd rather
have something to show for it. Losing that much money is not OK.
It's not OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts my heart.''

   HIDDEN-HILLS (Los Angeles) -- It's the most exclusive, priciest
community in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, home to celebrities and
CEOs, where a house that sells for $1 million is considered a
fixer-upper. Those who live in the 625-home city compare it to an
idyllic suburb of yesteryear, where everbody knows each other -
except for a few celebs who crave privacy - and kids feel safe
playing in the streets. The crime rate in Hidden Hills is almost
zero, thanks to gates, cameras and patrolling guards. It's almost
so isolated and perfect that one resident compared it to something
out of ``The Stepford Wives.'' Among celebrities that own homes
there, according to other residents: Sinbad, Alex Van Halen, Lisa
Marie Presley, Bob Eubanks, Beau Bridges. By Harrison Sheppard

SUMMER BASKETBALL PROGRAMS ARE SURROUNDED BY CORRUPTION

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a fall 1998 survey by the National Association of
Basketball Coaches, 70 percent of Division I college basketball
coaches support summer recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   However, at its meeting this week, the NCAA will consider
competing proposals to either limit the summer recruiting period
from 24 to 14 days, or to eliminate it entirely. All the proposals
are aimed at limiting the influence of summer-league coaches and
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals also would require closer monitoring and greater
financial disclosure of events where coaches are permitted to
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Tranghese, commissioner of the Big East Conference,
isn't convinced the NCAA can stop the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the problems are larger than us,'' he said. ``How do
I, as a commissioner, deal with an agent who's talking to a kid in
the ninth grade? I think the problem is societal. It pains me to
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   KU men's basketball head coach Roy Williams agrees there are no
easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't cure college basketball's problems by cutting out
summer recruiting,'' Williams said. ``Some people think the abuses
would stop if college coaches stopped going to the summer
tournaments. But think back to when you were 16. If somebody
offered me a trip to Las Vegas when I was 16, would I worry about
whether the coaches were there. No, I'd take the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams still is concerned, however, and said parents should
keep control of the recruiting pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said the best decisions are made when the
youngster makes the decision with guidance from the parents,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get somebody from the outside, it's unusual to have
someone whose only concern is what's best for the youngster.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Shaw, chancellor of Syracuse University, was chairman of
the NCAA's Division I basketball task force. He favors any proposal
that will make recruiters deal more directly with high school
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to believe that the high school coaches have not
only the student's athletic progress in mind, but also their
academic and social progress,'' Shaw said. ``That's what they're
there for. They're educators.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA also is seeking greater cooperation with shoe
companies, whose money often drives the frenzy of summer
basketball. Sonny Vaccaro, who deals with coaches for Adidas,
acknowledged his company's role in the process. But his solution is
novel and unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not allow any company affiliated with athletic situations _
Gatorade, shoe companies _ to give any money to anybody at the
amateur level,'' Vaccaro said. ``We sponsor teams because we want
to see the best kids at our tournaments. When the corporations give
money, they expect results.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro is not willing to leave the court to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Nike will own everything,'' he said. ``If one person
owned everything ... could you imagine the corruption then?''
</P>
<P>
   Further down the basketball food chain, high school coaches and
players try to deal with a flawed system that isn't all bad, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real good AAU coaches and a lot with poor
characters,'' said Rick Zych, boys basketball coach at Bishop Miege
High School. ``I've been around some of the coaches who believe
that grades and hard work are important. But for the most part, AAU
coaches only care about the basketball player. The high school
coaches see the kids daily, can talk about work habits, know how
the kid performs academically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Piggie defends the summer leagues, saying they keep some
youths who might otherwise be on the streets out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get blasted for trying to help these kids,'' Piggie said,
``and that's not fair. I'm trying to help these kids for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AAU atmosphere these kids face is like NBA or college
atmosphere. They travel, and they play against the best kids in the
country. There's a lot of pressure to perform, but it lets you know
where your game really is at.''
</P>
<P>
   Lathrop, who has won more than 800 games in his 41 years as
coach, said summer basketball wasn't a true gauge of a player's
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a college coach judge kids in those games? Those games
are like a gym class,'' Lathrop said. ``They just run up and down
the floor, and whoever has the ball shoots it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Oliver, a Raytown South junior with dreams of playing
big-time college ball, has decided not to play summer basketball,
as he has in past summers.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that the system is rocked with scandal. It just doesn't
meet his needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said: ``I'd rather go to the gym and shoot 500 times
instead of shooting 10 times in an AAU game.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One of the most successful high school
basketball coaches in the country, Raytown (Mo.) South's Bud
Lathrop, feels a bit lonely these days.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that when Lathrop had a top prospect, college
coaches would flock to his gym on recruiting trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Owens, Digger Phelps, Nolan Richardson all have come
through here,'' Lathrop said. But college coaches don't come around
as much now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is summer basketball. College coaches now do much of
their recruiting during the summer _ at games, tournaments and
camps unrelated to the athletes' high schools. Some athletes are
playing more games for their summer-league teams than for their
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Issues surrounding summer leagues are at the heart of a federal
grand jury probe that has sidelined three university basketball
players from Kansas City. The players _ Kareem Rush, JaRon Rush and
Andre Williams _ all have reportedly acknowledged receiving
payments or benefits from their former summer-league coach, a
Kansas City businessman or a Los Angeles sports agent.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is exploring whether amateur athletes were paid
to play basketball, thereby endangering their eligibility and
potentially defrauding federally funded universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury isn't alone in looking at summer basketball
programs.
</P>
<P>
   This week in San Diego the National Collegiate Athletic
Association will discuss changes to basketball recruiting rules to
limit the influence of summer coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these individuals operate in a structure devoid of any
accountability,'' an NCAA task force reported last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Summer basketball tournaments _ often held by the Amateur
Athletic Union _ have been around for decades. The teams, organized
independently, can be sponsored by corporations or charitable
groups, which often pay for travel, uniforms and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches engaged by the sponsors recruit players and run the
teams. The best players move to premier teams, hoping that head
college coaches, with more time in the summer to travel, will be
able to evaluate them.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new basketball book, Sole Influence: Basketball,
Corporate Greed and the Corruption of America's Youth, real money
began to flow into youth basketball in 1996. That year,
Philadelphia's Kobe Bryant became the first academically qualified
player to turn pro after high school, noted the book's authors, Dan
Wetzel of Basketball Times and Don Yaeger of Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as Nike and Adidas pour millions of dollars into
traveling teams of high school all-stars and flashy camps where top
prospects dunk in front of college recruiters. Professional sports
agents also have begun attending the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches of those all-star teams sometimes receive lucrative
consulting contracts with the shoe companies. Former Kansas City
coach Myron Piggie, for whom the Rush brothers and Williams played
while in high school, received a consulting contract that he said
was worth $50,000 a year to tout Nike products and take his team to
summer tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   As for the players, University of Kansas basketball player Drew
Gooden put it frankly: They get free gear, clothes and shoes.
``Things like that corrupt a kid's mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe company spokesmen say their only interest is to market
their products and provide opportunities to high school athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie said that he only gave his players legitimate expense
money on trips, which is permitted by NCAA rules, and that he had
done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State Vice President Robert Krause, who oversees the
day-to-day operations of the school's athletic programs, said the
system could wreck an athlete's attitude about academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It conditions kids to come to the university just for the
sport,'' Krause said. ``The kids are brought into the farm system
with the expectation that they're doing it for a career in the
sport and not for an education.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gurley, a former star player at Shawnee Mission South who
later played at Kansas, remembers summer ball during a simpler
time, the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a team, the KC Wildcats, and we played in places like
Las Vegas and Los Angeles,'' said Gurley, 27, who led Shawnee
Mission South to an undefeated state championship in the 1989-1990
basketball season. ``We had to raise money to go on trips, maybe
$2,000 to $3,000 every summer for each of us. There were no
improprieties going on with us. We got our money by selling yellow
trash bags, candy bars, lollipops, anything we could. I'd mow
lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockhurst High School coach Mark Nusbaum says he can tell when
players have adopted the summer basketball mentality _ they expect
to be wined and dined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost tough for players to come back (to high school
basketball) after playing in the summer,'' Nusbaum said. ``We've
got freshmen who've been to Orlando. They come back here, and where
do we go? Leavenworth. These kids have had the best uniforms, best
warmups, they're given travel bags, shoes. ... They come back and
say, `We have to wear these uniforms?' They wonder why they have to
stay at the Motel 6 and not the Ritz.''
</P>
<P>
   Though summer teams often are tagged with the ``AAU'' label,
that organization's executive director cautions that the Amateur
Athletic Union only organizes the tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AAU does not have teams,'' Bobby Dodd said. ``We do not
pay bills. We do not select coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that Piggie, convicted of a felony, was
coaching teams in AAU-sponsored tournaments, Dodd said the
organization adopted rules about a year ago requiring coaches to
disclose their criminal records before they can participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility for appropriate adults working in youth
programs lies with the parents and guardians,'' Dodd said. ``They
are the ones who are there day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the current attention is focused on the college
men's game, Pam DeCosta, the KU women's assistant coach in charge
of recruiting, said problems on the women's side weren't far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love it if you could go out and wouldn't have to talk
to the AAU coaches,'' she said. ``I think it's going to get a
little bit dirtier. ... The men's (game) is crazy and we follow
suit.''

SWEPT OVERBOARD WINS AT SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ For a horse that didn't run his race, Swept
Overboard finished Saturday's $100,000 Grade III San Miguel Stakes
in style, winning the 6 furlong sprint and beating favorite Forest
Camp by the slimmest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   The race, considered the first test for West Coast
three-year-olds who hope to run in the Santa Anita and Kentucky
derbies, featured a group of owners and trainers who had never won
it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, winning jockey Eddie Delahoussaye made his
fifth trip to the winner's circle in the San Miguel. That makes him
the event's all-time leading rider.
</P>
<P>
   Swept Overboard, who looked to be the early speed of the field,
came from the back of the pack and won a stretch duel with Forest
Camp. Trained by John Shirreffs, Swept Overboard covered the 6
furlongs in 1:08.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he broke real slow,'' Delahoussaye said. It was a real
tough fight for the last 100 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye said the pre-race instructions He received from
Shirreffs were helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to let the horse do what he wants,'' Delahoussaye
said. ''
</P>
<P>
   In order to be considered a hopeful for either the Santa Anita
or Kentucky Derby, Swept Overboard will have to prove He can run
well at a distance of a mile or greater. All his previous races
have been six furlongs or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step for him,'' said Shirreffs. We'll let the
horse dictate where He wants to go, not where we want to put him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one way you can find out,'' he said. ``That's
when you run.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Forest Camp, his finish was the second big disappointment
for the horse in recent months. Although He won the Grade II Del
Mar Futurity back in September, the Bob Baffert-trained Forest Camp
finished sixth in the Breeder's Cup Juvenile in November. ``What
are you going to do?'' Baffert asked. ``He drew the rail and when
you are down on the inside you have to use them a little more. You
have to be just a little more than the best from the one-hole.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron saved his comments for Delahoussaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe Eddie D. outrode me again,'' He said. ``This
was a good start for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   While Swept Overboard's future is somewhat uncertain, Baffert
has already set his sights on Forest Camp's next race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try the San Vicente,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __The stable run by Santa Anita owner Frank Stronach had a
winner on the dirt course in Saturday's third race. That winner was
Luftikus, ridden by Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Desormeaux's second of the afternoon. His first came
aboard Stabilizer in the second. Both helped Desormeaux maintain
his lead as Santa Anita's top jockey in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   __Stronach's plans for Santa Anita rennovation became a bit
clearer this week. The Arcadia City Planning Commission has sent a
letter to homeowners living within 1000 feet of the track detailing
some of Stronach's ideas. The letter advises that there will be an
open public meeting on Jan. 25 at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach is asking to city to allow his FrontRunner restaurant
to remain open until 1:30 p.m. seven days a week for satellite
wagering and unspecified other activities. Current city code only
permits late operation on Friday and Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Track management is also asking permission to leave the big
screen television on the infield turned on until 1:30 p.m. All the
better to see those simulcast races.
</P>
<P>
   __The Board of Stewards fined jockey David Flores $100 Saturday
for ``reporting late to the padock.''
</P>
<P>
   No further details of the incident were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   __A 66-year-old jockey will tempt fate Thursday in part of an
attempt to make history.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Ray York, a fixture of the Southern California racing
scene for six decades, will ride Culebra in Thursday's seventh
race. Doing so will make him (according to the flacks at Santa
Anita) the first jockey to ever ride in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   York's first professional mount came in June 1949. He won his
first race a month later. York's last ride was in 1992 at Bay
Meadows in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   In between He won 3,082 races; one of those was the 1954
Kentucky Derby aboard Determine.

GORE AND BRADLEY SPAR OVER FAMILIAR ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ In an hour of polite
slights and digs at nuanced policy differences, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley demonstrated Saturday that they mostly agreed on
government's role in the final year of the 20th century.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet the men also showed how their campaigns and characters
differ in manner and mode.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how to end school violence, for instance, the vice
president wonkishly rattled off a list of programs from income tax
credits to drug enforcement that could ``give our children a
feeling that their life has meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   More professorially, the former senator from New Jersey spoke in
bigger, if less specific, terms and settled on the need for ``a new
ethic of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their debate, much of it spent sparring over how best
to save Medicaid and Medicare, the Democratic rivals made clear
their differences in style. Gore was full of details. Bradley was
big on vision.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seized on that theme to close the afternoon face-off. The
presidency is not ``an academic exercise or a seminar on
theories,'' he said, poking at Bradley's deep-thinking ways. ``I
think the presidency has to be a day-to-day, resolute fight for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in turn, said the presidency was about leadership.
Although he didn't use terms like the ``Great Society,'' he lauded
Lyndon Johnson as a bold leader willing to tackle America's most
intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What leadership is about, I believe, is taking a national
problem _ health care, education _ and turning it into a public
issue and then engaging the idealism of the American people in
order to make something happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Bradley added, is what President Franklin Roosevelt did in
the 1930s with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say, `Well, we're going to cover 20 percent of the
people and see how it works out,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Held just 16 days before the Jan. 24 caucuses _ the first major
event in a speeded-up primary season _ Saturday's debate came as
Bradley seeks to wrestle the Democratic nomination away from a
sitting vice president. The Republican candidates will next debate
in Iowa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Saturday in The Des Moines Register suggested
that Gore had managed to halt Bradley's advance in Iowa. In June,
Gore towered over Bradley by being favored by 64 percent of
Democrats to Bradley's 24 percent. By November, Bradley had climbed
to 32 percent and Gore had fallen to 54 percent. The poll of 501
likely Democratic caucus participants released in Saturday's paper
showed the numbers essentially stuck: Gore 54 percent, Bradley 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush continued to
pace the field with 45 percent support. Publisher Steve Forbes was
in second place with 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's forum found the candidates treading on familiar
ground. Bradley advocated the more sweeping changes in health care
and gun control, while Gore insisted that Bradley's initiatives
could exhaust the country's newfound budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's preparation for the debate was pointed and precise,
seemingly scripted.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore and Bradley disagreed over how much the premiums for
Bradley's replacement health insurance program for Medicaid would
run, Gore presented debate moderator Dennis Ryerson with a list of
insurance companies in the state _ none of which, the vice
president said, would meet Bradley's price. When Gore wanted to
make a point about education, he asked a first-grade teacher
planted in the audience to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   And when he wanted to argue that Bradley is a late arrival to
the cause of family farming, he asked a hog farmer to rise to his
feet while wondering aloud why Bradley had voted against aid to
help rural Iowa recover from the flood of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Bradley seemed ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise of your question is wrong,'' he said. ``This
(campaign) is not about the past. This is about the future.'' And
then later in the debate: ``I would simply ask the family farmer of
Iowa, `Are you better off now than you were seven years ago?' ... I
will not rest until rural America and urban America move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have in other forums, the two clashed on health care, an
issue of growing concern in Iowa because of its older-than-average
population. Bradley's plan would devote $65 billion yearly toward
overhauling Medicare and Medicaid in an effort to insure nearly
every American. Gore wants a phased-in transition to programs that
would cover more people, but not the universal coverage Bradley
envisions. Gore says Bradley's plan is too expensive. Bradley
complains Gore's doesn't do enough to deal with a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   The two were questioned by senior citizen Margaret Rooney about
which candidate's plan would help her most with her soaring
prescription drug costs. Rooney said her bills topped $5,600 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his plan would wind up covering about $2,100 of the
woman's costs. Gore never said exactly what his plan would cover,
although Bradley's campaign calculated afterward that under Gore's
plan Rooney would pay more than $4,900.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore pointed to a broader question. He charged that Bradley
failed to spend more money on Medicare, which Gore said was
destined to go bankrupt in 2015 ``unless we start acting to save it
now.'' Even Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate
from Arizona, calls for spending more on Medicare, the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley countered that the program was on sound financial
footing until 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president said that I was prepared to let Medicare
go. Absolutely not,'' Bradley said. ``I replace Medicare, not
neglect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to campaign reform, Gore repeated his challenge to
Bradley that the two drop all television advertising in at least
one state to demonstrate their commitment to changing the election
system. Gore would replace the ads with more one-on-one debates in
that state.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bradley has refused such overtures before, Gore
picked up a line from the show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
and asked Bradley: ``Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seemed unmoved and once again refused to go along with
Gore's proposal. Campaigns can communicate a lot of information in
30 seconds, he said. Later, Bradley noted that Gore had supported
campaign reform for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, nothing's happened. ... The administration hasn't
submitted a campaign reform bill,'' Bradley said.
</P>

LOOK OUT BELOW FOR SOX PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has been buzzing with tales of a hot Red Sox
prospect down in Mexico by the name of Melville Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't heard of him? The story, as spread in cyberspace, is
that Stakes is a 6-foot-4-inch, 215-pounder from Rutland, Vt., an
18-year-old switch hitter who in 57 games in Mexico this winter hit
52 home runs, stole 46 bases, batted .391, and drove in 127 runs.
His performance may have slipped Peter Gammons's notice, but the
word on the Web is that Sox general manager Dan Duquette was
thinking of having the kid go straight from Sonora to the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he pitches, too.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to every Red Sox fan's dream?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, as Baseball America was only too glad to point out in
response to one naive inquiry, Melville Stakes is a fantasy, sprung
from the same fictional origins that some years ago gave us Sidd
Finch, the mythical hurler from the Himalayas. Nice try, but
someone smelled a rat in Rutland.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a true story out of Mexico that should fire
the imagination of any Sox fan who last summer embraced the ballad
of the Belleville Basher, Brian Daubach, as unlikely a hero as the
Sox have had in many years.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Melville Stakes, Morgan Burkhart exists, though
whether he is for real may not be known until he shows up at
training camp in Fort Myers this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart, a 27-year-old switch-hitting first baseman, last week
was named Most Valuable Player of the Mexican winter league after
leading the circuit with 55 RBIs in 67 games. He also hit 18 home
runs, began the season with a 19-game hitting streak, and according
to the Sox became the first player in Mexican League history to
homer from both sides of the plate in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   This, after a season in which he hit .363 with 23 home runs and
67 RBIs in just 68 games for Single A Sarasota in the Florida State
League, then was promoted to Double A Trenton, where he hit another
12 home runs and drove in 41 runs in another 66 games.
</P>
<P>
   Add them up _ Sarasota, Trenton, and Navajoa in the Mexican
League _ and you've got a player who in a year's span has hit 53
home runs and knocked in 163 runs in 201 games.
</P>
<P>
   Who is this guy? Even the Sox, who signed him last winter,
weren't quite sure. They misspelled his name in the team's media
guide.
</P>
<P>
   But the Burkhart believers know their man, who grew up in
suburban St. Louis _ on the other side of the Mississippi River
from Daubach _ went undrafted despite leading Central Missouri
State to a Division 2 title, then was working construction in a
warehouse until his baseball career was revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest hitter I've ever been around,'' said John
Cate, who managed Burkhart in the four years he spent playing for
the Richmond Roosters in the independent Frontier League.
</P>
<P>
   Cate is a longtime Indiana high school baseball coach who never
had heard of Burkhart until he ran into a Central Missouri coach at
a baseball clinic in Chicago who offered an unsolicited rave of a
player who hit .391 his last year in college.
</P>
<P>
   Why no interest from the big boys?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those so-called scout cards,'' said Cate, whose disdain was
evident over the telephone. ``He didn't fit any of their
categories. Scouts don't want to admit mistakes. They'd say, `We
like him but we don't have a place for him.' Or, `He's too short.'
Or, `He doesn't have a position.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart is short, for a first baseman. He's listed as 5-10,
though he's got Popeye forearms, according to Cate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Hack Wilson?'' said Frontier League commissioner Bill
(Not the Spaceman) Lee, invoking the name of the Hall of Fame Cubs
outfielder who was 5-6 but still holds the record for RBIs in a
season with 190. ``He's got arms like Hack Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   In Burkhart's first season with Richmond, he finished runner-up
in MVP voting. The next three years, he won the award. His last
season there, he hit a league-record .404, with 36 home runs and 98
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have run for mayor and won,'' Lee said. ``He put our
league on the map. And in four years, he didn't miss a game. He
played through everything. He just loves the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart was paid $600 his first season with Richmond, $750 the
second. That was increased to $1,100 his last two seasons, plus all
the free luncheons he could attend in Richmond, where Rooster
players lived with host families.
</P>
<P>
   One night, playing in Johnstown, Pa., Burkhart was 5 for 5 when
he came up to the plate for a sixth at-bat and was intentionally
walked. The fans booed. Another night, at home, he came up with the
bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth and was given another
intentional walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an unbelievable knowledge of the strike zone, and is
the most disciplined hitter I've ever seen,'' Cate said. ``Every
year we thought he wouldn't be coming back, but every year no one
signed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he'd wanted to return for a fifth season, he couldn't.
He was too old for the Frontier League, which stipulates that a
player can't turn 27 before June 1 of a given season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Sox came calling. Farm boss Kent Qualls offered
Burkhart a job last winter, and the kid hasn't stopped playing
since. Last week, with Navajoa in the playoffs, Burkhart hit two
home runs in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he hasn't decided whether Burkhart will be invited
to big-league camp as a nonroster player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Cate said. ``What do the Red Sox have to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier League has yet to send an alumnus to the big
leagues, unlike independent circuits like the Northern League,
which can boast of such grads as Braves pitcher Kevin Millwood and
Rangers reliever Jeff Zimmerman, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Morgan make it?'' Cate said. ``I don't know, but it would
not surprise me if he gets the chance?''
</P>
<P>
   A better idea on Rocker
</P>
<P>
   As well-intentioned as they may have been, the great minds who
decided that Braves pitcher John Rocker should undergo a
psychological evaluation for his offensive blathering in a magazine
interview made a big mistake. What Rocker's rants conveyed in a
public context sadly didn't stray far from opinions aired in
private, not only in clubhouses, but in boardrooms, bedrooms, and,
yes, even some newspaper offices. There's a difference between
crazy and stupid, and it smacks too much of knee-jerk political
correctness to haul Rocker before a shrink. There may be an
epidemic of ignorance in this country _ and again, it's not limited
to ballplayers _ but it's not a question of mental competence, a
deprived childhood, or a conflicted sense of self. It's about
educating a person to their blind prejudices and hateful invective.
Braves boss Stan Kasten had the right idea when he suggested that
the next time the Braves visit New York, he take Rocker to the
Statue of Liberty. But Kasten, and Major League Baseball, and the
Players' Association shouldn't stop there. Rocker would have been
better served by doing what pitcher John Burkett did when he was
with the Florida Marlins and visited an AIDS hospice in Miami
Beach, while dressed in full uniform. Or by spending an afternoon
riding the No. 7 train with an immigrant son or daughter of this
country, then going to the job and later home with that person, who
has never had luxury of big-league meal money, never mind a
million-dollar salary. Send Rocker to a city school to speak to
kids who weren't blessed with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball but have
dreams every big as his. Rocker, like so many athletes _ like so
many of us _ has been insulated for too long from the real world. A
counseling session won't break through that cocoon. Having some
real contact with the very people Rocker ripped would be far more
useful. And Rocker will endure no greater punishment than what he
is sure to face within the walls of a multicultural Braves
clubhouse, and in stadiums filled with folks who will let him know
in unmistakable terms how wrong he was . . . Remember Carl Everett,
the center fielder who is supposed to be a new centerpiece in the
Sox' lineup this season? Well, Everett is finally going to get
around to coming to Boston on Thursday for an introductory press
conference, his first public appearance since the Sox acquired him
from Houston. There were the typical excuses made for Everett's
unavailability _ his wife had a baby, it was the holidays, etc. _
but somehow Jose Offerman made it here last December after he
signed, and Pedro Martinez flew up from the Dominican Republic
twice in a month's time after he came in a trade, then signed a new
deal. So the tolerance for Everett's no-show is odd for a club
charging its fans as much as $45 per game. By the way, Duquette
said Friday that he has yet to talk about a multiyear deal for
Everett with agent Larry Reynolds, who is also scheduled to come to
town this week . . . Duquette, incidentally, went to Sox doctors
Bill Morgan and Arthur Pappas for surgery to repair the torn thumb
ligament he suffered in a recent skiing accident. And Tom Gordon
would probably like to know that Duquette said it's not true that
Sox CEO John Harrington threatened to void his contract if he went
to someone other than a Sox doc.
</P>
<P>
   One-way tickets
</P>
<P>
   Dernell Stenson, the Sox first-base prospect, came home from the
Dominican Republic for the holidays and elected not to go back and
finish the winter league season there. Yes, the Sox would have
liked him to do so _ Duquette said it would have been good for him
to experience the intensity of the Dominican playoffs _ but you're
inviting only misery if you force a kid to stay in a place so
different from home if he doesn't want to be there. Third base
prospect Wilton Veras also dropped off the roster of his Dominican
team, Escogido, for whom he was batting just .214, and is working
out at the Sox academy in the island nation. A lack of playing time
is the reason given for Veras's decision . . . After signing Jeff
Fassero, the Sox never made another pitch for Doc Gooden, who last
week signed a minor league deal with Houston that includes a
$500,000 base salary and incentives that could make the package
worth as much as $2 million. Duquette said he still hopes to add
another pitcher, and mentioned Canton's Bobby Witt as still under
consideration . . . A man of his word: Duquette said there is no
language in Sunny Kim's contract that would keep him from being
traded, but because of Kim's strong desire to pitch in Fenway Park,
and his promise as a prospect, Duquette won't deal the young Korean
righthander, who probably will pitch in Pawtucket this season . . .
PawSox tickets are now on sale by phone (401-724-7300), fax
(401-724-2140) or online (www.pawsox.com), with walkup sales
beginning Feb. 5. The best news? Top seat is still just 7 bucks . .
. Inky, Dinky, Doo: The independent Nashua Pride signed Pete
Incaviglia, who spent most of last season recovering from rotator
cuff surgery. Inky, 35, has played for six big-league teams and now
joins Daddy Butch Hobson in Nashua.

ST. JEAN IS GOLDEN STATE WORRIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, coach, how's it going?
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been fun,'' Garry St. Jean said. ``It's been hard.
Real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. St. Jean certainly hasn't had any fun the last
couple of weeks. He has gone from hesitant executioner _
terminating P.J. Carlesimo _ to hesitant overseer _ replacing
Carlesimo _ of one of the NBA's historically hapless franchises,
the Golden State Warriors. He has yet to win a game in his second
coaching incarnation, something that could change with a long
homestand and some equally inept opponents coming into Beirut by
the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Jean also knows the painful reality: He has no chance to
right the ship, assuming it hasn't been sinking from the start. Ask
him what he needs, other than healthy players, and St. Jean says,
``Training camp. The only problem with that is that everyone else
has played 30 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Suns senior executive vice president Cotton Fitzsimmons
said, ``It's just about impossible, coming into a situation like
that. You try to make it as easy as possible. You try to eliminate
the chaos. But there's no way. You need practice time. There isn't
any. I had the same thing happen when I replaced Paul Westphal. You
just can't do it. You have to do things piecemeal and that's never
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors thought they had a chance to be decent this season,
perhaps doing what Denver is now doing. Instead, they've been
awful. They've been decimated by injuries; St. Jean said that at
least three of the Warriors' projected top eight have been out for
every game (John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry Cummings are the
current invalids). Then owner Chris Cohan decided to jettison
Carlesimo _ who was twisting in the wind anyway _ and had St. Jean,
who was brought in after P.J., deliver the word to a guy he never
hired in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fitzsimmons, ``They do things backwards out there.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean called the move ``the hardest thing I've ever done. I
don't want to do it again. Ever.'' He knew Carlesimo wasn't
succeeding. He also knew it wasn't for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. was in a no-win situation,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``I talked
to my son, Gary (the Warriors' assistant general manager) and told
him, `You've got a bad team.' And I know from bad teams. I always
started with them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of untouchables on the roster: Erick Dampier
and Antawn Jamison. Dampier just returned this week after missing
the first two months of the season. Their own first-round draft
pick in 2000 _ which could be a top three pick _ is headed to
Orlando, the last of the three first-rounders Don Nelson sent to
the Magic along with Penny Hardaway to get Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors are still paying for the sins of St. Jean and, more
incredibly, of his predecessors. Saint undoubtedly would like to
have back the trade with Toronto, in which he sent draftee Vince
Carter and cash to the Raptors for Jamison. Recent draftees include
Adonal Foyle, Todd Fuller, and Joe Smith. Only Foyle is still
there. Fuller, taken ahead of Kobe Bryant, is in Charlotte. Smith,
taken first overall in 1995, was traded to Philadelphia for two
players (Clarence Weatherspoon and Jim Jackson) who left Golden
State high and dry as free agents. We haven't even gotten to
Latrell Sprewell. Or Donyell Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors just completed a winless swing through the East,
finishing it off with a 75-point, 30-percent-shooting gem in
Cleveland. They've lost eight straight and have fewer wins than any
other team but Chicago. Cotton Fitzsimmons is right. They are a bad
team. Now it's St. Jean's turn to try to get blood out of a stone.
He's been around long enough to know that that equation doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Dee's knees
</P>
<P>
   Dee Brown is back home in Orlando and could find out Monday what
the rest of his season will be like. Brown's left knee is bothering
him again and he has had two opinions: one from the Raptors,
suggesting rehab, the other from an independent source, suggesting
surgery. A third opinion is due from an Orlando specialist. Brown
is frustrated and would not return until March if he has another
operation. Left unsaid is that he's a free agent and not in
Toronto's future plans. Brown already has arthroscopic surgery on
the knee prior to the season. He apparently came back too soon,
because it's gotten worse, not better . . . Stephon Marbury told
reporters this past week that he has absolutely no regrets about
leaving the Timberwolves. ``When you have regrets, it's like
cancer,'' he said. ``People don't understand, and they still don't
understand because they choose not to, that I didn't leave
Minnesota because of basketball. It goes beyond basketball. I have
a life. I'm still a human being. I still have to live there and
wake up to snow every day and freezing weather. I loved playing
basketball there. If people got it wrong, so be it.'' . . .
Speaking of the Wolves, they have done a 180 from their December
funk, and one of the reasons is the insertion of Malik Sealy into
the starting lineup at shooting guard. ``He probably merited it
sooner,'' said Wolves boss Kevin McHale. ``All year long, he's been
one of our more consistent players. Lately, he's been ultra
consistent.'' The Wolves' comeback win at home Thursday over
Portland was their eighth in nine games. They beat San Antonio and
the Trail Blazers in the space of 48 hours. After a quick Eastern
swing this weekend (Detroit, Philly), they face home
character-builders this week against Miami, the Lakers, and, ahem,
the Celtics (Thursday). McHale thinks the team has snapped out of
its swoon, which saw the Wolves lose eight in a row. ``It was
ugly,'' he said. ``But those guys got their rear ends chewed out a
lot by me and the coaching staff and no one pointed fingers. At the
end of it, I think we've got guys with good character. I still
don't know how good we'll be. But I do know we have good guys. But
this has been a strange year. There's one team doing well, the
Lakers, and everyone else is ebbing and flowing. We were on a
serious ebb there for a while.'' . . . No sooner had Nelson met
with new Dallas owner-to-be Mark Cuban than he said that his son
was not in line to succeed him and never really had been. Huh? ``I
tried to convince him to stay here,'' said Fitzsimmons. The younger
Nelson was a Phoenix assistant before joining his father in Dallas
as the heir apparent. ``If he had stayed here,'' Fitzsimmons said,
``he'd probably be the coach now.'' Big Nellie, meanwhile, should
take his money and go back to Maui, although he is pledging to
stick around for another year in the front office, not his strong
suit. Does he really not know that it hasn't worked in Dallas?
Cuban looks like either a terrific, enthusiastic,
willing-to-do-whatever-it-takes owner or a meddlesome, John Y.
Brown-in-waiting. ``This is exactly the kind of owner the league
needs,'' Big Nellie said, referring to Cuban's deep pockets.
However, Cuban is also an unabashed Mavericks fan _ there
apparently are still a few _ and pledges to be hands-on, never a
good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion statement
</P>
<P>
   Albert White of the CBA's Sioux Falls Sky Force made the mistake
recently of wearing sweats when the team was out in the public eye.
For that transgression, he was suspended one game. The CBA, under
new boss Isiah Thomas, has instituted a dress code and already has
fined and suspended several players and one coach. Players and
coaches are expected to wear a coat, shirt, slacks, and shoes (no
sneakers or sandals) when travelling. (The exception is when they
travel by bus.) Several members of Dennis Johnson's La Crosse
Bobcats were fined for violating the code and Grand Rapids coach
Mark Hughes was even suspended a game because several of his
players were deemed to be sartorially incomplete . . . The always
intrepid Craig Sager of TBS/TNT fame tried to get Karl Malone this
past week to plug the Jazz' game Monday night with San Antonio (on
TBS). Malone wouldn't bite, mainly because the Jazz had games with
Dallas and Houston before the Spurs and couldn't afford to overlook
either one. Sager tried again. No luck. He stopped there, before he
Jim Grayed the whole thing. Well, when the Spurs do play the Jazz,
it will be only the third time this season that San Antonio has
played one of the other Big Three in the West. The Spurs still have
yet to face Portland and have played the Lakers only once . . .
Speaking of Malone, he demonstrated again on Thursday why he's an
annual first-team selection to the All-Interview squad. He went
chest to chest with Nelson during the Utah victory over the Mavs.
It didn't get to fisticuffs, but it took a few seconds before the
two were separated. Nelson wound up with a one-game suspension and
fine for bumping a ref before the Malone contretemps. Malone would
not reveal what the two said, but added, ``I was taught to respect
my elders. But Granddaddy always said if a person gets out of line,
you gotta put him in his place. There is a fine line you don't
cross and he crossed it. I think he's a little overmatched in this
one.'' Also in that game, Shawn Bradley was called for a technical
after getting kicked in the stomach on one of Malone's trademark
``kick jumpers.'' Bradley crumpled to the floor in pain. Said the
Mailman, ``When a Volkswagen hits an 18-wheeler, what's the result
going to be?'' Utah, by the way, had just beaten Charlotte the
night before and is 6-0 in the second game of back-to-backers. Not
bad for an allegedly actuarially-challenged squad . . . McHale on
Shaquille O'Neal: ``He's playing the way the Lakers hoped he would
and everyone else was afraid he would.'' . . . The Hornets,
struggling out West without Eddie Jones, activated the NBA steals
leader last week. But it was a formality. League rules stipulate
that a team can't carry 11 players for more than two weeks. So
Jones was activated, but he's unlikely to return until the Hornets
come back East this week. Eldridge Recasner, injured in the
preseason car accident with Derrick Coleman, may be ready to play
next month . . . Game of the Week: Lakers at Indiana on Friday.
They are the only two teams right now who, as McHale might say, are
flowing rather than ebbing . . . Denver's Dan Issel accused Jerry
Sloan of trying to run up the score in a Utah blowout last week.
Sloan, as you might suspect, didn't take kindly to the comments and
shot back that he was upset when Issel walked out on the Nuggets.
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, meanwhile, said he couldn't conceive
of a situation in the NBA where a team intentionally ran up the
score. ``If you get beat by 50,'' he said, ``it's your own fault.
It's not the job of the opponent to make it look better for you.''

FINALLY LETTING DOWN HIS HAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Note to reader: I am selling out. Every other columnist in this
section has written a story similar to the following one. Me? I
used to be the last holdout on the sports block. Not anymore; I
have sold out. What will I do next, get a haircut?
</P>
<P>
   A few items to discuss with the Sports Barber . . .
</P>
<P>
   --The Buffalo Bills, losers of four Super Bowls, didn't simply
blow a playoff game to Tennessee on an unlikely lateral Saturday.
They also granted clemency to Bill Buckner, Chris Webber (circa
1993), Greg Norman, and the Atlanta Braves of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   --OK, let's be honest. Who rooted hardest for the Titans: you,
the Tennessee fans, or Doug Flutie?
</P>
<P>
   --If you believe that Pete Carroll was too soft with the
Patriots, you'll understand why Bob Kraft likes Bill Belichick.
According to former Browns center Mike Baab, this is what the coach
told the Browns during his first team meeting: ``I've worked too
long and too hard for this chance to let you guys (expletive) it up
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   --Actually, Coach Belichick doesn't bother me. Coach/General
Manager Belichick is a near obscenity. It's too bad he has such
disdain for the media because he has a lot to share: He has visited
prisons, accompanied police on drug raids, observed surgeons at
work, jammed to the Allmans, and, the toughest job of all, served
as sports editor of the Annapolis (Md.) High yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   --The myth is that the people of Cleveland hated Belichick for
waiving an ineffective Bernie Kosar. Not quite. They hated him for
waiving Kosar when Todd Philcox was his only healthy quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   --Antoine Walker hasn't been dancing much lately. He says he'll
do it more when the Celtics go over .500. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   --If I had to vote this morning for NBA Coach of the Year, my
choice would be Orlando's Doc Rivers. The Magic began Saturady
night with 16 wins, or about 13 more than anyone expected at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   --A couple of months ago, I went to see ``Pokemon: The First
Movie'' with my 6-year-old nephew, Justin. His immediate review was
that it was OK, but a little confusing. I reminded Justin of this
two weeks ago and he said, basically, that he meant it when he said
it. Hey, Rick Pitino, are you moonlighting as a kindergarten
teacher?
</P>
<P>
   --``Hurricane,'' which is the story of boxer Rubin Carter, has a
little too much Hollywood in it but Denzel Washington _ the best in
the business _ saves it.
</P>
<P>
   --Ty Law, when asked to compare the coaching skills of Carroll
and Bill Parcells: ``Hell, that's like comparing Michael Jordan to
Latrell Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   --My name is Bob Kraft. The first, second, and third thing I do
this morning is phone Joe Gibbs and convince him to come out of
retirement. I sell him on the resurgent NASCAR scene in New
Hampshire. I tell him he can sign Mark Martin or Jeff Gordon to the
practice squad if he wants. Anything.
</P>
<P>
   --I'd take Gibbs over even Parcells and Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   --I think Shaquille O'Neal is underrated. Yep. Underrated. What
can't he do? You say free throws. Bill Russell shot 56 percent for
his career from the line and Wilt Chamberlain finished at 47
percent. O'Neal came into this season at 53 percent. He also has
career averages of 27 points and 12 rebounds. As much as he gets to
the line, he actually gets fouled twice as often as that. But it's
rarely called because he is so strong and it's not so obvious that
he has been whacked. Plus, look at how Penny Hardaway, Dennis
Scott, and Nick Anderson have performed with Shaq no longer in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   --Another reason Boston sports fans are praised for their
knowledge: Reader Doug Bishop wrote that Jordan and William
Shakespeare had more than artistic brilliance in common. Both,
Bishop said, retired at the top of their games.
</P>
<P>
   --John Rocker did more damage with his mouth than Sprewell ever
did with his hands. So why have Time magazine and the Wall Street
Journal been so quiet with their commentaries? You may recall that
Time referred to Sprewell as a ``corn-rowed punk'' when he choked
P.J. Carlesimo. The Journal had a headline that read ``Jail
Sprewell.'' No such words about Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   --If I had three sports wishes, one of them would be access to
Rocker's voice mail. We have heard from those who have condemned
the Braves pitcher for his ignorant remarks, but I'd feel more
comfortable if I knew the names of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   --So, if Kraft does eventually interview Marty Schottenheimer, I
hope he asks about Mike Junkin. When he was in Cleveland,
Schottenheimer traded up to the draft's top five to select Duke
linebacker Junkin, who was, of course, a bust. Really, when was the
last time you heard of someone trading up to draft a Duke football
player?
</P>
<P>
   --Once a year, I think every NFL coach should be allowed to pick
his favorite entertainer, author, or orator to speak on his behalf
at a press conference. Imagine how J.D. Salinger would respond (as
Holden Caulfield) when asked if Carroll's Patriots quit on him in a
time of war: ``I don't know too much about it myself, but I do know
it would drive me crazy if I had to be in the Army and be with a
bunch of guys like this. I was in the Boy Scouts once, for about a
week, and I couldn't even stand looking at the guy's neck in front
of me . . . I swear, if there's another war, they better just take
me out and stick me in front of a firing squad. I wouldn't
object.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Celtics have a head-shaving promotion Monday at the
FleetCenter. I'm thinking about it.

HUSKIES PULL RANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The couple hundred University of Connecticut
fans, barely visible in the sea of orange, and barely audible among
23,385 at Thompson-Boling Arena, had a lot to cheer about after the
game as they stood up in their nosebleed seats and chanted,
``UConn, UConn, UConn.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 women's basketball team in the country defeated No. 2
Tennessee, 74-67, to hold onto its perfect record of 12-0.
Tennessee fell to 11-3.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut point guard Sue Bird, who tore her anterior cruciate
ligament last year and saw action in just eight games, led the
Huskies with 25 points, whie Svetlana Abrosimova added 14 and Shea
Ralph 13.
</P>
<P>
   When the players were introduced, the Tennessee fans cheered
lustily for Semeke Randall, though it sounded like boos. Boo is a
nickname she picked up last year when the Lady Vols played UConn at
Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Randall and Abrosimova had fought for a loose ball in that game
and Randall had gained possession. Thereafter, she was booed by the
UConn crowd every time she touched the ball. Tennessee won the
game, which made the booing much easier for Randall to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``So thanks to Connecticut, that's my nickname,'' she said.
``But I guess I'm carrying it with class.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall laughed off insinuations that there might still be bad
blood between she and Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no hard feelings, I think she's a great player,''
Randall said, adding that the altercation was not surprising during
a hard-fought game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to win, I want to win,'' Randall said. ``It's
emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt was correct when she predicted the
game would look more like a track meet than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were hustling, not just to score, but to deny
opponents the ball as each team committed 12 first-half turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   UConn had the early upper hand at 20-13, but Tennessee went on a
run to go ahead, at 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn capitalized on its eight first-half steals (three by
freshman Kennitra Johnson and two by Bird), to pull back in front.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies shot 56 percent (18 for 32) from the floor in the
half, while Tennessee made just 12 of its 30 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, UConn went to the locker room up, 43-37.

BC SLIPS PAST PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   Al Skinner had watched his Boston College men's basketball team
endure an extended stretch of scattershot play.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:45 remaining in Saturday's Big East opener against
Providence, the Eagles had rallied from a 57-47 deficit with a 10-0
run over a span of 2 minutes 22 seconds, forcing the Friars to
commit three turnovers that resulted in 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely that kind of effort that helped Skinner remain
composed during the final 2 1/2 minutes _ when the game got truly
frenzied and the teams traded three consecutive 3-pointers and five
turnovers _ of BC's 67-62 victory over the Friars before a
breathless Conte Forum crowd of 5,486.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but at that point in time I felt a lot more
comfortable,'' Skinner said, after his Eagles improved to 9-4
overall. ``In all honesty, I thought the pressure was on them,
because if we did the right things defensively then they would have
to make some tough shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my urgency was when we were down and we were struggling and
making mistakes. Once we got the lead, I really settled down. I
felt a lot better with a 1-point lead than I did being down by 1
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Troy Bell, who was the only Eagle to score in
double figures, came within one missed free throw of tying his
career high (29 against UMass Dec. 4). Bell hit 8 of 17 shots,
including 4 of 8 from 3-point range, and was 8 of 11 from the foul
line. He outscored the rest of BC's starters, who combined to score
20 points by going 5 for 21 from the field (1 for 7 on 3-pointers)
and 9 for 12 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Walls had 9 points, including a pair of free throws that
tied it, 57-57, with 2:45 to go, Jonathan Beerbohm chipped in 8
points and three rebounds, and 6-foot-8-inch freshman power forward
Uka Agbai, whose hustle didn't show in the box score, loomed large
with his play against Providence's 7-2 center Karim Shabazz (15
points, 16 rebounds), with 3 points, 6 rebounds, 5 blocked shots,
and 2 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to play hard all the time,'' said Agbai. ``They
call me the Garbage Man because I do all the dirty work. I just try
my best and do whatever it takes to win. Even though it doesn't
show up on the stats, it doesn't bother me too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about fronting Shabazz, who was his counselor two summers
ago at an ABCD basketball camp, Agbai said, ``I do look up to him.
I wish I was 7-2 _ and hopefully I get to be 7-2 _ but I had to
play as if I was 7-2 just like he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friars, who led, 30-29, at halftime, outshot (44 percent to
35.7 percent) and outrebounded (41 to 30) the Eagles, but were
outscored, 20-5, over the final 5:07. Providence committed eight of
its 26 turnovers during that stretch, including five in the final
1:12, and took only 10 trips to the foul line all afternoon,
compared with 29 for BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put them on the foul line and we turned it over when it
counted,'' said Providence coach Tim Welsh, whose team fell to 8-7
overall, 1-1 in the conference. ``And that was the game right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   After Walls capped BC's 10-0 comeback with his tying free
throws, Bell engaged Providence's Donta Wade in a 3-point
tete-a-tete when he knocked down a trey from the top of the key to
give BC a 60-59 lead with 1:46 left. Wade answered with a
line-drive three to give the Friars a 62-60 edge, but Bell gave BC
the lead for good with another trifecta, this one from the corner
in front of the Eagles' bench with 1:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard everybody screaming `No!' but I felt like we just
needed something,'' said Bell. ``I knew I was feeling all right,
and so I just took it and knocked it down _ luckily.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Singletary made it a 64-62 lead by hitting the first of
two free throws and Bell, who scored 13 points in the final 3:03,
three of his four foul shots over the final 17.9 to ice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it says is that this team understands winning and it's
important to them,'' said Skinner, whose team plays its first
conference road game Wednesday night at Notre Dame. ``Even though
we didn't necessarily play well, even on the offensive end, we
still understand winning and we understand the extra hustle that
you need to win.''

TEAM CONNER AWAITS RULING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The fate of Stars &AMP; Stripes hung over
the dockside compound of Team Dennis Conner Saturday awaiting a
series of formal hearings and recommendations that could knock Team
Dennis Conner back a point or more in the standings, or in the most
extreme judgment, throw the San Diego cup veteran out of the
regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Long after racing ended Saturday night, an arbitration panel was
sending its findings to a jury. At question is what, if any, action
to take against Stars &AMP; Stripes in wake of findings that the
midnight blue IACC 75-footer sailed the first race of the current
Louis Vuitton semifinals with an illegal rudder.
</P>
<P>
   According to the written Cup protocol, a boat must manufacture
any appendages either in its home country or in the host country,
which is New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   But Team Dennis Conner had a rudder built in Australia, which
could leave them vulnerable to some penalty.
</P>
<P>
   While that storm swirled around the dockside offices all
weekend, out on the water things did not look much brighter for
Stars &AMP; Stripes, since a light air pattern put the boat built for
high winds and rougher water at a distinct disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   AmericaOne, Paul Cayard's San Francisco-leading team, trounced
Stars &AMP; Stripes, first by winning the start and getting the first
windshift, then by a show of blazing straight line speed that left
Stars &AMP; Stripes well off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   And heading into Saturday's races, the pattern of high pressure
and light air seems to be locked in over Auckland _ great news for
the thousands of boaters and vacationers in the height of their
summer _ bad news for Stars &AMP; Stripes, which was racing Nippon
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But ashore, the Team DC heavies were fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestion that Team Dennis Conner would be excluded would
be silly,'' said skipper Ken Read. ``It's not even an option. It's
not even worth talking about. It's just all crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Read said that the rudder, which was designed by US designers
and made from materials sent from the US, was built in Australia
only in the interest of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole team believes everything we have done is 100 percent
OK,'' said Read, a 36-year-old Newport, R.I., native, and former
J-24 world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes team members concede dockside politics of this
kind are ``distracting'' and can get in the way of a team's sailing
focus. In 1992 when they were competing in the finals of the Louis
Vuitton Cup against Italy, New Zealand faced charges of rigging an
illegal bowsprit. New Zealand admits the controversy was so
distracting it was a large part of its poor performance against the
winning Italian team, Il Moro de Venezia.
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes team members say they are pleased at least to
see their controversy go before an arbitration panel, rather than
the summary judgment of a jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what an arbitration panel is for,'' said Read, ``to
construe what is a pretty vague document at times.''
</P>
<P>
   At question before that panel is whether precedent has been
established to weaken the nationality clause of the protocol.
Specifically, argued Stars &AMP; Stripes tactician Tom Whidden, the
case of Italy's Azurra and France's French Kis which in 1986 had
keels built by a German manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Also cited was the most famous such controversy that arose when
in 1983 Australia II was charged with using a revolutionary keel
built in part in Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stars &AMP; Stripes has watched the ascendancy of an old
rival, Paul Cayard's AmericaOne take the lead on the board at 4-1
before Saturday's races. Stars &AMP; Stripes is 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   To our readers: Because New Zealand is 18 hours ahead of US East
Coast time, all action takes place a day ahead (i.e. a Sunday noon
race there is taking place Saturday evening here). To avoid
confusion, all time references in America's Cup stories will
reflect when the events took place according to Eastern Standard
Time.

WOMEN WANT US SOCCER TO KICK IN MORE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though strikes/walkouts/boycotts have become a ritual whenever
US Soccer and its elite players wrangle over a new deal, the
ongoing tiff with the women's team is decidedly different.
</P>
<P>
   Until they had filled every stadium from the Meadowlands to the
Rose Bowl during last summer's World Cup, the women had to swallow
the dictum that they deserved less money because they generated
less money. Now, after two World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal,
all those sellouts, and a prodigious amount of pre-Cup promotional
work, the women feel they've earned the respect that comes with
more money. What they want is a reported top-end $5,000 per month
and $2,000 a game, compared with the $3,150 and $250 they made
before the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always lived up to our end of the bargain,'' Brandi
Chastain tells the world on her AthleteDirect.com Web site.
``Knocked on doors, pounded the pavement, run clinics, and signed
unlimited autographs for the good of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So Chastain and her teammates, who will be the core of this
summer's Olympic team, are skipping the Australia Cup while US
Soccer sends a JV made up of present and former collegians and high
schoolers. Not that there has been a dropoff on the scoreboard. The
B team waxed the Czechs, 8-1, in their opener Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Why not Iverson?
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't the NBA's leading scorer on the US Olympic men's
basketball team? Because the selectors wanted a shooting guard, so
they bypassed Allen Iverson for Milwaukee bombardier Ray Allen.
Actually, Iverson was all but out of the running when the committee
chose five guards (Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston, Jason Kidd, Gary
Payton, Steve Smith) last year. His name barely came up during last
week's vote, when Grant Hill and Alonzo Mourning were also added to
the roster. The only decision was whether to choose Allen or
Toronto forward Vince Carter, who is leading the All-Star
balloting. Allen got the nod because he's more experienced and more
likely to accept 12th-man status . . . With Kara Wolters added last
week, just one spot remains on the US women's team. It could be
determined this week after the selectors chat by conference call.
After running roughshod (as in 11-1) over a dozen college
varsities, the Americans are off to Europe to face the Polish and
Slovak national squads and club teams . . . Though the
International Olympic Committee made a big deal out of adding 15
``active'' (as in recent) athletes as members, they're really just
temps. Unlike the incumbents, who can be reelected until they reach
70, the athletes have to step down after eight years. And while
they're nominated by their peers, they still have to be approved by
an IOC selection committee, the executive board, and the full body
. . . As expected (though originally denied), the IOC has moved
next month's board meeting from the United States to the other side
of the world to avoid any FBI agents who might pepper members with
questions about the Salt Lake bidding scandal. Instead of Colorado
Springs, the Lords will convene in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the odds
</P>
<P>
   US pairs skater Paul Binnebose, who nearly died last autumn
after fracturing his skull in a fall during practice, could be back
on the ice later this month, if only for a reentry spin. Binnebose
lost 50 pounds and developed heart and lung infections while he was
bedridden for two months. ``At one point, we said all we want is
for him just to live,'' says coach Ron Ludington . . . Missing from
the US skating championships yet again will be Nicole Bobek, who
missed last month's sectionals with the flu and was denied a
medical waiver to Nationals. Bobek, who was kept out last year by a
pelvic ailment, says she'll still stay eligible for another shot at
Olympus . . . Both the men's and women's world skating champions
were knocked off at the recent Russian nationals. Alexei Yagudin
was beaten by 17-year-old Evgeni Plushenko, and Irina Slutskaya
took down Maria Butyrskaya . . . Back on the beam after imploding
at trials and missing the last US Olympic team is 17-year-old Apolo
Anton Ohno, who recently became the youngest short-track
speedskater to win an overall World Cup event title. Ohno ranked
fifth in the global standings at the holiday break. South Korea's
Kim Dong Sung leads the men's list, Bulgaria's Evgenia Radanova the
women's . . . Nice effort by the US men's hockey team, which lost
the bronze medal to the Canadians in a shootout at the world junior
championships after finishing eighth last time. It was the best
showing since 1993 for the Americans. The unheralded Czechs stung
the Russians for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Tripped up
</P>
<P>
   Who would pay anybody to land the world Nordic skiing
championships? The Finns, who paid for the Croats and Belarussians
to go to New Zealand and (they hoped) vote for Lahti as next year's
host. Lahti got the bid, but Finnish police are investigating
whether the free trips amounted to a bribe . . . Lake Placid's new
combined luge-bobsled-skeleton run should be open by month's end,
in time for next month's inaugural winter Goodwill Games. Price of
the state-of-the-art venue is $24 million, more than double what
the individual runs cost when they were built for the 1980 Games .
. . New US women's gymnastics team coordinator Bela Karolyi was
underwhelmed by the physical condition of the several dozen Olympic
hopefuls who turned up for last month's one-day camp in Tulsa. ``To
be honest, I was not pleased,'' he says. ``The shape wasn't the one
that is required for a team that wants to be at the top standard.''
Karolyi will convene the group again next weekend and cut the list
in half before the next of his monthly camps. ``I hope they're
going to be in much better physical shape _ and ready,'' he says.
Among the hopefuls are three of the ``Magnificent Seven'' who won
gold in Atlanta: Dominique Moceanu, Amy Chow, and Jaycie Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Off target
</P>
<P>
   Latest cheating scandal comes in archery (yes, archery), with
Shane Parker getting booted off the US Olympic team and suspended a
year for firing two extra arrows after he'd missed the target twice
at last year's trials. Taking his place is 44-year-old Butch
Johnson of Woodstock, Conn., who'll be making his third trip to the
Games . . . Jim Pedro of Lawrence, the newly-crowned world champ,
leads the list of fighters just named to the US Olympic judo team,
which gets to send a full roster to Sydney. Joe Felton, the former
Detroit Lion from Fall River, will also make the team if he
outpoints Martin Boonzaayer by April . . . USA Track and Field
types are crossing their fingers and hoping that the wrong person
doesn't win next month's Olympic women's marathon trials in South
Carolina. If the victor hasn't met the ``A'' standard of 2:33 (and
only Libbie Hickman and Kristy Johnston have, so far), the
Americans will get to send only one runner to Sydney, even if
others have gone sub-2:33. The men, who haven't settled on
selection procedures, would have the same problem at their May
trials. Only David Morris and Joe LeMay have met the ``A'' standard
of 2:14.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the pool
</P>
<P>
   Another setback for gold-medal swimmer Amy Van Dyken, who had
surgery last week to remove scar tissue from the surgery she had
two years ago after tearing her rotator cuff in the weight room. If
all goes well, she figures to be back in the pool by March, five
months before the US Olympic trials . . . With Mike Gebhardt
nailing down a Mistral spot at the recent world championships, the
US sailing team has qualified for all but one of the 11 Olympic
events at Sydney. They'll get a final shot at the Finn class in
England in June . . . Why are the US Olympic boxing trials being
held seven months before the Games? Because victors now have to
earn the right to compete in Sydney at a series of regional
qualifiers in the spring. Only 54 boxers from the hemisphere (not
counting Cubans, who get to send a full team) will earn slots. So
it's possible that one or more Americans could make the team and
still stay home . . . Coincidence or karma? Six years to the day
after her henchmen kneecapped Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding skidded
off an icy road last week and put her pickup into a ditch.

FRANCIS AN ALMOST UNKNOWN SOLDIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riddick Bowe joined the Marine Corps after fighting Andrew
Golota twice. Julius Francis opted for the British Army even before
he has fought Mike Tyson once.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known British heavyweight champion, who is scheduled
to fight Tyson Jan. 29 in Manchester, England, ``joined'' the
British Army Wednesday so he could be free to train at the barracks
gym at Aldershot and live in the sergeant's mess there, according
to Frank Maloney, Francis's manager. Those claims are somewhat in
doubt, and exactly how it will help Francis stay upright against
Tyson is anyone's guess, but if it works, heavyweights all over
America will be driving to Parris Island with their trainers in the
back seat. That is the nature of sport: Success breeds imitation
almost without fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to lock myself away and mentally focus my body and
my mind and be away from the media,'' Francis said by phone from
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get all the attention, but when it comes down to
fight night, I have to be mentally and physically focused. There is
no way I can do that in the gym in London I use with the media
attention this fight has attracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it will be Tyson's first European appearance and the fight
sold out in less than two days, Francis may have a point, although
the smart money is betting he'll have more trouble keeping his eyes
focused after he takes Tyson's first punch than he'll have trying
to keep himself focused in the weeks leading up to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   A prohibitive underdog with a long record _ only some of which
was produced in the boxing ring _ the former street tough and
prison inmate had a rather succinct analysis of what his most
dangerous punch will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that lands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, but when a 35-year-old fighter sporting a 21-7
record and only 11 knockouts walks out of the darkness talking
about beating up Tyson, it is difficult not to laugh even after
acknowledging that this newest version of Tyson is a shadow of what
he once was.
</P>
<P>
   Francis understands the skepticism about him because of the fact
that he was an unranked fighter and unknown commodity until he was
plucked from obscurity by Tyson's handlers for this match. Yet he
insists, ``I have just done what people have not expected me to do.
I have seen guys crumble against Tyson. He has _ or had _ an aura
of invincibility, but it's been broken. Evander Holyfield broke it.
When James ``Buster'' Douglas wiped the floor with him, the bubble
was burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man is a man. Whatever they say about Tyson, he is human. He
bleeds. He feels pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson is fighting for his life. That's the same way I'm
approaching this fight. I set my sights and have always set my
sights further than what anybody else has seen them. I definitely
see this fight as a steppingstone.''
</P>
<P>
   As Julius Francis seems likely to soon learn, he isn't the only
one.
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Tapia should be applauded, and not merely for his
comeback fight this weekend against World Boxing Organization
bantamweight champion Jorge Eliecer Julio at The Pit in
Albuquerque. The fight is likely to be sold out, but Tapia
suggested to the promoter and the local police that two $30 tickets
be given to anyone agreeing to take a gun off the streets. Thus
far, more than 60 guns have been traded in, many of them illegals.
Tapia's mother was murdered when he was a boy, which scarred him
deeply and led to many of his outside-the-ring problems. Now he is
trying to help prevent young people in Albuquerque from going
through the hell he once faced. ``Before New Year's Eve, I got 57
guns off the street,'' Tapia said. ``The title don't mean nothing
to life. There's six bullets to a gun. You know how many lives were
saved just on New Year's Eve? That's a beautiful thing.'' So are
Tapia's efforts . . . Word in the cable industry is that promoters
Don King and Dan Goossen are back trying to make a David Reid-Felix
Trinidad fight for March 4. That was the original date of the fight
before complications arose over Reid's contract with HBO. Those now
appear solved because Goossen's suit against Time-Warner is going
away, but rival promoter Bob Arum has been holding that date for a
pay-per-view bout headlining bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala and
he wants to stick to it . . . Lou Duva is suing International
Boxing Federation 154-pound champion Fernando Vargas for what he
claims is the portion of Vargas's last purse he's owed. Duva no
longer trains Vargas but retains a share of his management
contract. Word is Main Events, which promotes Vargas, told the
champion to pay Duva but he refused. Duva and his son and daughter
have also filed suit against Kathy Duva, Lou's daughter-in-law, as
a result of the still unsettled breakup of what was once the family
boxing business . . . Meanwhile, Lou and his son and daughter are
back in the promotional saddle, having formed a new promotional
company called Duva Boxing. Duva's lawyers had to talk him out of
calling it Duva's Main Events, which should come as no surprise to
anyone who knows the feisty Duva. Their first promotion under the
new Duva banner will be Jan. 28 at The Ruins in New Orleans with
Harrah's casino as co-promoter. The main event pits super
middleweights Thomas Tate and Syd Vanderpool. Also on the card will
be undefeated heavyweight Clifford Etienne, who is 12-0 with nine
KOs. Known as the Black Rhino, he has thus far shown noticeable
punching power, and trainer Don Turner is convinced he will one day
be heavyweight champion. Maybe so, but it's a long walk from Baton
Rouge to the big time . . . Undefeated WBO super middleweight
champion Joe Calzaghe has this view of challenger David Starie.
``Starie's a good challenger, but there's no way he'll win,'' said
Calzaghe (27-0, 23 KOs). ``I have more knockouts than he has
fights.'' Starie (22-1, 16 KOs) is the British and Commonwealth
champion . . . Here's how sad it can get in boxing. Former
heavyweight champion Michael Moorer was sued by his 79-year-old
grandfather, who introduced him to boxing. Henry Smith originally
was seeking 25 percent of Moorer's past earnings, or $6.9 million.
A contract was produced with a handwritten addendum saying Smith
would get 5 percent of Moorer's income during his days fighting out
of the Kronk Gym. He did receive $64,850 and another $20,000 in
hotel room expenses, plane tickets, fight tickets, and meals,
according to John Davimos, Moorer's manager.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>

   Trainer Teddy Atlas appears to be ready to train Junior Jones
for his upcoming fight with Prince Naseem Hamed. Both Jones and
manager Gary Gittleson approached Atlas about preparing the former
world champion for what is likely to be his last shot at the
big-time. Atlas has yet to formally agree because of his reluctance
to return to the corner with anyone who isn't fully committed to
winning, but it is expected he will begin working with Jones next
week at Marciano's Gym in New Jersey if Jones can convince him he's
ready to follow the plan Atlas lays out. Atlas will quickly decide
after those opening training sessions whether he will stay the
course based on how Jones's preparation is going . . . Atlas
continues to train only one fighter while working as boxing's top
analyst on ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights.'' That is undefeated
Elvir Muriqui, the Kosov Kid, who is back home now but returns to
begin training soon. Muriqui will soon make an appearance on an
ESPN show with Atlas doing a boxing first: He will work the corner
with a live microphone, thus becoming the first man to serve as
cornerman and commentator in the same fight . . . The Miami Herald
reported that former super middleweight Sanderline Williams claims
he was offered $30,000 to take a dive against Roberto Duran ``in
the early 1990s.'' Williams claims the offer was made in a
restaurant near Cleveland, but the fight never took place. Williams
once served as Duran's sparring partner, and his former manager,
John Giachetti, said his fighter was offered $30,000 to fight Duran
but not to lose to him. Promoter Mike Acri, who was handling Duran
at the time, said he never even offered Williams the fight. ``For
what?'' Acri said . . . Sad to report that 38-year-old attorney
Jacqueline Frazier-Lyde, the daughter of Joe Frazier, will fight in
Scranton, Pa., Feb. 8 for $25,000. The mother of three supposedly
is preparing to challenge Laila Ali, 21-year-old daughter of
Muhammad Ali. The plan is for her to fight Ali in September, the
25th anniversary of the Thrilla in Manila. Frazier's first fight is
on the undercard of an IBF light heavyweight title fight between
champion Salvatore Di Salvatore and undefeated Chris Mills (18-0) .
. . Over and over people predict the death of boxing, and it proves
again and again that no sporting event fascinates like a big fight.
An entertainment trade magazine recently listed 1999's top box
office events. First was the Christmas show at Radio City Music
Hall, grossing more than $54 million for 208 performances. Next was
the Lewis-Holyfield rematch, which grossed nearly $17 million at
the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas. That's nearly a third as
much money for one night as Radio City did for its 208 Christmas
shows. The Holyfield-Lewis gate was nearly twice as much as the
third-place finisher, David Copperfield's magic shows, which
grossed $8.6 million . . . Golota will undergo an arthroscopy on
his right knee as a result of the car accident he was involved in
recently in Iowa. His companion died in the accident but Golota
received only minor injuries, including a sprained medial
collateral ligament and a torn medial meniscus . . . To make your

HBO's spring dance card has rapidly filled up with a strong first
quarter headlined by a April 29 heavyweight title fight between
undisputed champion Lennox Lewis and undefeated challenger Michael
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Local bleatings
</P>
<P>
   John Ruiz's shot at the world heavyweight title is off until
November, and his chance to solidify his No. 1 ranking with the WBC
by fighting No. 2 contender Grant disappeared with it. So where
does that leave the Chelsea fighter? Manager Norman Stone is hoping
for a boxoff for both the WBC's and WBA's No. 1 rankings against
three-time world champion Holyfield. Holyfield is third in the WBC
and second in the WBA, having been moved ahead of Ruiz by the
latter organization. Stone is hoping King can make that match, with
the winner guaranteed a title fight in July. HBO Sports president
Seth Abraham said if Ruiz were to get that fight and win ``he would
have tremendous leverage in any negotiations with either Grant or
Lennox for a title fight. He would be the underdog, but it's a
gamble worth him taking.'' Stone said he would also ask the WBC to
reaffirm Ruiz's No. 1 ranking because he had made his best effort
to make an elimination bout with Grant and was denied. ``Johnny did
something unprecedented,'' said Tony Cardinale, lawyer for both
Stone and Ruiz. ``He was willing to risk the mandatory title shot
and his No. 1 ranking against the No. 2 contender.'' Stone will try
to force the WBA to declare its title vacant when Lewis fights
Grant April 29 because, by contract, he was supposed to defend it
against the sanctioning body's top contender, Henry Akinwande, or
the next-highest available contender if Akinwande was is not
available. If that's done, Ruiz and Holyfield would fight for the
WBA title. Failing that, they hope to force the boxoff with
Holyfield that would bring Ruiz over a $1 million payday and set
him up for a big-money title shot with the Grant-Lewis winner.

DUVAL IS LEANING INTO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually, all Tiger Woods has to do is show up and he's the
story. But at last weekend's Williams World Challenge in Arizona, a
charity event that was billed as Woods's invitational, the
spotlight instead belonged to David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The man who for a short time last year replaced Woods as the
world's top-ranked player made observers stop and take notice. Not
because of 300-yard drives; Duval does that routinely. Not because
of wedges that would have settled into thimbles from 100 yards;
again, that's ho-hum for Duval. No, what people noticed was the
physique. Duval has obviously made a commitment to better health
and it's apparent that he isn't about to sit back while Woods races
into the stratosphere without him.
</P>
<P>
   Though his playing weight is still 190 pounds, Duval has
distributed it better. He is leaner, less bulky in the midsection,
and seemingly stronger. But he is no more revealing about himself,
shrugging off inquiries about his new look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' he told reporters in Hawaii, where he is the
defender at this weekend's Mercedes Championship. ``Go work hard
and eat well, and that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval didn't say so, but it's probably no conincidence that he
took this approach after watching Woods put up a dominating
performance in 1999 that left everyone else playing for second
place. In the process, people stopped talking exclusively about
Woods's eye-opening length and marveled, too, at his physical shape
and it wasn't long before it was publicized how hard the phenom
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to compete against players who are so much
stronger than you are,'' said Woods, who has gained 22 pounds since
breaking into pro golf as a 158-pounder in 1996. ``You just need to
get stronger to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether Duval's new approach to
physical conditioning will help him keep up with Woods. Even though
he has turned the ripe old age of 24, Woods has no intention of
releasing his grip on the pro golf world.
</P>
<P>
   It's still his, but it should be fun watching him trying to keep
it.
</P>
<P>
   Changing his clothes
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik has heard the jokes about his attire (he wore
bright red pants in the opening round of the Mercedes
Championship), but the Swede has always insisted that he's in style
_ European style, which he insists blazes the way. Perhaps he is
correct, because Duval has ended his association with Tommy
Hilfiger and signed on with Mossimo, a California-based clothing
company known for its European style. Duval unveiled the new look _
all black and nowhere as loose-fitting as the traditional golf
fashion _ during the Williams World Challenge, but it remains to be
seen whether the untucked shirttail is part of the new style . . .
Another change that keen golf fans will take note of in 2000 (and
we're not talking Woods's bag being emblazoned with Buick or Vijay
Singh's switch from Wilson to Cleveland irons) is the much-heralded
Callaway golf ball, which has been one of the great industry
secrets in recent years. The ball is ready (reporters made note of
Rocco Mediate and Brian Henninger heading out for practice rounds
at the Mercedes Championship armed with black pens to cover the
logo) but won't officially be introduced until the PGA Merchandise
Show in early February . . . Had enough of polls? Here's one that
proves how nonsensical they are, and why we should hope that it's
another thousand years before we have to suffer more of them.
PGATour.com and GolfWeb asked readers to select the golfers of the
millennium, and 5,207 votes later, the list was a joke. Rightfully,
Jack Nicklaus was first, but get a load of these placings: Payne
Stewart sixth, Fred Couples seventh, Greg Norman ninth, Sergio
Garcia 12th. Sergio Garcia! Ahead of Tom Watson and Lee Trevino?
One amazing golf shot that produces a second-place finish in the
PGA outweighs 14 major championships? Please. Where is Harry
Vardon? Gene Sarazen? Walter Hagen? Billy Casper? One look at the
list should have produced laughter, then editors should have showed
sanity and not published it. Given the voters' leanings, I'm
stunned that Celine Dion, Kevin Costner, and Michael Jordan weren't
there . . . Of the 31 eligible players, only Jose Maria Olazabal
chose not to take part in the Mercedes . . . Olazabal was an easy
choice for the Ben Hogan Award, given by members of the Golf
Writers Association to a player who continues to be active in golf
despite a physical handicap or serious illness. The GWAA also voted
Nancy Lopez the William D. Richardson Award for consistent
contributions to the game . . . Remember the woman who stripped
down to her underwear and ran onto the 18th green to plant a kiss
on Woods at the British Open last July? She was fined $400 by a
judge in Arbroath, Scotland, this past week, but outside the court
Yvonne Robb could not promise to behave at the 2000 event at St.
Andrews. ``I'm going to have to surprise you,'' she said . . .
Pampered members of the American PGA Tour hopefully appreciate what
they have. If not, please point out to them that this weekend in
Australia, the 2000 SmokeFree Victorian Open is featuring a
$100,000 purse, of which $18,000 goes to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention
</P>
<P>
   An evening to honor golf champions of 1999 was held at Wellesley
CC Wednesday, with the highlight being Player of the Year honors
presented to Jim Salinetti of Stockbridge GC (MGA) and Melanie
Curtin of Presidents GC in Quincy (WGAM). Salinetti, a senior at
the University of Rhode Island, earned the prestigious award for
the second time, thanks in large part to a dominating performance
to win last summer's State Amateur at Kittansett (he also completed
the State Am/POY perfecta in 1997) but perhaps a more treasured
victory came late in the summer at Blue Hill CC when Dick Salinetti
birdied the par-5 18th to nail down the Father and Son
Championship. ``I had to talk him into hitting the 7-wood,'' said
Jim with a laugh, nodding to the man who taught him this game he
now plays so well, ``but he hit the most awesome shot (to 5 feet)
I've ever seen.'' For Curtin, 28, it culminated a rather incredible
rise to the top of the local women's golf scene as she just started
playing the game five years ago. The Weymouth native was an avid
tennis player, earning a scholarship to Jacksonville University,
but she made the transition to golf quite smoothly. So well, in
fact, that she will pursue it professionally, having earned full
exempt status on the Futures Tour. Curtin will head to Florida
later this month to work on her game as she chases a dream that she
hopes will lead to a career on the LPGA. Curtin's many friends and
supporters are having a fund-raiser on her behalf Jan. 21 at the
Weymouth Elks Club. The donation is $60; for information, call
Patty Buck (617-325-0156), Peter Hess (617-770-2746), or Lisa
Kennedy (781-740-8358) . . . One player who knows about being
player of the year is Geoff Sisk of Marshfield. The two-time State
Open champion is a few weeks away from a trip to Florida, where he
will prepare to return to the BUY.com Tour (formerly Nike Tour) in
hopes of earning his way back to the big leagues. He was on the PGA
Tour in 1999, but his rookie campaign was disappointing, filled
with mistakes, inconsistent play, and indifferent travel plans. He
finished 198th on the money list, then failed at the second stage
of Q School. ``I played in every Monday pro-am I could play in,''
said Sisk, who has enough status that he hopes to get into at least
the first five stops on the BUY.com Tour. From there, if he plays
well, he is confident the remainder of the season will take care of
itself. ``They're not beating me, I'm beating myself,'' he said.
``The window of opportunity is starting to close, but until I can
say I've played my best and been beaten, I'm going to try.'' Sisk
will again be joined by his good friends on the minor league
circuit, as Kevin Johnson of Pembroke and Fran Quinn of
Northborough are fully exempt . . . There are details to be worked
out, but the MGA deserves a round of applause by beginning the new
year with a bold step that can only bring hundreds more players
into competition they normally wouldn't be eligible for. A state
net team championship will make its debut in 2000, with qualifying
rounds leading to a final, most likely in October. As the level of
play has improved dramatically and entries have exploded, the MGA
has, like most golf associations, been forced to set a minimum
handicap requirement. That, unfortunately, has left a lot of
willing enthusiasts on the sideline . . . He was honored for his
1999 Mid-Amateur championship, but Frank Vana Jr. of Marlborough CC
received a second tribute Wednesday, a rather unexpected nod as MGA
Golfer of the Decade. His Player of the Year points from 1990-99
totalled 3,991, a thousand more than runner-up (and his State
Four-ball partner) Jack Kearney of Elmcrest. Quite a tribute to
this consistent standout, though what should be noted is that Frank
Vana Sr. should thus be called Caddie of the Decade, for he has
been there nearly every step of the way. After Vana and Kearney,
the top 10 rounds out with James Driscoll of Charles River, Joe
Keller of Oyster Harbors, Jon Fasick of New England CC, Jim
Ruschioni of Oak Hill, Justin Peters of Pembroke, Steven Tasho of
Thorny Lea, Salinetti, and Brendan Hester of Pleasant Valley . . .
Brian Connor, a Walpole native who attended Xaverian Brothers High
School and Boston College, has been named director of marketing for
the TPC course that is being built in Norton. The land will be
cleared this spring and the Arnold Palmer-designed course is
scheduled for completion in 2002 . . . Four Massachusetts golf
shops _ The International in Bolton, Stow Acres CC, Edwin Watts in
Hanover, and Joe and Leigh's Discount Pro Shop at Pine Oaks in
Easton _ were included in the Top 100 across the country as voted
by Golf Shop Operations, a subsidiary of Golf Digest . . .
Children's educational and recreational programs throughout the
Mashpee area received $34,000 in grants from the Paul and Phyllis
Fireman Charitable Foundation and the Willowbend Children's Charity
. . . Chances are you will never meet Jenny Ritchie of New Zealand,
but you may want to raise a toast for her remarkable luck last
weekend. The 51-year-old ended the century with a hole-in-one Dec.
31, then began the next one with another ace less than 24 hours
later . . . Sad passings to report: Don Carner, who married Jo Ann
Gunderson in 1963 and operated a par 3 course in Seekonk before
they set out on a long and successful LPGA Tour journey, died at 84
after a long battle with Parkinson's; Gary Adams, who in the mid
'70s wanted to design a metal wood to please driving range owners
but ended up revolutionizing the golf industry, died at 56; and
Australia's most beloved amateur, Doug Bachli, who defeated
American Bill Campbell at Muirfield in 1954 to capture the British
Amateur, died at 77 . . . But no loss is as painful as that which
strikes closest to the heart, which is why the death of colleague
Robin Romano, 45, is nearly unbearable. She advised, encouraged,
and never stopped being the best friend one could ever have been
blessed with. When the topic was golf there was no one I enjoyed
talking with more than she, and I don't know of many people who
played the game _ or lived life _ more passionately. On the first
tee of the first round we ever played together, I took note that
she marched to the white tees, from where I hit. Three holes later,
to make things more fair, I suggested she move to the blue and I
move to the red. She laughed (though I was serious; oh, how she
could play), and it is the memory of that laugh that I will cherish
forever.

BU ROLLS PAST NORTHEASTERN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston University and Northeastern men's basketball teams
had much in common before confronting each other Saturday at Case
Gym. Both teams had two victories, against the same opponents, and
four successive defeats in seasons that appeared to be going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the Terriers set themselves apart in this game. They
dictated the tempo from the start, reacted efficiently to
Northeastern's pressing tactics, and maintained their composure in
a 62-45 victory before an announced crowd of 467. Neither team
appears capable of competing for the America East title, but BU
(3-10, 2-3) at least separated itself from the bottom teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northeastern is always one of our biggest rivals,'' BU's Mike
Costello (12 points) said. ``We play with their guys in summer and
we know each other well. We were real excited for this game after a
couple tough road trips and we were ready to play. We had a good
game plan. We knew we had to stop them on the outside, take care of
the ball against their pressing and trapping.''
</P>
<P>
   BU scored 14 of the game's first 16 points. The Huskies closed
to within 21-12 on Jean Bain's jumper with 10:03 left in the first
half. But the Terriers soon pulled away, stretching their advantage
to 48-21 on a Nacho Rodriguez inside move midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that losing is OK as long as you give all your
effort,'' said Northeastern coach Rudy Keeling. ``This result is
regrettable but we still have a lot of games left, so let's go from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   NU (2-10, 1-3) put Marcus Blossom at point guard in place of
Bain, but the move failed to bring cohesion to the team. Whether
Blossom will continue in the role against Towson Friday will be
determined by midweek, Keeling said.
</P>
<P>
   BU, which has suffered four defeats by 20 or more points, seemed
unaccustomed to being in position to dominate an opponent. But the
Terriers adjusted to their status and eventually seemed to thrive
on their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected it to be a close game,'' said BU coach Dennis
Wolff. ``We had good focus to begin the game and played
unselfishly, particularly at the beginning of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good win for us and now we have to build on it and
beat Liberty Tuesday (at BU). We found open guys and they made
shots. And if you make open shots everything is a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Costello and Jean Avebe, BU's only seniors, ignited the
Terriers' early run, scoring 11 of the team's first 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the ages of our players and you've just got to be
patient with them,'' Wolff said. ``We've had two or three chances
to win games. We've played hard but we just ran out of gas against
Hofstra (a 74-46 loss Jan. 2). This is a good group and they want
to win.''

   AMHERST _ Most of the fans at the Mullins Center stuck around
after Saturday's contest was over. When the University of
Massachusetts Minutemen packed up and headed off the court after
their 82-52 triumph over Atlantic 10 foe Fordham, the faithful gave
them a rousing ovation and didn't stop clapping until the home team
was out of view.
</P>
<P>
   There is joy again is Western Massachusetts. The much-maligned
Minutemen, facing what some had coined a must-win situation, staged
arguably their most significant triumph of the year _ holding the
A-10's highest-scoring team 28 points below its average while
scoring the third-most points they've tallied all season.
</P>
<P>
   Even UMass coach Bruiser Flint was seen smiling. His team
improved to 7-7 overall, 1-1 in league play, and snapped a
three-game losing streak. Due to a break in the schedule, Flint's
team has one week to savor the triumph, and the coach hopes it help
the Minutemen turn their season around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been up and down, up and down, but I keep saying that
there's a lot of basketball left to play,'' said Flint, whose team
held the Rams to 21 first-half points, a low for any UMass opponent
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack had a game-high 22 points and Chris Kirkland added 21
points and five steals for the Minutemen, who avoided starting 0-2
in A-10 play for the first time since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass players credited a team meeting Friday with the
improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a sense of urgency,'' said guard Shannon Crooks
(10 points, 4 steals, 2 blocks). ``We told each other, `We're not
going to lose this game, no matter what.' This is the best feeling
I've felt all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen still shot poorly (40 percent) from the floor, but
you would never know it from their output.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 6-3, early, UMass used a full-court press to force
steals and gain transition buckets en route to a 15-0 run and 18-6
lead with 11:02 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham cut the lead to 18-11, but the Minutemen, who have have
had trouble maintaining large leads, regrouped for a 31-21 edge at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Fordham came in the second half was 32-23 with 19:31
left on a jumper by Teremun Johnson. As they did in the first half,
the Minutemen went on a 15-0 burst to lead, 47-23, with 14:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were into this game early,'' said Fordham coach Bob Hill.
``I thought we had a decent presence defensively. But when they
started to press we lost our composure. They had a nice little run
that got them control of the game and in the process it became an
up-and-down game and they were just jumping over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevon Robin led Fordham with 13 points but made just 2 of 8
shots from the floor. The Rams (7-7, 0-2) shot 30 percent from the
floor, including 27 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can beat teams shooting 40 percent if we don't
shoot in the 30s,'' said Flint, whose team outscored Fordham, 32-6,
on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flint said junior college transfer guard JoVann Johnson has yet
to return to school since telling the coach about a death in his
family during the Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him every day and leave messages, and I haven't heard
from him,'' said Flint about the player he recruited to help the
team's outside shooting woes. ``The thing is, his teammates call
him, too, because they're concerned about him.''

ATLANTA IS FANKHOUSER'S BEST STOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Fankhouser, last seen around here as UMass-Lowell's No. 1
netminder, now holds down that same job for the Atlanta Thrashers.
That's as of today. To start the season, he held that title for the
Greenville Grrrowl in the East Coast Hockey League. A few weeks
later, he was the top puckstopper for the Orlando Solar Bears in
the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to learn with pro hockey,'' said Fankhouser,
``you've just got to make the most of your breaks. I realize, hey,
I could be back in the East Coast League next week. You've just got
to hope you find a niche and play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most young netminders in the league, the 24-year-old
Fankhouser prefers the old-time standup style of puckstopping. He
doesn't have that Dominik Hasek flop-around style, or the
much-copied Patrick Roy butterfly style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start flying around out there, I'll get beat,'' said
Fankhouser, who signed with Atlanta as a free agent last summer,
after going 16-14-0 with UMass-Lowell last season. ``I'll go out
and handle the puck some _ because that helps your defense _ but
otherwise I stay in there and stay up straight, just kind of let
the puck hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid in Littleton, Colo., Fankhouser was a Rockies fan, but
it was Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr, the Hall of Famer-to-be, who caught
his attention. To this day, he keeps an Oiler pennant, signed by
Fuhr, hanging in his room back in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play like him, not by any stretch of the
imagination,'' said Fankhouser, who was in net for a win over the
Capitals Thursday night, lifting his record to 2-2-1 with a
sparkling .913 save percentage. ``Grant made those big, quick,
flamboyant saves. That's not me. I'm more the Kirk McLean style.
But I just loved the way Grant played. He was by far the most
exciting goalie to watch, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally drafted by St. Louis, the 6-foot-2-inch Fankhouser
was never signed by the Blues and ultimately caught on with the
Thrashers as a free agent, getting a three-way deal that guaranteed
him only $18,000 to play in Greenville. After quickly moving up to
Orlando after going 6-1 with the Grrrowl, he got the call to
Atlanta after only one start with the Solar Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some injuries,'' said Atlanta general manager Don
Waddell, ``and to be honest, the closest I figured Scott would get
to NHL ice would be to drink out of the water bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a couple of weeks of observing Fankhouser's steady
play, Waddell is more impressed with each of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so cool, calm, and collected,'' said Waddell. ``He
doesn't scramble or panic. He took over in a game against the
Flyers and stopped (Eric) Lindros on a breakaway.''
</P>
<P>
   In about a month, top netminder Damian Rhodes will be off the
injured list. Rhodes and Norm Maracle have been considered the
short- and long-term solutions in the Atlanta net, but Fankhouser
has upset that equation with his steady hand and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be careful,'' said Waddell. ``There's no question
he has a future in the NHL. Does that future have to be now? Not
necessarily. We've all seen goalies, like Jim Carey, who get
everyone caught up and then see it disappear. We're an expansion
team and we're not trying to do our best for today _ we're trying
to do what will be best for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waddell is well aware of the impact winning can have on an
expansion city. With Fankhouser's win over Washington, the
Thrashers were on a two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck,'' he said, ``if we ever won three in a row, half the
city would be out getting their fingers fit for Stanley Cup rings.
And you know what, I might be one of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   A primo rumor
</P>
<P>
   While Jason Allison's one-year contract extension was being
tidied up Thursday, a rumor making its way around the league had
the Bruins shoring up their sagging center spot with a trade that
would see netminder Byron Dafoe dealt to the Carolina Hurricanes
for free agent holdout Keith Primeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely news to us,'' said Todd Reynolds, the former
Northeastern netminder who is one of Primeau's agents. ``We haven't
heard Boston before, but it wouldn't surprise me if something
happened soon, and it wouldn't surprise me if he went to a club no
one's talked about much, and that it happens overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the last few weeks had the 28-year-old Primeau
landing in New York (Rangers), Philadelphia, and Phoenix. Just
before New Year's, Phoenix reportedly was prepared to swap Keith
Tkachuk to Carolina, with the 6-foot-4-inch, 210-pound Primeau
agreeing to a four-year deal worth slightly more than $4 million a
year. That was until Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos took a harder
look at Tkachuk's deal, which calls for the former BU forward to
earn in excess of $8 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith Tkachuk,'' said Karmanos, who never verified that the
offer was on the table, ``has a stupid contract.''

   Meanwhile, the powerful Primeau bounces back and forth between
his family in suburban Raleigh and regular workouts in Ontario.
Last week, he was back in North Carolina, while the Hurricanes were
picking up 2 points on Causeway Street. He was Carolina's top point
producer last season, with 30 goals and 62 points _ production that
would have ranked third on the Bruins in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of teams have expressed interest in Keith,'' said
Reynolds, confirming the three aforementioned clubs. ``Los Angeles
and St. Louis made some inquiries, too, but we haven't heard from
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be highly unlikely for Boston to swap for a such a
high-priced free agent without first talking to his
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Would such a deal make sense for the Bruins? In many ways, yes.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of six weeks, it has been a struggling,
unentertaining club; witness Thursday night's debacle at the hands
of the Hurricanes. As of Friday morning, only five of the 15 clubs
in the Eastern Conference had fewer victories than Boston. Clearly,
it's a team in need of an impact center. Primeau would bring speed,
size, strength, and some pop to the position. If his hands were on
a par with the rest of his game, he would be a 100-point scorer. He
never has shown that kind of touch in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe held out for a month at the start of the season, finally
agreeing to a three-year pact worth $9.45 million (less the month
of lost wages). He has since struggled to regain his 32-23-11 form
of last season, a result of his own lackluster performance as well
as the club's inability to pressure the offensive net and score
goals.
</P>
<P>
   If Dafoe were dealt for Primeau, who at $4 million-plus per year
would be at the high end of Boston's payroll, the Bruins then would
bring up Providence's John Grahame, the 24-year-old netminder who
filled in so admirably during much of Dafoe's holdout. The Boston
net would be entrusted to the combination of Grahame and Rob
Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the Bruins and Hurricanes share a significant piece of
trading history, dating back almost five years. On Aug. 26, 1994,
the Bruins, unwilling to pay Glen Wesley some $5 million over three
years, first signed the free agent defenseman and then traded him
to Hartford (soon to be Carolina) for three-first round draft picks
that turned out to be Kyle McLaren, Jonathan Aitken, and Sergei
Samsonov.

<P>
   These old houses
</P>
<P>
   Word out of Toronto last week was that Maple Leaf Gardens, now
69 years old, likely will be converted from hockey shrine to
condominiums. If a plan is approved soon, remodeling could begin
late this year. In Buffalo, the latest working plan for the
now-defunct Aud is for it to become a transportation hub for buses,
trolleys, cabs, perhaps trains. Here in the Hub? In the next month
or two, look for Delaware North officials finally to choose a
developer _ it's down to two proposals _ and construction to follow
on a $500 million build-up (roughly three times the cost of the
Vault) that will include hotel and retail space. When the two-acre
project is complete, the Vault's front door, masked anyway all
these years by the Central Artery, essentially will be shifted
toward Causeway Street, where all the new construction will act as
an enticing welcome mat. The last brick of the old Garden was
hauled away in October 1998 . . . The Buffalo News, in its Jan. 1
edition, named Lou Jacobs among the city's top 10 business
personalities of the 20th century. Jacobs, father of the
concessions company that became Delaware North Companies Inc., is
remembered for this quote: ``Wherever a crowd gathers, a lot of
people will get hungry.'' Not quite, ``We'll sell no wine before
it's time,'' but wouldn't Jacobs's words look marvelous over the
concession stands at the Vault? . . . Columbus, ready to enter the
league this fall, hasn't settled on a coach yet. Blue Jackets GM
Doug MacLean no doubt will wait at least until late this season,
giving him the advantage of factoring in the handful of coaches
who'll be whacked over the next four months . . . Closing in on
Terry Sawchuk's league-record 447 career victories, Roy recently
began reading a biography on the legendary, complex great. ``One of
the great things about all this is that the closer I get to the
record,'' Roy told the Calgary Sun last week, ``there will be more
and more things written and said about Terry Sawchuk. People will
sort of rediscover him.'' The 34-year-old Roy began the season with
412 regular-season wins. His 110 postseason triumphs more than
double the 54 won by Sawchuk. Only 40 when he died on May 31, 1970,
Sawchuk succumbed to a blood clot related to his fall over a
barbecue pit during a tussle with Ranger teammate Ron Stewart . . .
His days of line changes behind him, Wayne Gretzky now writes lines
as a newspaper columnist in Canada's National Post (think the
National Enquirer could land Wade Boggs?). The Great One's vision
of the future includes European-based clubs. ``Absolutely,''
Gretzky wrote recently. ``The reason is simple _ television and
travel _ and one day we'll see teams in places like Sweden and
Finland and Germany and probably even London. Maybe they'll have an
interlocking schedule, maybe two leagues would play for another
trophy, the World Cup, after the Stanley Cup.'' . . . The Canadian
government hasn't announced a formal plan of tax relief for its NHL
clubs, but it appears each of the six teams will be handed $5
million a year through 2004 (the end of the NHL's collective
bargaining agreement) to make it easier to compete with US-based
squads. Canada's NBA and Major League Baseball teams will want the
same handouts, of course, and then other privately-owned
enterprises will raise their hands, too. Sounds like a nightmare
that only secession to the US can end. Better yet, how about IPO
Canada, enabling every American to own a share of the provinces? .
. . Lightning GM Rick Dudley on junior star Jay Bouwmeester, the
16-year-old Canadian blue liner who wowed everyone at the recent
World Junior championships: ``I didn't see Lindros play at the same
age, but I've never seen a 16-year-old play like that.''
Bouwmeester isn't available until the 2002 draft . . . Bruins
play-by-play guy Dale Arnold picked up an A in lip reading Thursday
night, relating to viewers that Bruins coach Pat Burns said, ``It
doesn't matter,'' to Kerry Fraser as the referee tried to explain
why he awarded Carolina's sixth goal _ on a play Fraser initially
blew dead. Burns indeed was right _ the Bruins were toast well
before then _ but it was a shocking moment in Boston sports,
emphasized all the more by the TV cameras, to see the coach of the
never-say-die Bruins so casually admit the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Learning curve
</P>
<P>
   Only the day before he drilled home career goals Nos. 600 and
601, Brett Hull longed for the day when the league would relax its
limitations on curved stickblades, noting that goalies had plenty
of protection (``You couldn't hurt 'em with a cannon.''). Bruins
Hall of Fame netminder Gerry Cheevers isn't so sure today's
shooters would find the banana blades of old to their liking.
``Overall, I think you'd see the skill level drop for a lot of
forwards,'' said Cheevers, who lived through the era of the bowed
blade. ``It takes away a lot of backhand passes and backhand shots
_ now I'm talking about guys who had ridiculous curves. Some of
them, once they had it on their backhand, you wouldn't have to
worry about a thing, it actually helped you as a goalie. On the
same hand, it did make just average shooters very dangerous. It
gave their shots dip, speed, and the trickiest part of all was that
you didn't know where it was going.'' . . . First the Senators'
Vaclav Prospal calls Patrice Brisebois a ``(expletive) frog,''
denigrating Brisebois's French-Canadian heritage, then issues a
public apology, but pointedly omits Brisebois. Prospal instead made
a blanket apology to all French-Canadians and then added, ``But I
never will apologize to the one Frenchman who caused all this
controversy. That's my statement and I'll stick to it.'' Hey, OK,
nothing like a small man with an even smaller sense of diplomacy.
Let's do everything we can to find this guy a summer home next to
John Rocker's place. Later in the week, Prospal's agent, Rich
Winter, came out firing at Brisebois, labeling the Canadiens
defenseman ``gutless and spineless'' and saying he was ``hiding
behind his skirt.'' . . . If Ray Bourque calls it quits this
spring, as many expect, he will have played at least one
regular-season NHL game in no fewer than 53 rinks. Funkiest of the
bunch, without question, had to be the tiny Stampede, home to the
Calgary Flames during construction of the Saddledome. The benches
were so small that players had to sit glee-club style on two tiers
and the boards so high that ex-Bruin Bobby Lalonde could skate by,
his head barely visible above the rail. Bourque got in one game at
the old Detroit Olympia in a 6-3 loss to the Wings on Dec. 1, 1979
_ just 11 days before the Joe opened for business . . . Just back
with the Kings after hernia surgery, ex-Bruin Jozef Stumpel is out
again, this time with a wrenched knee . . . Almost seven years
after the Bruins made him the No. 25 pick overall in the '93 draft,
Kevyn Adams, now in his fourth year of pro hockey, looks as if he's
caught on as a regular with the Maple Leafs. The job: fourth-line
in-your-face pest, a la Tyson Nash in St. Louis (last seen getting
pummeled by Joe Murphy). ``I guess that's a good thing,'' the 6-1,
195-pound Adams told the Toronto Star. ``If the other guys are mad
at me, then maybe I'm doing something right.'' Lowballed by the
Bruins, Adams never signed in Boston and was one of three
consecutive first-rounders _ along with Dmitri Kvartalnov ('92) and
Evgeny Ryabchikov (21) _ who stunted the club's growth in the '90s
. . . The Blackhawks have adopted a playoff approach for home
games, retreating to a downtown hotel for R&AMP;R after day-of-game
skates at the United Center. Who knows if it will translate to
extra points in the standings, but their hotel points will get a
huge boost. It's somewhat reminiscent of the day Mike Milbury, then
coach of the Bruins, bused his boys to cheap digs on Route 1 prior
to Game 5 of a playoff series with the Canadiens in '91. Milbury
then: ``I don't know what went on in every room _ but my room was
quiet.'' The cheap digs did the trick: The Bruins dumped the Habs,
4-1, the next night and went on to win the series . . . Old friend
Rosie Ruzicka, front and center during the Czech Republic's
gold-medal win at the Japan Olympics, retired from the Czech Elite
League Tuesday, hindered by a groin problem. ``No one ever scored
as many goals on me as he did,'' said countryman Hasek. Added
fellow Czech Jaromir Jagr: ``Rosie's been my idol since pee-wee
hockey.'' To see him leave, said Jagr, was like watching Gretzky
retire. Wonder where Rosie keeps that Channel 38 Seventh Player
trophy.

ANDERSON OFF TO HEALTHY START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kenny Anderson wanted this year to be different. So
far, it has been. The wins haven't come as often as he'd like, but
the injuries are another story. For the most part, they've stayed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's health and fragility were hot topics at the start of
the season. Could he sustain a full season under Rick Pitino? The
signs weren't good. In his 1 1/2 years in Boston, he had missed 28
games because of various ailments.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a lot left of this season, but Anderson started
Saturday night for the 32d time. As they might say in Foxboro, he
hasn't missed a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson worked out hard over the summer, hiring a track coach
in Atlanta to work on his legs and stamina. Once the season
started, he hired a personal chef and is more diligent than ever in
taking care of his body. It shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is prepare myself not to get hurt,'' he said
before Saturday's game with the Bulls. ``I'm doing more lifting.
I'm taking care of my body. Year by year, I think I'm getting wiser
in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, who has publicly pleaded for Anderson to be in great
shape, said the point guard was arguably the team's MVP _ not
exactly a coveted honor at this point _ earlier in the week. His
numbers aren't necessarily eye-popping, but what sticks out are his
shooting _ 46 percent, which would be a career high _ and a nearly
3-1 assist to turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   And the 32 starts in 32 games. ``I was watching some interviews
on TV with older players,'' Anderson said, ``and I watched them
talk about what they did in the twilight of their careers. They
talked about taking care of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there are injuries that you can't prevent.
If someone bumps you, or you come down wrong on someone's foot and
sprain an ankle, those kinds of things. But you can take care of
your body to help with other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 29, has had two minor scrapes already this season. He
lasted only 11 minutes in the Celtics' sixth game of the season,
sustaining a hip pointer against the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the team had signed Doug Overton two days earlier in
the event Anderson got hurt. But he was back in the starting lineup
two nights later against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The other brush came last Tuesday in New York, when he strained
his left hamstring against the Knicks. He tried to play with the
injury in the second half, but clearly was hobbled. Luckily, the
Celtics had two days off and he was ready to play Friday. He had 12
points, 7 assists and 3 steals in 34 minutes against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky so far,'' he said. ``I just hope it stays this
way.''

BELICHICK'S SANITY IS MADDENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only lunatics around the NFL at the moment are the ones
whispering that Bill Belichick may have ruined his career by
refusing to accept a bad job under worse circumstances last week.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is a place where lunatics abound. Many of them are paid
handsomely for their antisocial tendencies, especially when acted
out on what is regarded by many as the holiest day of the week.
Belichick is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   The shame this week does not belong to him for following his
heart (and, to be honest, probably his accountant) and deciding not
to succeed the NFL's version of Bigfoot on the Giants Stadium
sideline. The shame belongs to people such as Jets president Steve
Gutman, who suggested that Belichick was in some sort of ``inner
turmoil'' because he decided he didn't want to follow Bill
Parcells, perhaps the greatest football coach of his time, as head
coach of a team with an aging and infirm starting quarterback, a
$10 million salary cap overrun, and an ownership situation that
will change radically between now and September.
</P>
<P>
   If that decision makes Belichick look like a troubled man, then
pro football and society could use a few more like him.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has been accused of accepting a $1 million ``bonus''
for not interviewing for jobs in Chicago and Kansas City a year
ago. Both Gutman and Parcells know that is not what happened. They
know the money was a salary increase given him by a kindly man
named Leon Hess and that Belichick earned that money this past
season, paycheck by paycheck, just as they know that after the deal
was done, Belichick spoke with both Mark Hatley of Chicago and Carl
Peterson of Kansas City before they went in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, one could call Belichick disloyal or disingenuous for
promising to follow Parcells and then getting cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could argue, as I would, that not taking the
Jets job may have been the sanest thing Belichick has done since
the day he first decided to ruin his life by turning it over to the
NFL's debilitating demands.
</P>
<P>
   The life of an NFL coach, in particular an assistant coach, is
not what it appears from the outside. Trust me, it's better than
working for a living in the real world because, as my old man used
to say, it's indoor work most of the time with no heavy lifting.
It's not putting roofs on houses in February as my father did for
nearly 50 years. It's not making other people's beds or cleaning
their laundry or picking up their mess as my mother had to do for
too many years. It's not real work at all, not in the
back-breaking, mind-numbing sense.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there isn't a high price to pay for doing
it. It means 18-hour days and catering to talented but often
childish young men and regularly facing public criticism from
nincompoops who usually don't know whether the ball is puffed or
stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   It means even more pressures on the families of those people,
families like Belichick's who last week had to hear Gutman suggest
that some sort of family or personal breakdown was involved, when
no such thing is the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Belichick's case, one day he was a genius and the next day he
was an evil maniac who didn't know what was best for him. He was
vilified by many Parcells toadies in Manhattan as disloyal,
disingenuous, and disheveled when he made public concerns that he'd
privately expressed to Parcells and Gutman on a number of
occasions. Those concerns continued to grow as the sale of the team
dragged on for one reason _ because John Hess and Gutman were
trying to wring every nickel they could out of it after Leon Hess's
son had already inherited $55 million from his father's estate and
stood to get a few million more when this sale is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Belichick didn't have some sort of
back-channel deal in place with Bob Kraft to replace Pete Carroll
as Patriots coach because he probably does, although no one can
prove it. It's not to say making a last-second decision to bail out
when he obviously had so many doubts was completely aboveboard,
either, but it certainly was understandable. But for people to act
as if no one has ever been in such a situation and opted for what
he or she believed was best for their family is the ravings of
lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I did the same thing myself about 10 years ago, after
accepting a columnist's job in Denver and then changing my mind
less than 24 hours before I was supposed to write my first column.
There were a lot of reasons, most of them personal.
</P>
<P>
   If that makes me a lunatic _ so be it. No one in my family
thought so, and they were really the only people whose opinion I am
concerned about. Then or now.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick made his decision for several reasons. He expressed
some of them at his press conference, when it was suggested that he
looked uncomfortable and wary. No kidding? He's in a room full of
wiseguys and vultures ready to tear him to shreds for something at
least some of them have probably done at some point in their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a guy who was ever very media-friendly either, as he
proved in his first head coaching experience in Cleveland. Was it
any surprise that he didn't exactly look or sound comfortable as he
announced that he wasn't going to do what everyone in the building
thought he was going to do?
</P>
<P>
   Several nights ago, a student at Harvard Medical School faxed a
local radio host a two-page letter chastising him for calling
Belichick a lunatic and suggesting that he looked like someone who
belonged in a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   People are entitled to their opinion, and talk shows are
designed to stir up the masses and prod conversation, but let's get
a little perspective, which admittedly is in short supply when the
Patriots and Jets are involved.
</P>
<P>
   What Belichick did was the right thing for him, regardless of
whether he believes he'll end up coaching the Patriots or not. It
was the right thing because he didn't feel right about the
situation for whatever reason, and he's the one who would have to
live with it.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman knows full well that the contract Belichick supposedly
signed five times can offer him as coach no real protection from a
meddlesome new owner. He knows, for example, that when Cablevision
executive Chuck Dolan bought Madison Square Garden, the Knicks, and
the Rangers, he installed his son, Jimmy, as the boss and had Dave
Checketts reporting to him.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, as Belichick surely must, that it was young Dolan who
ordered Checketts to ax Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld.
Jimmy is the operational head of Chuck Dolan's businesses. Chuck
negotiates the deals but he lets Jimmy run them now. I've heard
some real horror stories about Jimmy. I don't know Belichick, but
I'm sure he was asking himself whether he wanted to have to report
to a guy like that. That was probably the uncertainty he kept
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one can argue about the sanctity of a contract, and
point out that Belichick agreed to this deal in 1997. Then again,
no one can argue that he has any protection from a new owner
because the opposite has been played out so many times in sports
and in life as to make Gutman's protestations absurd. Anyone who
tries to argue that Belichick _ or any other employee _ is
protected beyond getting paid off when a new sheriff comes into the
organization does sound like a lunatic or a pretty naive person.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, like Belichick, knows that when you pay $680 million for
a sports franchise, you do what you want with it, and what Dolan
has done in the past is put his own man in over the basketball and
hockey people running the Knicks and Rangers and they answer to his
son, who may be able to dribble and skate but that doesn't make him
knowledgeable in either basketball or hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman also knows that he may not even be around himself to help
protect Belichick (not that he could), and Parcells has made it
clear he'll quit in a minute if the new guy bothers him. So where
would that leave the well-protected Belichick?
</P>
<P>
   Probably fired in a year or two. Fired in what he knows is his
last chance in the NFL, because unlike the NBA, NHL, or Major
League Baseball, the NFL doesn't keep recycling head coaches. Most
of the time, you get two chances. After that, you're driving a
leased Taurus again for the rest of your coaching career while
someone else has the Caddy or the Jag and the suite on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding that, Belichick wanted one thing. He wanted to
have full control. He didn't want Bill Parcells or Jimmy Dolan or
Dave Checketts or anyone else telling him what to do. Not, at
least, in the matters of his football career.
</P>
<P>
   So he walked.
</P>
<P>
   Call that decision what you will. There is no one wearing a
white hat here. There is no moral high ground for anyone involved,
including Kraft. All sides are reaping what they sowed, in one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call it the action of a lunatic or a man suffering
inner turmoil. Even by the NFL's standards, that was a low blow.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hard reality in Big Easy
</P>
<P>
   When Saints owner Tom Benson called in Mike Ditka and Bill
Kuharich to fire them last week, no one was more shocked than
Ditka, who had convinced himself he would get at least one more
year in New Orleans despite going 6-10, 6-10, and 3-13. Kuharich
was more rational, although he was still shocked to hear the words
eight months after he'd been given a four-year contract extension
as club president and general manager. ``Until somebody actually
says the words, it's hard to believe, although I understand the
record has not been what Tom or any of us had hoped,'' said
Kuharich, who would have entered his 15th year with the Saints next
month. ``This is the first time I haven't had a job in football
since the USFL folded. It was very hard not to get up and go to
work the next day.'' Although Ditka, 60, said he was finished with
coaching, Kuharich is only 46 and hopes to find another
front-office position in personnel. ``I was brought up in
football,'' Kuharich said. ``I've been in it my whole life. But
there are only 31 GM jobs. I know what that means.'' What it
probably means is that Kuharich will have to move back into a
lower-level personnel job. Kuharich defended the move that he and
Ditka made last spring to trade their entire draft for running back
Ricky Williams, whose injury-plagued rookie season was a large part
of the reason things didn't work out for the Saints. ``Everyone was
in agreement in April when we did it,'' Kuharich said. ``That trade
can't be judged on one season. He had over 800 yards and only
played in 10 games. That's well over 1,000 if he'd stayed healthy.
You have to look back on it in three or four years and see how he's
done and how the people taken with those picks do.''. . . Best bet
in the NFL may be for the Rams to reach the Super Bowl. St. Louis
is undefeated at the TWA Dome (8-0), have won by an average margin
of 25 points at home, and have home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs. ``The Rams might run the table and go to the Super
Bowl,'' said Kuharich, whose Saints played the Rams twice and were
battered by their offense. ``They are legit, and as long as they
play at home, they're very tough to beat. They're so confident
there that the only team with a real chance to beat them is
Minnesota. The Vikings are the only team that can win a shootout
against them but their defense may not be able to hold the Rams in
check. Tampa can't play the game close enough because the Rams have
too many explosive weapons. They have three things going for them:
Mike Martz, their offensive coordinator; their quarterback (Kurt
Warner) has not had a bad game; and Marshall (Faulk). They can beat
you with Faulk, and if you try to stop him, they beat you with
(Isaac) Bruce and the quarterback.'' . . . Many have suggested that
the 13-3 Rams are a mirage because they played only three teams
with a winning record (Tennessee, Detroit, and Baltimore) and lost
to two of them while beating teams with an aggregate 38-83 mark. No
one can say that such a schedule wouldn't help anyone, even the
Patriots, but here's what Rams All-Pro defensive end Kevin Carter,
who led the NFL in sacks, had to say about it: ``Our record speaks
for itself. We don't worry about what the critics say. All we can
really control and worry about is what we do on Sunday. Everyone
said the Giants were going to come in and test us because they were
a team with a winning record a couple weeks ago and they had been
known to be tough in December and hadn't lost under (Jim) Fassel in
December, yet we took it to 'em. When they see us playing in the
Super Bowl, then they'll really know.'' . . . Don't bet against the
Titans in the AFC, either. Tennessee went 3-0 against the Rams and
Jaguars while the rest of the NFL went 2-27 against them.

   Bonus could be an onus
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mo Lewis reportedly has been offered the largest
signing bonus the Jets have handed out since Parcells arrived. It
exceeds the $6.2 million given to quarterback Vinny Testaverde a
year ago but is probably less than the $7.5 million bonus Curtis
Martin took as part of his deal to defect from the Patriots. It
would still be larger than Martin's signing bonus, which was only
$4.2 million; the rest came as a $3.3 million roster bonus received
seven days after signing, a poison pill that prevented the Patriots
from matching. That bonus only complicates things for the Jets,
though. They are more than $10 million over next season's projected
salary cap, and an executive familiar with the team said, ``I see
why Belichick bailed. It's going to be very hard to be better than
8-8 with that team. Parcells is a genius in many ways. One of them
is in knowing when to leave.'' . . . The Dolphins' offense has
stalled for many of the same reasons the Patriots' did. They can't
run the ball and have been abysmal in the red zone. Miami enters
the postseason ranked 23d in red-zone production. Miami has scored
a touchdown only 41.2 percent of the time (21 of 51 attempts) from
inside the 20. The only worse playoff team is Tampa, at 33.3
percent (15 touchdowns in 45 tries). The Patriots were the worst in
the AFC, scoring a touchdown 37 percent of the time (17 of 46).
Tampa was the least-productive team inside the red zone in the NFL
. . . Here's how backward things are in Dallas. Going into the
season, the Cowboys were 53-9 when Emmitt Smith rushed for 100
yards. This season, they went 3-5 when he did it and lost five of
the last six such times. This flies in the face of the league
trend, as teams won better than 75 percent of the time a back ran
for 100 yards or more. Smith, by the way, was supposed to be washed
up two years ago. Well, he was 8 yards shy of the NFC rushing title
this year and finished with 1,397 yards to leave him only 2,764
yards short of breaking Walter Payton's all-time record . . . Is
there any chance the Cleveland Browns will draft anyone but Florida
State wide receiver Peter Warrick with the first pick in April's
draft? Not unless he gets hit by a bus. The show he put on against
Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl was a far better advertisement for
his talents than winning the Heisman. Browns quarterback Tim Couch
even joked recently that he plans to walk into personnel director
Dwight Clark's office singing the Florida State fight song . . .
Here's a sad song for Kraft. The Patriots were third, behind the
Browns and Packers, in total salary in 1999, spending $75,072,400.
The six highest-paying teams and seven of the top 10 didn't even
manage winning records . . . Why should ex-Redskins executive
Charley Casserly land himself a job running an NFL team? Here's one
reason: The Redskins were 30th in the league in salary in 1999,
spending $50,641,800, and finished atop the NFC East with a 10-6
record. Casserly was in Houston Friday to talk with owner Bob
McNair about a job running his football operation. Benson and Kraft
could help themselves by bringing Casserly in to run the football
operation. The irony if Casserly landed with the Saints would be
obvious. He's the guy who made the deal that sent Williams there
and set up the Redskins for the future with a shopping cart full of
draft picks.

   While the Rams were in Philadelphia over the New Year's holiday
preparing to play a meaningless final game with the Eagles, the
team brass grew concerned about how to keep them focused on the
game. So the players were shown a film of the first Ali-Frazier
fight at Madison Square Garden and, on game day, Frazier was
brought in to address the team. The Rams didn't win, but they
played far better than anyone hoped . . . According to a new rating
system for kickers that began this year, Miami's Olindo Mare was
the league's top kicker in part because he set a league record with
39 field goals in 46 attempts for a total of 1,364 yards. New
England's Adam Vinatieri was, like his team, in the middle of the
pack. Vinatieri finished 14th, going 26 of 33 and 807 yards. San
Francisco's Wade Richey was the most accurate kicker in the league,
hitting 21 of 23 (91.3 percent) . . . When the Redskins were
regularly reaching the playoffs under Joe Gibbs, they would
annually wear T-shirts extolling one of their team's virtues. Few
people in the organization remember those days because Washington
has not been in the playoffs in seven years. But equipment manager
Jay Brunetti does remember, and last week he handed out ``Believe
in Stephen'' T-shirts, a reference to NFC-leading rusher Stephen
Davis. The same company that used to make the shirts that extolled
``The Hogs'' and ``Riggo's Rangers'' cranked out the ones for Davis
in time for the playoffs . . . Somebody had better check the water
up there in Buffalo. Not only did Wade Phillips bench our Doug
(Flutie) after he led the Bills into the playoffs, but wide
receiver Andre Reed went on his Web site this week and ripped the
organization and Flutie. Writing on something called
AthleteDirect.com, Reed criticized the way the Bills got him the
ball last week to allow him to pass Art Monk and become No. 2 in
NFL history in receptions with 941, one more than Monk. Here's how
Reed saw the five catches he made in what may have been his final
regular-season game for the Bills: ``The record was great but I
think I wept because of a lot of other things. It wasn't just a
happy moment for me but also frustration. The five balls that I did
catch weren't even routes and that just makes me look bad, like
they have to give me charity throws. They've just been throwing me
bones to make me happy, but I'm not happy at all . . . They know I
don't want to be here anymore. It'll be a chip on my shoulder for a
long long time.'' What? The fact that they threw him probably twice
as many balls in his career as he caught? Gimme a break. But Reed
wasn't finished. Like Phillips, he piled on Flutie. The benching,
he wrote, ``It ``certainly was a shock to everyone . . . but you
may have heard that I'm not on speaking terms with Doug Flutie.
Doug Flutie has changed as a person over one year and (offensive
coordinator) Joe Pendry has had a plan for me from day one. You
don't do that to people because it comes back to bite you.'' Who is
doing Reed's biographical movie _ Oliver Stone?

ALL OLD CONCERNS REPLAYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The National Football League re-instituted its
replay process mainly so that playoff games or a Super Bowl would
not be decided by an incorrect call. Saturday the new replay rule
got its first playoff test, and it left many, and not just the
Buffalo Bills, muttering.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's most controversial replay, with 16 seconds left,
the lateral from the Titans' Frank Wycheck to Kevin Dyson that led
to a 75-yard kickoff return for a touchdown that won the game for
Tennessee, referee Phil Luckett gave his interpretation to a pool
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line judge's intial ruling was that it was not a forward
pass,'' said Luckett. ``Taking from where the pass left the
passer's hand right on that (25-)yard line, the receiver catches it
right there on that yard line. It did not appear to be a forward
pass; therefore there is not a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Luckett's ruling, it appeared that Wycheck threw his
pass from inside the 25 and, even more clearly, that Dyson caught
the pass over the 25.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial replay ruling by Luckett just before the
half had him somehow able to distinguish that Titans QB Steve
McNair went out of bounds on a third down scramble about 4 to 5
inches farther upfield than initially ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were able to get a first down on Luckett's ruling,
and that led to a 40-yard field goal by Al Del Greco as time
expired. Those 3 points, which gave the Titans a 12-0 lead, would
have a direct influence on the wild plays at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Wade Phillips, though, chose to take the high
road. ``I don't want to comment on that,'' said Phillips when asked
about Luckett's rulings. ``That's what replay is for. That's why we
put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had a primitive and cautious offense for much of the
game, making their creative last-second play all the more
astounding. ``I haven't seen anything like that since I've been in
this league,'' said Buffalo receiver Eric Moulds, ``or even in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Tenneesee offensive lineman Bruce Matthews said his pain
from the Houston Oilers' (the Titans' predecessors) loss to the
Bills in a 1993 playoff game, after blowing a 35-3 lead, is finally
soothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came from 32 points behind, but we did ours in 13
seconds,'' said Matthews. ``It's truly amazing; I've never seen
anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Doug Flutie, shocked as all the Bills were, said he never
had seen an ending like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go from starting, to thinking about next week, to we have
to go back and work on next week, to praying for an official's
overturned call, to dropping to your knees in disbelief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of sitting on the bench, Flutie said, ``You'd always rather
start, but it was out of my hands and it wasn't my call. My role
(Saturday) was to back up Rob Johnson. It was a difficult thing not
to start.''

TITANS RETURN FROM DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The play, the wild and wacky play, is called ``Home
Run Throw Back.'' A football home run it most certainly was, but it
threw the National Football League back into consternation and
chaos. Replay or no replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was do or die,'' said Tennessee tight end Frank Wycheck who
threw one of the most famous _ or infamous _ passes in NFL playoff
history, one that now gives the pros their own California-Stanford
finish, minus a tuba or two. ``And the funny thing is I wasn't even
throwing it to the guy who caught it (Kevin Dyson) but to Isaac
Byrd. It was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   If only that word ``crazy'' could do justice to how Tennessee
beat Buffalo, 22-16, Saturday in an AFC wild-card game with a
75-yard touchdown run off a ``lateral'' on a kickoff return with 16
seconds left. The play, which caught the Bills by surprise, was
bizarre enough, but then it was up to referee Phil Luckett _ the
infamous Phil Luckett _ to put his head under that black hood on
the sideline and watch replay after replay before ruling whether
Wycheck's toss to Dyson was a forward pass _ and illegal _ or a
lateral.
</P>
<P>
   There being 66,782 vocal souls making noise while Luckett
watched the tape and a whole army of songwriters here in Music City
ready to storm the Grand Ole Opry with new choruses about ``broken
hearts'' and ``cheatin' men,'' Luckett took the safe route.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled Tennessee had its winning TD even though it appeared
Wycheck's pass, which was thrown from a foot or two inside the
Titans' 25 and was caught a foot or two beyond the 25, may have
been forward, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Luckett, it should be remembered, was the person who ruled the
Jets' Vinny Testaverde scored on a plunge against Seattle last
season even though replays appeared to show he didn't cross the
goal line, and he was the one who botched the Thanksgiving Day coin
toss later in 1998 in a game between Pittsburgh and Detroit. ``We
have nothing to prove that it was a forward pass,'' Luckett said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wycheck, as well as Steve McNair and other Titans, not to
mention a whole posse of Bills, were not sure. ``I'm not sure if it
was forward or not,'' said Wycheck. Said Bills quarterback Rob
Johnson, ``I just hope for the referee's sake that they made the
right call.''
</P>
<P>
   The melodramatic finish was set up first by some dramatics by
the Bills and Johnson, who played well as the replacement for Doug
Flutie. A 36-yard field goal by Tennessee's Al Del Greco with 1:48
left gave the Titans a 15-13 lead. But Johnson, first playing
without timeouts and then without a shoe, needed only six plays to
set Steve Christie up for a 41-yard field goal, and a 16-15 lead,
leaving those 16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With 52 seconds left, Johnson had scrambled for 3 yards, losing
his shoe while being tackled. He then rushed back to the line of
scrimmage, his sock and tape dangling from his right foot, and
somehow scrambled and found Peerless Price along the right sideline
for a gain of 9 yards, the final yards Christie needed to attempt
his field goal. The heroics of Shoeless Rob Johnson were sure to
echo in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Run Throw Back'' was called by the Titans, and why not?
It was Tennessee's last chance, a play the Titans work on every
week but never have tried. And Wycheck went a step beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we huddled on the sideline, I made sure to (ask) Lorenzo
(Neal), `If you get the ball, you going to pitch it to me?' '' said
Wycheck. But the Titans were expecting a squib kick from the Bills,
``and that's how we usually work the play, off a squib kick,''
added Wycheck. ``We weren't expecting the bloop kick like they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson wasn't supposed to be on the field, he said. ``I've never
been on kickoff returns before,'' he said. ``But one of our guys
was cramping up and they just called my name out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was merely the start of the serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's kickoff was fielded by Neal at about the 24, and
Neal, as Wycheck had reminded him, handed the ball off to him.
``I've never been involved in something like that,'' Neal would
say, ``and I'd be lying if I said I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck's only option then, he explained, ``is to throw the
ball. No matter what. It's do or die then, so you have to throw it,
but I don't think Dyson was supposed to catch the ball. Ike (Byrd)
was supposed to catch it and pitch it back to Dyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, meanwhile, ``thought the play was over with'' when
Wycheck took the handoff from Neal. Suddenly, though, the ball was
flying his way on the left from Wycheck on the right ``and once I
caught it I thought, `Get yourself a TD or good position for a
field goal.' '' And as Dyson sprinted down the left sideline, nary
a Bill to buffalo out of the way, Wycheck was screaming, ``Get out
of bounds so we can kick a field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson kept running. Touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the replay, and Wycheck thought, ``It was a tight
throw. I mean, when they reviewed it, I didn't know which way it
would go. It happened so fast, but I thought I at least got it
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say this one now moves into the No. 1 spot,'' said Bud
Adams, the Titans owner and one of only three original American
Football League owners left. ``I've been watching this game for 40
years and I've seen a lot of plays, both for us and against us, but
this is the most weird way to end a game I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   That last play, said McNair, ``was the magnificent turning point
of my life . . . but did he throw a forward pass or was it a
lateral? And the wait was very frustrating, but it turned out for
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who has made a last-second play or two, could only say,
``I've never seen anything like it.''

HAMILTON GETS IN LINE FOR JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ After preliminary talks with vice president of
player personnel Bobby Grier and owner Bob Kraft, Patriots
defensive line coach Ray Hamilton has the impression he will be
formally interviewed for the team's head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Mr. Grier and Mr. Kraft said they wanted to speak to me
about the head coaching job,'' said Hamilton Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our talks went very well and they know what my
aspirations are. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Pete Carroll's staff, only defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell has been interviewed. But the organization is obviously
looking everywhere for coaching candidates in case the Bill
Belichick situation becomes too sticky or too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will answer Belichick's grievance Monday and then NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue will schedule a hearing involving Jets
management and Belichick's representation.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue may come up with a compensation figure by midweek for
any team interested in the services of the ex-Jet coach.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Jets don't go along with the amount, it could drag
out much longer _ though it would be hard to believe the Jets
wouldn't take draft picks for a coach they no longer want running
their team.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has been a longtime player, coach, and loyal soldier
for the Patriots. It appears he would be a strong candidate to stay
in New England no matter who becomes coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to stay here,'' said Hamilton. ``I've spent so
much of my life in this area. It's home for me. But I feel I've
reached the point in my career where it's time for the next level.
I feel I have a lot to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   One coach the Patriots are considering, but haven't formally
asked permission to speak to yet, is New York Giants defensive
coordinator John Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 44, said Saturday he had not been contacted by the
Patriots. But he's on the team's short list, and could join Oakland
Raiders defensive coordinator Willie Shaw, Baltimore Ravens
defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis, Chicago Bears offensive
coordinator Gary Crowton, and Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also is expected to speak with St. Louis Rams
offensive coordinator Mike Martz, Jacksonville Jaguars defensive
coordinator Dom Capers, and Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach
Art Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has been the Giants' defensive coordinator since 1997 and
was the Raiders' defensive coordinator in 1994. His defenses have
started out fast, but the Giants weren't very good late in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been quiet, but conducting business as usual
in Foxborough with Grier continuing to do his personnel
evaluations. Patriots employees have commented that nothing has
changed in terms of Grier's powers. At least not yet.

Lowry knew time was right to break out `throwback'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ When Titans assistant Alan Lowry switched from
coaching receivers to special teams after the 1998 season, he
installed a kickoff return called ``home run throwback,'' a
desperation play they practiced every week but never used until
Saturday's AFC wild-card game against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   After Steve Christie's 41-yard field goal had given the Bills a
16-15 lead with 16 seconds remaining, Lowry figured it was time to
use the special play in an attempt to pull off a miraculous
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened the way the Titans practiced it every Saturday,
but they got the results they wanted _ a touchdown that gave them a
22-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Christie popped up the ball, fullback Lorenzo Neal caught
it at the Tennessee 24. Neal handed the ball to tight end Frank
Wycheck going toward the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck ran a few steps to his right. As the Bills closed in on
him, Wycheck threw the ball back across the field to receiver Kevin
Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson caught the ball and took off down the left sideline and
didn't stop until he had a 75-yard touchdown return with three
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you live for this,'' Lowry said in the euphoric
Titans dressing room. ``When I was the Cowboys' special teams
coach, I saw SMU beat Texas Tech (34-27) with that play in 1982.
This was the exact situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't include the same players who had been practicing
it every week. The special play is designed for a squib kick, not a
pop-up kick. Wycheck is supposed to field the ball and throw it
across the field to receiver Isaac Byrd, who would run down the
sideline with Derrick Mason, the regular return man, trailing him
in case Byrd needed to lateral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't supposed to be out there,'' Dyson said. ``Mason went
down (concussion), and A.D. (Anthony Dorsett) was cramping up. He
(Lowry) just called my name out of the blue. As we were running on
the field, they were trying to explain it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball was short, I saw Ike try to catch it when Frank
was supposed to. I saw Frank catch the ball, but I wasn't supposed
to catch the lateral. That was supposed to be Ike. I took one hard
step out to make sure it was a lateral. Once I caught it, I was
thinking I should score a touchdown or get in position for a field
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills surprised the Titans by having Christie kick the ball
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it so their prime returner wouldn't get a chance to set
up a proper return, but they got it to him, anyway, but in a
roundabout way,'' Christie said, not realizing that Mason was out
and Dyson had replaced him. ``When they pitched it to our left,
everybody went left. Then they threw it back to our right, and we
couldn't recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dan Brandenburg, who was one of the Bills covering the
kick: ``They burned us. You want to play it safe, but you don't
want to play it too safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie caught the Titans off guard, but they improvised
exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lorenzo should get a ton of credit because the ball wasn't
supposed to come to him,'' Lowry said. ``We hadn't practiced
against the high, short one. Lorenzo had to improvise. He just
handed the ball to Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal had the presence of mind to react quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we run it in practice, the defense knows what we're
doing, but it always works,'' Neal said. ``Sometimes in practice, I
tell Frank, `I'll catch it, lateral to you and you make the throw.'
That way, we'll get more people thinking we're going to pitch it
around and it leaves no one on the back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the coverage team's going after the ball. They're
trying to pin you deep. Sometimes, you can have success if they
overplay it, and that's what happened. It really was unbelievable.
I've never been involved in something like that. It was an
emotional roller-coaster, but you never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck, who threw a 61-yard touchdown pass against Atlanta,
tossed the ball to Dyson because Byrd got tangled in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have that kind of kick because it caught them
off guard,'' Wycheck said. ``I ran to the other side of the field,
and it opened up on the other sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happened so fast. Byrd was supposed to catch it,
but Dyson did and he found a seam. It was a tight throw. I thought
I got it level or a yard behind (line of scrimmage). When they
reviewed it, I didn't know which way it would go.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Terry Killens got a clearing block for Dyson. The
question became would he score, or would he get tackled with not
enough time left, or should he go out of bounds?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some guys going down the sideline screaming for him
to get out of bounds,'' Lowry said, ``but Kevin just kept on
running.''
</P>
<P>
   After he scored, Dyson ran through the end zone and into the
corner of the stadium, where his teammates piled on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been paying attention to the clock, I would have
stopped on the goal line and let the last three seconds run out,''
Dyson said. ``I had time to do it. I had a wall in front of me. The
only thing left was the kicker. If I can't outrun a kicker, I
shouldn't be in the NFL.''

Seahawks, Dolphins running in reverse
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEATTLE _ Believe it or not, an NFL playoff team is going to lose
today in the Kingdome and end the season with six defeats in its
last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The other team is going to advance to the AFC semifinals with
only its second victory in its last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of parity _ the NFL's favorite word these days _ it's
more like hilarity that the Miami Dolphins and the Seattle Seahawks
still have a chance to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At least it should be an even matchup. Both teams are 9-7 after
playing the second half of the season like they were trying to earn
the No. 1 draft pick this spring. And both teams backed into the
playoffs with losses last weekend in their final regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive is that we got in,'' said Dolphins fullback
Stanley Pritchett, ``because really, we're not playing well right
now. We have no confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks haven't displayed a lot of confidence either,
failing to reach the end zone last weekend in a 19-9 loss to the
New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're excited about being in the playoffs,''
Seattle running back Ricky Watters said. ``But when you lose five
of the last six, there's a bad taste in everybody's mouth. We have
not been getting the job done. If we keep playing the way we've
been playing, it isn't going to matter. We're going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle squeaked into the playoffs when Oakland upset Kansas
City with a field goal in overtime. It gave the Seahawks the AFC
West title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you need to be lucky,'' Seattle coach Mike Holmgren
said. ``You need the ball to bounce a certain way on occasion. I'll
take it, but usually that won't get you to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, who are hosting a playoff game for the first time
in 16 years, never have made it to the Super Bowl. This is the
first playoff appearance for Seattle since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a typical playoff game since it involves two teams
that seem to have lost their way after early-season success. The
Dolphins were 7-1 before the downfall began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about us backing into the playoffs,'' Miami
coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``It's a simple deal. If you win enough
games, you make it in. We won enough games. Unfortunately, our
(wins) were early rather than late. But it's the same talent that
won those early games, and I think we can get it back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   One big problem for the Dolphins has been turnovers. Miami was
minus-13 on the turnover chart in the last six games. Veteran
quarterback Dan Marino has been a big part of the problem, throwing
12 of his 17 interceptions this season in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent this week looking at what we've been successful doing
in the last four or five weeks and decided to take that and go with
it,'' Marino said. ``We looked at what we've been successful doing
as a group, not necessarily just me. Simplifying the offense was
our theme this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Another simple reason for Miami's problems has been an inability
to run the football. The Dolphins are hoping to see the return of
rookie running back J.J. Johnson, who has a team-leading 558
rushing yards. Johnson has been out with a severely pulled right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have given up at least 100 yards rushing in four of
their last six games, so J.J. Johnson's return could help balance
the Miami attack and take some of the pressure off Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Running the ball also has been a problem for Seattle since
Watters sprained a ligament in his right knee two weeks ago.
Watters, who will wear a knee brace for the game, has rushed for
more than 1,200 yards, but he struggled last week and rushed for
only 30 yards on nine carries.

 &HT;    Erring Lions easy road kill for Redskins
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ It might not have come as a surprise to see most
NFL playoff teams put the clamps on the Lions' offense, but Detroit
wasn't playing a typical playoff team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions were playing the league's second-worst defense.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody forgot to tell the Redskins' defenders how bad they're
supposed to be, and they had no problems slowing down the Lions in
a 27-13 Washington win much more lopsided than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions (8-9) are 0-20 in Washington now, have lost six
straight playoff games, and their final five games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   No team that has ever entered the NFL postseason with a record
of .500 has won, lending weight to the theory no team in such a
predicament deserved to be here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit managed 258 yards of total offense against the league's
No. 30 defense. But get this: Ninety of those yards, and six of the
Lions' 15 first downs came on the game's final drive, when
everybody was backpedaling.
</P>
<P>
   Another 58 yards came on a Hail Mary pass on the final play of
the first half from Detroit quarterback Gus Frerotte to Herman
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those two possessions, the Lions had five possessions
that lost yardage.
</P>
<P>
   They intercepted Washington quarterback Brad Johnson twice, and
began four possessions in Redskins territory, but didn't score on
any of those possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In their first postseason appearance since the 1992 season, the
NFC East champion Redskins (11-6) looked a bit like their playoff
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time. It's been a long road,'' said 17-year
veteran Redskins cornerback Darrell Green, who played on two of the
three Super Bowl championship teams under former Washington coach
Joe Gibbs. ``And it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame running back John Riggins retired long ago, but
running back Stephen Davis ran all over the place behind a hogish
offensive line, rushing for 119 yards and two touchdowns in a
little more than a quarter of action.
</P>
<P>
   He left with a sprained right knee early in the second quarter,
but it hardly mattered. The Redskins took a 20-0 lead on the next
play on Brett Conway's second field goal, and Washington led 27-0
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins outgained the Lions 275-117 in the first half.
Davis' effort was hardly surprising, though, unless you consider he
had a sprained ankle that supposedly crippled him until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget he led the NFC with 1,405 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   But what about that defense?
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, despite incremental improvement the past two
months, have been dreadful on defense almost all season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday before an announced crowd of 79,411 at FedEx Field,
however, they dominated, sacking former Redskin Frerotte five
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, it must be said, were mostly awful since beating the
Redskins 33-17 Dec. 5 in Detroit. Injuries, and a lack of
confidence in the secondary led to five straight losses by a team
that began the season 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line was absolutely fabulous. That was as quick
as we've played, and we got a great pass rush,'' said Washington
coach Norv Turner. ``Offensively, in the first half we were playing
a lot like we did in the first four or five games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins averaged 37.5 points over their first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were sluggish in the second half, when Turner
said, ``I thought we lost some focus,'' Washington looks suddenly
like a pretty good match for its next opponent, the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday's game at Tampa Bay will pit the NFL's No. 2
offense against the Bucs' No. 3 defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Bucs' No. 28 offense will go against a
No. 30 defense that could be, if Saturday was any indication,
improving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The midseason addition of sage defensive specialist Bill
Arnsparger as an adviser appears to have helped embattled defensive
coordinator Mike Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tackling better,'' said defensive end Marco Coleman,
former Georgia Tech star. ``We have a lot more confidence in one
another.''

Cowboys great example of NFL parody
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ In a Cinderella season of fairy-tale turnabouts in
St. Louis and Indianapolis, the truth is no foot fits more
perfectly into the glass slipper than Dallas'.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's Year of Mediocrity deserves a mediocre champion, and
the Cowboys wear that label as easily as a custom-made hat. They
are a 10-gallon Stetson of average.
</P>
<P>
   Parity or poverty? What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   In commissioner Paul Tagliabue's 21st century, there are no
great teams anymore, only a great number of fair-to-middling ones,
of which Dallas might be the best of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   If they were a feature film, the Cowboys would be Ordinary
People. If they searched for their proper place to tie up their
horses, it would be the OK Corral.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a campaign that was about as easy to swallow
as last year's oatmeal, they were 7-1 at home and 1-7 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect balance. Perfect harmony. Perfectly passable.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Cowboys bring their even-steven act back to the
Metrodome today, which is fitting, because in their previous
appearance they won the first half and lost the second half, though
by a significantly wider margin.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL tries to pass off a season when a record nine teams
finish 8-8 as breathlessly exciting and evidence that everybody has
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But history says no team that has shamelessly crawled in through
a crack to the playoffs with an 8-8 record has lived to see another
day. The most recent to try were the 1991 New York Jets under head
coach Bruce Coslet and the 1990 New Orleans Saints led by
quarterback Steve Walsh. And neither of those heroes has a gaudy
Super Bowl ring or a special place in the Hall of Fame at Canton,
Ohio., which tells you all you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Fish out of water have a longer life expectancy than an 8-8 team
going on the road for the playoffs. And floundering is what the
Cowboys have done since their deceiving 3-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to do something that has never been
done before,'' says head coach Chan Gailey. ``We'll take them one
game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they'll just take one more game from the Vikings on the
chin and then continue their talk about how close they are.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind history, Chan. In order for the Cowboys to make this
the first miracle of the new millennium and gallop off all the way
to Atlanta, they will have to do something they haven't done since
September, which is win consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling from inside the organization has been that as long
as the Cowboys have Troy Aikman at quarterback and Emmitt Smith in
the backfield, they have the makings of a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a handful of Pro Bowlers on defense, who have for
the most part held up their side of the bargain, Aikman and Smith
have not been nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   There is some belief that it is Gailey's stultifyingly dull
offense _ even with the addition of Rocket Ismail _ that has kept
the Cowboys from reaching their potential and that debate likely
will rage through the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Club owner Jerry Jones doesn't help the cause by having a team
meeting with 20 veterans that does not include Gailey and by
publicly stating that aspects of the offense must change. Even if
that is true, it sends a message that the head coach is not the
authority who must be respected and adhered to, which is no way to
enter the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem is likely more basic _ the Cowboys no longer
have enough championship-caliber talent. Thus, for the long-term
good of the franchise, a final-weekend loss to the Giants, a 7-9
record and missing the playoffs might have provided a more sobering
taste of reality. Not to mention that at 7-9 the Cowboys would have
drafted from the 11th spot instead of 19th, which is a significant
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they beat the Giants _ or the Giants held the door
open _ and the Cowboys carry their upset hopes and a suspect
secondary into this game against a hot Minnesota quarterback in
Jeff George and a corps of wide receivers _ Randy Moss, Cris
Carter, et al. _ who should start the offseason angst churning in
Dallas soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   But before sweeping them under the rug, remember the kind of NFL
season it's been. Jacksonville and St. Louis earned first-round
byes without beating a single playoff team. Washington is the
champion of the NFC East, but Dallas beat the Redskins twice. What
is there to fear but fear itself?
</P>
<P>
   There is no quality, no greatness. Only mediocrity. And if these
Cowboys can be champions of anything, it is that.

Oklahoma State struggles to tame Texas Tech
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STILLWATER, Okla. _ Because of familiarity, better defense and
better competition, conference games are not supposed to be pretty.
But Saturday's Texas Tech-Oklahoma State contest Saturday was a
particularly unsightly affair.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined to hit only 36.7 percent of their shots
(40-of-109), including less than 25 percent from 3-point territory
(8-for-35).
</P>
<P>
   Tech's best player played the entire game and had more turnovers
than field goals, while Oklahoma State's top player logged 36
minutes and scored only one point for every 12 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, OSU's Desmond Mason got more help from teammates who,
despite his season-low three points and 1-for-9 day from the floor,
managed to claim a 55-47 win over Tech at Gallagher-Iba Arena in
the Big 12 Conference opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   OSU, which is ranked 16th in the country, improved to 12-1 on
the season while Tech dropped to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tech point guard Rayford Young struggled to find his touch for
much of the game, though he battled to score 13 points on 5-of-14
shooting (1-for-6 on 3-pointers). But an uncharacteristic six
turnovers for the senior was indicative of how much trouble Tech
had getting into the flow offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (a credit to) their defense,'' Tech coach James Dickey
said. ``They're very good defensively. They have great help,
they're strong and they talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little bit fatigued. We just don't have enough
players. We need more players.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech finished with 18 turnovers despite the relatively slow pace
of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of knew what they were gonna do and we took them out
of a lot of stuff that they were running offensively,'' said
Oklahoma State forward Brian Montonati, who had a game-high 14
rebounds, 10 on the defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Montonati also noted the Cowboys' inability to hit ``the broad
side of a barn'' on the offensive end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who entered the game averaging 19.8 per outing, and sixth
man Glendon Alexander, who was scoring 13.7 a game, combined to
score just six points on 2-for-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The only Oklahoma State players to shoot above 50 percent from
the floor were Alex Webber and Fredrik Jonzen, a pair of post
players who are seldom called upon to score in the Cowboys'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Webber actually thought he would be pulled from the lineup
because of lackluster play of late, but took advantage of one final
reprieve from the Cowboys' coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-10 senior, who had averaged just 4.6 points in the team's
last seven games, scored 11 points in just 11 minutes. Jonzen, who
has been playing more minutes than Webber recently, reached double
figures for the second consecutive game with 10 points and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tech hung tough and with any kind of hot spurt could have
possibly taken control.
</P>
<P>
   OSU took only a 22-18 lead into the half though the Red Raiders
were just 8-for-30 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ellis, who was held to half his average with nine points,
slammed home a follow dunk to pull Tech to within 24-22 less than
two minutes into the second half before OSU went on an 11-0 run to
open its biggest lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech refused to be blown out, canning enough big shots to stay
within reach of a late run. A 3-pointer from Mario Layne (11
points) and a conventional three-point play by Ellis with 5:46 left
closed the gap to 42-37.
</P>
<P>
   But Tech hit another cold spell, only getting a jump hook from
Ellis over the next three minutes, while OSU got a critical
3-pointer from Alexander, his only field goal of the game, and a
three-point play from Montonati to stretch the lead back to 11
points with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tech again was unwilling to give up, but the Red Raiders could
get no closer than six the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud, really proud of the way our guys competed, but
they didn't play well enough to beat a Top 15 team on their home
court or win a conference game on the road,'' Dickey said.

Oklahoma routs Texas A&AMP;M
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NORMAN, Okla. _ The first step of the Texas A&AMP;M tour through the
Top 25 teams in the Big 12 went according to form Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were smothered 78-53 by No. 20 Oklahoma (13-1) at
Lloyd Noble Center. The loss in the Big 12 Conference opener for
both teams wasn't what Texas A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins wanted, but
he admitted it wasn't altogether unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma is a very talented team, a Top 20 team,'' said
Watkins. ``We knew it would a big, big chore to come to their home
floor and get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead does not get any easier for the young Aggies, who
start three freshmen and bring two other first-year players off the
bench for significant minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, Texas A&AMP;M (4-8) plays No. 17 Texas on
Wednesday, gets a ``breather'' at Texas Tech Jan. 15 and then plays
No. 9 Kansas on Jan. 17 and No. 16 Oklahoma State on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks a lot to the Big 12 office for that schedule,'' said
Watkins. ``But you know what? Every team in the Big 12 is tough, so
you can't really complain about it. It's tough for a young team,
but we're going to work hard and try to keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have nowhere to go but up. They provided little in
the way of a challenge to the Sooners, who jumped ahead 7-0 and
didn't allow a point until the 15:24 mark of the first half.
Oklahoma was ahead 19-6 with 11:15 remaining after one of reserve
guard Kelley Newton's five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Bernard King, who led the Aggies with 18 points, hit
two 3-pointers to help close the margin to 22-18 with 8:35 left in
the half. It was easily as close as the Aggies would get the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, who was 5-of-6 on 3-pointers and led all scorers with 19
points, connected on two from behind the arc. Eduardo Najera, who
had 14 points, scored two quick inside baskets to key a 20-7 run
and put the Sooners ahead 42-25 with just under four minutes left
in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma hit 8-of-13 from 3-point range in the first half and
built a commanding 47-29 lead after 20 minutes. The second half was
a formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them close midway through the half, but we couldn't
finish,`` said Watkins. ``That's been a problem for us all year. We
play really well in spurts, but we have trouble playing for the
full 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, I think, is that their pressure just wore us
down. They were physical, and a lot of our kids haven't been
exposed to that. But as we get into the Big 12, we'll see it a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson was pleased with his team's
defense and rebounding. The Sooners forced 24 turnovers, held the
Aggies to 37 percent shooting and had a 36-29 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our traps were good, and we knew how to take the ball away
from them,`` said Sampson. ``Our game plan was to attack. When you
get to January, February and March, defense and rebounding can take
you a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't hurt that the Sooners' reserves outscored
the Aggies' bench 42-15. Or that Jameel Heywood came off the bench
to grab a game-high 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pressured us so much that we were forced into doing
things we don't usually do,'' said King. ``When they hit all those
3s, we didn't do a good job of staying with the (3-point) shooter.
We were jumping in to help, and all they did was keep throwing it
back to the shooter. They weren't missing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the second half, the Aggies were playing only to determine a
final score. Oklahoma ran off 16 straight points to take a 65-36
lead, and King sensed a feeling of frustration among the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we started to hang our heads a little,''
said King. ``We didn't play as hard as we did in the first half.
That's something we can't do. We realize we're a young team, but we
have to keep fighting. We can't give up when we get down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way around it, you have to play these teams,'' said
Watkins. ``What we have to do is learn from every game we play and
then use what we learn the next time out.''

NETS BEAT HEAT, 90-89  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With 5.1 seconds left and Saturday night's game against
the Miami Heat tied, the Nets had an 84 percent free-throw shooter
at the foul line for three attempts. Scott Burrell, fouled by
Alonzo Mourning while attempting a 3-pointer, looked calm, poised
and ready to give the Nets at least a 2-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Burrell, who had made 16 of 19 foul shots on the season,
missed the first and third of his attempts. He hit the second free
throw, however, and it was enough to lift the Nets to a 90-89
victory at the brand-new American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had a chance to win when Dan Majerle grabbed the rebound
after Burrell's final miss, but after a timeout, the Heat could not
manage anything. It got the ball to center Alonzo Mourning
underneath the basket, but he was stumbling backward and onto his
backside. By the time he caught the ball, he was on the floor and
unable to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, coming on the heels of consecutive losses to
Indiana and lowly Vancouver, lifted the Nets to 13-20 and dropped
Miami to 21-11. The Nets are now 3-11 on the road. And it was just
the fifth loss in 17 home games for the Heat, which played without
its injured point guard, Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury led the Nets with 20 points and 11 assists,
while Kendall Gill and Kerry Kittles added 16 points apiece.
Mourning led everyone with 23 points, and Majerle followed him for
the Heat with 20.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 74-65 at the start of the fourth quarter, the Nets were
outscored by 13-4 over the first half of the period, the Heat tying
the game on a driving layup by the rookie Anthony Carter with just
over five minutes remaining. Part of the Nets' problem was the
absence of Marbury, who left the game after being poked in the eye
at the 9-minute-18-second mark with the Nets ahead by 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   When Marbury returned four minutes later, the Nets were ahead by
only 2. Johnny Newman answered Carter's tying basket with a
3-pointer that made it 81-78, but Mourning followed with a
ferocious dunk. The Nets came right back and scored on a baseline
15-footer by Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   Miami pulled within 83-82 on a basket by Mourning, and Marbury
pushed the led back to 3 points with two free throws. But Majerle
tied the game with 2:22 left with a 3-pointer. Marbury and Jamal
Mashburn exchanged baskets, and then Keith Van Horn hit two free
throws to put the Nets ahead, 89-87, with 1:16 to play. But
Mashburn scored again, tying the game with a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets could not answer this time, but the Heat was unable to
score as well, and when Michael Cage grabbed a defensive rebound
with 20 seconds remaining the Nets had the last shot. Out of a
timeout, Newman inbounded the ball to Van Horn, who quickly got it
to Marbury. Marbury passed to Burrell, who out of desperation
attempted a 3-pointer. Using a head fake, he got Mourning in the
air and was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets pulled ahead with a torrid shooting display midway
through the third quarter. Hitting five 3-pointers _ two by Kittles
and one each by Kendall Gill, Johnny Newman and Scott Burrell _
they turned a 57-57 tie at the 6:10 mark into a 74-63 lead with
47.8 seconds left in the period. Miami scored the final basket of
the quarter to cut the lead to 9 points heading into the fourth,
but the Nets maintained the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Feick, who ranks fifth in the league with an average of
11.8 rebounds a game, played just 16 minutes and grabbed only 1
rebound against Vancouver while fighting an intestinal virus.
Saturday night, Coach Don Casey chose to rest Feick entirely in
hopes that he would be able to play in Monday's game at Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Though Feick does not start, Casey shifted his first five,
replacing Jim McIlvaine at center with the 37-year-old Michael
Cage. Casey felt that McIlvaine, who played with goggles for the
first time after being inadvertently poked in the eye by Kittles on
Friday, would get in quick foul trouble against Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Casey's intentions proved correct, as McIlvaine, substituting
for Cage at the 5:43 mark of the first quarter, picked up two fouls
in 1:21. That forced Casey to go to the rookie Evan Eschmeyer, who
surprisingly was more than serviceable.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not record many points and rebounds (2 points, 1
rebounds), the 6-foot-11-inch center from Northwestern put his
255-pound body on Mourning and battled. He was so effective that
Casey used him for 11 minutes in the second quarter.

CAVALIERS BEAT KNICKS, 89-86  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing's elasticity failed him as he tried to
play his second game in two nights for the first time this season.
He sat and watched his younger and quicker teammates bounce back
from deficit after deficit until their resilience began to sag.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks Saturday night had reached into their energy rations
to recover from a 17-point deficit in the second quarter at Madison
Square Garden and took their first lead in the game with just over
11 minutes left on a two-handed dunk by Latrell Sprewell. Then the
bottom fell out.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held a 7-point lead with 5 minutes 20 seconds left in
the game but missed eight of their last nine shots. Eventually, the
Cleveland Cavaliers made them pay when Bob Sura sprang free of
Sprewell and hit a 3-pointer with 10.8 seconds in the game to give
his team a 4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs came back with a 3-pointer with 6.3 seconds left,
but two free throws by Brevin Knight sealed the victory for the
Cavs, 89-86.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks (20-13) fell to 2-6 when playing back-to-back nights.
Led by Allan Houston's 23 points, they got a big lift from Marcus
Camby (13 points, 8 rebounds) but were unable to sustain their
energy at the end. From the beginning, Ewing was in trouble as he
turned the ball over five times in the first half and finished with
8 points in 23 minutes. The Cavs (14-19) were led by Sura's 25
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 45 percent from the field and had 20 turnovers.
The Cavs shot 41 percent and had 21 turnovers but outrebounded the
Knicks, 39-33. In the end, that extra edge gave the Cavs just what
they needed to counter the Knicks' bevy of comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their second game in less than 24 hours, the
Knicks plunged into the caffeine, rubbed the jelly out of their
legs and steeled themselves for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed set up to fail. After leaving an aggressive Magic
team behind at Orlando, they were faced with an equally energetic
Cavs team that arrived rested and ready. The disparity in their
energy was obvious. The Cavs turned the Knicks' league-best defense
to mush by building a 17-point advantage with 4:23 left in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had to either bounce back or give in to the fatigue.
With the help of the fresh-legged and seldom-used John Wallace,
they unearthed some intensity on defense and some crispness on
offense and recovered from their dreadful start by closing the
Cavs' lead to 44-40 at halftime. Although they turned the ball over
12 times, the Knicks were back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot out of the Knicks to make their comeback. The
Ewing-led group of starters looked spent as they came back for the
third quarter. Quickly, the Cavs preyed on the languid Ewing inside
and took a 65-53 lead. But once again, Coach Jeff Van Gundy turned
to his bench players and his every-day weapon, Houston. With
Wallace and Camby by his side, Houston, who scored 13 points in the
first half, went on a shooting spurt for 7 straight points near the
end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Torturing a frustrated Sura, Houston scored on three consecutive
jumpers to pull the Knicks back to within 65-61 with two minutes
left in the third. After two free throws by Charlie Ward, the
Knicks were down by just 65-63 with 1:31 left in the quarter. Once
again, the Knicks had scrambled to make up a double-digit deficit
and trailed after the third quarter, 67-65.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks were visibly weary. Although the entire team was
up for inspection, there was special curiosity whether Ewing,
playing two nights in a row for the first time since he returned to
the team a month ago, had any elasticity left in his game at age
37.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious, at this stage in his comeback, that Ewing
dragged through the first half in a fog. His recent bout of the flu
may have had something to do with it, but he groggily turned the
ball over four times in the first eight minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ewing was not the main problem. The Knicks' defense was
slow and uninspired as it allowed the Cavs to hit open jumpers from
3-point range, make uncontested layups and get easy points in
transition. With Sprewell in early foul trouble and the rest of the
Knicks out of the game mentally, the Cavs eased out to a 17-point
lead in the second quarter before the boos rang out from an
impatient crowd and jarred the team to its senses.

GIULIANI OFFERS A NEW CHOICE FOR SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The search for an interim New York City schools
chancellor took another abrupt turn Saturday, with Giuliani
administration officials introducing an 11th-hour candidate and
some Board of Education members wondering whether to withdraw their
support for a banking executive whose candidacy is strongly opposed
by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven board members were supporting that candidate,
Harold O. Levy, on Friday. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
apparently so unhappy with the choice that he persuaded Robert R.
Kiley, chief executive of the New York City Partnership and Chamber
of Commerce, to join the applicant pool at the last minute. The
board was planning to select an interim chancellor in a public vote
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's action astounded some board members, a board official
said Saturday, because mayoral allies on the board had eliminated
Kiley's name from the list of candidates earlier in the week. They
did so on the ground that Kiley, a former chairman of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was unacceptable to the
mayor, said the board official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the negotiations said Saturday that Giuliani
did not consider Kiley a strong ally, and that even Saturday
afternoon, mayoral aides were questioning his credentials for the
job of running the nation's largest school system. Giuliani's first
choice for interim chancellor was Joseph P. Viteritti, a research
professor at New York University who has been a policy adviser to
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Viteritti withdrew his candidacy Saturday, after it became
clear that he could not get more than three votes. A board official
said that Terri Thomson, the Queens County representative who often
serves as the swing vote, decided not to support Viteritti mainly
because he lacked managerial experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere has gotten so politically charged that it
doesn't look like a situation that I or anybody could walk into and
make work,'' Viteritti said.
</P>
<P>
   The board met briefly Saturday to discuss Kiley, Levy and a
third candidate, John Jay Iselin, the president of Cooper Union.
William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, emerged from the
meeting to announce that the board would interview Kiley Sunday
afternoon before voting for an interim chancellor at 4 p.m. The
other candidates were interviewed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the selection process was the fact that
both Kiley and Levy lack the formal credentials of school
administrators. To serve as interim chancellor, they would need a
waiver from Richard P. Mills, the commissioner of the State
Education Department. Thompson said Saturday that the board was
preparing to request a waiver if necessary, but that it would not
formally do so until after Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has a bachelor's degree and a law degree from Cornell
University. He is the director of global compliance at Citigroup,
as well as a member of the State Board of Regents. Ms. Thomson, the
Queens County representative on the board, also works at Citigroup,
and Friday she was enthusiastically supporting Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was appointed to the Board of Regents by the Democratic
majority in the state Assembly and several officials have said his
ties to the Democratic Party made his candidacy unacceptable to
Giuliani. Levy's friendship with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, was said to be troubling to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is presumably running for the Senate this year against
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and it would help him to have an interim
chancellor who agrees with his philosophies. The interim chancellor
is to serve until at least late spring, while the board searches
for a permanent replacement for Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomson was the board member who originally recommended
Kiley for the job, and Saturday, she said that she might end up
supporting him. She said that she would make up her mind after the
board interviewed Kiley on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are both well-qualified people who have stepped up to
the plate at great cost to themselves,'' Ms. Thomson said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley graduated magna cum laude from Notre Dame University with
a bachelor's degree. The chairman of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority from 1983 to 1990, Kiley has had a varied
career, serving as a deputy mayor in Boston, where he took
responsibility for the safety of school children during the 1974
desegregation crisis, and working from 1963 to 1970 at the Central
Intelligence Agency, where he served as an executive assistant to
Richard Helms, the director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley, 64, also headed the transportation system in Boston from
1975 to 1978, earning high marks for hiring professional managers,
curbing a runaway budget and conducting tough labor negotiations.
At the MTA, he oversaw a vast program to rebuild New York City's
subways, bus lines and commuter railroads. He left the
transportation agency to become president of the Fischbach Corp.,
an electrical engineering concern that did business with the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Kiley, who was born in Minneapolis, became chief
executive of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce,
an alliance of corporate executives, educational and civic leaders.
There, he has been a vocal supporter of ending school principals'
tenure, and in 1998 he borrowed an idea from the boardroom to help
the city's troubled school system, suggesting that the city offer
$30 million in incentives to fatten the salaries of
superintendents, principals and teachers if they could raise the
academic performance of students.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Kiley and Giuliani has had its rough
patches, with critical comments by Kiley angering the mayor. In
1996, the personality clash reportedly led to the exclusion of
Kiley from an informal mayoral advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Kiley publicly criticized the labor contracts
that Giuliani negotiated with city unions. He also raised the
possibility of letting the State Financial Control Board take
control of the city's finances to solve its fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's appointees to the board, Irene H. Impellizzeri and
Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra, were supporting Kiley Saturday, as was
Jerry Cammarata, the Staten Island representative. Sandra E.
Lerner, the Bronx representative, was supporting Levy. Thompson,
Ms. Thomson and Irving S. Hamer, the Manhattan representative, were
undecided, officials close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials theorized that Thompson would switch his support
to Kiley if Ms. Thomson and Hamer did the same, because he wants
the interim chancellor to have the support of most board members.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the board voted 4 to 3 against renewing Crew's
contract, and last week they terminated it after granting the
outgoing chancellor severance pay and other benefits. Ms. Thomson
cast the crucial vote against Crew, who lost the support of
Giuliani last spring after he refused to implement an experimental
voucher program. Many board members complained in recent months
that he had become ambivalent about the job.

TCU SQUANDERS LATE LEAD IN LOSS TO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Coming out of a timeout with 3:12 left and
TCU clinging to a 74-70 lead, Thomas McTyer turned to his teammates
and said: ``This is it right here.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Except Southwest Missouri State, not the Horned
Frogs, seized control.
</P>
<P>
   Bears guard Kevin Ault drained a 3-pointer after the timeout,
and Southwest Missouri would complete a 10-0 sprint to close out
the game and the Frogs, 75-74, yesterday afternoon before 8,266 at
the Hammons Student Center and ESPN's national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (9-8) sunk down the stretch, spoiling what would have
been their best effort and biggest victory of the season. The
mistakes, some forced but several not, were typical of a team
struggling to keep above water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 33 or so minutes we played pretty good,'' Frogs coach
Billy Tubbs said. ``I thought the difference was Southwest played
like they were ahead in the game, even though they were seven or
eight points down. We played like we behind. We took chances that
we didn't need to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as Derrick Davenport's charge with 4:40 left _ he fouled
out _ or Bingo Merriex's and McTyer's failure to call timeout in
the final seconds to set up one last chance to score.
</P>
<P>
   With 9.8 seconds remaining, Merriex bobbled and then grabbed
Ault's missed free throw and passed to McTyer. McTyer also bobbled
the ball, stopped at half court, and shuffled it back to Merriex,
who never gained control before time expired. TCU still had three
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made plays that were not very smart down the stretch,''
Tubbs said. ``We just didn't do things you've got to do to put
people away. They hit some shots and got some offensive rebounds
that really hurt us. At least you should get off a shot with nine
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs talked about calling timeout on the sidelines before
Ault's free throw, which were set up by a Bears offensive rebound.
``A really smart team, which I can't accuse us of, I think takes
its chances on a timeout,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to at least get a shot up,'' said McTyer, who played
all 40 minutes and scored 12 points in his third consecutive start.
``I don't know. I thought Bingo was open. I don't know if he didn't
catch the ball or someone got a hand on it, but we just gave that
one up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Carroll made his first start since Southwest Missouri beat
TCU, 69-60, in Fort Worth on Dec. 11. He scored a team-high 19
points, including five 3-pointers, in 38 minutes. Carroll said the
Frogs played their ``best basketball,'' but had ``a mental
breakdown'' when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we knew we were going to win,'' said Carroll,
who had missed four games due to injury or illness since Dec. 11
and played an average of 21 minutes in the other three. ``I think
we were happy that we were winning, but they had more confidence in
the later stages of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU led 45-42 at the half on the strength of heady play and good
shot selection. McTyer kept the Frogs under control, and Carroll,
McTyer and Estell Laster (14 points) each hit timely 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears (10-4) started the second half strong, with Ault
hitting a couple of 3-pointers as Southwest Missouri moved out to a
58-54 advantage. The Frogs answered the run, outscoring the home
team 18-5 to pull ahead 72-63 with seven minutes left. It wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a big step, but we need to learn to finish games
off,'' he said. ``We have to learn to play smart the whole game.''

RANGERS BEAT LEAFS, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Petr Nedved, whose name has been mentioned in trade
talks for Carolina's unsigned center Keith Primeau for months, put
on a show Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved tallied his third career hat trick to lead the Rangers to
a 5-3 victory over Toronto, their second consecutive victory over
the high-powered Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved completed his feat at 12 minutes 58 seconds of the third
period when he wristed a picture-perfect shot from the top of the
right-wing circle. Nedved's 11th goal of the season _ his fourth in
the last two games _ sailed past defenseman Tomas Kaberle and over
former Ranger Glenn Healy's right shoulder and into the goal. The
shot broke a 3-3 tie against a team that had been 18-4-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean's tap in off the right wing post on a 2-on-1 break
with Valery Kamensky sealed the come-from-behind victory for Mike
Richter (31 saves).
</P>
<P>
   This was the Nedved the Rangers had been waiting for all season.
Nedved's goal Wednesday in New York in the Rangers' 3-2 overtime
victory over the Leafs was his first since Nov. 24 and had snapped
a 12-game drought for the much-maligned 29-year-old center. Nedved
scored in each of the first two periods Saturday night, both times
erasing one-goal Toronto leads.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved seems revitalized since Wednesday when Coach John Muckler
established the Czech Connection _ Nedved centering Jan Hlavac and
Radek Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
   Kris King gave Toronto a 1-0 lead 5:15 into the contest off a
drop pass from Garry Valk when both Rangers defensemen _ Rich Pilon
and Kevin Hatcher _ went for Valk in the middle of the slot. King
and Kevyn Adams both went for the puck above the left-wing circle
and crisscrossed after King took possession of the puck. King beat
Richter stick-side wide for his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved tied the score at 10:29 with a wicked wrister. He snapped
it from the top of the right circle through defenseman Tomas
Kaberle's legs to beat former Rangers goaltender Glenn Healy
stick-side wide. And the score was 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern would repeat itself in each of the next two periods.
Toronto grabbed a 2-1 lead at 6:36 of the second when Mats Sundin
worked a nifty give-and-go with Steve Thomas through the right
circle on the power play. Sundin then beat Richter with a one-timer
from the edge of the circle, blasting it over Richter's left
shoulder for his 18th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved tied things up again at 12:17 with a power-play goal of
his own on a deflection of a Kevin Hatcher shot from the top of the
circles for his 10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Just 3:01 into the third, the Leafs again took a one-goal lead.
Sergei Berezin fought off Mike York just off the right wing post
and beat Richter after Mike Johnson had skated around the back of
the net and found Berezin with a pass through the slot. Berezin's
17th goal of the season gave Toronto a 3-2 lead. But it did not
even survive a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves squared the score a third time at 3:34 with his 14th
goal of the season. Graves tapped in the rebound of a York shot,
after Theo Fleury had pounced on a turnover at the blue line in the
Rangers' offensive zone before finding York in the right circle
with a pretty pass. And so the teams were tied at 3-3.

UCLA BEATS WASHINGTON STATE

<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ The wind blew hard outside Washington State's
Friel Court on Saturday afternoon. There were patches of snow, and
the clouds hung low. It was miserable, with intermittent
dreariness.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, UCLA and Washington State battled for last place in
chilly silence. The announced crowd was 3,189, but the Cougars must
have been counting teeth. It felt like 50. It felt, appropriately
enough, like a game at Palouse High.
</P>
<P>
   Although UCLA played a centimeter better than it did Thursday at
Washington, the Cougars resembled a high school team. They stumbled
and bumbled and let the Bruins do whatever they pleased in an 86-64
victory that meant ... almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bruins dodged the Pacific-10 cellar and avoided a
sweep by the league's worst teams. They also moved one win closer
to an NCAA Tournament berth: nine down, nine to go. But in terms of
substantive evaluation, in terms of measuring progress, the game
failed to register.
</P>
<P>
   Not even UCLA coach Steve Lavin, the uber-spinner, could turn
this 22-point victory into value. After all, USC beat the Cougars
by the same margin Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get a barometer as far as what this means,''
Lavin said. ``It's not something we should overreact to. It's not
like a win over North Carolina or USC or Arizona or Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   File this under Morgan State, Iona and Fairfield and lock the
cabinet. The Bruins (9-3, 1-1) won't have another game this easy
until the Cougars visit Pauley Pavilion in March.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (5-6, 0-2) has two Pac-10-caliber players,
guard Jan-Michael Thomas and forward Chris Crosby, and both are
3-point specialists. Once the Bruins extended their defense to 20
feet, the Cougars wilted. They made seven 3-pointers in the first
half, one in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouting report said Thomas and Crosby are good spot-up
shooters, and we come out and the first five minutes they're
hitting 3-pointers,'' UCLA forward Jason Kapono said, a bit
mystified. ``Then we changed our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars' frontline is the worst in the league. Their tallest
player is the 6-8 Crosby, a guard in a forward's body. They're so
ravaged by injury and ineptitude they turned to Paul Mencke, the
second-string quarterback who played his second basketball game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-5, Mencke had no chance against Bruins center Dan Gadzuric,
who tied his career-high with 16 points and fueled UCLA's
game-breaking 19-6 surge late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to post-up hard and be patient,'' Gadzuric said.
``I think I played a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington State's shoddy defense enabled the go-go Bruins to
find their rhythm and break the 70-point barrier for the first time
in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Five miles from Idaho, UCLA found a slice of Westwood: a pick-up
game delivered straight from the Men's Gym.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono led the Bruins with 20 points, six assists and no
turnovers _ more evidence he has become UCLA's best player just 12
games into his college career.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Rico Hines scored a career-high 12 points. Guard Billy
Knight, who decided to transfer, then changed his mind, made 4 of 7
3-pointers and scored 14 points. The Bruins had 22 assists, shot 50
percent from 3-point range and unleashed their pressure defense for
the first time in weeks. It discombobulated the Cougars (18
turnovers) and turned up the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Give USC coach Henry Bibby an assist on that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the (Washington State) game, (the Trojans) trapped them,''
Lavin said. ``We're not going to change what we do, but that was
effective. I don't think we're a great pressing team, but in spots
we can be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 26-22 with 7:41 left in the first half, UCLA took
command. Its press forced three Cougars turnovers, and each time
the Bruins converted the mistakes into baskets. Knight scored from
the right baseline, then Gadzuric fed Kapono for a chippie, then
Gadzuric dunked.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 3-pointer cut UCLA's lead to 11, but Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso countered with back-to-back jumpers, then Knight's 3-pointer
pushed the Bruins' advantage to 17.
</P>
<P>
   Game. Set. USC on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the loss (at Washington), we weren't playing good
basketball, we weren't playing as a team, and we weren't playing
play,'' Kapono said. ``Those are three things that will keep you
from winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not playing as a team and you're not playing hard,
you might as well play tennis or golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Washington State.

BLAKE EARNS ALL-STAR NOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake has been to All-Star Games. He has
played in the Stanley Cup Finals and been named the NHL's best
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Feb. 6 All-Star Game in Toronto will rank up there with
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, the Los Angeles Kings captain, learned Saturday he has
been voted into the starting lineup for the North American squad in
the 50th anniversary of the All-Star Game, which will be played in
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is what will make it so special,'' Blake said
Saturday. ``Getting picked by the fans means so much to me, but
playing in the place where I grew up, that's incredible. There will
be so many people there who have had an impact on my life and
career. I don't know if a player could ask for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's selection was announced on ABC during halftime of the
NFL playoff game between Buffalo and Tennessee. He was watching the
game from his home in Manhattan Beach, where he has lived most of
his 10 years with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, 30, will be joining Paul Kariya of the Mighty Ducks as a
starter on the North American team, which will be facing a team
comprised of players from Europe that includes the Ducks' Teemu
Selanne (Finland).
</P>
<P>
   This is Blake's third All-Star Game, although he did not play in
1997 because of injuries. He is the first Kings player to be named
a starter since Wayne Gretzky in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said the Kings' success this season contributed to his
selection. They are 18-15-7 and ranked seventh in the Western
Conference. Before this year, the Kings missed the playoffs five of
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we went through that rough spot last month, it is
clear this is our best team in quite a while,'' he said. ``It has
opened some eyes around the league and that is very gratifying. It
is good to see people recognize who the Los Angeles Kings are.''
</P>
<P>
   More fun: Blake will be participating in the hardest-shot
segment of the Kings Skills Competition this morning at 11 at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Other events include fastest skater, most accurate shot and
stick handling.
</P>
<P>
   The finals will be held the day before the All-Star Game and
proceeds benefit the players' pension fund. Only season-ticket
holders are invited and 8,000 to 10,000 spectators are expected.
</P>
<P>
   But not all players enjoy the competition, especially after
Florida goaltender Trevor Kidd broke his collarbone trying to stop
a shot during the Panthers' showcase last month. Kidd is expected
to miss 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no, I don't like it,'' Kings goaltender Stephane Fiset
said. ``Anything can happen in a situation like that. The most
important thing you have to do is warm up properly and treat it
like it is a regular practice. A lot of players don't do that and
that is why the injuries happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the same thing would have happened to Kidd if it had
been a regular practice. But it always makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel, two of the league's better stick
handlers, will not participate because of injuries. Blake has one
of the league's hardest shots, but he will be joined by newcomer
Jere Karalahti, who has played well the past few games after a slow
start.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Mattias Norstrom is considered the Kings' fastest
skater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little time to show off,'' Norstrom said. ``But
there aren't many players who think it is fun. There just seems to
be a greater chance to get hurt. There isn't contact like practice,
but there are a lot of quick starts and stops. Before you start you
have to ride the bike to get warmed up and do a lot of
stretching.''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

DEVILS BEAT COYOTES, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Claude Lemieux's return to the Devils
this season surprised many of their fans and delighted quite a few,
too. Lemieux left after the Stanley Cup championship of 1995 after
a contract squabble that he initiated and lost. But Lou Lamoriello,
the general manager, brought him back in a trade with Colorado
because the talented Devils lacked a certain straw to stir their
drink in recent seasons. Lamoriello might not have forgotten
Lemieux's transgression, but he forgave it, with the urging of the
owner John McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' enlightened management brought them more positive
returns Saturday night when Lemieux scored twice to pace the Devils
to a 4-3 victory over a good Phoenix Coyotes team. Lemieux beat
goalie Sean Burke for the game-winner on a slap shot at 14 minutes
16 seconds of the third period, just as a Phoenix penalty was
ending. The victory put the Devils atop the Eastern Conference
standing, extended their winning streak to four games, extended
their unbeaten streak to eight games (6-0-2) and extended their
winning streak at home to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez and Patrik Elias also scored for the Devils, who put
42 shots on goal. Martin Brodeur, the Devils goalie, faced only 16
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Out of uniform for the Devils for the first time this season was
defenseman Scott Stevens, their veteran captain. The Devils
announced that Stevens was ill and did not come to the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix scored on its first two shots against Brodeur, who was
starting his 11th consecutive game and his 20th in the last 21. In
between those goals, the Devils got one from Gomez. After one
period, the Devils had a 17-2 edge in shots on goal but the Coyotes
had a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal was scored by Shane Doan at 2:34. He beat Brodeur
high on the glove side after taking a pass in the slot from Trevor
Letowski after a Lemieux turnover near the blue line. Gomez, a
candidate for the Calder trophy as the rookie of the year and for
next month's All-Star Game, made the score 1-1 at 5:02 with a nifty
move out of the right-wing corner, skating past Rick Tocchet,
cutting behind a wall of teammates and firing a low wrist shot from
close range to beat Phoenix goalie Sean Burke. It was the 11th goal
of the season for Gomez, who came into the game with 38 points, the
most on the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Jyrki Lumme of Phoenix made the score 2-1 at 6:10 by taking
Dallas Drake's rebound off the end boards and putting the puck past
the lunging Brodeur, who was trying to get back into position.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Devils got the first nine shots on
goal and took a 3-2 lead. Phoenix did not manage its third shot of
the game until nine minutes had been played in the period. By that
time, Elias and Lemieux had scored for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, who has been on fire lately, scored at 5:28 to tie the
score at 2-2. Lemieux set him up by skating netward along the right
side and drawing the goalie and the defenders toward him before
sliding the puck from right to left to his open teammate. Elias had
come into the game with six goals in his previous six games and 12
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils went up by 3-2 at 5:54 on Lemieux's 14th of the
season, set up by Gomez. After Brendan Morrison forced a turnover
high in the Phoenix zone, he passed down to Gomez, who usually
knows where to send it. Despite the disparity in shots, the Coyotes
almost tied the score when, with 4:40 left in the second during a
power play, Jeremy Roenick shot from short range while alone at the
side of the crease. But Brodeur moved his right leg into the path
of the shot and Roenick failed to lift the puck over it. &QL;

Titans' Immaculate Deception stuns Bills
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ If you are a fan of the Tennessee Titans and you
live to be 100, you will never forget what happened at Adelphia
Coliseum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary AFC wild-card game with a finish so
improbable that some are calling it the Immaculate Deception, the
Titans shocked the Buffalo Bills 22-16 to advance into the second
round of the playoffs at Jacksonville or Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In their first playoff appearance since 1993 when they were
still the Houston Oilers, the Titans staged a fabulous finish that
will become part of NFL legend.
</P>
<P>
   After Al Del Greco kicked a 36-yard field goal to give the
Titans a 15-13 lead with 1:48 remaining, the Bills responded with
Steve Christie's 41-yarder with 16 seconds left that gave them a
16-15 advantage and what should have been an upset victory before a
franchise-record crowd of 66,728.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Titans were on the right side of
history. A kickoff return play, named ``home run throwback,'' was
called for the first time. Lorenzo Neal caught Christie's high,
short kick and handed the ball to Frank Wycheck. After running a
few steps to his right, Wycheck threw back across the field to
receiver Kevin Dyson, who ran down the sideline untouched for a
75-yard touchdown with three seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The replay official in the press box called for a review of the
play, which was close to being a forward lateral. But referee Phil
Luckett reviewed the play and allowed the touchdown to stand, and
pandemonium erupted at Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 16 seconds left, I was ready to commit suicide,'' Titans
general manager Floyd Reese said. ``I just couldn't decide if I was
going to do it with a bullet, pills or a rope. The next thing I
knew, I was dancing on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Bills were livid that Luckett refused to overturn
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who watched this game will clearly understand that we
didn't get a fair shake,'' Buffalo linebacker Sam Rogers said. ``In
a game of this magnitude when lives are on the line, you can't make
a call like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning their first playoff game since 1991, the Titans
avenged the most infamous defeat in franchise history _ the 41-38
overtime loss at Buffalo on Jan. 3, 1993, when they blew a 35-3
lead, still the biggest in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was poetic justice, vindication for seven years of living
with that stigma,'' said cornerback Steve Jackson, a nine-year
veteran. ``Revenge has been a long time coming, not just for the
guys left on this team but for our former teammates like Cris
(Dishman), Sean (Jones), Warren (Moon), (William) Fuller and
Darryll (Lewis).
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning this game the way we did makes it even sweeter.
Shakespeare couldn't have written a better ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, free safety Marcus Robertson, guard Bruce Matthews,
kicker Al Del Greco, linebacker Eddie Robinson and linebacker Joe
Bowden are the only Titans players who contributed to blowing a
32-point third-quarter lead to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking me if this soothes the pain of losing that
game,'' Matthews said. ``Yes, it does. Right now, I can almost feel
the same kind of elation the Bills felt when they beat us. I've
never been part of anything like this. It's truly amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who was injured in a motorcycle accident two weeks
ago and needed 150 stitches in his face, played for the first time
since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is redemption for us,'' Robertson said. ``That game has
haunted us for seven years. Maybe we exorcised those ghosts today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buffalo game in 1993 was their springboard to the Super
Bowl. Maybe this one will be our springboard to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans will have to play a lot better on offense if they
hope to reach the AFC Championship Game. They used a conservative
game plan and finished with only 194 yards against the NFL's No. 1
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George rushed for 106 yards on 29 carries. Quarterback
Steve McNair completed 13 of 24 passes for 76 yards. Unlike the
last two games in which he was allowed to roll out and throw on the
run, McNair stayed in the pocket most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills had only 219 yards, including 123 rushing. Quarterback
Rob Johnson, who was elevated to the starting job over Doug Flutie
last week, was 10-of-22 for 131 yards and no touchdowns. He wasn't
intercepted, but he was sacked six times, twice by defensive end
Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular game, from my standpoint, is so big for those
guys who went through everything _ not only that loss at Buffalo
but for all the difficult times they endured in 1995 and 1996 and
the last two years,'' coach Jeff Fisher said. ``We played with
poise, and to be able to win in our first playoff game at home
really makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans led 12-0 at halftime when Kearse sacked Johnson for a
safety, McNair scored on a one-yard run and Del Greco kicked a
40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills rallied in the second half on Antowain Smith's
touchdown runs of four and one yards, giving Buffalo a 13-12 lead
with 11:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans regained the lead on Del Greco's 36-yard field
goal with 1:48 remaining, it appeared as if they would finally end
the Buffalo jinx.
</P>
<P>
   After Kevin Williams returned the kickoff 33 yards to the
Buffalo 39, the old Oilers reared their ugly heads. Johnson, who
was named the starter over Doug Flutie last week, moved the Bills
to the Tennessee 23. Christie, who won that overtime game in 1993
with a field goal, appeared to eliminate them again, but Buffalo's
celebration was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Oilers in 1993, the Bills found out that games like
this can be all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe how bad I feel,'' Bills defensive end
Marcellus Wiley said. ``It's like they pulled out a gun and shot
down our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as safety Henry Jones said, ``This hurts more than the three
Super Bowls I was involved in.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE THINGS WE DO TO MAKE IT HOME &LR;  By Beverly Gologorsky.
Ballantine, $12. This generous first novel explores the aftershocks
of the Vietnam War on half a dozen women and their husbands and
lovers who returned from the war scarred and tormented, unable to
blend back into normal civilian life. The dialogue is ``lean and
supple, completely persuasive, full of nuanced turns,'' Jacqueline
Carey wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUR KIND OF PEOPLE: Inside America's Black Upper Class &LR;  By
Lawrence Otis Graham. HarperPerennial, $14. The author explores
that little-known segment of black society that has experienced
generations of material well-being and produced many extraordinary
traditions and personalities. The result is ``a fascinating ...
amalgam of popular history, sociological treatise and memoir,''
Andrea Lee wrote last year. ``He has made a major contribution both
to African-American studies and to the larger American picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; AMERICAN BEACH: How `Progress'
Robbed a Black Town _ and Nation _ of History, Wealth, and Power &LR; ,
by Russ Rymer ($14), an inquiry into race and politics, cultural
erosion, development and powerlessness in a black resort community
in Florida. ``Rymer is a seasoned journalist, precise, attentive,
thought-provoking,'' Eddy L. Harris wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MUSIC LESSON &LR;  By Katharine Weber. Picador USA, $12. A New
York art historian is recruited by an Irish cousin to take part in
an IRA plot to steal a Vermeer painting owned by Queen Elizabeth II
and hold it for ransom. Last year in The New York Times Book
Review, Sylvia Brownrigg called this an ``affecting and elegant ...
novel about the dangerous subterfuges of politics and the healing
truths of art.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOCOLAT &LR;  By Joanne Harris. Penguin, $12.95. When a beguiling
stranger opens a candy shop in a small French town and announces
plans for a chocolate festival that coincides with Easter, the
parish priest is driven to sabotage by what he sees as an assault
on the church's teachings. Last year the reviewer Nancy Willard
called this an ``accomplished novel'' that ``few readers will be
able to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COUSINS' WARS: Religion, Politics, and the Triumph of
Anglo-America &LR;  By Kevin Phillips. Basic Books, $16.50. In this
audacious demographic inquiry into the causes and effects of the
English Civil War, the American Revolution and the American Civil
War, Cavalier aristocrats keep losing out to republican Roundheads.
``Phillips' details are as marvelous as they are copious,'' Richard
Brookhiser wrote last year. ``He has given us a juicy, provocative
account of where we have come from.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; 1898: The Birth of the American Century &LR; , by David Traxel
(Vintage, $15), a historian argues that the year of the
Spanish-American War was a watershed in time that thrust the United
States into world-power status. In 1998 the reviewer Stanley
Weintraub found this to be an uneven popular history that
nevertheless contains ``a fund of good stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECRETS &LR;  By Nuruddin Farah. Penguin, $12.95. All the characters
in this Somali novel, which takes place on the eve of the nation's
brutal civil war in the early 1990s, are transformed by magical
intervention and walk the line between the human and animal worlds.
In 1998 the reviewer George Packer admired ``the daring, lush,
urbane voice of the author.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ART OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS &LR;  By Helen Vendler.
Belknap/Harvard University, $18.95. An impassioned critic dissects
Shakespeare's 154 sonnets and makes a persuasive case that they
``remain intelligible, moving and beautiful'' to contemporary
readers. ``Hers is the most intricately inquiring and ingeniously
responding study of these poems yet to be undertaken,'' Richard
Howard wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WIDOW KILLER &LR;  By Pavel Kohout. Picador USA, $14. Set in
Prague near the end of World War II, this novel is about a Czech
detective and a Gestapo agent pursuing a serial killer who sees
himself as the avenger of an occupied nation. What begins as ``a
taut and suspenseful thriller ... turns into a powerful and
gripping allegory,'' Richard Bernstein wrote in The New York Times
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRINGING THE HEAT &LR;  By Mark Bowden. Atlantic Monthly, $15. A
reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer explores the professional
football industry through the lens of the Eagles' 1992 season.
``His book overflows with stories of pro football dreams,'' Keith
Dixon wrote in 1994. ``Yet it also unflinchingly tells of the
darker side of life in the National Football League: uncontrollable
egos, ruined families, marital infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STILLEST DAY &LR;  By Josephine Hart. Overlook, $13.95. A
novelist obsessed with obsession spins a turn-of-the-century tale
about an English art teacher who becomes increasingly preoccupied
with her new neighbor. ``In mood, Hart is something of a
present-day Daphne du Maurier: She writes ominously, creating an
atmosphere laden with mystery,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote in 1998.
