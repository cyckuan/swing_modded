MARBURY AND THE NETS FALL SHORT AT THE BUZZER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIOB _ The defending National Basketball Association
champions got a taste of what the New Jersey Nets look like when
Stephon Marbury and Keith Van Horn are at the height of their games
offensively, and the experience was nearly too much for the San
Antonio Spurs to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, continuing his assault on the league's point guards,
scored a game-high 34 points on 9-of-14 shooting, and Van Horn
scored 23 points in just 24 minutes of play. But the Spurs, behind
David Robinson's 25 points and Tim Duncan's 17, were able to escape
the Alamodome with a thrilling 106-104 victory on Monday night when
a 30-foot 3-point attempt by Marbury fell short at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and Marbury put the Nets in position to win with
outstanding fourth-quarter play. Van Horn, whose minutes were
limited by foul trouble, scored 9 points and made a steal in a 15-9
run that pulled the Nets within 2, at 102-100, with three minutes
to play. A free throw by Robinson and a 3-pointer by Jaren Jackson
made the score 106-100 and seemed to close the door on the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But Marbury, who scored more than 30 points for the fifth time
in his last nine games, hit a driving layup, and then Van Horn
followed with a steal and basket with 37 seconds remaining. Twenty
seconds later, Jamie Feick, who led the Nets in rebounding with 11,
made a steal and set up Marbury's final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The game was reminiscent of the Nets' 96-94 loss to San Antonio
at the Meadowlands in November, when Duncan blocked a last-second
layup attempt by Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Nets to 2-3 on this road trip and to 24-36
heading into Wednesday's home game against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets trailed by just 3 points at the start of the final
period. But a little-known second-year guard out of Eastern
Michigan, Derrick Dial, put them in a hole that was hard to climb
out of. In his first NBA game _ he was on the injured list all of
last season and most of this season with a lower back strain _ Dial
scored 7 straight points early in the fourth period to increase the
Spurs' advantage to 93-85 with eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets caught the Spurs at the right time. San Antonio (38-22)
had lost three of its last four home games, including the last two.
And Duncan, who missed four games with a lower abdominal strain,
was a bit rusty in his second game back.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Robinson finished with 13 rebounds each as the Spurs
outrebounded the Nets, 52-31.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio took a 28-27 lead after one quarter behind the
surprising scoring of Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who entered the game with an 11.4-point average, scored
10 and gave out 3 assists in the first 12 minutes. Marbury answered
with 9 points and 3 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury went to the bench with the Nets ahead, 30-29, early in
the second period. His backup, Elliot Perry, scored 6 points, made
3 steals and dished out 2 assists as the Nets increased their lead
to 7 points twice.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, an eighth-year veteran, was so hot that with 4 minutes 31
seconds left, Marbury began heading for the scorer's table only to
reverse his direction when Perry buried a 21-foot shot in front of
the Nets' bench. As the shot fell through, Marbury smiled and told
Coach Don Casey to leave Perry in the game. Perry's jumper put the
Nets up by 47-42.

COWBOYS MAKE OFFER TO QB MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys made a contract offer yesterday to
quarterback Scott Mitchell, and owner Jerry Jones said he expects a
decision today on whether Mitchell would rather play behind Troy
Aikman or Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would not divulge the Cowboys' offer, but said Mitchell's
decision will not be based solely on money because ``the
circumstances are different in Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell reportedly has an $800,000 offer from the Bengals to
back up Smith, a second-year player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is reviewing everything,'' Jones said. ``He wants to know
how playing in Dallas behind Aikman or playing in Cincinnati would
impact his career. Obviously, he wouldn't get as much chance to
play here. He also has to decide where he thinks he has the best
chance to win. He's looking at it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor for Mitchell is the chance to work again with
Cowboys offensive coordinator Jack Reilly, who coached Mitchell in
college at Utah. Their relationship is the reason Mitchell worked
out for the Cowboys after he was reportedly close to an agreement
with the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good workout and good meetings with everybody,''
Reilly said. ``He's going to go back home, think about it and see
where he is with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 32, spent the first nine seasons of his career with
the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions before joining the Baltimore
Ravens last year, when he came in as the starter before being
benched after two games.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has 66 starts and 14,688 passing yards, 92 touchdowns
and 70 interceptions over the past decade. However, he has been
plagued by inconsistency and weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe the 6-foot-6, 245-pound Mitchell has the
size and strength to be a capable replacement for the departed
Jason Garrett (New York Giants) as Aikman's backup. They are also
encouraged by Mitchell's commitment to a conditioning program.
Cowboys head coach Dave Campo said Mitchell has lost a lot of
weight and looked sharp yesterday.
Wilson hired as QB coach
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones has said all along that he wanted a former Troy
Aikman backup to join the team as quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett spurned Jones' offer to join the coaching staff
and signed with the Giants because he wanted to continue playing.
So the Cowboys hired Wade Wilson, the guy Garrett replaced as
Aikman's backup in 1998. Wilson, 41, recently retired as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lengthy career will serve him well,'' Jones said. ``He is
an outstanding people person, has great respect from his teammates
and a great relationship with Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson played for five teams in 19 seasons, including the past
two with the Oakland Raiders. He was with the Cowboys from 1995-97.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed fourth-year tight end Brian Roche to a
contract yesterday. Roche did not play last season after playing
with the Chiefs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to work out four quarterbacks and two receivers
today. Three of the quarterbacks _ Charles Puleri, Todd Hammel and
Arron Garcia _ are Arena League veterans hoping to become the next
Kurt Warner. The other is CFL veteran Cody Ledbetter. The two
receivers scheduled to work out are Anthony Rodgers and Connie
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, who spent
the past three years running the New England Patriots' offense,
said he expects to join the Cowboys soon as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' off-season program officially began yesterday. A
number of players, including Troy Aikman, guard Larry Allen, safety
Darren Woodson and defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman, dropped by the
team's headquarters to meet with strength and conditioning coach
Joe Juraszek.

VERNON WELL'S ADVANCEMENT HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT SLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ A simple bit of subtraction is all it takes to
know how far Vernon Wells has come in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in spring training he wore an football offensive
lineman's number, No. 62. This year, he's reduced it by 52, wearing
No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   A little knowledge of baseball etiquette is helpful to
understand the significance.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, only longshots and no-hopers ticketed for
the minors or the waiver wire get the lineman and receiver numbers.
The players on the team, or the ones with a chance to make the
team, get the baseball-player numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 62 meant that Wells, although he was a top prospect, was
just biding his time before a minor-league assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 10 means that Wells, who was patrolling the outfield for
Arlington Bowie High School only three years ago, has a chance to
break camp as the Toronto Blue Jays' starting center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the job's wide open, and I haven't heard anything
to discourage me from that,'' Wells said. ``That's all you can hope
for, is to get a chance to break with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory that because of his youth and inexperience,
the 21-year-old Wells might be better off beginning the year in the
minors. Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi doesn't necessarily subscribe
to that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working on my fourth year in the big leagues at 21,''
Fregosi said. ``Good athletes have a way of adjusting to things.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that Wells is a good athlete. He was an
All-America baseball player at Bowie and an all-state football
player as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic ability and skill prompted the Blue Jays to take
him with the fifth overall pick in the 1997 amateur draft. He
quickly signed and reported to St. Catherines, a rookie-league
team, where he hit .307 with 10 homers and 31 runs batted in in 66
games.
</P>
<P>
   Wells spent all of the 1998 season at Class-A Hagerstown, where
he hit .285 with 11 homers and 65 RBI in 134 games.
</P>
<P>
   The high draft position and the skills established Wells as the
Blue Jays' top prospect, and they invited him to spring training as
a nonroster player last year to give him a taste of life at the
top. Wells got to hang around with big-leaguers, but he wasn't yet
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two at-bats, or something like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the season at Dunedin of the Class-A Florida State
League, as the Blue Jays were prepared to have him climb the ladder
to the majors one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Wells did it according to plan. He just drastically accelerated
the process.
</P>
<P>
   He tore up the FSL, batting .343 with 11 homers and 43 RBI in 70
games, and was promoted to Double-A Knoxville He had an even
shorter stint there, earning a promotion to Triple-A Syracuse after
hitting .340 in 26 games. Wells again excelled, batting .310 with
four homers and 21 RBI, stealing five bases in six attempts and
scoring 20 runs in 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wells completed his unlikely journey in late August, when he was
promoted to the majors three months before his 21st birthday. It
wasn't a matter of getting the kid a taste of the big leagues. The
Blue Jays were in the wild-card race, but the club thought his bat,
defense, speed and poise could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an organizational decision,'' Fregosi said.
``Everybody was involved, all the scouts, and the field
personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells became the starting center fielder, and held his own with
a .261 average in 88 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struggled a little bit at the beginning, but he adjusted,''
Fregosi said.
</P>
<P>
   The long trip from Class A to the majors in such a short time
was one Wells didn't even dare dream about when the season started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' he said. ``I just hoped I'd end up in Double A. Then
I got to Double A, and I figured I'd be there for the whole year.
Then I got called up to Triple A. And so on and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The meteoric rise to the majors makes this year's spring
training a lot different than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to this one,'' Wells said. ``I had fun
last year and had a chance to see big-league games and see what
it's all about. Now it's an opportunity to hopefully be on a
contending team and have some fun at the big-league level.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells is competing with Jose Cruz Jr. To break camp with the
big-league team, he'll have to clearly win the job. The
organization would rather see him develop by playing full time in
the minors than playing sporadically in the majors as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in here competing for a job,'' Fregosi said. ``The only
difference is, if he makes the major-league club, he'll be the
everyday center fielder. Otherwise, he will play every day in
Syracuse. He's got a wealth of talent, he's got a lot of ability,
he's a great kid, he's got a lot of things going for him. But we
would never do anything to deter his career. We'll try to do what's
best for the young man.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting a taste of the majors, Wells doesn't want to
return to the minors. But he sees the benefit of playing all the
time at Triple-A rather than sitting the bench in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather it not happen, but if it does I'm not going to get
discouraged about it,'' Wells said. ``I'd still be a lot further
ahead than where I thought I'd be at this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 10 on his back tells just how far he's come.

GAVEY KEEPS BRIGHT OUTLOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A scar snakes down Stars center Aaron Gavey's
face, starting under his right eye and trickling all the way down
to his lip.
</P>
<P>
   He's lucky it isn't worse. The hockey skate opened up a gash
that required 130-plus stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, you honestly wouldn't notice it if not for the fact his
Mary Lou Retton-sized smile draws attention there every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimist,'' Gavey said, explaining the smile and
reciting his motto in one, short declarative sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He remained optimistic after being sent down to Kalamazoo
despite a strong training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He remained optimistic when sent back to Kalamazoo not once but
twice more during the regular season. Not that he made a bad
impression when the Stars called him up. He didn't make any
impression at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have moments where you wonder,'' Gavey admitted before
quickly adding, ``but things are all done for a reason. I can't
worry about things I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   What he finally figured out is he can control some of those
things by the way he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey said he didn't consider it his last chance when he was
called up for the third time on Jan. 10, but if his chances were a
marathon he had to be around the 25th mile. He has six goals since,
including three in the Stars last three games against Philadelphia,
Phoenix and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about the pluses of the week against these intense
competition, he has to be right up there with one of the top
pluses. He and Brenden Morrow,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``I think Aaron is able to carry his own weight right now. I think
Aaron can go and play with anybody and he's got an impact in the
game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With a week to go before the March 14 trade deadline, Gavey has
put himself and the Stars in the enviable position of having a
really hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   If they want to make a trade for Carolina's Gary Roberts,
Montreal's Shayne Corson or one of the many other names rumored to
be going just about everywhere before the deadline, they have a
young talent to deal. If they aren't able to get a deal done, they
still have their young talent who could quickly become their
versatile scoring forward they so desire for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey and his wife, Jennifer, are ready for either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on what happens on the 14th, she's going to either
drive our truck back here or follow me wherever I go,'' Gavey said.
``I know I can play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are the only team in his five-year career where he's
bounced from the minors to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   They drafted what they thought was one player. They got quite
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when you are 24 and you have a 21-year-old that you
want to bring up here you think, `Maybe, this guy may be past
it,''' Hitchcock said. ``He's in the middle of proving he's capable
of playing in this league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He did in Tampa Bay, playing in 73 games his first year for the
Lightning. The only games he missed were because of the cut to his
face. He jokes that he made his own red line of blood as he skated
from Tampa Bay's bench to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the stitches were removed and he returned.
</P>
<P>
   The scar remained, and likely always will even if he has
surgery, because the cut went against the grain. The scar used to
bother him. He hated looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really talk about it for a while,'' Gavey said.
</P>
<P>
   The morose moment went as quickly as it had come, replaced by
the smile. For it is this you notice not the scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be that ugly,'' Gavey said with a laugh. ``My wife
married me.''

he's a great kid, he's got a lot of things going for him. But we
would never do anything to deter his career. We'll try to do what's
best for the young man.''

   After getting a taste of the majors, Wells doesn't want to
return to the minors. But he sees the benefit of playing all the
time at Triple-A rather than sitting the bench in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather it not happen, but if it does I'm not going to get
discouraged about it,'' Wells said. ``I'd still be a lot further
ahead than where I thought I'd be at this time last year.''

   The No. 10 on his back tells just how far he's come.

   CHINA-ASSESS (Shanghai, China) _ News Analysis: China's renewed
threat of war against Taiwan has caused anxiety in the West, but
Beijing's military options for attacking the island remain limited
and impractical, a fact often overlooked amid the furor in
Washington. Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last
month and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper today,
is meant to warn Taiwan away from formal independence and push it
toward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland. A
news analysis by Craig S. Smith.

watching _ still from afar, but with considerable bemusement _ as
his poetry becomes a weapon in the hands of right-wing Israeli

   BOEING-STRIKE (Tukwila, Wash.) _ The placards along the picket
lines outside the Boeing Co.'s huge aircraft plants are a bit
unusual. ``No Nerds, No Birds,'' proclaims one. And many Boeing
engineers, most on strike for the first time in their lives, say
they are still stunned at how unified their group has become in the
face of its protest against the jet manufacturer. The increasingly
bitter protest by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the largest strikes by
white-collar workers against a private company in years. For
national labor leaders, who have rushed in to help out the striking
engineers, the strike is clearly seen as an opportunity to make
inroads in its hopes to organize a potentially vast sector of the

   GEORGIA-VOTERS (Covington, Ga.) _ If previous elections were a
blur of policy headlines and angry demands, this year's is more
like an interesting novel that local voters suddenly have the time

There's not much doubt who will win Tuesday's primaries in Georgia;
both Bush and Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the
four major candidates has even bothered to campaign here on a
regular basis. But neither inevitability nor prosperity seems to
have dimmed Newton County's interest in this election. No one here
has seen a single political ad or shaken a candidate's hand, yet
voters are planning to show up at the polls, and they won't be
making a decision in last-minute frustration. By David Firestone.

disturbed about the popularity of MP3, a technology that poses a
serious piracy threat by compressing music into files that can be

install docks, build a domed theater and a spa with a glass atrium,
pave roads, and string electric cables. Hyundai has plans for a
1,000-room seaside hotel, a 45-hole golf course and a ski slope. It
has done all this with the blessing of the north's reclusive
Communist leaders. The project is the biggest gamble taken so far

THIS JINGLE IS FOR VOTERS, NOT SHOPPERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN JONES 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State propositions have inspired many things in the past _
name- &LR;  calling, yawns, endless junk mail. But this election,
they've inspired a catchy, toe-tapping hit single.
</P>
<P>
   A Sacramento-based voter education organization released a
31/2-minute jingle to help voters remember the 20 propositions on
Tuesday's ballot. ``The Proposition Song,'' written and performed
by California Voter Foundation president and founder Kim Alexander,
has gotten air time on dozens of talk and news radio shows around
the state, including KQED-FM in the Bay Area. It has been featured
on CNN and National Public Radio and in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The song also received 63,000 hits on the group's Web site in
February. It hasn't made the Billboard charts yet, but it might
before the election results are tallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fun public service. Anything that gets people
thinking about the election is a good thing,'' said Scott Shafer of
KQED, who featured the song during a one-hour special on the
election, which was sent to the station's affiliates around the
state. ``People seemed to like it. Now, whether they're whistling
it in the voter booth is another thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The melody is sort of a folksy rendition of ``My Baloney Has a
First Name.'' Alexander, a former camp song leader, said she
intended it to sound like a TV commercial jingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it all started. We all get TV jingles caught in our
head. I thought, `What if we can get the state propositions stuck
in voters' heads?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and her friends started working on the lyrics in
December, when the ballot was finalized. It was a tremendous
challenge, she said, to cover the complexities of 20 bonds and
initiatives in a cute and nonpartisan way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to think of it as `Schoolhouse Rock,' '' she said.
``Our whole generation learned the Constitution through that
song.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and a friend, along with a guitar accompanist,
recorded the song in two takes at Capitol Public Radio in
Sacramento. They made 30 compact disc recordings at her husband's
office and mailed them to radio stations around the state. A
Massachusetts company created a Web video for the song almost pro
bono. The video features the lyrics with a bouncing ball for
viewers to sing along.
</P>
<P>
   The whole project cost less than $2,500, Alexander said. ``It's
not perfect, but it's not unbearable to listen to. That was my main
concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Proposition Song'' has been such a success, Alexander
would like to record another song for the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to get a band in there,'' she said. ``But I have to
convince my friends to help out first.''

PEDIATRICIANS URGE COUNSELING IN VIOLENCE PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Confronting an epidemic of youth violence, the nation's leading
pediatricians group said Monday that a child's visit to the doctor
should include screening and counseling for violence prevention.
<P>
   The influential American Academy of Pediatrics said preventing
violence should take a place alongside whooping-cough vaccines and
nutrition counselingin everyday clinical practice _ starting with
counseling parents even before the child is born.
</P>
<P>
   The group outlined a series of subjects for doctors to raise
with parents and youngsters, including exposure to violence in the
home and school, attitudes toward discipline and corporal
punishment and access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations also offer guidance for doctors on how to
deal with problems as they arise. In many cases, the pediatricians
are expected to serve as an early-warning system, referring the
most difficult cases to counselors and other specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence prevention is a major problem affecting the health of
children of all ages, and we feel it should be part of
pediatricians' responsibility to try to prevent it,'' said Dr. Jack
Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa, speaking for the
55,000-member national organization.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy follows an academy-sponsored task force study
that began in 1997, even before the Columbine High School shootings
dramatically heightened public concern about youth violence. But
doctors said the latest spate of tragedies _ most recently the
shooting death of a classmate by a Michigan 6-year-old _ added much
more urgency to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatricians group cited a grim array of statistics showing
the United States has some of the highest youth homicide and
suicide rates in the world. American teenagers, experts noted, are
more likely to die of gunshot wounds than of all natural causes
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in popular culture, child abuse at home and easy access
to guns are among the ``many issues relevant to pediatric
practice,'' the doctors group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many issues are affecting kids now, it often seems that
viruses and bacteria are the least of our concerns these days,''
said Dr. Edward Cox, a Grand Rapids, Mich., pediatrician helping to
implement the new clinical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The group acknowledged that screening for the warning signs of
violence is a sensitive topic fraught with possibilities for
misunderstanding and invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But if a family's pediatrician raises the subject in the right
way, the group believes that parents or children will talk about
these sensitive issues for the good of the child. The idea is to
raise the subjects in a nonconfrontational way.
</P>
<P>
   The change announced Monday is part of a periodic update of a
schedule of preventive services and screening practices doctors are
supposed to offer their patients, starting with prenatal screening
and continuing through late adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Besides adding violence prevention to the list of health issues,
the latest revision included for the first time a recommendation
that newborns be screened for hearing difficulties. Recent studies
have found early detection of hearing problems can make a
significant difference in child development and language skills
throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   The violence-prevention guidelines are designed to tackle a much
broader concern. The upshot would be a new role for pediatricians
that would include not only clinical services _ at virtually every
stage of a child's development _ but community advocacy, research
and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a role,'' said Dr. Ann Tipton, a pediatrician and
adolescent health specialist at Kaiser Permanente's Oakland medical
center. She called violence prevention ``a multifaceted problem
that needs many approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it isn't part of the classical medical model,'' she
said, ``we all need to be working together in the home setting, the
school setting and now also in the medical setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines are being published on the pediatric group's
Web site Tuesday  &UR; (www.aap.org),  &LR; along with the 1999 policy
statement that gave rise to the change. They also appear in this
month's issue of Pediatrics, the organization's journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Steiner, a youth-violence expert at Stanford Medical
Center, said it's clear that a new awareness of violence is needed
in doctor's offices if the epidemic is ever to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems often start very early in life, and so they need to
be identified early in life,'' he said, adding that pediatricians
can be among the first to pick up risk factors such as an
aggressive temperament and exposure to violence in the home.

 DIAMONDS FINANCE AFRICA'S REBEL ARMIES  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional spring wedding season is approaching, and
diamond engagement rings are sparkling on the hands of brides-to-be
throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those diamonds have a sordid history. In many parts
of Africa, diamonds don't mean glamour, purity or eternal love.
Instead, they mean slaughter and sadistic brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In civil wars in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone _ among the
world's bloodiest yet most ignored conflicts _ guerrilla groups
earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually from mining and
exporting diamonds. They use the money to buy huge arsenals and
terrorize enormous expanses of countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a backlash has begun.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, in Washington and elsewhere, diplomats
and politicians are belatedly admitting that Western businesses and
consumers contribute to the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign is beginning to cut off diamond trading with the
rebel armies. At stake, its backers say, is the fate of a huge
swath of Africa _ and perhaps of the global diamond industry
itself.
</P>
<P>
   `'Diamonds are leaving a trail of misery through a lot of
African countries, and we as Americans have a lot of
responsibility,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who notes that an
estimated 5 percent to 15 percent of gem diamonds sold in the
United States come from rebels in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At minimum we need to let consumers know that these symbols of
love are causing great hardship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., are sponsoring legislation to
require that all diamonds sold in the United States be labeled
according to country of origin _ the first step, they say, to
forcing the guerrillas' diamonds off the American marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is rising for a crackdown on ``conflict diamonds'' in
the following ways:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Angola. &LR;  Diplomats led by Canada's ambassador to the United
Nations, Robert Fowler, are trying to stop diamond exporting by
Angola's powerful UNITA rebels. Fowler complains that U.N. members
have ignored a 2-year-old U.N. embargo on UNITA's diamonds, which
are believed to earn the rebels nearly $150 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, fighting between the government and the rebels
has killed 10,000 people, caused 75,000 to die of starvation and
has displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. In 25
years of civil war, more than 500,000 Angolans have died, most of
them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council panel on Angola, headed by Fowler, is
expected to issue a report March 15 revealing that businesses in
countries such as Ukraine, Belgium and South Africa, as well as
several African governments, are colluding with UNITA to break the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Sierra Leone.  &LR; A shaky peace is barely holding in this tiny
West African nation's civil war. The Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) guerrillas have harassed and seized weapons from the 6,000
U.N. peacekeepers, and they have refused to disarm or give up their
control of the nation's diamond mines, as they agreed to do in a
peace pact last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels spread mayhem throughout the nation and horrified the
world during the eight-year war by hacking off the arms, legs, ears
and lips of thousands of civilians. About 75,000 people died in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the RUF is using the tens of millions of dollars it earns
annually from diamonds to strengthen its forces. CIA Director
George Tenet told Congress last month that the RUF is ``poised to
break a tenuous cease-fire and resume a campaign of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats and activists say the United Nations must place
an embargo on diamonds from Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia _
whose ruler, Charles Taylor, acts as the RUF's diamond exporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Leone's diamonds are top quality, and the RUF is
getting them to market one way or another, and it must be stopped
or else the U.N. mission will be a total failure,'' said Ian
Smillie, a researcher for Partnership Africa Canada, a coalition of
development organizations that in January released an influential
expose on the RUF's role in the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Congo.  &LR; More than 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers are scheduled to
move into this sprawling nation in the coming months to try to stop
what has been called ``Africa's world war'' _ a conflict that has
drawn in tens of thousands of soldiers from neighboring Rwanda,
Uganda, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad. But many experts say
the war will continue until the foreign armies are forced out of
the nation's $600-million-per-year diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, whose troops form the backbone of the rebel
forces, pay their way by diamond and gold mining in rebel-held
areas of eastern Congo, and act as conduits for UNITA's diamond and
weapons smuggling. Zimbabwe, which backs the Congolese government,
enjoys a lucrative diamond concession granted by President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is building on the Security Council to put  &LR; impose a
ban on all Congolese diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Consumer information.  &LR; In Congress, Hall and Wolf say their
legislation is needed to help build pressure on the diamond
industry to stop dealing with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world looked the other way once, while revenues from
diamond sales were used to butcher innocent civilians,'' Wolf said.
``This time, we should not stand idly by. We should do whatever it
takes to cut off these revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, Hall and other reformers insist that they do not want a
general boycott of the diamond industry, which they say would
damage nations like Botswana, South Africa and Namibia, where it
provides much-needed jobs and generally operates in an ethical
manner.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is running scared, fearing that any bad publicity
could hurt sales. Gem diamonds have no intrinsic value, and their
value depends totally on the upscale image the industry has created
over the years through slick advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African conglomerate
that controls about two-thirds of the wholesale diamond trade
worldwide, announced last Tuesday that starting later this month,
diamonds sold by the company will be accompanied by a certificate
stating that they do ``not include any diamonds which come from any
area in Africa controlled by forces rebelling against the
legitimate and internationally recognized government of the
relevant country.''
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that De Beers will sell only gems from its mines
in Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and other nations, or ones
bought on the open market from places like Russia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As industry leader we feel an obligation to take these steps,
not only from a moral standpoint,'' said Andrew Lamont, a spokesman
in London for De Beers. ``We hope this will ensure that the
legitimate diamond trade is not adversely affected by the small
number of diamonds that benefit the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates hailed the decision. ``De Beers has taken a
lead that the rest of the diamond industry must now follow,'' said
Charmian Gooch, director of Global Witness, a group based in London
that has led the international campaign against African conflict
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But the diamond trade's secretive nature makes it difficult for
De Beers to fully comply. Experts say diamonds cannot be
distinguished visually by place of origin, and as a result a
suitcase of gems worth tens of millions of dollars can easily be
``laundered'' through several countries to falsify their place of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   In January, U.S. diamond importers and retailers signed a
statement pledging to obey the embargo on UNITA diamonds, and
promising to cooperate with U.N. attempts to strengthen the ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Gooch and other reformers say that U.S. importers buy as
much as one-third of their diamonds from wholesalers in Antwerp,
Tel Aviv and elsewhere that, unlike De Beers, refuse to crack down
on rebel-mined gems or give verifiable information on their origin.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, they say, is a mandatory global diamond labeling
system in which all sales must be accompanied by verifiable
documents declaring the origin of the diamonds and their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems _ and the proposed Hall-Wolf legislation _ are
opposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to find a practical or feasible way to
label diamonds,'' said Jeffrey Fischer, vice president of the
Diamond Manufacturers and Importers of America, who was one of the
signers of the January statement. ``The diamond industry is a very
fluid, fast-moving business. (Mandatory controls) would only burden
the industry, and ultimately the consumer, with much higher
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet decided whether to
support a mandatory labeling system. Action has been advocated by
mid-level officials for several years, but was ignored at more
senior levels until very recently because wars in Africa are not
generally seen as affecting America's strategic interests.

 BUSH CAMPAIGN DENIES SHIFT ON GAYS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ A spokeswoman for Texas Gov. George W. Bush insisted
Monday that the candidate's pronouncement that he would meet with
gay Republicans is not a reversal, but a clarification of comments
widely ``misinterpreted'' by the national media.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told NBC's Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' last fall that
he would ``probably not'' meet with Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
organization, because it would create a ``huge political ...
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, he defended his comments, saying he did not wish
to ``politicize'' a matter as ``personal and private'' as someone's
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Bush told The Chronicle that he welcomes support from
gays and is willing to meet with the group. Explaining his comments
to reporters on the campaign trail in Southern California
yesterday, Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, insisted
his initial reluctance had been directed only at two specific
leaders of the gay group, whom he believed had already decided to
support to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor does have many supporters who are members of
local chapters of different Log Cabin organizations,'' she said.
``He welcomes their support and will certainly consider meeting
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The words drew an incredulous response from officials of the Log
Cabin group, which is based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the more she talks, the more bizarre this gets,''
said spokesman Kevin Ivers. ``If you look at the video, it is
pretty clear. Still, we stand by our statement that what the
governor said (Sunday) is a positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday morning show last fall, Russert said to Bush:
``John McCain, your opponent, met with Log Cabin Republicans, gay
Republicans. Would you meet with them?''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BUSH07 (14007 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Bush responded: ``Oh, probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, Bush said, ``I don't believe in group thought,
pitting one group of people against another. And all that does is
create kind of a huge political, you know, nightmare for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's refusal to meet with the gay group was the subject of a
pro-Bush radio ad produced by the Christian Coalition and aired in
South Carolina. The ad questioned McCain's conservative credentials
by noting that he had met with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, as Bush delivered a speech on tolerance at the Simon
Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles, he was repeatedly interrupted by
a heckler who demanded: ``What about gay people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about tolerance and inclusion _ but he just can't
open his heart to include gay Americans,'' said the heckler,
Richard Noble, 31, an artist from West Hollywood.

TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT A BAD BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's Super Tuesday, when at long last California
and New York rise up and exercise almost as much political clout as
New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know anything about the candidates or the issues, so I
called on my chief political adviser, Dr. Paula Ticks.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when considering the four main presidential
candidates, you should look at the negatives, rather than only at
the so-called upsides.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people, says Dr. Ticks, make important, life-altering
decisions based on a few glittery, superficial qualities. This is
what psychologists refer to as Darva Conger Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the good doctor's notes on candidate negs:
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush. He speaks at Bob Jones University, then weeks
later apologizes lukewarmly for not taking the school to task for
its strident anti-Catholicism and ban on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   That's one slow thinker, folks, even for a Texan. (Just kidding,
padnuhs!) John McCain. The G word. Suppose things get dicey between
China and Taiwan, the U.S. gets involved in negotiations, world
peace hangs in the balance, and President McCain slips and uses the
G word. Oops!
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McCain is just a garden-variety Republican, except on
campaign finance reform, and that's a bogus issue since people who
champion that cause drop it like a hot cow pie once they get into
office (see: Bill Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore. He's being swept into the Democratic nomination on the
strength of his association with Clinton. Either this logic is
flawed, or Gabby Hayes should have won several Academy Awards for
best actor.
</P>
<P>
   And the deal with Gore inventing the Internet and being the
inspiration for ``Love Story''? Just a little bit creepy. Al's
reality/fantasy boundary is wobbly. Actually, Gore  &UR; was  &LR; the
inspiration for ``Robo Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley. Clinically unable to throw tantrums. McCain, Bush,
Gore _ all noted blow-tops, in public and behind the scenes. But
Bradley takes a situation that calls for petulant lash-out and
tries to handle it with calm, boring reason and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the blustery, cartoonish personality we demand in our
presidents?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would be OK in summit talks with belligerent world
leaders, sure, but he would be lost if ever called upon to appear
in an infomercial giving an enthusiastic endorsement to the Buns of
Steel video.
</P>
<P>
   SHOCK AND OUTRAGE were the most common reactions to photos of
Sunday's airliner crash in Burbank, where the plane came to rest
under a Chevron gas station sign.
</P>
<P>
   The horror! A buck seventy-nine for super premium! Twenty cents
cheaper than Bay Area gas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true that the pilot leaned out the cockpit window and
said, ``Fill 'er up!'' But George Hampton points out that since a
jet has a 6,000-gallon fuel tank, a fill-up at the Burbank Chevron
is $1,200 cheaper than a tankful at a service station near SFO.
Plus down there, or so it appears in the photos, firefighters clean
your jet's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   MY FINANCIAL analyst, Suds Shanahan, looked up the portfolios of
the candidates on AOL Personal Finance and unearthed the largest
single stock investment held by each man, to wit:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Bank of America, $100,000. So would Bradley be OK
with moving the White House to North Carolina and letting Hugh
McColl call the shots?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, Microsoft, $180,000. Amazingly enough, Bush
supports tax breaks for the computer industry, has even floated a
proposal to make Canada a subsidiary of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, lease of a zinc mine, between $100,000 and $250,000.
With ready access to zinc tablets, Al can easily ward off colds and
flu.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, Anheuser Busch, $300,000. Hey, John Sixpack! Here
comes the Slurred Speech Express, and key endorsements from two of
the three Budweiser frogs (one has withheld endorsement due to
McCain's proposal to use all rivers and swamps for storage of
radioactive waste).
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY, Dr. Ticks says she wants to congratulate all the
Democrats who reregistered Republican in order to vote for McCain
and stamp out Bush.
</P>
<P>
   You've not only enlisted in a lost cause, but you've also
energized the once-complacent W.
</P>
<P>
   And as a bonus, you've taken away votes from Bradley that might
have made him a contender. So many Demos shooting themselves in
feet, it's no wonder their party supports gun control.
</P>
<P>
   My own pick on Super Tuesday: The Rams by a touchdown.

PEDIATRICIANS URGE COUNSELING IN VIOLENCE PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Confronting an epidemic of youth violence, the nation's leading
pediatricians group said Monday that a child's visit to the doctor
should include screening and counseling for violence prevention.
<P>
   The influential American Academy of Pediatrics said preventing
violence should take a place alongside whooping-cough vaccines and
nutrition counseling in everyday clinical practice _ starting with
counseling parents even before the child is born.
</P>
<P>
   The group outlined a series of subjects for doctors to raise
with parents and youngsters, including exposure to violence in the
home and school, attitudes toward discipline and corporal
punishment and access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations also offer guidance for doctors on how to
deal with problems as they arise. In many cases, the pediatricians
are expected to serve as an early-warning system, referring the
most difficult cases to counselors and other specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence prevention is a major problem affecting the health of
children of all ages, and we feel it should be part of
pediatricians' responsibility to try to prevent it,'' said Dr. Jack
Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa, speaking for the
55,000-member national organization.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy follows an academy-sponsored task force study
that began in 1997, even before the Columbine High School shootings
dramatically heightened public concern about youth violence. But
doctors said the latest spate of tragedies _ most recently the
shooting death of a classmate by a Michigan 6-year-old _ added much
more urgency to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatricians group cited a grim array of statistics showing
the United States has some of the highest youth homicide and
suicide rates in the world. American teenagers, experts noted, are
more likely to die of gunshot wounds than of all natural causes
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in popular culture, child abuse at home and easy access
to guns are among the ``many issues relevant to pediatric
practice,'' the doctors group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many issues are affecting kids now, it often seems that
viruses and bacteria are the least of our concerns these days,''
said Dr. Edward Cox, a Grand Rapids, Mich., pediatrician helping to
implement the new clinical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The group acknowledged that screening for the warning signs of
violence is a sensitive topic fraught with possibilities for
misunderstanding and invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But if a family's pediatrician raises the subject in the right
way, the group believes that parents or children will talk about
these sensitive issues for the good of the child. The idea is to
raise the subjects in a nonconfrontational way.
</P>
<P>
   The change announced Monday is part of a periodic update of a
schedule of preventive services and screening practices doctors are
supposed to offer their patients, starting with prenatal screening
and continuing through late adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Besides adding violence prevention to the list of health issues,
the latest revision included for the first time a recommendation
that newborns be screened for hearing difficulties. Recent studies
have found early detection of hearing problems can make a
significant difference in child development and language skills
throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   The violence-prevention guidelines are designed to tackle a much
broader concern. The upshot would be a new role for pediatricians
that would include not only clinical services _ at virtually every
stage of a child's development _ but community advocacy, research
and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a role,'' said Dr. Ann Tipton, a pediatrician and
adolescent health specialist at Kaiser Permanente's Oakland medical
center. She called violence prevention ``a multifaceted problem
that needs many approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it isn't part of the classical medical model,'' she
said, ``we all need to be working together in the home setting, the
school setting and now also in the medical setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines are being published on the pediatric group's
Web site Tuesday  &UR; (www.aap.org),  &LR; along with the 1999 policy
statement that gave rise to the change. They also appear in this
month's issue of Pediatrics, the organization's journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Steiner, a youth-violence expert at Stanford Medical
Center, said it's clear that a new awareness of violence is needed
in doctor's offices if the epidemic is ever to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems often start very early in life, and so they need to
be identified early in life,'' he said, adding that pediatricians
can be among the first to pick up risk factors such as an
aggressive temperament and exposure to violence in the home.

 DIAMONDS FINANCE AFRICA'S REBEL ARMIES  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional spring wedding season is approaching, and
diamond engagement rings are sparkling on the hands of brides-to-be
throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those diamonds have a sordid history. In many parts
of Africa, diamonds don't mean glamour, purity or eternal love.
Instead, they mean slaughter and sadistic brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In civil wars in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone _ among the
world's bloodiest yet most ignored conflicts _ guerrilla groups
earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually from mining and
exporting diamonds. They use the money to buy huge arsenals and
terrorize enormous expanses of countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a backlash has begun.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, in Washington and elsewhere, diplomats
and politicians are belatedly admitting that Western businesses and
consumers contribute to the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign is beginning to cut off diamond trading with the
rebel armies. At stake, its backers say, is the fate of a huge
swath of Africa _ and perhaps of the global diamond industry
itself.
</P>
<P>
   `'Diamonds are leaving a trail of misery through a lot of
African countries, and we as Americans have a lot of
responsibility,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who notes that an
estimated 5 percent to 15 percent of gem diamonds sold in the
United States come from rebels in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At minimum we need to let consumers know that these symbols of
love are causing great hardship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., are sponsoring legislation to
require that all diamonds sold in the United States be labeled
according to country of origin _ the first step, they say, to
forcing the guerrillas' diamonds off the American marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is rising for a crackdown on ``conflict diamonds'' in
the following ways:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Angola. &LR;  Diplomats led by Canada's ambassador to the United
Nations, Robert Fowler, are trying to stop diamond exporting by
Angola's powerful UNITA rebels. Fowler complains that U.N. members
have ignored a 2-year-old U.N. embargo on UNITA's diamonds, which
are believed to earn the rebels nearly $150 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, fighting between the government and the rebels
has killed 10,000 people, caused 75,000 to die of starvation and
has displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. In 25
years of civil war, more than 500,000 Angolans have died, most of
them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council panel on Angola, headed by Fowler, is
expected to issue a report March 15 revealing that businesses in
countries such as Ukraine, Belgium and South Africa, as well as
several African governments, are colluding with UNITA to break the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Sierra Leone.  &LR; A shaky peace is barely holding in this tiny
West African nation's civil war. The Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) guerrillas have harassed and seized weapons from the 6,000
U.N. peacekeepers, and they have refused to disarm or give up their
control of the nation's diamond mines, as they agreed to do in a
peace pact last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels spread mayhem throughout the nation and horrified the
world during the eight-year war by hacking off the arms, legs, ears
and lips of thousands of civilians. About 75,000 people died in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the RUF is using the tens of millions of dollars it earns
annually from diamonds to strengthen its forces. CIA Director
George Tenet told Congress last month that the RUF is ``poised to
break a tenuous cease-fire and resume a campaign of terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats and activists say the United Nations must place
an embargo on diamonds from Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia _
whose ruler, Charles Taylor, acts as the RUF's diamond exporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Leone's diamonds are top quality, and the RUF is
getting them to market one way or another, and it must be stopped
or else the U.N. mission will be a total failure,'' said Ian
Smillie, a researcher for Partnership Africa Canada, a coalition of
development organizations that in January released an influential
expose on the RUF's role in the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Congo.  &LR; More than 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers are scheduled to
move into this sprawling nation in the coming months to try to stop
what has been called ``Africa's world war'' _ a conflict that has
drawn in tens of thousands of soldiers from neighboring Rwanda,
Uganda, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad. But many experts say
the war will continue until the foreign armies are forced out of
the nation's $600-million-per-year diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, whose troops form the backbone of the rebel
forces, pay their way by diamond and gold mining in rebel-held
areas of eastern Congo, and act as conduits for UNITA's diamond and
weapons smuggling. Zimbabwe, which backs the Congolese government,
enjoys a lucrative diamond concession granted by President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is building on the Security Council to put  &LR; impose a
ban on all Congolese diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Consumer information.  &LR; In Congress, Hall and Wolf say their
legislation is needed to help build pressure on the diamond
industry to stop dealing with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world looked the other way once, while revenues from
diamond sales were used to butcher innocent civilians,'' Wolf said.
``This time, we should not stand idly by. We should do whatever it
takes to cut off these revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, Hall and other reformers insist that they do not want a
general boycott of the diamond industry, which they say would
damage nations like Botswana, South Africa and Namibia, where it
provides much-needed jobs and generally operates in an ethical
manner.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is running scared, fearing that any bad publicity
could hurt sales. Gem diamonds have no intrinsic value, and their
value depends totally on the upscale image the industry has created
over the years through slick advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African conglomerate
that controls about two-thirds of the wholesale diamond trade
worldwide, announced last Tuesday that starting later this month,
diamonds sold by the company will be accompanied by a certificate
stating that they do ``not include any diamonds which come from any
area in Africa controlled by forces rebelling against the
legitimate and internationally recognized government of the
relevant country.''
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that De Beers will sell only gems from its mines
in Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and other nations, or ones
bought on the open market from places like Russia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As industry leader we feel an obligation to take these steps,
not only from a moral standpoint,'' said Andrew Lamont, a spokesman
in London for De Beers. ``We hope this will ensure that the
legitimate diamond trade is not adversely affected by the small
number of diamonds that benefit the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates hailed the decision. ``De Beers has taken a
lead that the rest of the diamond industry must now follow,'' said
Charmian Gooch, director of Global Witness, a group based in London
that has led the international campaign against African conflict
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But the diamond trade's secretive nature makes it difficult for
De Beers to fully comply. Experts say diamonds cannot be
distinguished visually by place of origin, and as a result a
suitcase of gems worth tens of millions of dollars can easily be
``laundered'' through several countries to falsify their place of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   In January, U.S. diamond importers and retailers signed a
statement pledging to obey the embargo on UNITA diamonds, and
promising to cooperate with U.N. attempts to strengthen the ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Gooch and other reformers say that U.S. importers buy as
much as one-third of their diamonds from wholesalers in Antwerp,
Tel Aviv and elsewhere that, unlike De Beers, refuse to crack down
on rebel-mined gems or give verifiable information on their origin.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, they say, is a mandatory global diamond labeling
system in which all sales must be accompanied by verifiable
documents declaring the origin of the diamonds and their
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems _ and the proposed Hall-Wolf legislation _ are
opposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to find a practical or feasible way to
label diamonds,'' said Jeffrey Fischer, vice president of the
Diamond Manufacturers and Importers of America, who was one of the
signers of the January statement. ``The diamond industry is a very
fluid, fast-moving business. (Mandatory controls) would only burden
the industry, and ultimately the consumer, with much higher
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet decided whether to
support a mandatory labeling system. Action has been advocated by
mid-level officials for several years, but was ignored at more
senior levels until very recently because wars in Africa are not
generally seen as affecting America's strategic interests.

 DIAMONDS FINANCE AFRICA'S REBEL ARMIES  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional spring wedding season is approaching, and
diamond engagement rings are sparkling on the hands of brides-to-be
throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those diamonds have a sordid history. In many parts
of Africa, diamonds don't mean glamour, purity or eternal love.
Instead, they mean slaughter and sadistic brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In civil wars in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone _ among the
world's bloodiest yet most ignored conflicts _ guerrilla groups
earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually from mining and
exporting diamonds. They use the money to buy huge arsenals and
terrorize enormous expanses of countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a backlash has begun.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, in Washington and elsewhere, diplomats
and politicians are belatedly admitting that Western businesses and
consumers contribute to the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign is beginning to cut off diamond trading with the
rebel armies. At stake, its backers say, is the fate of a huge
swath of Africa _ and perhaps of the global diamond industry
itself.
</P>
<P>
   `'Diamonds are leaving a trail of misery through a lot of
African countries, and we as Americans have a lot of
responsibility,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who notes that an
estimated 5 percent to 15 percent of gem diamonds sold in the
United States come from rebels in Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At minimum we need to let consumers know that these symbols of
love are causing great hardship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., are sponsoring legislation to
require that all diamonds sold in the United States be labeled
according to country of origin _ the first step, they say, to
forcing the guerrillas' diamonds off the American marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is rising for a crackdown on ``conflict diamonds'' in
the following ways:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Angola. &LR;  Diplomats led by Canada's ambassador to the United
Nations, Robert Fowler, are trying to stop diamond exporting by
Angola's powerful UNITA rebels. Fowler complains that U.N. members
have ignored a 2-year-old U.N. embargo on UNITA's diamonds, which
are believed to earn the rebels nearly $150 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, fighting between the government and the rebels
has killed 10,000 people, caused 75,000 to die of starvation and
has displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. In 25
years of civil war, more than 500,000 Angolans have died, most of
them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council panel on Angola, headed by Fowler, is
expected to issue a report March 15 revealing that businesses in
countries such as Ukraine, Belgium and South Africa, as well as
several African governments, are colluding with UNITA to break the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Sierra Leone.  &LR; A shaky peace is barely holding in this tiny
West African nation's civil war. The Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) guerrillas have harassed and seized weapons from the 6,000
U.N. peacekeepers, and they have refused to disarm or give up their
control of the nation's diamond mines, as they agreed to do in a
peace pact last year.

NEAR DISASTER FUELS AIRPORT DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER, JENNIFER HAMM AND HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BURBANK, CALIF. _ As the battered body of a Southwest Airlines
jet was towed from Hollywood Way, local officials seized on the
near disaster to renew the debate on Burbank Airport safety, plans
for a new terminal and flight curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board opened its
investigation with officials promising to examine everything from
equipment on the 15-year-old aircraft to the actions of its veteran
crew. Part of the investigation will focus on the cockpit data
records, which were flown to the NTSB lab in Washington, D.C.
Several of the plane's passengers said the jet approached the
airport too fast and at too steep an angle to stop after touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be _ starting tomorrow _ doing a very, very
detailed examination of the airplane's systems, every aspect of
them, and we're also going to be looking at the crew's
performance,'' Jeff Rich, the safety board's lead investigator,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As workers hauled the damaged 737-300 back onto the airport
tarmac, the crash, which caused only minor injuries, reignited a
long-running battle over Burbank Airport's planned expansion.
Backers of efforts to upgrade the airport seized on the accident as
graphic proof of their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that there's not a safety problem at this airport
vanished (Sunday) night,'' said Carl Meseck, chairman of the
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The authority wants to relocate and upgrade the airport
terminal, which sits just 350 feet from the runway the plane
overshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to sit down and see how we can move the relocation
forward,'' Burbank Mayor Stacey Murphy said. ``It's a huge safety
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Burbank City Councilman Ted McConkey said the
airport's planned upgrade would do nothing to prevent similar
incidents from occurring in the future. The length of the runways
would not change in the proposed upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be nothing to stop the same accident from happening,''
said McConkey, a longtime expansion foe. ``It wouldn't have made
any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators aren't sure why Southwest Flight 1455
skidded off the runway around 6:10 p.m. Sunday, crashed through a
metal barrier and plunged onto Hollywood Way, stopping just feet
from a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said investigators already had interviewed the crew of a
plane that landed shortly before the ill-fated Southwest flight.
Despite the raging storms that blew through the San Fernando Valley
earlier Sunday, the earlier crew reported a dry runway and good
braking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They described the conditions as fairly benign,'' Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of Flight 1455's landing, several of
the 142 people on board said.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane descended toward Burbank, flying east across the
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the pilot made a sharp left turn, said
passenger Garrett Hamil of Hollywood. The plane then turned back to
the right and swayed back and forth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit the pavement at what seemed like the middle of the
runway, he said, and barreled on through the metal barrier. On
Monday, Hamil was still marveling that the jet didn't hit the gas
station and touch off an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at that Chevron station and how close we were to that
pump and the jet fuel ... we were saved,'' he said through tears.
``It was not our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6,032 feet, the runway is shorter than those used by the
largest aircraft, but an acceptable size for commuter planes like
the 737-300, according to aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate for a 737. However, if anything goes wrong, it
leaves very little margin for luck to come in,'' said Frank Tullo,
a retired airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. ``Most of
the runways are a lot longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261, in which all 88
people aboard died Jan. 31 after the aircraft plunged into water
off the Ventura County coast, no one died in Sunday's crash. All
six people who were hurt, including the plane's pilot, were treated
at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank and released
before midnight Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Southwest Airlines declined to release the names of
the Oakland-based pilot and first officer, citing the ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They described the pilot, however, as an experienced flier who
served in the U.S. Air Force before joining Southwest in 1988.
Company spokeswoman Beth Harbin said the pilot has been flying 737s
since 1980. He suffered a gash to his head during the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer, Harbin said, has 15 years of flying
experience and joined the airline in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The crew reported no problems with the aircraft during the
flight, according to company officials. The aircraft has flown
32,000 flight cycles to date each representing one takeoff and one
landing. Its last service check, on Thursday, turned up no
problems, Harbin said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft might not fly again. The crash damaged its nose,
landing gear and right engine.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was gingerly towed away from the crash site around 9
a.m. Monday, with the assistance of two cranes brought in by a
private contractor and a flatbed truck used to keep the nose
steady, said Burbank airport spokesman Victor Gill. It was brought
to an open-air location next to the runway, where NTSB
investigators pored over the aircraft looking for clues to what
went wrong.

WITNESSES TO PLANE CRASH QUICKLY BECOME HEROES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BURBANK, CALIF. _ In the last harrowing moments before
Southwest Airlines Flight 1455 crashed, passenger Garrett Hamil
said he knew something was very wrong as the jetliner swayed
violently down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to crash at that time,'' Hamil recalled
Monday, a day after the jet slammed through a metal fence, careened
onto Hollywood Way and stopped short of a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you look at death in people's eyes, and you
think these are the last eyes you're going to look into? That's
what happened. Everybody was looking for comfort in each other,''
the 27-year-old Hollywood man said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the plane made a quick right turn and burst through
the fence that divides the airport from Hollywood Way. The
passengers and crew members were jolted upon impact and then again
when the plane hit a car before coming to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Panels from the plane's ceiling tumbled onto passengers,
trapping Hamil and others, as the plane finally stopped about 30
feet away from gas pumps at a Chevron station.
</P>
<P>
   The nose of the plane had dropped down. The cabin lights went
off and smoke filled the plane as passengers exited on inflatable
ramps. Miraculously, no one was seriously hurt in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fortuitous ending to what began as a rough landing. Ten
minutes before landing, the pilot warned of turbulence ahead, Hamil
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said we may have some rough turbulence because of 27 mph
winds. But he said it should be no problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, passengers were jerked to the right and then to
the left as the plane swayed in the wind. ``I knew we were going
too fast,'' Hamil said. ``People are screaming and hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, almost everyone applauded. ``A
couple people yelled out, `Right on!' '' Hamil said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too soon: Hamil and others looked out the window and
saw that the plane had landed too far down the runway. The jet then
crashed through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The next communication with the passengers came after the plane
stopped and a flight attendant told them to head to the nearest
exit. ``You could totally tell her panic. Her voice was shaking,''
Hamil said.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers tried to grab their luggage but were ordered to
leave without it.
</P>
<P>
   A few men had to lift the large panel that had fallen before
Hamil and others could exit the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   After making their way through the smoke-filled plane, the crew
told passengers to jump from the plane onto an inflatable slide.
</P>
<P>
   Hamil jumped and was caught by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started running away from the plane,'' he said. ``I
looked back and saw people walking on the wing. You're just taking
it all in and wondering if everyone's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those helping rescue passengers was Abayomi Omolewu, a
Prime Time shuttle van driver who had been waiting at the Chevron
station. While others ran away, Omolewu, a father of two, ran
toward the plane. He saw a man hanging from the wing who shouted,
``Help! Help!''
</P>
<P>
   Omolewu's co-workers hollered for him to step back. But he
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was just telling me to go and help. I was watching
to see if it was going to blow up,'' said the 46-year-old Nigerian
native who lives in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept yelling, `Sit down and slide,' '' Omolewu said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-7 and 190 pounds, Omolewu ended up catching about 30
people. ``I believe God gave me that strength yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Two others, including one passenger Omolewu helped down the
slide, also helped catch people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking maybe this plane will blow up. But I'm looking
at the people in the plane who may die ... I didn't want those
people to die. So I did whatever I could,'' Omolewu said. ``It's
hard to see someone drowning. If I know I can swim, I'll go and
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Martinez, 18, a cashier at the Chevron station, also ran
to help the victims after hitting the emergency button to shut off
gas pumps and calling 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the plane was going to blow up, but I didn't want to
just leave them there,'' Martinez said. ``One old lady was crying
and didn't know where to go. I hugged her and I told her everything
was going to be all right. I told her to get away from the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Omolewu and other shuttle and taxi drivers helped drive the
victims to safe ground at the airport.
</P>

BUSH, McCAIN APPEAL FOR VOTES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ In final symbolic gestures for Tuesday
primaries, GOP presidential candidates campaigned in the nation's
biggest state Monday with front-runner George W. Bush talking about
tolerance and challenger John McCain attacking establishment power.
</P>
<P>
   With California and 13 other states, including New York, on the
line, the Texas governor offered an upbeat message to moderate
Republicans and denounced racial and religious hatred in a speech
at the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Museum of Tolerance in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all its flaws, I believe our nation is chosen by God and
commissioned by history to be the model to the world of justice and
inclusion and diversity without division,'' Bush said. ``These are
American convictions. Defending them is America's calling, and they
must be passed intact to America's children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, fighting to keep his candidacy alive with
California's 162 delegates among the 613 GOP delegates at stake
Tuesday, attacked Bush's campaign tactics and ``his sleazy Texas
buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   At a UCLA rally, McCain told students he's like fictional movie
hero Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star with his
crusade to reform campaign financing and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get out of the Death Star and we're going to
defeat the forces arrayed against us,'' McCain told hundreds of
students gathered in a drizzling rain outside Kerckhoff Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the establishment, all the big money _ the iron triangle
of big money, lobbyists and legislation. We're going to break that
iron triangle and we're going to give government back to you. That
is what this campaign is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Tuesday's'' biggest prize is California's
winner-take-all primary, but McCain could score a damaging upset by
winning the popular vote ``beauty contest'' against Bush by
appealing to independents and Democrats to cross party lines. Only
votes of Republicans will count toward GOP delegation selection,
under rules imposed by the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged that if he is elected president, he will give voice
to the need for tolerance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I must give it force. That is my commitment to the people
of this country. Every American must know they are equally American
_ no matter their culture, race or religion,'' he said. ``And those
who practice intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy
in the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bush lit the memorial flame at the center in honor of
those killed during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   During his appearance at UCLA, McCain said he hoped his recent
comments criticizing the actions of ministers Jerry Falwell and Pat
Robertson didn't alienate conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my party to be the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore
Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``A party that says
everybody come on board, even if you have some disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA junior Neel Punwani, 21, said he liked what McCain had to
say about reforming government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breath of fresh air in our political system,'' he said.
``I really admire him for speaking out against the Christian right.
It takes a lot of guts to do that. He'll probably pay for it, but I
commend him on his beliefs.''

NO LETUP IN SIGHT AT GAS PUMPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Motorists across the region who are hoping for
relief from rising gasoline prices can look forward instead to more
bad news this summer, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
decides to increase oil production later this month, U.S. gasoline
prices could easily soar an additional 20 cents a gallon by May or
June, according to an analysis released by the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   That means prices could head into or above the $1.70-a-gallon
range for this summer's busy driving season. In California, where
the average price for unleaded is already at $1.63, prices could
top $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline in some spots in California is already $2 a gallon,''
said Philip Verleger Jr., an economist with the Brattle Group, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based economic consulting firm. ``Californians are
going to pay 20 cents more on average than the EIA is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's uproar over soaring gas prices which included
a one-day boycott of service stations _ California motorists could
be particularly sensitive to further fuel-price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Gas station owners could bear the brunt of that unrest this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the service station dealers, we catch the front-line wrath
of the consumer,'' said Will Woods, executive director of the
Automotive Trade Organizations of California, an association of
service station dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy about it either,'' Woods said. ``In most cases
we don't pass on the full cost increases because we have to compete
with other stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director of the California
Energy Commission, said the government has had little power to
influence oil and gasoline prices since 1981, when President Reagan
deregulated the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commodity market,'' Chandler said. ``It's very
difficult for the state of California or the federal government to
step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Although consumer complaints are sure to rise with gasoline
prices, Carol Thorp, spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of
Southern California, said prices will probably not affect the
summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, as long as the economy is good and people are
secure about their jobs,'' she said, ``increases in gasoline prices
have little or no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists blame the current situation on an effort by the OPEC
cartel to shore up prices by curtailing oil production. OPEC and
other oil-producing countries have already cut daily production by
an estimated 4.3 million barrels, or about 181 million gallons,
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Daily production now stands around 75 million barrels, Verleger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC cuts lifted crude oil prices from under $11 a barrel to
around $30 a barrel. Each $1 increase in crude oil translates into
an additional 2 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump, according
to the California Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission estimates that California gets just 15
percent of its oil from foreign sources, OPEC price levels set the
benchmark for the entire industry. And gasoline refiners are
particularly vulnerable to crude oil price increases now because
U.S. inventories of gasoline are ``alarmingly low,'' according to
the Energy Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even if OPEC decides to increase production at its scheduled
March 27 meeting, it will take weeks before gas prices are
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent increases, inflation-adjusted gas prices are
still nowhere near their 1981 peak, however. In current dollars,
gasoline would cost about $2.70 a gallon, according to Verleger.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will be complaining if prices increase in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Arco, which draws much of its oil from Alaska,
should see higher profits as a result of higher gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Verches, spokesman for Arco Products Co., said the
high prices and resulting windfall for some oil companies _ is
unlikely to last and is not enough to derail Arco's proposed merger
with BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive period financially for the company,'' he said,
``but it's a little late to save us.''

HERSHISER IS PITCHER AND PROFESSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Anyone who knows Orel Hershiser even a little
will tell you his options are limitless when his playing days are
over. Whether he's a pitching coach, a manager, a general manager,
a president or whatever, he'll be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all the things people say about Hershiser, there is one
thing no one can tell you. No one knows when Hershiser will stop
throwing baseballs and pursue that next career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys are like, `How much do you have left?''' said
Hershiser, a 17-year veteran. ``Well, I'm still winning 12, 13, 16
games. ... Even in my last day of my last year, when it comes, I'm
never going to say it is (time to retire) because that'll mean I
quit in the midseason, or spring training, or in September, and
that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hershiser left the Dodgers after the `94 season, the
consensus among the front office was he no longer possessed the
skills to perform as a starter. Stops in Cleveland and San
Francisco punched holes in that evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hershiser has a one-year, $2 million contract (with a club
option for 2001), and the speculation is his return is nothing more
than a precursor to a front-office job or a spot on the coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's lost that much as far as velocity,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He still has good sink, makes
the ball move. He takes real good care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, is with his fourth team in four years and not
assured of a spot in the starting rotation. He's battling Carlos
Perez for a starting spot. Otherwise, Hershiser will wind up in the
bullpen out to pasture in the role of long relief.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hershiser's run after right shoulder surgery in 1990
suggests anything, it's that he should never be counted out, only
counted on. The last three seasons are insight into his willingness
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   He won 14 games for playoff-bound Cleveland, won 11 before San
Francisco fell to Chicago in a one-game play-in for the playoffs,
then signed with the Mets during last spring training and tied for
the team lead with 13 wins. The Mets went to the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better this year than I did last year,'' Hershiser
said. ``I went into the Cleveland camp on a nonguaranteed,
minor-league deal, having to impress people to get a job. I had to
go into spring training to perform, not to prepare for a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in 15 years I had to go to spring training
trying to win a job. I had to try to execute all my pitches right
from the get-go and I fell behind because I spent a lot of bullets
just making a team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact that makes many within the organization cringe: The
last time the Dodgers won a playoff game was 1988, when Hershiser
threw the title clincher against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not the same pitcher now as he was in `88. His mental
skills were always an asset, but his physical ability was imposing.
The surgery that cost him nearly all of the '90 season taught him
how to survive without dominating stuff, and now folks around
baseball shake their heads in amazement at how the wiry Hershiser
still wins.
</P>
<P>
   Being the quintessential student of the game, Hershiser honed
his mental skills. Now, his success comes from preying on young and
impatient hitters. Those who exhibit patience are the ones who give
him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel has to rely on his mental ability more so than on his
physical ability, which he probably used more when he was a younger
pitcher,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said. ``The guy finds
a way to win. There's guys with more talent, but he finds a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as he began doing years ago, he's imparting that wisdom to
the Dodgers' younger, and inexperienced, pitchers. Before
Grapefruit League games started, he would hold daily rap sessions
to talk with them. But the games didn't put an end to the meetings,
just the number of pupils he talks to at one time.
</P>
<P>
   After rookie Eric Gagne, in the running for a starting spot and
in the spotlight for the first time, allowed seven runs in his
initial spring outing, Hershiser spent time talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professor in the art of pitching,'' 30-year-old rookie
right-hander Matt Herges said. ``I don't know if he ever plans on
being a coach; I imagine he does. He's maybe getting prepared for
that. And I think he'd be great. He doesn't force anything. He
knows everyone has different mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser is being paid by the Dodgers to be a pitcher _ whether
relief or starter has to be decided. But he brings so much more. He
loves to talk about pitching, or hitting, or the offensive aspect
of the game. He's involved with the players' union and he's
interested in the business side of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's not sure whether he wants to remain in uniform or
trade the cleats and support hose for a suit and tie. When his
playing days end, he'll have his pick. Funny thing, even though the
scenarios and opportunities appear limitless, when Hershiser takes
advantage of them is anyone's guess. &QL;

HASEGAWA GETS TV TIME IN JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa was no different
than many of his teammates during the offseason _ he stayed in
Orange County and worked out in preparation for the 2000 season.
But he also spent six weeks of the winter doing something entirely
different.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa went to his native Japan to be a TV star. Sort of.
Hasegawa signed with an agency that gives him work in television
doing a variety of things. He does commentary on sporting events,
and participates in comedy shows and quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about my future,'' Hasegawa said. ``It's good for
baseball, it's good for my life now and it's good for a little bit
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa said he did 20 programs and one commercial. One of the
shows was a quiz show, in which Hasegawa was a contestant.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The other contestants) were so talented,'' he said. ``It was
nice of them to ask me, but I don't know. I was a little mixed up.
Everybody answered questions but me, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy shows were fun, Hasegawa said, ``but they were so
serious. Same as our job as baseball players.''
</P>
<P>
   SPRING CUTS: Catcher Bryan Graves was reassigned to minor-league
camp in Mesa. Four others _ outfielders Nathan Haynes, Darren
Blakely and Juan Tolentino, and infielder Brian Oliver will spend
their last day in major-league camp today, then report to
minor-league camp Wednesday. &QL;

   Send in the Clippers. They haven't been able to hold a candle to
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the NBA's worst team wasn't clowning around this time,
but when Monday night's final numbers were tallied, the Lakers had
their 16th consecutive victory, a relative cakewalk 123-103 win in
front of 20,385 at Staples Center. According to the custodians of
L.A. hoop history, it was the largest crowd ever to witness a game
in this city.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, O'Neal used many happy returns to the low post,
finishing with a career-high 61 points and 21 rebounds. He made 24
of his 35 rim-roasting field-goal attempts and 13 of 22 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough going against Goliath,'' said interim Clippers
coach Jim Todd, who smiled for this next line. ``I think he could
have stopped at 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal, ``My teammates kept saying, `We're gonna getcha 50,
we're gonna getcha 50.' When I got 50, they said, `We're gonna
getcha 60.' My teammates took care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal demonstrated his gratitude by taking care of the
Clippers. During his postmortem mumble, O'Neal was asked if he was
able to muster of crumb of pity for the vanquished neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   With this triumph, the league's best team equaled the sweet 16
in a row it won between mid-December and mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a 16-game streak in the playoffs,'' said Lakers coach
Phil Jackson, whose crew now has a three-game Pacific Division lead
on the Portland Trail Blazers, who were whipped Monday by the
Toronto Raptors. ``That's the only streak I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (12-48) said ``Uncle!'' for the 30th time in their
last 33 games. And they did it by following the tired Clippers
format.
</P>
<P>
   In the usual preamble to their second-half annihilation, the
Clips really went to town in the first quarter. They achieved their
biggest lead at 27-18 when Maurice Taylor (a team-high 25 points)
nailed a 15-foot jumper from the left baseline with 3:16 left in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi, whose duels with O'Neal often resemble a
surfboard in the path of a tsunami, followed the script by picking
up his third foul with only 4:17 elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Olowokandi in foul trouble,'' said Jackson, illuminating
the obvious, ``they (Clippers) couldn't put a big body out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A night's work for Olowokandi spanned 14 minutes, producing two
points _ on free throws _ and four rebounds. Taylor and Lamar Odom
also failed to escape the first quarter before picking up two picky
fouls apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always get touch fouls,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 10 points and six rebounds from Odom, the Clips led 29-24
entering the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal spent the second quarter matched against Clipper subs
Anthony Avent and Pete Chilcutt, who represent as much resistance
as barnacles on the belly of a cruise ship. O'Neal went for 16
points in the quarter, which ended on a Kobe Bryant runner that
gave the Lakers their first lead, 56-55. Bryant's final line
included 22 points and five of the Lakers' 31 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, by the way, earned his third foul midway through the
period in a less-than-cerebral bid to strip the ball from O'Neal
during the prologue to another slam.
</P>
<P>
   The party favors continued after intermission, as O'Neal pounded
the Clippers for 16 points in the third quarter. Glen Rice added 11
and Bryant contributed nine. Clipper Derek Anderson (21 points) had
nine for the Clippers, who trailed 92-80 heading into the final
stanza.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal continued mugging the Clippers defense, flipping home
points 60 and 61 with just over three minutes to play. Jackson
called off the league's alpha dog with 2:33 remaining before the
mercy of the final horn. He was replaced by Travis Knight, who
looked into the teeth of a Clippers defense that allowed the Lakers
to shoot 61 percent for the game. Knight, who only saw gums,
scored, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the night, the game and the cake belonged to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt pretty good,'' he said of committing absolute
destruction. ``I'm on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   And there appears to be no mercy involved. &QL;

HARPER KNOWS HOW CLIPPER FEEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press Telegram  
LOS ANGELES _ One Laker who's familiar with life on the other side
of L.A.'s tracks is veteran guard Ron Harper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harper spent 4 seasons with the Clippers before hauling away
three championship rings with the Chicago Bulls. He also has some
advice for any young, whiny Clipper looking for the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they don't understand is the grass ain't any greener
someplace else,'' said Harper, who struggled in Chicago as Michael
Jordan's successor until Jordan returned from pro baseball.
``L.A.'s a great place. It's a great city. The one thing they have
to understand is that they have to stick together to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   HORRY SHOW: Aside from providing stellar defense and rebounding,
Lakers sixth man Robert Horry has morphed back into the sniper who
helped the Houston Rockets snag two NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Leading into Monday's game with the Clippers, Horry had made 7
of his previous 14 3-point shots over a five-game span.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson said Horry has been something of a
deadeye since retiring the mask used to protect his broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he got out of that Phantom of the Opera thing, he's
looking pretty good as far as shooting-wise,'' Jackson said of
Horry, whose nose was broken courtesy of a Tim Thomas elbow at
Milwaukee on Jan. 12. ``He's starting to come through again.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RIDE STUFF: On his 28th birthday, at least one of Shaquille
O'Neal's presents truly wasn't accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the most expensive Bentley on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   When a TV reporter asked the Lakers center if his teammates had
pitched in for a birthday gift, O'Neal said each of his teammates
coughed up $50,000 toward the aforementioned luxury sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Including those Lakers on the injured list, the Bentley either
would have had a sticker price of $650,000, or O'Neal would now
possess enough cash to load up on CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Some story, but not true, O'Neal admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he did receive a birthday Bentley green. Shaq said it was a
gift from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   OLD CENTER, NEW STAGE: Life on the other side of the tracks
didn't register any vibe of peculiarity for Clippers assistant
coach Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with the Clippers now really doesn't affect anything,''
said Abdul-Jabbar, who helped sky-hook the Lakers to five NBA
championships in the '80s. But being detached from the Lakers
doesn't mean he's missed what's been going on around the NBA.
``They (Lakers) have about the best team in the league. They
certainly are contenders to win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW CENTER, OLD STAGE: Clippers center Michael Olowokandi still
responds with a nervous chuckle when the subject of any inquiry
leads to his matchup with O'Neal. But at least now he has what
should be Yoda-caliber advice from Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem said `keep him out of the paint,''' Olowokandi, still
chuckling, said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to keep down low and push him off the block,''
Olowokandi added. ``That'll be the game plan for tonight.
Hopefully, when he (O'Neal) gets too deep, you can get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy may need some fine tuning. Olowokandi was assessed
three personal fouls in the first 4:17 of Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN AND OUT: The Clippers, who already have Eric Murdock and
Brian Skinner on the injured list with ankle problems, didn't suit
up Keith Closs and Troy Hudson. Closs continues to have lower-back
problems; Hudson's stomach ailment will be checked out by a doctor
today. &QL;

GONZAGA STOPS PEPPERDINE, WINS WCC TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ When Gonzaga called on the Calvary,
Pepperdine turned to its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Calvary _ Bulldogs forward Casey Calvary _ won
out. As a result, it's Gonzaga who will charge into the NCAA
Tournament after beating the Waves 69-65 in overtime Monday to win
the West Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's win secures a coveted automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament, beginning March 16. Pepperdine's fate rests in the
hands of the NCAA Tournament committee. The Waves, who won the
regular-season conference title, felt coming in they'd earn an
at-large berth by reaching the final here.
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory they didn't want to test, but now they can only
hope it bears out. The conference has sent two teams to the
tournament just six times in its 45-year history, the last coming
in 1996 when Portland and Santa Clara advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the final was Calvary, who had 25 points and
seven rebounds. He had two points in overtime and a key offensive
rebound and kickout pass to Richie Frahm, who nailed a 3-pointer to
put Gonzaga ahead 66-58 with 3:52 left.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine got 17 points from reserve guard Craig Lewis, who
pulled the Waves to within 68-65 on a 3-pointer with 2:18 left. But
Pepperdine never scored again, despite three shot attempts,
including Tezale Archie's 3-point try with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a transition period, looking over to the coach to get
a play, and not everybody knew what the play was,'' Archie said.
``The clock was running down, I tried to create, but I wasn't able
to get (a good) shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary started the second half with nine quick points, giving
the Bulldogs a 50-42 lead. But the Waves, who fell behind by 14 in
the first half, got back in it on Lewis' jumper to make it 55-54
with six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Sheppard tied the game 58-58 with 43 seconds left.
Pepperdine had a chance to win it, but Archie misfired on a wild
jumper to in the closing seconds to send it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (24-8) led 38-34 at halftime after leading by as
many as 14 points. Gonzaga opened a 35-21 lead with 5:19 left in
the half when Ryan Floyd shook free for a 3-pointer, his second of
the game. Floyd hurt the Waves throughout the first half, scoring
13 points to lead the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just Floyd. Gonzaga's two big forwards Calvary and
Zach Gourde continually outworked the Waves inside. Calvary
finished the half with 12 points and Gourde, a freshman reserve,
had six.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine got little offense outside of Archie for the first 16
minutes. He kept them in the game with three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was Brandon Armstrong's foul trouble.
Armstrong, the Waves' leading scorer, picked up two less then three
minutes in and wasn't a factor, playing just six minutes and
missing his only field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Waves kept chipping away, using their depth to wear
the Bulldogs down and cut into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs hit two short jumpers in the paint to make it
36-28. Then Al Minihan hit a 3-pointer to make it 36-31, followed
by a Lewis 3-pointer to pull Pepperdine within 36-34 with 40
seconds left, completing a 15-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga finished the half shooting 57.4 percent from the field.
Pepperdine, after a slow start, wound up shooting 13 of 29 (44.8)
after it's late spurt. &QL;

FISET OUT WITH GROIN INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just days after it appeared he would be the Kings' starting
goaltender in the playoffs, Stephane Fiset was place on injured
reserve with a strained right groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, hurt during the second period of Saturday's 3-2 victory
over Nashville, will miss at least three games and probably more.
The groin, however, is not torn, which could have sidelined Fiset
for the rest of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr, who has shared the job with Fiset throughout this
injury-plagued season, will start tonight when the Kings play host
to the Detroit Red Wings at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job isn't to think about who the top goalie is,'' Storr
said. ``My job is to prepare to play when my name is called. It
doesn't matter if it is the second game or the 70th.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Cousineau, the top goaltender at minor-league Long Beach,
practiced with the club on Monday and will be Storr's backup.
</P>
<P>
   Storr suffered a similar injury during the opening week of the
season. He also missed a month with a concussion. Fiset was out for
more than six weeks after taking a shot off his right hand before
the Nov. 6 game against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   When Storr struck the back of his head on the crossbar in
Montreal on Dec. 11, Fiset was not ready to return. But coach Andy
Murray stuck him in three nights later after Storr faltered against
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of confidence in Jamie,'' Murray said. ``We've
said all along that it takes two goaltenders to get through a
season. This is the proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither goaltender has clearly outplayed the other,
Murray has gone with Fiset in six of the last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset is 16-15-5 in 40 games with a 2.92 goals-against average.
Storr set a career high for victories this season with a 14-10-3
record.
</P>
<P>
   When Storr returned from his concussion in late January, Fiset
was rested and given a chance to tinker with his mechanics in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch Storr was named NHL Player of the Week. But
he did not consistently play well and lost the top spot when Fiset
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely want to be in there, but the most important
thing is what's best for the team,'' Storr said. ``This is an
important stretch coming up. Whether it is Steph or me, we will get
the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK WHISTLES: Bryan Smolinski, who also left the Nashville
game with a second-period injury (corneal abrasion), will be back
in the lineup tonight. Smolinski's vision cleared quickly Sunday
when the Kings did not practice.... Smolinski's second line is
expected to stay the same against Detroit, with rookie Jason Blake
at forward and Donald Audette as a healthy scratch. ... Phillippe
Boucher, who has missed the entire season after undergoing foot
surgery, participated in his first practice of the year Monday.
Boucher probably won't play this season, but could participate in a
workout program this summer in Europe. &QL;

 &HT;    WITH MORE AT STAKE THAN EVER, CENSUS BEGINS ITS DIFFICULT TASK
 &HT;    With CENSUS-RACEMIX, CENSUS-HARDTOREACH, CENSUS-NEW and
CENSUS-FACTS. For release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Check the mailbox. Something's coming that could
change your life. Millions of dollars are at stake, not to mention
power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about the Publishers Clearinghouse
sweepstakes, but the U.S. census.
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 years, as it has since U.S. marshals combed the new
nation on horseback in 1790, the government conducts a head count
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Questionnaires for the 2000 census are going out this month in
advance of April 1, the date known as Census Day.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a dull exercise, but every question is
mandated by Congress and has a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The results help determine how you are represented in Congress
and the state legislature, how federal and state money is
distributed to your city and school district, and where developers
might build the next subdivision, shopping mall or bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires the census as the way to determine how
the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are distributed among
the 50 states. The numbers also are applied to federal grant
programs, roughly $180 billion a year in money that Washington
distributes among the states.
</P>
<P>
   There are some firsts in the 2000 census. Reflecting America's
growing diversity, for the first time people can check more than
one box to indicate their race. Also for the first time, people can
file their census questionnaire via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era of telecommuting and smart-card shopping, the
census remains a labor-intensive task. The Census Bureau is hiring
500,000 full-time and part-time workers to fill nearly 900,000
jobs, with some workers filling several jobs before the task is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Before it's over, they will have counted about 120 million
households, or 275 million residents. And while much of it will be
accomplished by super-fast computers, they'll have made a lot of
trash _ more than 20 million maps needed for field work and 1.5
billion piece of paper moved in the process.
</P>
<P>
   This temporary army of census workers is up against some
powerful forces: public resentment of the government and people's
concerns over whether their answers are truly confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bulk-mail factor. ``We worry a lot about the
questionnaire simply not being opened because it gets lost amid the
junk mail,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in the census this year will hit a record low, the
government predicts. The Census Bureau expects only 61 percent of
households to return the form mailed or hand-delivered to homes.
Census workers will continue follow-up calls and visits through
early July trying to find those who do not respond initially.
</P>
<P>
   But their job has become more complicated. The rise in the
numbers of two-earner households means that people often are not
home when the census workers come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that people no longer consider participation in the
census as a patriotic duty and that a growing distrust of
government makes them less likely to want to reply. The rapid
growth of America's immigrant population, for many of whom English
is a second language, means there are millions of residents who are
confused by or scared of the forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau detected a significant drop in its count 20
years ago when mail response rates fell to 75 percent, from a 78
percent rate in 1970. In 1990, the slide became steeper, down to
only 65 percent, meaning that roughly one of every three households
failed to respond to the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is the fact that the count of minorities
traditionally has been less accurate than that of whites.
Historically, blacks and other minorities have been wary of the
government and less likely to respond to the census. Furthermore,
in low-income areas the distrust of government and census takers'
fear of crime may have reduced the count's accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The steadily worsening results prompted the Census Bureau this
year to mount its first-ever paid advertising campaign on
prime-time TV and develop an extensive promotional effort involving
clergy, teachers, elected officials and other community leaders in
thousands of neighborhoods across America to inform people of the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critical that people know what this is and that they do
not throw it away,'' said Karen Narasaki, executive director of the
National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, an advocacy group
for Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities were undercounted by a rate of more than 2 to 1
compared with whites in the 1990 census. Children made up more than
half of the 4 million people who were missed in the count, meaning
that states and cities that often need the help most were
shortchanged when government aid was distributed over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were the consequences to our community? Simple. We lost
out on money and power,'' said Maria Demeo of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only minority groups and special-interest
organizations who are pushing their people for a better count.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, recognizing that many of its citizens head south to
spend the winter in resort homes, is urging them to file their
census forms from their northern address. The state has launched a
public-relations campaign and has distributed pamphlets in Arizona
and Florida urging people to wait and file their forms from their
homes in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Southern and Western states suffered the most in the 1990
census. Because their populations are growing and shifting faster,
they were more difficult to count and thus more likely to be
missed. Had the 1990 been adjusted for the undercount later
detected, Georgia, California and Montana each would have gained an
additional congressional seat at the expense of Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of 15 federal grant programs by the
U.S. Government Accounting Office, about $384 million more would
have gone to states in the South and West in 1998 that instead went
to states in the North and Midwest. Over the decade, that comes to
more than $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court last year also raised the
stakes. The court forbade the Census Bureau from using statistical
models to fill the projected gaps in the undercount for the
purposes of reapportioning congressional districts, making the 2000
count perhaps the most closely watched and politically charged
ever.
</P>
<P>
   By late March, most people will have received their form in the
mail, or by hand delivery in rural areas. About 83 percent of
households receive the ``short'' form of only eight basic
questions: name, sex, age, race, Hispanic origin, relationship to
others living in home, rent or own, and phone number.
</P>
<P>
   One in six households will receive a ``long'' form of 53
questions. The long form is used to find out detailed information
about housing, income, health and other social characteristics.
Scientific sampling techniques are applied to this information to
draw conclusions about the wider population.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall, all field work will be concluded and, under law,
the Census Bureau must report the total U.S. population by state to
president by Dec. 31. States receive more detailed data by April 1,
2001, on which to base the redrawing of legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   While it's just getting under way, the Census Bureau's huge
operation has not been flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a computer error by a private printer doing
work for the Census Bureau resulted in wrong addresses being
affixed to more than 100 million advance letters being sent to
households to inform them that the census form would follow.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a General Accounting Office report raised questions
about whether the sophisticated computers to tabulate the census
data will be ready. The Census Bureau contends that the system will
be fully tested and operational.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, the census director, said the agency has done all it
can to guarantee a thorough count.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, it is simply up to people to answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the form arrives, the responsibility shifts from the
government to the people,'' Prewitt said. ``This is the moment of
truth.''

 &HT;    CENSUS MAKING SPECIAL PUSH TO REACH THE HARD-TO-REACH
 &HT;    With CENSUS. For release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People unlikely to fill out the Census 2000
questionnaire are a diverse group _ ethnic minorities and
anti-government militiamen, native Americans on reservations and
the upper-class residents of gated communities.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply busy working parents who just can't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a better result this year than in the last census in
1990, the Census Bureau has mounted a sophisticated marketing and
advertising campaign intended to reach people who are less likely
to respond to the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   In planning its ad blitz, the Census Bureau and its ad agency
turned to existing demographic data on civic participation _ the
types of people who do and don't get involved in their local PTA,
those who try to avoid jury duty and those who do it even though
they don't necessarily want to.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they identified three distinct groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Will mail the questionnaire back. About 40 percent of the
population, these people tend to be older, middle-class,
white-collar homeowners. They are familiar with the census and its
benefits. This group includes all races, but because it is
predominately white, it suffers less of an undercount than
minorities and new-immigrant ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ May get to it or not. The largest group, at 43 percent of the
population, these people tend to be middle-class Americans of all
races who feel no compelling reason to respond to the form. They
have at least a high school education and are primarily blue-collar
and service-industry workers. The Census Bureau hopes to convince
these people that it is in their interest to respond.
</P>
<P>
   _ The disaffected. The third group, at 17 percent, are the
people unlikely to fill out the form at all, including people from
a range of ethnic groups that have been undercounted in the past:
blacks, Hispanics, native Americans and others highly distrustful
of government. These groups are being targeted with print, radio
and TV ads that are tailored to their ethnic market and which
reinforce the message that the answers remain confidential. In
inner cities and high-crime areas, the Census Bureau will send out
``blitz teams'' of counters traveling together. The Census Bureau
also will make special efforts to count homeless people and illegal
aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire is being printed in six languages _ English,
Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean. Guidebooks to
filling out the form are available in 49 languages other than
English. In neighborhoods across America, the Census Bureau will
operate 60,000 assistance centers.

   WHAT'S NEW IN THE 2000 CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, people can file their census questionnaires
via the Census Bureau's Web site (www.census.gov). To file by the
Web, people use the 22-digit number printed on their census form as
a password.
</P>
<P>
   But census officials are not promoting the fact, mainly because
their operation is geared for the paper forms. So only about 8
million households out of a total 120 million are expected to take
advantage of cyber-census filing this year. In the future, the
Census Bureau plans to expand filing by the Web.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTEST SHORT FORM
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau cut the size of the short form _ which five of
every six households will receive _ to just eight questions, from
13 in 1990. Five questions related to housing were moved to the
long form. It is the shortest short form in history, intended to
make it easier and more likely to be filled out. It should take no
more than 10 minutes to complete the form.
</P>
<P>
   GRANDPARENTS AS CAREGIVERS
</P>
<P>
   A new question posed by the census _ No. 19 on the long form _
seeks to determine how many grandparents provide the bulk of
support and are primary caregivers for their grandchildren. As with
all items on the census questionnaire, it was put there by Congress
and intended to provide government with a better picture of who is
taking care of the nation's children. The question, in three parts,
asks: Are your grandchildren living in your house or apartment? Is
the grandparent responsible for the most basic needs of the
grandchildren? How long has the grandparent been responsible for
the grandchildren? The answers could have a bearing on the
distribution of government aid and legal issues involving child
care and children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   TO ADJUST OR NOT TO ADJUST?
</P>
<P>
   This is the most expensive and complex census in history. One
reason is a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1999 that forbids the use
of statistical sampling to compensate for the inevitable undercount
of the population. The Supreme Court said that the apportionment of
seats in Congress, the main reason the government counts people
every 10 years, cannot be based on sampling, which applies
scientific calculations to estimate the number and characteristics
of those people missed by the census.
</P>
<P>
   So the Census Bureau is making extensive efforts to count every
man, woman and child to come up with its unadjusted total. It will
also produce adjusted figures based on sampling _ widely consider
more accurate _ for the use of states who want them.
</P>
<P>
   States may be able to use the adjusted figures to help draw new
state legislative districts and for formulas governing the
distribution of federal and state money. But more lawsuits are
expected to be filed on the issue, which may compel the Supreme
Court to clarify its earlier ruling.

 &HT;    MULTI-RACE CENSUS OPTIONS LEAVE SOME GROUPS WORRIED
 &HT;    With CENSUS. For release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a nation where celebrities such as Tiger Woods
and Mariah Carey represent the increasingly multiracial face of
America, the government is adjusting to diversity.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the 2000 census form arriving at homes
across the country this month allows people to identify themselves
as a combination of races by choosing as many races as they wish
from 12 check boxes and three write-in spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The results will give the Census Bureau data on 63 different
possible racial categories, plus a separate category for those of
Hispanic origin that blurs the potential combinations even further,
to 126.
</P>
<P>
   It is a multiple choice many racial and ethnic groups do not
want their members to make.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing their communities could lose money and clout, groups
representing African Americans, Asian Americans and American
Indians are encouraging people to choose only one box.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all know from the recent TV movie about Sally Hemings,
most African Americans are a mixture of many things and could check
a number of boxes,'' said William Spriggs, policy director for the
National Urban League. ``This is not a matter of ethnic pride, this
is a matter of accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Spriggs and other black leaders worry that the multi-box options
could reduce the overall number of African Americans and
potentially weaken the enforcement of civil rights laws, fair
employment practices and social service funding distributed on the
basis of census data.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a particular county in Mississippi that was majority
black, these numbers could be 40 percent black and 18 percent
something else. That in turn could mean no more federal oversight
of civil rights laws. That's the kind of concern we have in how
these numbers are tallied,'' said Spriggs.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the fears, the Census Bureau has not yet decided how the
racial data will be tabulated and, more important, the Clinton
administration has not determined how the results will be applied
to federal programs that shape political power and the distribution
of government money.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear. The results of the 2000 census on race will
not be directly comparable to the last census in 1990, which asked
people to check only one box.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials predict that no more than 2 percent of the
population, or about 5 million people, will check more than one
box. The rates will be higher in larger cities, they believe.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 census ``dress rehearsal,'' 5.4 percent of the
residents in Sacramento, Calif., checked more than one box, while
fewer than 1 percent of the people in Columbia, S.C., listed
themselves as more than one race.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget mandated the
change as a way to reflect the growing diversity of America.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1990, the number of interracial marriages ballooned
from 100,000 to 1.5 million. In the same period, the number of
children from mixed marriages quadrupled to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The country's booming immigrant population suggests that the
trend will accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, this census question may become meaningless,'' said
Carl Haub, an expert with the Population Reference Bureau, a
non-profit demographics research organization. ``The definitions
may blur racial lines to the extent that it just doesn't matter
what you are.''

Hispanic origin, how many people live with you, rent or own, your
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Questions on the long form: 35, including the basics of the
short form plus details such as how you live, work, commute, the
state of your health, education, what your earn, and the value and
size of your home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workers hired to conduct the census: about 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maps needed for field work: more than 20 million,
</P>
<P>
   _ Sheets of paper to be processed: 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cost of the count: about $4.8 billion, more than twice the
cost of the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the results will be in: The Census Bureau must report the
population totals to the president by Dec. 31 for purposes of
apportioning congressional districts to the states. By April 1,
2001, states will receive their population counts for the purposes
of redrawing state legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The money at stake: census numbers guide the allocation of
about $180 billion in federal spending each year.

 &HT;    Times have changed, but not that much

<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Gasoline was a major concern for teens back
in the early '50s. It cost 17-cents a gallon, and we often ran out.
Guys, I found out years later, used jalopy-pushing as a determiner
of true love. If their girlfriend helped, it was the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of dating, even in those days, was not always
affordable. Movies were 50-cents, popcorn and Cokes a dime each.
Kids who were lucky enough to be going steady could share.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie it was drive-in time. Hamburgers were a quarter
and milkshakes 15-cents. If your date was flush, he'd spring for
fries - an extra 10-cents. Saturday nights could easily end up
costing a guy $2.25 - big bucks for a working stiff earning
35-cents an hour bagging groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline was something else. Guys seemed to spend even more time
calculating gas money than they did worrying the shine on their
penny loafers. ``I got 18-cents left over from my lunch money,''
one would say checking the change in his jeans pocket. ``I've got a
dime,'' the second volunteers adding, ``It's supposed to be for
notebook paper but I'll borrow from Trudy.'' Another says he's
busted.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, four or five guys would be standing around the
cafeteria door, palms up, counting change. Their calculations would
have made the math teacher proud.''Okay,'' the leader (usually the
driver) says, ``we've got 39-cents, a little over two gallons. At
18-miles to the gallon, I figure we can either go cruising tonight
or to the beach tomorrow.'' Tough choice.
</P>
<P>
   Few boys had cars in those days, and even fewer girls. Once in a
while, a generous parent would turn us loose with the family
flivver - after a 30-minute lecture on road safety and
tire-squealing. Those deals usually included gas money since, no
matter what we teenagers thought, our folks weren't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to have to tow us home _ like Ruthie's mother
did the night seven of us, without permission and in our pajamas,
piled into Bobby Johnson's momma's '39 Dodge for a midnight cruise
around the old hometown and ran dry 14
</P>
<P>
   miles from where we were supposed to be _ which was at a slumber
party on Ruthie's screened porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be neat,'' somebody had suggested, ``if we drove
to the beach and went wading in our pajamas?'' Yeah, we all agreed.
Neat-O. We made it out there all right, but on the way back the
Dodge gulped its last 40 drops and stranded us in the middle of the
Rickenbacker Causeway.
</P>
<P>
   No gas. No money. No telephone. Just us and the land crabs. We
tried pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Ever try to push a '39 Dodge? Built like a Sherman tank and
weighs about the same. All we got for our efforts were bare feet
full of sandspurs and a load of frustration. We did the only thing
left to do - we crawled back into the car and cried.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the policeman found us _ seven hysterical 16-year-old
girls in pajamas jammed into a stolen car (Bobby Johnson, we later
learned, had forgotten to mention to his momma that he'd loaned out
her car), picking sandspurs out of their feet and laying odds on
being found in time for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   We must have been a pitiful sight by the time Ruthie's mom came
to fetch us, sitting there on the side of the road picking and
crying. Neither she nor the policeman laughed although I'm sure it
was tempting.
</P>
<P>
   This morning the sign on the Sunoco station uptown reads: Self
Serve Reg. 159.9.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking if this keeps up guys are going to have to go back
to marrying the girl next door because they won't be able to afford
gas money to look any farther.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks a lot, OPEC. You've stuck it to us again.

 &HT;    Conference on race barely taps people's desire to talk
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If we talked in terms of dinosaur DNA, we might
get people's attention. Except all we're talking about in the case
here is people, and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable number of Waco residents gave up a part of their
Sunday last weekend to talk about it, to make the choice that
Martin Luther King Jr. said we must, between ``chaos and
community.''
</P>
<P>
   They chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The ``chaos theory'' is what caused ``Jurassic Park'' to get
bloody _ the rule that forces left untended manage to go awry even
with the best of designs.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco as in most communities, we think of race relations as
yesterday's news. Discrimination by government or business is
prohibited, right? So all we need to to is make sure the streets
are passable, the police are on call, education and jobs are
available, right? All will be well as we reside in our neutral
corners. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Not even close. Chaos or community. In our indifference and
drift and through our actions we've affirmed that the consensus
choice is anything but community.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some far-seeing people assembled the first Dialogue
on Race Relations last year, and a first-anniversary event last
Sunday. Good news: Though the forces of chaos still have the
numbers, the numbers at this event were up from 150 registrants
last year to 220 this year. Indeed, they approached standing
room-only in the University High School cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing sentiment? Frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration wasn't with the people or subject matter. The
frustration was that with so many participants and so little time,
passionate and rewarding discussions were cut short. People of will
and goodwill were left begging for more. Which is good.
</P>
<P>
   For if they think it's worth pursuing this type of dialogue,
they have the power and opportunity to continue it.
</P>
<P>
   One of many small-group discussions focused on something Waco
public television station KCTF will be coordinating: a set of study
circles to discuss social issues. A study circle is composed of
eight to 12 individuals and meets regularly over a period of weeks.
It progresses from personal issues to broader issues and to
community responses.
</P>
<P>
   Over 100 communities are in various stages of this initiative
with assistance from the Study Circles Resource Center in Pomfret,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the teaspoonful of most-stimulating sharing among a
study-circle discussion group Sunday, this idea can bring out
personal and communal revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Another opportunity, one hopes, for personal and communal
discovery is that more people in Waco see the video, ``The Color of
Fear.'' A handful of people saw an excerpt Sunday, and if there's
one of them who didn't want to see the rest of it, that person has
Crazy Glue instead of ear wax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color of Fear'' is not something for a captive audience. It is
for people who want to be challenged, as a group of eight men does
in an excruciating, real-life encounter of their own fears and
prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   The video is like volatile chemicals best handled by
professionals. It comes with provisos about how best to present it,
along with workshops and training for presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University social work lecturer Helen Harris said that
groups or businesses interested in the film could contact her or
producers Stir-Fry Productions, (800) 370-STIR. Be advised, this no
$3.50 Blockbuster rental. It is expensive. But for organizations
interested in changing attitudes, is it a worthwhile investment.
</P>
<P>
   So often the adage is right, that talk is cheap. Not in this
case. Talk is of the essence, the essence of community.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Got a zit? Zappers offer overnight cure
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The uninvited guests at the party of
life, pimples have a way of showing up at the most inopportune
times.
</P>
<P>
   Like when you've scored the big date, landed the important job
interview or scheduled a sitdown for your yearbook photo.
</P>
<P>
   Now skin-care companies are asking the zit-ridden to sleep on
their complexion problems, with the debut of nighttime ``blemish
bombs'' and ``acne patches'' that you stick on trouble spots before
you go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight Blemish Reducers by Pond's Institute contain
skin-friendly Vitamin E, rosemary and tea tree oil, as well as
salicylic acid, which helps unclog pores. A package of 24 clear
dots costs $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   The Biore Blemish Bomb uses salicylic acid and Panthenol
(pro-vitamin B5), which reduces redness. The Bomb costs $6.99 for
10 single-use packets (each packet can treat up to four blemishes).
</P>
<P>
   Both products promise results overnight, but acne experts aren't
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of salicylic acid have been known for many years,
says Patricia Farris, a New Orleans dermatologist and board member
of the American Academy of Dermatology, but these new products
sound more like ``a marketing gimmick than an actual zit buster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have little effect overnight,'' Farris says. ``I
don't think they're the magic bullet for cysts.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not much hope for a 24-hour cure at home, she says.
Benzoyl peroxide, available in many over-the-counter acne formulas,
is a good antibacterial agent but doesn't work that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to send a zit packing? An injection of diluted
cortisone from a dermatologist, Farris says.

 &HT;    Found bottle from afar uncorks youthful enthusiasm
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Nov. 19, a class of second-graders
from Red Bay Primary School in the Cayman Islands wrote their names
and the titles of their favorite storybooks on slips of paper,
corked them up in an emerald-green bottle, and dropped the bottle
in the ocean, not knowing where the bottle would go, or even if it
would be found.
</P>
<P>
   You'll never guess in a million years were the bottle ended up
three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Give up?
</P>
<P>
   With more second-graders. Last week, when Pam Langford,
second-grade teacher at Meadow Park Elementary School in West Palm
Beach, was fishing 8 miles off Palm Beach with her husband, Mike,
she saw a sparkling green bottle bobbing in the waves and plucked
it out of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A story like this is simply too exciting to trust to a grown-up,
who can make anything boring, so I went straight to the school and
asked the second-graders to tell me in their own words what was
going on. When I asked questions, the children answered in such
eager, high-pitched voices that when I typed their responses, they
came out in italics.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the bottle come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was from Grand Cayman.''
</P>
<P>
   How far is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 500 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It started Nov. 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is Grand Cayman?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down there by Mexico and the bottle floated all the way
around Cuba and Mrs. Langford picked it up and it had all kinds of
shells and things stuck to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it smelled real bad!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we couldn't get the messages out so we stuck a piece of
wire inside and twisted it around until they came out.''
</P>
<P>
   What was inside the bottle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Notes about the children's favorite storybooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Whose favorite storybooks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Cayman second -graders. They took a vote on `Wombat
Stew' and `Mr. Grumpy's Outing'.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the best?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wombat Stew! Wombat Stew! Gooey, brewy, yummy, chewy, wombat
stew!''
</P>
<P>
   Is that your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   It was, by a vote of 27 to 1. ``Mr. Grumpy's Outing,'' second
choice of both classes, was about a farmer who went for a boat ride
on his pond, and when all his animals insisted on going along, the
boat capsized, and they ended up swimming ashore and going to the
farmer's house for a cup of tea. ``Wombat Stew'' is about a dingo
in Australia who catches a fat wombat for a stew, but first he
makes the stew using suggestions by all the other animals like mud
by the platypus and bugs by the emu, and when he tastes it, he
spits it out because he thinks he's poisoned, and the fat wombat
runs away.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher explained: ``We hadn't read those books, but they
were in the library. So we read them, and now we have written
letters to the Grand Cayman students, and we are mailing them
today.''
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't mail them before I got a peek at some of the
letters, each addressed to a Grand Cayman child in Mrs. Rankine's
Red Bay Primary School. And although all the letters were
interesting, the chattiest was by Holly of West Palm Beach, writing
to her new pen pal, Holly Ann of Grand Cayman:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Holly Ann,
</P>
<P>
   Our teacher found the bottle while she was fishing.
</P>
<P>
   I have some queshtons.
</P>
<P>
   What color is your hair? What color is your skin? And what color
is your eyes? Do you wear glases? What is your favorite food? I
have blond hair, blue eyes and peach skin. May be we cold be pen
pals. I am in 2nd grade. My favorite color is blue. What is your's?
Pleas write back.
</P>
<P>
   from Holly.
</P>
<P>
   I also liked Kevin's note to Wesley: What kind of video gamed do
you play? Well if you have Pokemon careds please wright back to me.
If you can get some pitjchers of you so I can see what you look
like and I'll get some pitcher of my self so you can see what I
look like.
</P>
<P>
   The address of the second-graders is Red Bay Primary School, Box
380 SAV, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, B.W.I., and I'm betting that
the West Indian students from first through sixth grades would
enjoy hearing from any South Florida students who would like a
foreign pen pal. And now, in case anybody is wondering what
happened to the emerald-green bottle, I was wondering that, too,
when I asked to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Langford threw it away!'' a chorus of Meadow Park
second-graders cheerfully informed me.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too stinky!
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was yucky!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, I thought, but I would have been quite happy to put a
clothespin on my nose if I could hold a bottle and think that it
had drifted all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, around Cuba and
up into the Gulf Stream with messages from children in another
country.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Irradiating solid foods safe, but there are
still naysayers
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If the news media had transmitted hysteria as
effectively in the mid-1800s as they do now, 19th century crusaders
might have saved the world from the evils of pasteurized milk.
</P>
<P>
   There was opposition then to the process of heating liquid foods
to kill the micro-organisms responsible for spreading many
diseases, just as there is opposition now to the use of ionizing
energy for the same purpose on solid foods.
</P>
<P>
   This opposition is based largely on unfortunate terminology.
``Food irradiation'' conjures up images of glowing green stomachs
and mushroom-cloud explosions that might have been avoided by
``food ionization.'' But whatever irradiation's detractors lack in
clarity, they make up in volume.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
irradiating raw beef, pork and lamb to prevent foodborne illnesses.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture determined E. coli
0157 is more prevalent in cattle than previously believed, calling
attention to inadequacies in the inspection process.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation eradicates E. coli and eliminates virtually all
listeria, salmonella and other pathogens responsible for food
poisoning. Foodborne illnesses strike as many as 80 million
Americans a year with unpleasant symptoms commonly known as
``stomach flu.'' They kill about 9,000, mostly the very young, very
old and those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Food that's irradiated passes through a low-dose radioactive
field of cobalt-60 gamma rays without touching anything
radioactive, similar to dental X-rays. The process disrupts cell
function of bacteria so they cannot reproduce to harmful levels, as
its proponents describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat and white potatoes have been irradiated since the
mid-1960s, spices and dry vegetable seasoning since 1983 and fresh
fruits since 1986. In fruits, irradiation has helped extend shelf
life and reduce the use of pest-killing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   It does not make food radioactive. It does not use elements that
can explode or be used in making a nuclear weapon. All the nuclear
waste from used cobalt-60 would fit in an office desk, says the
American Dietetic Association's position paper.
</P>
<P>
   Medical equipment is routinely irradiated for sterile surgery.
Astronauts and hospital patients with depleted immune systems have
eaten irradiated food for years. Food irradiation is used in 27
other countries, including Canada, Japan, France and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irradiation has been studied more extensively than any other
food-preservation process, including canning, freezing, dehydration
and chemical additives,'' says the American Council on Science and
Health. Warning labels are required on all irradiated food, but the
ACSH encourages food companies to advertise the labels, the way
they alert consumers that something is ``calcium fortified.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Public Health Association, ADA, American Medical
Association and university-based Food Safety Consortium also
endorse irradiation. Most favor expanding irradiation to precooked
meat products.
</P>
<P>
   Its organized opponents tend to be those against everything
nuclear or governmental and those who bow to everything natural,
forgetting, for example, that the reason farmers use pesticides is
that with all their drawbacks, they're usually preferable to the
bugs they kill.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern for nuclear safety hazards might make sense if
trucks routinely spilled radioactive waste and ``The Simpsons''
were a documentary. They complain that chemical changes in
irradiated food haven't been adequately researched, but also that
there's no sure method to tell if food has been irradiated, so
slight are the chemical changes.
</P>
<P>
   If irradiated food is harmful, it's a wonder that mankind has
survived all these centuries of eating cooked food.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical changes produced by irradiation are identical to
the ones from cooking, steaming, roasting and pasteurization, the
ADA says. Nutrient losses are small and ``often substantially
less'' than from canning, drying and pasteurizing.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation isn't a cure-all for foodborne illness. It can't
reverse spoilage that has begun. Healthy animals, sanitary
processing and handling of food and adequate cooking still are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   As research continues, better methods might turn up. Cal Poly
Pomona scientists announced a promising technique last week for
using a natural protein in cows' milk to starve bacteria in meat.
After years of research, maybe some day experts will consider it as
safe as irradiation.

 &HT;    Hair loss a question of timing and amount
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ A little black cloud hangs over the head of
just about every man imaginable. It evokes worry, panic and even
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Most men try not to think about it. Few talk about it. But
ignoring it won't make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   Hair loss. It causes no known medical complications, but it can
cause emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 96 percent of men demonstrate some natural progression of
hair loss after puberty, according to Dr. Valerie Laing, a
dermatologist with Boice-Willis Clinic in Rocky Mount. Some men
don't notice it until 30 years later. Others see visible signs of
hair loss in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier hair loss begins, the greater the eventual loss,
Laing said. It's most common for men to lose the hair on the top of
their head and around the temples.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic and hormonal factors play a role in hair loss. While it
can't be prevented, in most cases, hair loss can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Few men refuse to sit quietly and watch their hair thin. Many
men wage war against hair loss. Their first mode of attack -
Rogaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men will try an over-the-counter product, such as
Rogaine, first,'' said Dr. Fiona Cook, an endocrinologist with
Physicians East in Greenville. ``If that doesn't work as well as
they would have liked, they'll visit their family physician. Not
for hair loss, per se, but for some other reason. The hair loss
often comes up as a 'by the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rogaine is a topical application that can be bought at any
pharmacy. It's effective, but not as effective as the prescription
drug Propecia, according to Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Propecia has been known to slow down hair loss, prevent further
hair loss and in some cases help regrow hair. It usually takes
three to 12 months before men start to see results. Its most common
side effect is decreased sexual drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other hair loss treatments include scalp reductions, weaves and
hair transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Most times, though, surgery is the last resort. People will
often experiment with wigs and hairpieces first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer than popping a pill or going under the knife,''
said Dennis Cobb, co-owner of Downtown Wig Mart in Wilson with his
wife, So Young. ``They may be costly, but wigs and hairpieces are
still cheaper than a prescription or an operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigs and hairpieces at Downtown Wig Mart cost between $24 and
$200. Of the two, wigs are more popular, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just slip them on and go. Hairpieces, on the other hand,
have to match the color of one's hair exactly. Otherwise, they'll
look funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Men aren't the only ones afflicted with hair loss. Up to 79
percent of women demonstrate some natural progression of hair loss
after puberty, according to Laing. Visible signs of female hair
loss rarely begin before menopause or age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors view female hair loss as more serious than male hair
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Male pattern baldness in women isn't normal. Actually, it's
pretty rare,'' Cook said. ``When we see it, we often worry about an
abnormal male hormone level in women.''
</P>
<P>
   In women, hair loss usually occurs on the top of the head. While
Propecia is effective in treating hair loss in men, it isn't
appropriate for women, especially women of child-bearing age. The
drug is potentially harmful to a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Cook advises women suffering from hair loss to visit their
family physician for an evaluation, so an appropriate method of
treatment can be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair loss is painless. But it does can cause emotional
distress,'' Cook said. ``The earlier it's caught, the earlier you
can begin treatment and get on with your life.''

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE _ I grew up in
Sudan, a small West Texas town where farmers still crawl into their
weather-beaten pickup trucks and putter snail-like into town down
narrow, two-lane blacktop. My grandpa was one of those farmers, and
like the others, he was bound to the rich, dry ground through a

 &HT;    Home security doesn't have to be expensive
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ People pay thousands of dollars to have
alarm systems installed in their homes. But, while alarm systems
deter crime, not everyone can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't, Yvette Jones, Rocky Mount Police
Department's crime prevention technician, cites several inexpensive
steps people can take to protect their homes against invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a deadbolt lock, buy one,'' Jones said.
``Otherwise, burglars won't think twice about kicking your door in.
You might invest in additional locks for your windows, too. Some
people buy what's called a drill and pin packet. This lock actually
secures the two window panes together so an intruder can't break
the glass, unlatch the lock and lift up the bottom pane. It can
present a fire hazard, however, so if you have small children, it's
probably better that you don't use this method.''
</P>
<P>
   Burglars look for poorly lit areas to hide themselves so they
can sneak into a home. Exterior lighting around the perimeter of a
house helps prevent break-ins, as does trimming nearby bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars hide themselves in tall bushes and climb into homes
through windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overgrown areas send direct messages to burglars,'' Jones
said. ``It tells them that the people who own the house probably
don't spend a great deal of time at home. It also tells them that
they'll probably be able to find some easy points of entry.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common point of entry is the front door, said Detective
Robert Williams with the Rocky Mount Police Department's criminal
investigation division. Most times, he said, burglars walk right up
to the front door, kick it in and make their way into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Since most burglars aren't looking for a confrontation, Williams
encourages homeowners to lead burglars to believe they're home even
when they're not. Do such things as leave the TV or radio on and
keep several lights lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burglars want to get in and get out as fast as they can,
without ever coming face to face with a homeowner. Most often
they're stealing to help support a drug habit. They take what they
can carry - TVs, VCRs, stereos, jewelry, loose change, clothes.
They either sell these items for cash or trade them for drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to engrave your valuables with your driver's
license number and state abbreviation. By doing so, if the items
are ever stolen, they can be returned to their correct owner once
they're retrieved by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Jones encourages people to write down the make, model
and serial number of the items for their own records.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mount Police Department will send patrol officers free
of charge to people's homes to conduct home security surveys.
Officers circle the perimeter of the house, looking for danger
areas, such as poor lighting or unkept shrubbery. They then make
their way inside the house, examining locks, door frames and
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The officers offer the homeowners advice on how not to become
victims.

 &HT;    Is a trip to Hooters practical? It is for the father of the year
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man met the father of the
year last week.
</P>
<P>
   At Hooters.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you sensitive types sling more scorching screeds his
way, let the practical man get one thing straight. Hooters is
practical. Or so he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old buddy's in town,'' he said. ``We're taking him to
Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O for Pete's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bah! It'll keep us out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big pervs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant! We'll be distracted by the babes, won't drink
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing cackle was bloodcurdling, but the practical man
doesn't scare easy. Minutes later he was perched on a stool and
surrounded by pals _ three similarly washed-up married men.
</P>
<P>
   They ate wings, which were hot, fattening and expensive. They
drank beer _ cold, fattening and expensive. They talked,
pointlessly, of the past, which made their lives seem empty. And
they gawked, pointlessly, at the girls, who made them ache for
their youth. It was, in short, not just a shameful but a painful
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Until the father of the year appeared.
</P>
<P>
   This gent's enormous girth at first disguised his true identity,
for when he lumbered into the joint, he obliterated all perception
of what trailed behind. But soon the fat man's charge wanted to see
what all the hooting was about, and he poked his nose around Pop's
billowy belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet mother of heaven!'' exclaimed the practical man. ``It's
a Cub Scout!''
</P>
<P>
   Appalled, his crew looked on as father and son made their way to
a table, sat and studied menus. Within seconds, the Scout began
bobbing above his bill of fare like a determined dog over a
backyard fence. The practical man and friends discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's game,'' said one. ``But one rib doesn't make a
barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One bat doesn't make a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One stick of wood doesn't make a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they sent a waitress to the table with a gift: Hooters
T-shirts. For by this time, the father of the year's genius had
begun to dawn on them. Why let a boy muddle through puberty,
nibbling at nuance and sipping at secrets, when he can gorge on
whole truth for the price of a chicken wing?
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S LEFT FOR OLDER, DISCARDED WORKER?
</P>
<P>
   A reader from West Palm Beach sent an interesting e-mail. It's
much too long to publish, but the practical man will summarize as
best as he can:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: Everyone says the economy is booming, but
it's not booming for older workers who have been discarded in favor
of younger, cheaper employees. I'm 57, with vast corporate
experience and proven management skills, but ``I've been relegated
to the garbage heap and at this rate, I'll soon be one of those
living with relatives or in my car. What a country! Give your all _
only to lose it when you get older.... Where does one go from
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Tough break, and tough question. The practical man can't pretend
to have the answer, but he does have some thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   First, you are not your work.
</P>
<P>
   Careerists inevitably get this wrong, only to suffer
disillusionment after retirement, or after realizing their kids
have been raised almost entirely by strangers, or, like you, after
being laid off. Only then do they pause to take in the tragic
truth: 99 percent of all white-collar jobs exist only to make the
smart feel important or to swindle the stupid out of their cash.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity would not only survive happily, it would likely be
better off without advertisers and stockbrokers and the
military-industrial complex, without the media and celebrities and
politicians, without zillions of companies trying to sell us
trinkets we don't need, without cell phones and pagers and the
Internet, and yeah, without a Practical Man column.
</P>
<P>
   Because it doesn't matter how well you can write, how
effortlessly you can manage, how quickly you can calculate the
square root of 317. What matters is the stuff you don't get paid
for: your family and friends, being kind to people, improving your
mind so you can live in the world without hurting it and enjoy it
without buying bogus toys.
</P>
<P>
   So, to the practical man, where you go from here is obvious: Get
a job. It doesn't have to be a job you're ``qualified for'' or one
that puts your massive but meaningless corporate talents to good
use. Take any job that pays enough to keep you from living in your
car. Then forget about your career and start concentrating on your
life.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: U are my favorite reading these days. ...
Are you a local? Are you really a man?
</P>
<P>
   _ Doesn't Vote Either, Deborah
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Forgive the stationery. Trying to save a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the practical man not a woman, he's also not Ron
Wiggins. He's 38 and he's lived in Palm Beach County 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the only clues you'll get, Deborah, for the
practical man has discovered that nothing _ not even a toolbox
stuffed with Snap-On wrenches and a pocket edition of ``The Way
Things Work'' _ is as practical as anonymity, especially when your
specialty is ticking people off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the stationery: For the love of God, never do that
again! You may have saved a tree _ or more like a twig _ but you
dang near killed the practical man. Nothing strikes fear in his
heart like the second coming of Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: This note is to comment on your column of
Feb. 20 (''the secret of lasting love'').
</P>
<P>
   Your answer to that person was RIGHT ON!
</P>
<P>
   I am in my late 60s. Married 48 years. For the many stories of
true and everlasting love there are probably as many like mine.

 &HT;    Meeting a final deadline
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles M. Schulz never
missed a deadline, his former editors have said.
</P>
<P>
   His death then, on the night of Feb. 12 _ while the ink of his
final cartoon strip was still wet on newspapers around the country
_ came as if he had sketched it out himself.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's timing may have seemed eerily perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts on death and dying say living to meet a final
deadline is a common phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal experience is that when there's somebody who
really wants to be alive (to mark a milestone), somehow they
struggle to do it, and afterwards they really quickly die,'' said
Dr. Carlos Encarnacion, a medical oncologist at Texas Oncology
Cancer Care and Research Center. ``I certainly believe there is
something a person does or an inner strength that helps them last
until certain events happen. It's not very scientific, but who can
be scientific under those circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   Terminally ill people may postpone death to celebrate the events
they have cherished throughout life _ birthdays, anniversaries,
family weddings, babies' births, holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of deaths around the Thanksgiving and Christmas
and New Year's holidays,'' said Hatch Bailey, president of
Wilkirson-Hatch-Bailey Funeral Home. ``And we see a lot of people
make it just past a birthday, especially if a birthday is a
milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   A loved one's will to live became a personal experience for
Tillman Rodabough, a sociology professor who teaches a class on
death and dying at Baylor University. His brother, a quadriplegic,
fell critically ill around Thanksgiving last year, but he didn't
die until late January. Rodabough said he believes his brother
willed himself to live that long so he could ring in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can, to some degree, determine when we die,''
Rodabough said. ``Some people have very little to live for, and
physically they are dying, but they can slow the process just by
will. We can control our body to a pretty fair extent, and I think
that's what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   No scientific explanation exists as to how people can will
themselves to live. But many researchers have been interested in
the mind's power over the body, and recent studies have shown that
optimistic people tend to live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are born optimists. But shaping thought processes
and striving to meet optimistic goals can be learned at any stage
in life, according to Norman Fluet, director of psychological
services for the Scott &AMP; White Clinic in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, those who have had an important part of their lives
taken away may not feel as motivated to live because part of
themselves has already died, Fluet said. That is why spouses often
die within a short time of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Fluet said Schulz may have felt this way about ending his
``Peanuts'' strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a love affair with his comic strip
characters,'' Fluet said. ``All that was coming to an end as his
own mortality was coming to an end. I think his timing was
absolutely incredible. It was like saying goodbye to all his
characters was like saying goodbye to his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people may feel ready to die but will themselves to hang on
for family and friends, said Rodney Kruse, chaplain and bereavement
coordinator for Scott &AMP; White Hospice in Temple. He has served
patients who want to ensure financial and emotional support for
their spouses and children before they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize they're trying to live until they die, and part
of living until you die is taking care of business,'' Kruse said.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to survive to meet a milestone can be emotionally
taxing on a terminally ill patient's family, especially when the
patient's quality of life is gone. If dying people feel they can't
die for fear of abandoning other people, families must give them
permission to die, Rodabough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family member that says we've had great times, we're glad
you are here and we'll remember you forever says it's OK to die,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion said doctors' first responsibility is to be honest
with families about their loved ones' chances for survival. But in
most cases, he would also encourage people to survive to meet a
personal milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to take away hope, but you don't want to be
unrealistic,'' he said. ``No one knows how long anyone has to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a person doesn't live long enough to pass an important
milestone, the fact that he or she tried can ease the family's
grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the idea of realizing the dying person wants to
accomplish this gives comfort to the bereaved,'' Kruse said.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to wave goodbye is one of the first things children
learn, and it's one of the last symbolic gestures people make in
life. Some people who die quickly don't get that last chance. But
for those who are able to mark a final salient point in life, the
last wave goodbye can be a peaceful, if not joyful, gesture, Kruse
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea of saying goodbye or accomplishing something
is the idea that as people look forward, they see a future,'' Kruse
said. ``And the future is not on this earth, and at some point,
people realize that they let go and they trust in God. So instead
of saying people give up, that they dread the future, I think
people let go because they see the future. Instead of living out of
fear, they live out of trust and grace.''

Sudan, a small West Texas town where farmers still crawl into their

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past year, J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books
has topped the New York Times best seller list _ 18.5 million
copies in print in America. The books have been published in 29
countries; and in the United States, the books have been challenged
or banned in at least 26 schools, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Children across America have turned off their TV sets and turned
the pages of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.'' And as they wait impatiently for the
promised fourth book in the series, they turn to other children's
fantasy literature _ C.S. Lewis's ``Chronicles of Narnia'' and
Lloyd Alexander's ``Chronicles of Prydain.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Eager's ``Half Magic,'' Madeleine L'Engle's ``Wrinkle in
Time'' and J.R.R. Tolkein's classic trilogy, ``Lord of the Rings,''
are also enjoying a resurgence of sales. Children are reading again
_ with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   They have spread the word about the fledgling wizard Harry
Potter.
</P>
<P>
   So why are members of the religious right, the organization
called Family Friendly Libraries and other conservative groups
pushing to have the books removed from school reading lists and
school libraries?
</P>
<P>
   In one word, ``magic.'' Their protests against the Harry Potter
books are sparked by their objections to sorcery, the magic arts,
wizards, warlocks and witches. They don't like 11-year-old Potter
using magic to solve his problems. They have forgotten what it is
like to be a child.
</P>
<P>
   All children believe in magic. It's a way to explain the world.
It's a way to have some power over the world around them. It's a
way to overcome the fears children have. Fantasies and fairy tales
and stories about magical powers are important to the development
of a healthy psychological state.
</P>
<P>
   What child doesn't have an uncle who pulls quarters out of the
air or out of an ear to the delight of his nieces and nephews?
</P>
<P>
   What child hasn't talked to and for his or her dolls or stuffed
animals or toy soldiers? What child hasn't fantasized about being a
knight, a king or queen, or a superhero? What child has not thought
of incantations that would make some improbable or even impossible
event happen _ in an attempt to control the world around them?
</P>
<P>
   A rich fantasy life invigorates the imagination. Fantasy and
fairy tales acknowledge the fears and conflicts children have. And
they can provide answers or resolutions to a child's inner
problems.
</P>
<P>
   What child hasn't felt like ``The Ugly Duckling'' or felt
unfairly burdened by chores set by a parent as in ``Cinderella''?
The inherent lessons of these stories are not lost on children.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Harry Potter book, Muggles are defined as
``nonmagic folk.'' In reality, Muggles are those whose imaginations
have been so suppressed they cannot see the joy in pretending nor
the complex reasons for children's fantasies. Those who want the
Harry Potter books banned are threatened by an active imagination.
They are the real Muggles.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper reality involved here. Tens of thousands
of years ago, early humans created a magical universe to explain
the planets, stars and natural phenomenon like lightning, eclipses,
floods and volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Humankind sought connections between events by creating a
magical universe. Much like we do, early humans sought answers to
the problems the world threw at them. Their approach was through
magic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Lascaux cave paintings have been interpreted as
hunting magic _ the portrayal of a desired event would bring it
into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The arrow struck the reindeer or bison in a painting, thus it
would come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the magical universe, when two things look alike _ the magic
of similarities _ they share some interior properties that can be
used to bring health or illness. A leaf from the liverwort plant
looks like a liver and thereby was thought to be an effective cure
for liver ailments. Like conceives like: A cave painting if
rendered carefully brought about the portrayed event.
</P>
<P>
   Those immersed in the magical universe know that if two things
in the world have once touched one another, they are always in
contact. In voodoo, for instance, a single hair or fingernail
paring taken from a person can be used to cast a spell on that
person _ for the hair or nail clipping is always in touch with the
person from whom it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists have never found a culture that didn't create
its own magical universe. Magical connections are inherent in our
thought patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The magical universe inhabits the twilight of our psyches.
</P>
<P>
   The magical universe was gradually shoved out of its position of
prominence by the rise of the religious universe. Later, the
scientific universe eventually came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these three universes seeks different ways of explaining
the world around us. They ask different questions and arrive at
answers by very different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   When lightning strikes a tree on a plain and kills the herder
sitting beneath it, a person imbedded in the magical universe would
explain that someone put a spell on the herder so that he was
killed by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   A religious person could interpret the event as a sign that
divine retribution will fall upon those who commit a sacrilege or a
violation of holy covenants.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist, however, would explain that the tree as the tallest
conductor of electricity in the locale _ because of the sap or
because it was wet with rain _ would draw lightning to it. The
herder sitting beneath the tree should have known better and was
killed because of his ignorance of natural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   While it may no longer be a dominant perspective, the magical
universe still prowls in our minds, our thought processes, our way
of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   We all have some belief in magical connections and intuitions
that defy religion and science.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter books acknowledge the thirst children have for
magic and fantasy. Children already fantasize about their lives.
These books give them the security that other children fantasize,
too. And that makes their own fantasies less fearful.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy and imagination are crucial to our growth as human
beings. We gradually outgrow our childhood fantasies, but the
pathways they constructed to enrich our imaginations and to tap our
deepest fears are invaluable in helping us reach our fullest
potential as adults.

childhood's fears, summons new life for the imagination and

   ENERGY-PILL (San Francisco) _ Ephedra, a chemical cousin to the

aspirin, and looks safer, because no warning labels are required.
Yet the Food and Drug Administration has collected more than 800

many are painted extensions of the book illustrator's deeply

tobacco smoke, pet hair and dander, dust mites, molds, bacteria and

 This little piggy went to the stock market, and ...   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far be it from me to offer advice to Alan Greenspan on how to
keep the economy humming, but I think the fellow ought to quit
fretting over inflation and pay a little more attention to my feet.
</P>
<P>
   As silly as that may sound, I can say with confidence that my
toes (and fingers) have saved me from economic ruin on numerous
occasions as I've struggled to balance my checkbook. I believe my
piggies can be of a similar service to the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. Our country is, I'm sad to report, on the verge of a
major battle for the heart and mind _ not to mention the feet,
neck, butt and belly _ of the American male. I fear the noise from
the battleground will produce annoying echoes on Wall Street.
Greenspan needs me and my toes to keep him on his toes.
</P>
<P>
   The menswear industry, it seems, has begun a major push to have
corporate America declare Thursday as the day for guys to button up
and put on a nice suit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Toronto Star, the good people who make and sell
men's clothing feel it's time to create Dress-up Thursdays to whip
into shape ``a workforce of slobs, a workforce that lacks
professional etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as you may have surmised, is Casual Fridays. This
official day for dressing down _ originated 10 years ago by Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. in a burst of, uh, civic-mindedness _ was designed to
improve morale, break people out of a rut and get them to think
more freely.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks in the nondenim menswear industry think dressing
down has gone too far, that it's made us all rather indolent and
unattractive. On their Web site (www.dressupthursdays.com), the
leaders of the anti-casual movement say their efforts are necessary
``to assist Corporate America in re-conceptualizing the importance
of appropriate business attire in the workplace and its attendant
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are also necessary, I'm guessing, to save their
natty behinds. Suit sales have plummeted from 13 million units in
1996 to 9 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dress-up Thursdays, the Web site says, is ``a Grassroots
movement within the Tailored Men's Clothing Industry (manufacturers
and retailers) aimed at returning the art of dressing back into the
hands of haberdashers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm all for rescuing haberdashers, if for no other reason
than I like the sound of the word. But on the subject of casual vs.
dress, I am torn, or _ as they used to say in olden days _ I am
rending garments.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, I've never cared much for ties. I'm not sure why,
exactly, but I suspect it's more than a question of comfort.
Somewhere in the back of my mind, I guess I've always figured I'm
liable to do something at work that's a hanging offense, and I'd
rather not be the one who supplies my boss with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, I've tried to get into the spirit of
things. I wear a decorative noose to the office just about every
day now. It gives me something handy to wipe my chin with when I
dribble coffee, and it helps take the sting out of pretty young
store clerks glancing at my graying hair and calling me ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, I even wear ties on Fridays. As much as I dislike
ties, I can't bring myself to participate in Casual Fridays.
There's something about organized disorganization that rubs me the
wrong way, and I rebel.
</P>
<P>
   But, as my wife will attest, I'm pretty much a slob when I'm not
at work. She and I have a running disagreement over flip-flops. I
say they're perfectly fine for the rare occasions when going
barefoot isn't good enough. She claims grown men with graying hair
don't wear flip-flops unless they're headed for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Because of my divided loyalties about what constitutes
appropriate attire, I think I am the perfect barometer for the
approaching fashion storm.
</P>
<P>
   For a modest fee, I am willing to allow Alan Greenspan and the
Federal Reserve to monitor my toes.
</P>
<P>
   If the forces of casualness are winning, I will wriggle my toes
and Greenspan can dash into action. If the forces of nattiness are
winning, my toes will be covered, and Greenspan can dash into
action.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what that dashing action should be in either case.
I'll just handle the flip-flops, and let better-dressed people take
care of the important stuff.
</P>

 &HT;    MONEYTALK : Countdown to big R
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David and Anna Gines have already built and moved into
their retirement dream house.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is ahead of the game. He is 62, she is 57, and they
don't expect to end their working careers for another three years.
</P>
<P>
   To David Gines, a fund-raising executive for Brenau University,
that kind of forethought just makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to plan your retirement and your estate just like you
plan every day of your job,'' he said. ``You work all your life to
get to that point. If you don't put together a good plan to utilize
what you've accumulated, you've wasted a lot of your effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Their new house _ which includes a woodworking shop for him and
a studio for her photo and sewing activities _ isn't the only
thing. The couple long ago accelerated their savings and investment
program, meaning they will have more gold for their golden years.
They have also updated their wills and other documents, established
trusts to minimize inheritance taxes for their three children and
procured all the insurance they believe they will need.
</P>
<P>
   They started the whole process years ago, a practice that
financial planners and consultants urge on all their clients. ``It
can be overwhelming,'' said Marian Davis, a retirement planning
consultant with TIAA-CREF, a major financial services firm.
``You're getting so much information. It's best to start finding
out your options early.''
</P>
<P>
   The first question, of course, is whether you can afford to
retire when you want, with the comforts you yearn.
</P>
<P>
   But saving and budgeting are just the beginning, as the Gines'
experience shows. Some questions are intricate, rather like a
machine with a thousand moving parts, half of which perform
erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most people bring in experts to help make
their decisions. The Gineses used Davis, as well as an attorney and
a stockbroker with experience in financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like that suggest starting your countdown to retirement
as much as 10 years before you expect to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a checklist _ by no means all-inclusive _ of things to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Right now
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Write your wills, if you and your spouse haven't already. A
surprising number people put this off for years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider other legal documents, including living wills and
health care powers of attorney.
</P>
<P>
   10 years to retirement
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look into long-term care insurance, to cover your expenses if
you need to go to a nursing home or need other specialized care.
``If you can get it in your late 50s, it's definitely more
cost-effective,'' said Marian Davis. ``The younger you are, the
cheaper it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start boning up on retirement issues. Check the accompanying
list for books and Web sites that will help. If you decide to
search out a professional, the best way to start is by asking
friends or business acquaintances for referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Five years to go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Work out an estimate of how much income you will have in
retirement. If you are not getting annual statements from the
Social Security Administration, call 1-800-772-1213 and ask for a
statement of your earnings and estimated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If you are eligible for a pension, ask your employer for an
estimate of how much you will have coming.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the income you can expect from retirement savings
accounts, such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts,
and any other resources you have.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plan your retirement lifestyle. ``Maybe you picture yourself
traveling, finally having time to devote to a hobby or a sport, or
spending more time seeing your grandkids,'' said Nic Pye, a
director of KPMG's personal planning practice. ``Visualize what you
will be doing seven days a week. Discuss your plans with your
family, and continue this process as you approach retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Develop a retirement budget. You need to cover the basics but
not forget lifestyle extras.
</P>
<P>
   Pye suggests drawing up a detailed budget, with your spending
needs divided into must-haves, discretionary items and contingency
spending. The latter means making some provision for uncontrollable
circumstances, such as illness or runaway inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For useful calculators to help the project along, go to www
</P>
<P>
   .kiplinger.com/retirement/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get serious about gaps between the income you expect and how
much you want to spend. A number of adjustments are possible,
including increased saving, budget cuts, putting off retirement or
accepting part-time work after you retire.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start adjusting your investment portfolio. ``It makes sense to
re-evaluate, but not to go to the extreme and put everything into
fixed-income investments,'' said Davis. ``Even for a conservative
investor, I think keeping at least 30 percent in the stock market,
as an inflation hedge, would be a good thing to do.'' Don't forget,
your retirement could last 20 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Three years
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start looking at health insurance options. If you're lucky,
you can continue the coverage you have at work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Review your financial plans. You may need to accommodate
changes in your lifestyle, aspirations or health. You also want to
check that you are making satisfactory progress in your investments
and your savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   One year
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start on projects that are easier to pay for while you still
have a regular paycheck. Extensive home repairs are one example.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take advantage of medical benefits at work. If you have a
flexible spending plan for medical expenses, use it all up. It's
your last chance to use this tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Also take care of optional surgery or other medical expenses
while you're still covered by the company's health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Review your pension options. You may have to decide whether to
take a lump-sum payout, monthly payments for the rest of your life
or monthly payments as long as your or your spouse are alive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Call the nearest Social Security office to set up an
appointment and apply for benefits. It's best to do this at least
three months before your retirement date.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decide when you will start taking distributions from
retirement plans. For this item, you will almost certainly need to
hire an expert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At all times, stay loose. This kind of planning is a
never-ending process, one that evolves as your life moves along and
changes.

   TAKE-BOS  
 JAMAICA, N.Y.: ... a jockey.' ''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Arroyo was working as a groom at Rockingham Park for
trainer Jonathan John, and then he went to work on a horse farm in
Virginia. By last summer, he was ready to begin his riding career
when Rockingham opened for its summer meet in Salem, N.H. Trainer
Nick Cicerone had taken the youth under his wing ``and I've got to
thank Nick Cicerone for getting me going,'' said Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hall was tending to his business as agent for veteran
jockeys Joe Hampshire and Jose Caraballo, two of the leading
jockeys in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day,'' Hall recalled, ``Joe came up to me and said he
was really impressed by this bug boy (apprentice) and he told me
his name was Arroyo. Joe said he was very good at getting a horse
out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire could have told Hall this apprentice's name was Willie
Shoemaker and Hall still wouldn't have been impressed. Hall, much
like football's Bill Parcells, does not like rookies ``because they
make so many mistakes and you have to wait so long for them to get
good,'' said the agent. In all his years, Hall had been an agent
for only three apprentices, and that was back in the 1970s and
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hall stuck to veteran jockeys because they were reliable. An
apprentice, by definition, was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take so much time and effort,'' said Hall, ``but so many
of them never make it. They lose races because of mistakes, and an
old veteran rider doesn't make those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hall, with the prodding of his meal ticket, Hampshire, took
a look at Arroyo, and he came away impressed. Arroyo's first ride,
Mia's Gold, finished fourth, but on the fifth ride of his career,
he brought home Iron Lady, a 49-1 shot, last June at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' said Hall. ``It was a blanket finish.
There were three or four horses at the wire, but what I liked was
that he was dead last at the top of the stretch but (Arroyo) was
able to get him home.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo was even more excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I had won,'' he said. ``I remember when I was
pulling up after the race, I said to (jockey) Harry Vega, `I think
you won,' and Harry said he didn't know. And when I got back and I
saw my number was up, I was so excited. The horse paid $99. It was
my first win. It was so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trainers noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started getting calls from some of the top outfits,''
recalled Hall, ``but the kid was as green as a pea. He made a few
mistakes, and the horses didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was not all bad. Hall knew it was important for a
youngster to gain experience before he won too many races, for
practical as well as psychological reasons. The psychological
reasons are obvious: too many wins too soon and all the success
might go to a youngster's head.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical reasons are perhaps just as important. An
apprentice jockey begins by carrying 10 pounds less than a veteran
jockey on a horse. After a set number of wins, that weight
allowance drops to 7 pounds and finally to 5. The apprentice is
then allowed an entire year to ride with that 5-pound allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous when I got started,'' Arroyo said,
``but I am very competitive, and I knew I would do good. I used to
box and the other fighters would see how small I was and they would
think they could do anything with me; but I would beat them. I had
that same mentality when I started riding.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Rockingham meet in September, when, in fact,
Arroyo was still ``green as a pea,'' Hall had his master plan.
Knowing that this youth had exceptional talent, Hall thought Arroyo
should start out fast when the Suffolk Downs meet opened in
September, win race after race, and then head down to New York at
the first of the year. Traditionally, the top New York jockeys
leave for Gulfstream Park in Florida in the winter, and
opportunities for a skillful apprentice abound in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, right when Suffolk opened, Norberto had a spill and
he hurt his shoulder,'' said Hall. ``He was out for a while, and
that set us back.''
</P>
<P>
   By October, Arroyo was back on horses, and by November and
December, he was the sensation of Suffolk Downs, winning races at a
25 percent clip. Michael Gill, the leading owner at Suffolk, had
noticed the youth, put him on horse after horse, and Arroyo won
race after race. Other top trainers also put him on their better
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, I knew I could do it,'' said Arroyo. ``I was very
confident. I wanted to go to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Hall, the unthinkable for him now was inevitable. Hall
knew he had to leave New England and see how far Arroyo could go
with his apprenticeship (which will last until August). Beyond the
talent, beyond Arroyo's likability as a person, said Hall, the
youngster had a rare trait for an apprentice: ``He'd do what he was
told; he'd listen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, said Hall, was the place to go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The color brown _ dull brown _ permeates winter racing in New
York. The outer track at Aqueduct, unused in the winter, is brown,
just as dusty brown is the color of the inner track, where the
horses run nine times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Further inside, the grass on the turf course _ also unused _ is
winter brown, just as the bushes surrounding the infield lakes seem
tinted brownish green by winter's cold. Even the clouds and air
between Aqueduct and nearby JFK airport seem dully brownish, just
as are the parkas and winter coats of so many of the men who gather
for the day's races at New York's winter racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Brown. Dull. The color of racing for the sake of racing. Winter
racing. Neither the sport of kings nor the sport of flings, but
merely a day's work for both horse and man.
</P>
<P>
   But heat, sparks, flashes, and a warm glow soon warmed Aqueduct.
Instead of dull brown, Aqueduct was white hot because of Arroyo
virtually from the day he arrived in New York two months ago.
Arroyo now is the 10th leading jockey in the US _ winning more
races than such stalwarts as Mike Smith, John Velasquez, and Jerry
Bailey _ and is 12th in money earned with more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, jockeys get 10 percent of winning purses and agents
collect 25 percent of what the jockey earns. Thus, Arroyo has
already earned more than $150,000 in 2000 and Hall receives a
quarter of that. Arroyo has won 22 percent of his races in New
York, a superlative record.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall had a huge hurdle to climb once he got to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had to win right away so we could make a good
impression and get off to a fast start,'' said the agent, ``but I
didn't know the New York trainers.'' And racing, like all walks of
life, is dependent on contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing about New Englanders who have raced at
Suffolk or Rockingham, it is their loyalty. Hall knew his only hope
for a fast start was to contact former New Englanders now racing in
New York _ ``guys such as Bobby and Steve Klesaris and Russell
Derderian'' _ and throw himself at their mercy.
</P>
<P>
   So Hall went to Bobby Klesaris, who began his career at Suffolk,
and told him, ``I need a live one _ fast.'' And Klesaris came
through with a live horse the next day, put Arroyo aboard, and the
apprentice won. After a few more wins, Arroyo caught the eye of
veteran New York trainers such as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers, of course, are grizzled cynics who say Arroyo
is no better than other bug boys who have shown up in the winter
only to disappear once the top jockeys return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at his competition,'' said one of the cynics. ``Aaron
Gryder (the leading rider in New York) and Mike Luzzi _ that's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Arroyo can't praise Gryder often enough (``Aaron
Gryder is a true friend; he's done so much for me''), a few other
jockeys have not been happy about Arroyo's aggressive riding style,
which already has been the cause of two suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't hide it,'' said Arroyo of a few New York jockeys
not happy with his appearance on the scene. ``They've got to show
it. No class. Once a jockey tried to put me over the rail. They
were on the lead and I was laying second and I was on the inside,
and down the backstretch they tried to put me over the rail if I
didn't take my horse back. I got my boot all scuffed (from the
paint on the rail). They weren't even trying to win the race. They
were just trying to make sure I wasn't going to win. A lot of them
go out there riding so you won't win while not even caring if they
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxer's spirit, the athlete's competitiveness, ooze from
every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think because I'm a bug boy I'll be intimidated,'' said
Arroyo. ``But I'm not intimidated by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he says he will do well once the top jockeys return in
April _ Bailey, Smith, Velasquez, Jorge Chavez, Jose Santos, and
Edgar Prado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are the best,'' said Arroyo, ``but I am confident
I will do well if I am given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo has already won a stakes race in New York (``That is now
my biggest thrill, when winning my first race at Rockingham had
been'') and is in constant demand. On last Saturday's card at
Aqueduct, for instance, he had a ride in all nine races.
</P>
<P>
   The two men from the Boston area, one 22 years old and the other
a grandfather, use similar words to describe their experiences.
``This is a dream for me,'' said Arroyo, ``to ride in New York and
win.'' And Hall, his agent who never thought there was anyone or
anything that could yank him out of New England, says, ``Norberto
is definitely fulfilling a dream for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And each morning at dawn, the two are at the Aqueduct stables,
Arroyo working out horses and Hall checking to see which horses his
jockey should ride. Then comes the afternoon of racing and, at
night, back to the apartment in Queens, the two studying the tapes
of the day's races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a son to me,'' said Hall, and Arroyo, so close to
his father that he calls him ``my best friend,'' said his agent is
``like a father to me. I listen to what he says, just as I love to
listen to P.G. (Phil) Johnson. These men have seen everything in
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Including dreams.

KAROLY RETURNS TO STEADY US GYMNASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bela Karolyi wears grown-up, 9-to-5 clothes now. Checked jacket,
crimson tie, real shoes. ``My wife said I'm looking more human,''
he said. ``I wish I was back in my old warmup suit, jumping
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this Olympic year. The greatest coach in gymnastics history,
mentor to Nadia and Mary Lou and Kimbo and Dominique, has nobody in
the chase this time. Or, more accurately, he has everybody in the
chase, the whole US women's team for this summer's Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi is the national team coordinator, the man with a plan to
pull the deflated Americans off the floor and get them back on the
medal stand where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had a so-called coordinating or advisory position
in my life,'' said Karolyi. ``I'm not a very political person. I am
pretty vocal in my opinions. I enjoy having the freedom to say
whatever I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Karolyi has to play the diplomat. He has to convince more
than two dozen coaches that he has nothing up his sleeve. That he's
not going to spirit away their gymnasts before the trials. That
he's not going to be prowling the floor at Olympus and grabbing the
credit when the medals are handed out. That he will keep the warmup
suit in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi retired from elite coaching after the Magnificent Seven
won the team gold medal in Atlanta four years ago. After three
decades, after producing nine Olympic and 15 world champions in two
countries, he had nothing more to prove.
</P>
<P>
   So he went back to his Houston ranch and his summer camps.
``When I stepped out, I considered it over,'' said the 57-year-old
Karolyi. ``With me, it's all in or all out. Halfway, I don't
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   He figured that some younger coach, someone with personality and
leadership, would step up and take over the reins. ``But somehow,
it never came around,'' Karolyi said.
</P>
<P>
   After just one year, the US women tumbled from first to sixth on
the global stage. ``It's unreal,'' he said. ``You cannot accept it.
There is something deeply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the usual post-Olympic transition, the coaches and
federation people insisted. Next time, we'll be back up there. But
when the Americans finished a dispirited sixth again at last year's
world championships in China, behind even the Australians, it was
crisis time. ``Now we're going to do it my way,'' declared USA
Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi, who had pushed for a shake-up
when he arrived from the Mass. Sports Partnership in summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His way meant Karolyi, the man whose golden touch had produced
Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton, Kim Zmeskal, and Dominique
Moceanu. The man who never, ever does sixth place. ``Winning
medals,'' said Colarossi, ``drives everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi's wife, Martha, told him he was out of his mind. ``When
I came back in 1992, she told me I was crazy,'' he shrugged. ``When
I came back in 1994, she told me I was really crazy. When I came
back in 1996, she told me I was really, really crazy. Now she
thinks I'm completely crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   What else could he do? Karolyi enjoyed the summer camps, ``the
little kiddos hanging on me, saying, `Bela, Bela.' '' But he missed
the competitive excitement, ``running around the floor like a crazy
rooster, eating my fingers.'' And he was undeniably frustrated at
seeing American kids getting their heads handed to them at world
meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years of my life I was working so hard growing the
sport of gymnastics in this country,'' Karolyi said. ``Now
everything is going down. I said, is not fair, damn it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, last November, he agreed to come back and ``coordinate'' the
national team. That means visiting clubs from Pennsylvania to Ohio
to Nevada to California to check on the elite gymnasts. That means
helping decide on the selection process (more intricate than a
quadratic equation) and helping choose the team. (Back in Romania,
he merely pointed: you, you, you, you, you, you.) That means
holding monthly boot camps at his ranch. That means organizing,
prodding, cajoling, hugging, growling, inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   It does not mean coaching individual gymnasts, and that was
spelled out in his deal. ``There would be a revolution,'' Karolyi
realized. ``It would be called biasedness. It would be called
everything in the world. And I understand, because I would probably
react in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the federation had ``the meeting of all meetings'' in
Tulsa in December, skeptical coaching eyebrows were everywhere.
``Still was suspicion out there, still they thought I want to take
it over and not give them their well-deserved recognition,''
Karolyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Videos from Olympics past rolled in their heads. Bela stopping
the show for 40 minutes in Moscow, claiming that Comaneci was
robbed. Bela giving Retton a victory bear hug in Los Angeles. Bela
carrying wounded Kerri Strug onto the medal stand in Atlanta.
Always Bela.
</P>
<P>
   Their gymnasts, though, have seen the same videotapes _ which is
why they were agog when Karolyi walked into the gym. ``I couldn't
stop smiling the whole time,'' said Vanessa Atler. ``I was
awestruck.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the familiar walrus mustache, the piercing glare, the
guttural growl, the 10,000 volts of energy, the boundless optimism:
``Sure, we gonna do it. We gotta do it. Now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the unyielding standard, the disdain for mediocrity,
for sloppiness, for halfheartedness. The women discovered that at
Karolyi's first boot camp. ``It's work,'' Karolyi said. ``It's
intensity. It's repetition. Not wasting time, not hanging around.
No talk. What to talk? Do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi was stunned when he dropped by Atler's gym in a Dallas
suburb to check on her and watched her casually abandon a bars
routine halfway through. ``Hey, hey, what the hell is this?'' he
snapped at her. ``You call this a routine? That's crap, that's
nothing. Go back and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler did a half-dozen routines, then moved to the balance beam
and did another half-dozen there. ``I said this is the difference,
honey, between training and training,'' Karolyi said. ``They need
to understand, this is the standard. But someone has to push them
to it. They need that strong voice, that support, to pull them
through what they think are difficulties. To perform all the time
their routines without falling, without walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no other way to climb up from sixth place, to win a
medal, Karolyi tells them. You think the Russians and the Romanians
and the Chinese are jumping down from the bars? ``He makes us
realize that there are other gymnasts working every second,'' Atler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Why let them and their coaches kid themselves, Karolyi believes.
The competition in Sydney will be fierce, and there are only a few
months to prepare. His job is to get everyone moving in
triple-time, with a boot up the butt (``more efficient guidance'')
if necessary. ``No hocus-pocus, but reality,'' Karolyi said. ``Tell
them the truth. That's the most important.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the elite group is fitter and more focused
since Karolyi has been around. ``He makes all the girls want to do
more,'' said Kristen Maloney, the two-time national champion. But
if the Games were held now, the Americans still would not be
anywhere near the podium.
</P>
<P>
   None of their top people _ Maloney, Atler, Jennie Thompson,
Elise Ray _ were ready to compete at the American Cup two weekends
ago. Karolyi needs a star to emerge, like Retton or Zmeskal or
Shannon Miller, and a team to build beneath her. ``You need a star,
period,'' he said. ``But you need a team to create the star.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi will mold and motivate that team, but this time he will
not be the running-around rooster. ``I will not be on the floor,''
said the so-called coordinator. ``But I'm gonna be around the
floor.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Books, cars, and mutual funds are already hawked
online, so why not pitch a congressman or two?
</P>
<P>
   That's the aim of about a dozen new Web sites calling themselves
``democracy portals'' and hoping to turn politics into a lucrative
e-commerce application.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of politicians already have sites of their own, to raise
money and to turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the democracy portals are drawing users with their own
polls, news stories, and bipartisan e-mail debates. And they are
developing high-tech plans to sell their access to potential voters
to the candidates and political parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when all politics is marketing, election pros love the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Voter.com of Boston has signed promotional
agreements with everyone from the Democratic Leadership Council and
the AFL-CIO to the Christian Coalition and the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A rival, Grassroots.com, is targeting local races around the
country, with advice from former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu
and a content deal with the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other entrants include SpeakOut.com, Vote.com, and Voxcap.com.
</P>
<P>
   These for-profit companies all declare they want the Internet to
be an engine of public discourse. But by tracking voters' interests
and e-mail addresses, the sites also expect to build up databases
better than those kept by any political organization to date.
</P>
<P>
   The portals won't share their data with outsiders, but they will
make use of the information as middlemen, their owners say,
channelling e-mail pitches from candidates to users who have
expressed interest in certain causes.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to help candidates better target supporters and lower
the cost of campaigns _ blending the lofty goal of increasing voter
participation with a big dose of dot-com commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a cost of thousands of dollars, the services the Web
companies could provide to candidates would be far cheaper than the
television and radio ads that dominate campaigns today. And in
theory they would allow a deeper discussion of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the public, there's a tremendous frustration with the
existing tools'' of politics, said Justin Dangel, Voter.com's
25-year-old founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Television spots are too brief and expensive to allow candidates
to talk about complex matters like health care and education, he
said, while much news coverage focuses on campaign tactics, not
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No campaign in America will tell you they're happy with the
level of distribution of their issue information,'' said Lawrence
Purpuro, who oversees online efforts for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Purpuro has signed deals with several of the independent portals
since December, in hopes of reaching potential voters who might not
register themselves on sites run by the RNC or the Republican Party
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While the party has a database of 120 million voters, it has
e-mail addresses for just a small fraction of them, Purpuro said,
and needs to build up its electronic contact list to cut its
communication costs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, e-mail has reduced the RNC's fax budget from $25,000 to
$7,000 a month, he said. ``We've made it clear we need to go
digital or die, but how we get there is unclear,'' Purpuro said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and parties have made broad use of the Internet
since the 1998 election cycle, and major Internet and media
companies pump a massive amount of political news and analysis onto
their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political sites draw mainly hard-core party
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the new portals hope to attract more of the swing
voters who decide most elections, then summarize and deliver their
views to politicians and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Celmer, one of the investors in SpeakOut.com, calls it ``the
aggregation of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The packaging of information on electronic visitors begins when
users log in. Many online companies are keen to collect credit card
and Social Security numbers, but the democracy portals often ask
for a person's ZIP code, party affiliation and whether they are
registered to vote, all of which can help politicians target
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Next, many of the portals ask users to specify a few issues they
care most about, such as civil rights, the environment, or crime,
and suggest that users take a brief quiz on each area. The data
amount to a rough ideological and demographic profile of each user.
</P>
<P>
   After providing the information, visitors to Voter.com can then
call up a section called ``My Officials,'' customized by ZIP code.
A user from Dorchester, for instance, would see links to officials
from President Clinton down to the local state representative,
Democrat John A. Hart.
</P>
<P>
   These links don't generate revenue, but Voter.com collects fees
from politicians who want to display more information about
themselves. Currently these include Hillary Clinton, running for
Senate from New York, and Jon Gordon, seeking a congressional seat
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats pay several hundred dollars a month. That's
hardly a significant outlay; Gordon said he plans to spend $1
million if he wins his party's nomination, primarily on broadcast
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Voter.com thinks it can make money on volume, hoping to sign
up virtually every one of thousands of candidates seeking state or
federal office this year. That could generate enough revenue to
make it profitable by 2001, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Other revenue sources include building home pages for candidates
and collecting online contributions, in return for a percentage of
the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who once lived in Natick, said television ads are still
more important than exposure on the Web, but that may change in
several years. ``The big opportunity here (online) is to reduce the
targetting cost,'' of reaching swing voters who might not go to the
polls otherwise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Voter.com hopes to provide its services to people
running for local councils and school boards, a market it estimates
at more than 100,000 candidates nationwide. To help build trust
across party and ideological lines, it has hired executives like
Randy Tate, former head of the Christian Coalition, and Craig
Smith, former manager of Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to turn politics into e-commerce worries observers like
Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   He's made ``a little antsy'' by what he calls ``the
commercialization of citizen communications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornfield said he doubts most of the sites will draw much of
an audience. ``For all but a handful of junkies, politics is an
occasional interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses aim to prove him wrong, by showing they can
expand the market for political talk and lowering communications
costs for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're solving is making political communication
more efficient,'' said Voter.com's Dangel.

CABLE TV FLEXES ITS PRIMARY MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before a single voter had spoken in the presidential
primary process that peaked with ``Super Tuesday,'' Chris Matthews
made a bold prediction on his MSNBC talk show, ``Hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the primaries took place on these
kinds of programs,'' Matthews told a guest, William Kristol, last
November. ``This is where the game is going to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, Matthews may be right. Just as HBO's ``The
Sopranos'' underscored the ascendancy of cable in the entertainment
realm, so has the presidential race driven home the prominence of
cable-news outlets in election time.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC and Fox News Channel, barely in their infancy in 1996, are
now aggressively in the mix with the old standby, CNN. The trio
have amplified cable's voice by sponsoring debates, devoting much
more air time to daily campaign coverage than broadcast networks,
competing for prime interview ``gets'' of the candidates, and,
especially, by relentlessly dissecting every twist in the race on
political talk shows like ``Hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 24-7, all-coverage, all-punditry, all the time,'' said a
Boston University communications professor, Tobe Berkovitz. ``It
makes the strategy and the tactics as important as the candidates,
the message and the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But it can also can boost an issue from obscurity to the
forefront of voters' consciousness. When George W. Bush spoke at
Bob Jones University last month, it initially caused little
controversy. But the college's ban on interracial dating and its
founder's anti-Catholic views became an albatross for Bush once TV
talk shows, along with John McCain, his chief GOP rival and other
Republicans, began focusing on the questions it raised about Bush's
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cable is feeling its oats. Sean Hannity, cohost of
Fox News Channel's ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes,'' proclaimed that ``this
election cycle is just the beginning . . . Political news will be
dominated in the years to come by the cable channels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that maybe would end up on the cutting-room floor on a
22-minute nightly newscast now may get 20 minutes of air time on a
cable channel,'' Hannity added.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true, it's also true that the collective
audience of the three cable-news outlets still does not approach
that of even one of their broadcast competitors. At any given time,
roughly one million viewers are tuned in to CNN, Fox News Channel
and MSNBC together, whereas 31 million collectively tune in to the
nightly newscasts on CBS, NBC and ABC. An appearance on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' still counts for a lot more than an interview
with any cable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some critics say the conflict-driven, insider-oriented
nature of cable news coverage and talk shows obscures more than it
illuminates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pursuit of the trivial in a lot of ways,'' said
Everette Dennis, a professor of communications at Fordham
University. ``There's a tendency to follow minute details of the
campaign, whether it's a speech, a letter, a phone call by Pat
Robertson. They beat it to death in a way that didn't used to
happen . . . It's such extensive coverage of so little.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jeff Cohen, founder of Fairness &AMP; Accuracy in Reporting, the
cable-news outlets are guilty of a missed opportunity to broaden
the spectrum of political opinion. He says that voices from the
left, consumer advocates, and critics of the political process are
frozen out in favor of ``elite journalists and elite pundits and
hired handlers talking among themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Matthews argues that shows like his have helped to
energize the political process. ``We inspire enthusiasm for the
personalities and the attitudes in the race,'' he said. ``We do
more to jack up interest in these races than newspaper columnists,
who aren't really doing the kind of florid commentary they once
did.'' Matthews views shows like ``Hardball' as the contemporary
version of afternoon newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential primaries often turn on decisions made by the most
committed voters. And to that audience, cable's daily coverage and
its talk shows loom large as a means of forming impressions of
candidates _ a fact of which campaigns are keenly aware.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, said
that while the unblinking eye of the cable-news outlets ``hasn't
changed our typical day'' when it comes to scheduling events, it
``keeps you on your toes'' to know that CNN, Fox News Channel and
MSNBC will ``run a lot more material from the campaign trail than
the traditional evening news.''
</P>
<P>
   Any campaign worth its salt has a cadre of telegenic
spinmeisters prepared to go on political talk shows. To campaign
operatives, such shows serve a dual purpose: They are ``free
media'' that provide an opportunity to get a candidate's message
out to likely voters, and they are a chance to influence the
perceptions of journalists and political professionals, especially
since such programs are often quoted by political newsletters like
``The Hotline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really sensitive to the presence of the 24-hour
networks,'' said Wolf Blitzer, host of a Sunday political talk
show, ``Late Edition,'' and anchor of a nightly newscast on CNN.
``They want to make sure they don't neglect us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Judy Woodruff, coanchor of CNN's ``Inside
Politics,'' it's not unusual for producers to receive a call from a
campaign while the show is still on the air, hoping for time to
rebut a rival spinmeister during the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is candidates, not spinners, who are the prized
``gets'' on such programs _ and those programs lend even greater
importance to a presidential candidate's media skills. In fact,
some observers say that favorable coverage and analysis on
cable-news outlets is partly responsible for the unexpectedly
strong showing by media-savvy GOP candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Blitzer's view, the cable-news outlets have irreversibly
changed the tempo of the presidential campaign. ``The 24-hour news
cycle is now more like 24 minutes,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, a former reporter for NBC and PBS, agreed. ``It used
to be you could have one event a day, at 2, and you made the
nightly news,'' she said. ``Now, if you do something in the morning
it will be on CNN right away, and if you say something about your
opponent it will be ping-ponging back and forth for several hours.
You cannot wait for the evening news anymore.''

A DAZZLING ARRAY OF EVENTS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was a year to visit Europe, this is it! Europe is
welcoming the 21st century with some great happenings _ a world's
fair with a vision of the future, a mammoth picnic, a towering
Ferris wheel over London, a once-in-a-decade Passion play, and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is still the number one destination for Americans seeking
heritage, culture, architecture, museums, grand sights from ancient
castles to soaring mountains, and glorious food. This year's
celebrations, from the Jubilee Year in Rome to thousand-year
anniversaries, only add to the reasons to pack your bags and head
across the Atlantic for, perhaps, some once-in-a-lifetime memories.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with such a festive menu is deciding when to go
to join in the celebrations Europe has planned. All this means the
Europeans are expecting more Americans than ever. The number of
Americans with the means to go (adults in households with incomes
of $60,000 plus, according to the ETC) has doubled over the past 10
years to more than 60 million, and at least 25 percent of the
projected 12 million-plus US citizens heading to Europe will be
going for the first time, according to Einar Gustavsson of Iceland,
US chairman of the 29-nation European Travel Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Making the journey a bit easier is that the dollar is strong and
air fares are attractive, according to the European Travel
Commission. The ETC says the dollar is buying 19 percent more in
euros and other European currencies than it did when the euro was
inaugurated in January 1999, and with airlines adding more
trans-Atlantic flights and seats, competitive pressures are there
to fill seats and hold down fares.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, London unveiled a vast Millennium Dome filled
with 14 stunning exhibitions ranging from an enormous see-through
human body to millennial looks at communications, recreation,
spirituality, etc. Artist David Hockney and designer Sir Cameron
Mackintosh are among those who developed the projects. Performances
are held in the dome and the nearby Baby Dome.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther up the Thames is the London Eye, a
450-foot-tall Ferris wheel that at any one time will carry nearly
1,000 passengers high above the river and the Houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the Millennium, London has opened a new Tate Gallery of
Modern Art and a new Millennium Bridge. Other projects include
major new science and environmental centers elsewhere in England
and in Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   France plans two unique Millennium Year events open to all: On
June 21, the first day of summer will be greeted by PeripheRock, a
grand music fest set up on the wide peripherique highway circling
Paris. The road will be closed to traffic, transformed into a huge
nightclub with wired stages, and taken over by scores of rock
bands, music groups, and the public. There will be additional
performances in the capital's major squares and in cities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Bastille Day, July 14, more than 3 million people are
expected to take part in The Incredible Picnic, to take place on
scores of sites stretching 620 miles along the Meridieine Verte
between Dunkirk and the Pyrenees. In Paris alone, mile-long picnic
tables will be set up at the Louvre, in Montmartre and on an Orly
Airport runway. Open to all, each site will offer local
specialties. Baton relays will meet at the meridian midpoint and an
armada of aircraft will buzz the entire line between 2 and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Emperor Charles V, was the man of the 16th century, and now on
the 500th anniversary of his birth, four of the countries he ruled
will hold special exhibits and celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ghent's Prinzenhof in 1500 and brought up in Belgium,
Charles V inherited vast empires, including those of Spain,
Austria, and the Low Countries. A central figure of the 16th
century, he led the opposition to Martin Luther in Germany, fought
France for control of Italy, halted the relentless Ottoman advance
at Lepanto, and expanded Spain's new world holdings before
abdicating in Brussels in 1555 and retiring to a monastery in
Spain's Sierra de Gredos.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Ghent will exhibit 19th-century renderings of
Charles's career; in Mechelen there will be an exhibit of
tapestries of Charles (May 26-Oct. 8) and other exhibits will be
held in Leuven, Antwerp, and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Spain will hold the ``Art and the Kings of Spain'' exhibition in
Barcelona through May, and related exhibitions will be held in
LaCoruna and Granada April through June.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4 and 6, Brussels holds its annual Ommegang pageant in
the Grand'Place, re-creating Charles's spectacular procession of
1549. Madrid will follow suit with its own Ommegang procession on
July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Germany will certainly be taking center stage for many events
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hannover 2000, the first World Expo of the new millennium and
the first ever in Germany, runs July 1 through October. Planned as
a celebration of ``Humankind-Nature-Technology,'' it will provide a
395-acre platform for nearly 200 nations and international
organizations to explore global solutions to 21st-century
challenges. Thematic areas will delve into the past and future of
humankind, work, health, communications, the environment, and more.
A Planet of Vision will take visitors into utopian worlds. A
nonstop performing arts schedule _ from Faust to the Scorpions _ is
planned, as are nightly fireworks and laser shows.
</P>
<P>
   If you miss the Passion play in Oberammergau, Germany, this
year, you'll have to wait 10 years for the next performances. After
a 17th-century plague, the villagers of the Bavarian town of
Oberammergau vowed that if saved they would perform the ``Passion
of Christ'' every 10 years. The villagers have kept their promise
and this year present a millennium version of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant event will be the celebration of
Guttenberg's 600th birthday in Mainz, where he introduced printing
with movable type, which led directly to huge advances in
communications and education.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II has inaugurated the Golden Jubilee
Year, inviting Christians everywhere to make a pilgrimage to the
Eternal City and to the dazzlingly refurbished St. Peter's
Basilica. Jubilee events are planned for every week of the year,
peaking with World Youth Day (Aug. 15-20), which could draw more
than 2 million young people.
</P>
<P>
   The city has responded by restoring monuments from the Colosseum
to Nero's Golden Palace and creating a great archeological park to
link the ancient Roman forums. A number of museums have opened,
including the Palazzo Massimo, the Palazzo Barberini, and the
galleries of the Villa Borghese. Brand new are the minimalist
Church of the New Millennium and the monumental, horseshoe-shaped
Citta della Musica, an amphitheater and series of concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   Other important anniversaries:
</P>
<P>
   --One thousand years of the Hungarian Crown (March 15-31).
Exhibitions in Budapest and other cities celebrate the Crown of St.
Stephen, who introduced Christianity as king of the new Magyar
state.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1,000th anniversary of Leif Ericsson's ``discovery'' of
North America on a voyage from Iceland: A replica Viking ship will
retrace his probable route this summer.
</P>
<P>
   --The 200th anniversary of the Rijksmuseum, founded by Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte. Amsterdam celebrates this great collection,
which includes Rembrandt's ``Night Watch,'' with a year of special
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   --The 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach in
Leipzig, Germany (March 8-April 15 and July 21-30).
</P>
<P>
   The 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. Lisbon and all
Portugal celebrate the navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral and the
country's unique relationship with the sprawling South American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   --Oslo's 1,000th year. The Norwegian capital celebrates with a
special edition of the famous Holenkollen Ski Festival (now through
March 12) and with St. Hallvard's Day parades (May 13-17) followed
by a special sound-and-light show at the ruins of the original
settlement at Sorenga.

   &UR;  &LR; It's a long way from Foxborough, Mass. to San Miguel el Alta,
Mexico, but the distance was no obstacle for the New England
Revolution and Major League Soccer in their off-season search for
corporate sponsorships to help finance the still-fledgling league.
</P>
<P>
   When Reebok International Ltd. of Stoughton signalled last year
that it would not renew its four-year sponsorship of the
professional soccer franchise in its own backyard _ in one of the
most robust soccer markets in the country _ the Revolution and MLS
realized they needed a new, aggressive corporate partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the sales figures and the return that we were
producing on our investment over the four years, and it just wasn't
making sense,'' said John McCluskey, director of international
soccer promotions for Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Reebok, the troubled manufacturer of athletic shoes and
apparel that has spent three years revamping its approach to sports
marketing by shedding both athletes and teams as marketing
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Atletica, a new kid on the block in the United States. It
is establishing a beachhead in the lucrative American sporting
goods and apparel market by spending $800,000 to $1.2 million to
sponsor the Revolution and MLS for four years, according to league
officials and industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the idea of working with a new and aggressive company
that has really expanded dramatically into Latin American
markets,'' said Brian O'Donovan, chief operating officer of the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about more than just bringing the MLS to Foxborough,
obviously. The Krafts have purposefully fashioned a role in soccer
internationally, and it makes sense for us to forge relationships
in these new markets, as well. It strengthens that role,''
O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Atletica, a 15-year-old Mexican company that employs about 2,500
people, signed a deal that allows it to feature the Atletica name
on Revolution jerseys and fieldboard signs, stadium announcements,
and radio, as well as a rotating spot for national commercial time
on ABC and ESPN broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go to the American market because we find that
our products sell very well with those people in the US who follow
Latin American teams,'' said Diego Aceves, Atletica's director of
product development. The company supplies uniforms and equipment
for several national teams in Latin America and several teams in
the first division of the Mexican professional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation throughout Latin America is that we really
cater to the needs of the players,'' Aceves said. ``We get many
inquiries for supporting new teams, but this is a first for us in
the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer was structured in 1995 to have three of the
major sports shoe and apparel companies, Nike, Adidas, and Reebok,
participating as sponsors of the league and individual teams. Under
the league's ``single-entity structure,'' MLS receives most of the
money, parceling some of it out to the individual franchises to
cover operating costs, although each of the sponsorships also
included smaller, ancillary deals with franchises.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four years of MLS's existence, Reebok's stock has
tumbled and sales of athletic shoes in the US market have declined
almost across the board. Last year, the sale of athletic shoes
dropped 3.8 percent in the United States, according to the Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association, a trade group in North Palm Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sale of soccer shoes last year actually increased
by 6 percent, to $155 million. Meanwhile, New England has long been
one of the hotter spots for soccer in the United States, driven by
the longstanding competition at the collegiate and high school
levels, as well as the wealth of interest in the internationally
popular game among immigrants from Europe, Latin America, and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Reebok failed to find enough support for its sponsorship of
Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok actually sold more Revolution merchandise than our
competitors who had other teams,'' McCluskey said. ``New England
was in first place because, obviously, they have a very high
attendance, considering the other teams. But, like all of our
competitors, we realized our loss in the first year was to be
expected. But when it continued into the second, third, and fourth
years, we just decided to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCluskey asserted that Reebok's commitment to soccer remains
strong, with its sponsorship of an international competition known
as the Reebok Cup. He also said the company would reconsider
sponsoring MLS if attendance and television viewership improves.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Phipps, MLS's executive vice president for corporate
sponsorships, said that despite Reebok's decision the league has
done well renewing sponsorships in what has been a crucial
off-season. Honda, Budweiser and Pepsi-Cola have all renewed,
Phipps said, and Aquafina, the New York Life Insurance Co., and
Lego have become new sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's been a good off-season for MLS,'' Phipps said.
``In the next 30 days, we'll be making announcements about several
new companies joining.''

<P>
   JAMAICA, N.Y. _ Max Hall is old school. Hard work. Attention to
detail. Even more hard work. Pull out the binoculars and watch
close-up every horse's step, to spot the lame, the improving, the
horse on the down cycle, the ones coming up to a peak. Then even
more work. Watch the tapes at night, slow-motion and rewind, to
spot what the binoculars missed.
</P>
<P>
   But Max Hall can adjust to the times. The new way. Cell phone in
pocket. Keeping in touch. Missing not a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' Max Hall was saying the other
day. ``I mean, in so many ways, the boy is such a good rider, but
he is such a good person, too. I feel for him like he's my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone rings. ``Yes,'' Max Hall can be heard saying.
``Right . . . sure.'' Another trainer eager for Max Hall's ear,
another trainer desperate for Max Hall to say, ``Yes.'' Max's
``boy'' will ride that trainer's horse.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Max Hall was sitting in the racing secretary's office at
Aqueduct when all this was happening, the entries for races two
days away just having been drawn, Max Hall fending off this trainer
and that, all wanting Hall to put his ``boy'' on their horse.
Donald Trump could be handing out $10 bills on the apron at
Aqueduct and he might not be as popular as Max Hall is at this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the hottest apprentice jockey in America is his.
Norberto Arroyo Jr. is his name, he is 22 years old, and he is from
Medford and Somerville. Two years ago, Arroyo was selling sneakers
at the Foot Locker store at a mall in Cambridge, Mass. A few years
before that, ``I wanted to get into Suffolk Downs,'' said Arroyo,
``but they wouldn't let me in.''
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone rings again. Another trainer. Max Hall once again
listens politely, saying ``yes'' and ``sure'' but withholding the
final approval. Max Hall might know every racehorse in New England
but he still isn't sure about many of New York's horses. Old
school. Hard work. The tried-and-true way he has practiced for 30
years. Max Hall will go back that night to the apartment he and his
``boy'' share near Belmont Park, not far from here, and study more
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him on good horses,'' Max Hall said. ``He's such a good
rider that's all he deserves to be on _ good horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked, the man next to Hall volunteers his
opinion. ``He's a natural,'' Phil Johnson offered. ``He has that
natural instinct of a good rider. He can go a long way.'' Phil
Johnson? A great New York trainer for decades. In the racing Hall
of Fame at Saratoga. A man who knows his horses and his riders. ``I
put him on my horses right away,'' Johnson said, ``and I'll do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone rings again. Yet another trainer. More polite talk
from Hall, and then this jockey's agent bares his soul, that he is
reborn, that his wife and children and two grandchildren with two
more grandchildren due April 15 are up in Boston, with Max taking
the shuttle back every Sunday to be with his family, but coming
back down to New York on Tuesday to follow the dream and his
``boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's best of all?'' said Hall, a grandfather as
excited as any 20-year-old about life's prospects. ``How this is so
good for New England. This just doesn't happen in New England, a
jockey like this coming out of New England and causing such a
storm. I just think it's great how this reflects back on New
England and how much attention it'll bring to New England racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Hall, after all, is as Boston as the Old North Church,
``Cheers,'' and the Freedom Trail. He has paid his dues at Suffolk
Downs and Rockingham Park. He never would have thought this could
happen. But it has.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Chris McCarron started his rise nearly three decades
ago has a Boston area jockey created such a fuss as Arroyo. And his
goal, and the goal of Hall's, is as simple as it is profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win the Eclipse,'' said Arroyo. ``That's what I want
most of all. I want to win the Eclipse badly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Arroyo just may be capable of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protocol for meeting a jockey at Aqueduct is to go to the
jockey's room, ask the man in charge to page the jockey, then wait.
At Aqueduct, the man in charge of the room is Braulio Baeza,
himself in the Hall of Fame, a top jockey of the 1960s, the rider
of such great steeds as Buckpasser and Arts and Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy has a future,'' Baeza said. ``He is a very good
apprentice, but it seems he may have a future beyond that. He has
natural instincts and he is fearless. And he is aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for Arroyo to arrive, Baeza spoke of how he gives
pointers to the youth, of how he may spot something that Arroyo did
wrong in a race and then quietly point out the mistake to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is very good about him,'' said the Hall of Famer, ``is
that he doesn't make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo arrived wearing a New York Yankees hat, and when told
this was very bizarre garb for a Bostonian, he blurted out with a
wide smile, ``I have a whole bunch of Red Sox hats in my locker,
too.'' And he makes the point even sharper when he talks about
arguments in the jockeys' room over who is a better shortstop, the
Red Sox' Nomar Garciaparra or the Yankees' Derek Jeter, ``I shout
out, `Nomar! Nomar! Nomar is the best.' '' His personality is
bright and open.
</P>
<P>
   The first time on a horse?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6,'' said Arroyo. ``We used to go out and ride
horses and the man told me to be careful. And when I got out away
from the man, we were riding under a tree and I reached up and
grabbed a branch and ripped it off and I whacked the horse. But I
stayed on the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   This was outside San Juan, but in 1989, when Arroyo was 11, his
father brought the family to the United States. His father,
Norberto Sr., had been a boxer in Puerto Rico (``My father sparred
with Roberto Duran, and my father was undefeated as a
professional'') and the youth followed his father's athletic
instincts, playing virtually every sport. Baseball was his love,
and he said he was the starting shortstop for three years for
Somerville (Mass.) High School, leading the team in hitting.
</P>
<P>
   But the young Arroyo still recalled how much he'd loved riding
horses back in Puerto Rico ``and I wanted to get on a horse here,''
he recalled. ``When I was about 15, I went to the track (Suffolk
Downs) but they wouldn't even let me in the track.'' His cousin,
Enrique Arroyo, was riding at Suffolk, ``and I told them I was
Enrique's cousin, but they still wouldn't let me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo kept on at Somerville High, and he would box and play
soccer as well as baseball, but the lure of the horses just
wouldn't leave him. In time, Suffolk trainer Al Borosh took to the
youth, ``and Mr. Borosh put me on a horse and I'd work in the barn
and walk the horses and do those things,'' said Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing high school, Arroyo found himself managing the
Foot Locker outlet, but the company transferred him to a store in
Florida. ``And when I was in Florida,'' said Arroyo, ``I kept
thinking, `I really want to be a jockey; I really, really want to
be a jockey.' ''

<HEADLINE>
NASD'S ZARB PLANNING FOR GLOBAL TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Zarb is a busy guy.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers
has to hustle just to keep up with the hyper pace of expansion of
its Nasdaq Stock Market, a system that now handles a mind-boggling
2 billion shares in a typical trading day.
</P>
<P>
   But Zarb also spends a lot of time fending off people who want a
piece of the action or others seeking to restructure the entire
market.
</P>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission seems to want the NASD
to merge with the New York Stock Exchange and create one giant,
centralized market that is easier to police. Meanwhile, big
customers like Fidelity Investments are trying to chew into his
business with their own private electronic communications networks,
or ECNs, that trade stock ultraefficiently on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, speaking on a panel at the Boston College economic
conference Monday, was asked point-blank about what happens to the
Nasdaq Stock Market amid all that uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the marketplace and regulators will insist on a
configuration of stock exchanges which do the best job for
investors and the marketplace,'' he said. ``I think we'll just have
to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, no one is really waiting around for a memo
about their future.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD needs to make a compelling case why it should not be
merged and push a strategy to compete successfully against anyone,
including its customers. The point of attack: globalized stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb has launched joint ventures that will establish new Nasdaq
markets in Tokyo and London, known as Nasdaq Japan and Nasdaq
Europe. He said two other international Nasadaq markets were ``on
the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea: create global, around-the-clock stock trading
platforms for investors and stocks anywhere. For starters, the 100
largest Nasdaq stocks will be available for 24-hour trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means more companies can invest in Microsoft and Intel
throughout the world,'' Zarb said. ``We're using pools of liquidity
outside the US to invest in our companies and that's got to be
good. We're also allowing our investors, you, to invest in that
Japanese company, that new IPO, when we're open and they're
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The point about liquidity _ the ability to execute trades at any
time _ was no casual reference. As trading hours are extended into
America's evening and more ECNs get in the act, the ability to
endlessly match buyers with sellers to maintain an orderly market
and keep stock prices from jumbling around has emerged as a big
issue. Stretch markets too thin and that coveted liquidity could
begin to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the trading platform around the world as it works
around the clock, Zarb argues, the Nasdaq markets are actually
improving liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion, however, has come with strings attached. The NASD has
needed partners to move into new parts of the world and share their
ownership. It teamed with Masayoshi Son's Softbank Corp. in Japan.
Nasdaq Europe counts Softbank, News Corp. and Vivendi SA as
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we have to share some of our revenues and we'll
only own a piece of those facilities,'' said Zarb.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD has been able to move into other parts of the world in
part by trading on its brand name. There isn't anything stopping
one of those private trading networks from doing the same thing,
but how many could really pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   So what about a push to merge the NASD with the NYSE?
</P>
<P>
   Though the plan appeals to regulators and some big market
players like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
there are lots of details that make it a difficult deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zarb and NYSE president Richard Grasso must deal with
brokerage and specialist companies that don't want anything to do
with a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Goldman Sachs promote a merger of exchanges
because it would cut costs. But Zarb will tell you competition in
the stock exchange business is international and driven by
technology. He believes that plays to his NASD's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it right we're going to continue to be a dominant
stock market in the US and the world,'' Zarb said. ``If we don't,
we'll lose and we'll deserve to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up still another victory for the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week we told you that Sycamore Networks had moved past
Gillette Co. to become the Massachusetts company with the second
greatest market value. Sycamore, in case you don't know, is a
red-hot, but very small optical networking company that boasts a
market cap of $40.6 billion. Gillette's market cap is $37.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stay in third place didn't last long. By the end of
Monday, CMGI, the Andover, Mass. Internet company, had also moved
past Gillette. CMGI's market cap is $41.1 billion. It goes without
saying that neither Sycamore nor CMGI were profitable in the most
recent quarter.

A PRIMER ON THE THE MIXED ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So much ideological guff has been floated during the last 20
years about the kind of world we live in: ``a private enterprise
system,'' ``an opportunity society,'' ``market capitalism,'' and so
on _ all of it partly true.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who harbors the slightest doubt, however, that we live
more than ever in a ``mixed economy'' should have stopped by Boston
College Monday. There a parade of financial celebrities turned out
at the invitation of US Representative Edward Markey for a daylong
conference on The New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the economy was
growing too fast for its own good and the market went down,
anticipating further increases in short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Gerstner of IBM Corp. speculated on the impact of the
Internet on large firms. Arthur Levitt of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and William Kennard of the Federal
Communications Commission described the changing missions of their
agencies, as did Frank Zarb of the National Association of
Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs including CMGI's David Wetherell, Gururaj ``Desh''
Deshpande of Sycamore Networks, Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Asset
Management, and Kay Koplovitz of Working Woman Network participated
in panels.
</P>
<P>
   And opening the conference, Boston College president William P.
Leahy SJ underscored the politically charged theme that underlay it
when he spoke of ``the justice and fairness issues that have been
at the core of religious concern since the days of the prophets.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowed Markey to an audience of more than 1,000 people, most of
them BC graduates like him (class of 1968, law school 1972), it was
``one of the all-time all-star lineups ever assembled anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What brings Markey such drawing power? He's the ranking Democrat
on the House subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer
protection.
</P>
<P>
   And it is through the committee that virtually all legislation
concerning the Internet, communications satellites, and telephone
services and cable television must pass.
</P>
<P>
   It is because they are located in Markey's district that
Boxbrough, Littleton, Westford, Chelmsford, and Tewksbury bristle
with companies that manufacture the next generation of switching
equipment and software for the Internet. Low rent and a ready-made
work force are part of the story about bustling I-495 _ but so is
the direct access that a factory in the district affords to the
world's ultimate standard-setting body, the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BC understands this nexus of markets and politics better than
most. Monday's meeting took place in the Silvio O. Conte Forum, a
basketball and hockey palace named for the former Western
Massachusetts representative. On the hill above sits the Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill Library. Like Conte, the late US House speaker was
a BC alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   An only-slightly-different ethic prevails at the Massacusetts
Institute of Technology, where the strictly personal is so frowned
upon that, until recently, the buildings were numbered instead of
named for great or generous men and women. Nevertheless, most of
MIT's growth has derived from federal spending on R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
   So when US Representative Michael Capuano recently found $600
million in ostensibly new money headed for the Department of Energy
in the Networking and Information Technology Research and
Development Act, he filed an amendment shifting half of it to the
National Science Foundation, where it would be doled out to
universities _ perhaps even MIT _ rather than government labs.
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, a letter from the Energy Department arrived
over the House fax claiming that the measure would close the
nation's largest unclassified computer facility at California's
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The amemdment sailed through on a
voice vote nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked about it; they never answered until it was too late,''
Capuano said. The funding may be restored. But what better way to
serve notice that the congressman who represents Harvard and MIT
now has a seat on the science committee?

SOME STORES ARE WEB HOLDOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom. These are just
a few of the department stores that have rushed online to sell wine
glasses, chenille blankets, and designer clothing.
</P>
<P>
   So where are Lord &AMP; Taylor, Filene's, Hecht's, and the other
chains owned by May Department Stores Co., the nation's number two
department store operator?
</P>
<P>
   Firmly on the ground, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rivals, May dares to go Internet-free. But it is not
the only Web holdout. Many big businesses retailers have avoided or
delayed chasing after online shoppers for a hodgepodge of reasons,
including the following:
</P>
<P>
   --There's no big rush. Although Internet-only retailers
disagree, big chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. believe they can
catch up and dominate Web sales after late starts.
</P>
<P>
   --Shoppers aren't ready. Some categories, such as luxury goods
and hardware, are still maturing online. That's why home
improvement retailers and jewelers have been slower to move online.
</P>
<P>
   --Channel conflicts continue. Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. tried to claim
the Web for itself, barring retailers like J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
from selling its denims. It didn't work. Home Depot Inc.'s warning
letters to manufacturers have been more effective.
</P>
<P>
   --The Net does not work for everyone. Rolex and other makers of
expensive jewelry like to tightly control retail channels to keep
their prices high and their products exclusive. It's more difficult
to micromanage the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As for May, its motive for avoiding the Web is unclear. Some
industry observers speculate that its individual chains are too
regional to make online forays worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   May spokeswoman Rhonda West said the retailer was indeed selling
products on the Internet: electronic gift cards. As for offering
other merchandise online, she said: ``I'm not sure I can respond to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other old-line businesses are beginning to make compromises. In
a customer survey, Michaels Stores Inc. discovered its consumers
weren't overwhelmingly interested in buying arts and crafts
materials on the Web. So the retailer announced last week that it
will strike a balance, offering mainly an informational site that
will gradually add items for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crafting community is not seriously interested in
purchasing online,'' said Cynthia Gould, a company spokeswoman.
``They want how-to's.''

BEZOS SEES HUGE FUTURE FOR WIRELESS E-COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ So you're sitting in the doctor's office leafing
through a magazine when finally you see the gift you have been
wanting to give your father-in-law for his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   You pull out your wireless phone _ but instead of calling
someone to place an order, you scroll down the little screen to
Amazon.com, and with a few keystrokes on the number pad find the
book you think he'll love, use your Amazon account to order it, and
have an e-mail sent to him to arrange delivery.
</P>
<P>
   As futuristic as that scenario may sound, some wireless
subscribers can already do that today. And Amazon.com founder and
chief executive Jeff Bezos, among many top industry executives who
met here this week for the Wireless 2000 convention, thinks cell
phones, or wireless devices including Palm Pilots and enhanced
digital pagers, could become a major way for people to do business
with his company and other e-commerce firms.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association officials cite
estimates that within five years 830 million wireless devices
around the world will be capable of connecting to the Internet _
not just phones and handheld devices but laptop computers equipped
with wireless modems.
</P>
<P>
   Said Michael Capellas, chief executive of Compaq: ``That's a
good number, but I suspect it's (actually) low.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages for wireless e-commerce is that by
definition, the network can tell where people are _ if not just
which metropolitan area, potentially what city street they are on,
through emerging location technologies that chart a wireless
phone's distance from several towers to pinpoint where the user is
and chart it on a computerized map.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see that many people might find it a little creepy
to have a marketing-minded Big Brother following their every step
down the street, figuring out which store or restaurant to try to
steer them toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine walking by a restaurant and getting a message
(translate ``advertisement'') offering you a lunch special, and it
just happens to be your favorite food at an irresistible price,''
said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta telecommunications analyst. For
Net-enabled wireless devices: ``Push advertising is going to be a
hot trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Zander, president of Sun Microsystems, which is making
a big push into wireless Net services, said he envisions a day when
``my device will know where I am, what I like to eat, and when I
last ate'' and send advertising messages accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos acknowledged that there will be a potentially steep
learning curve for all but the hardiest technology freaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cell phone is a device that people are in such a strong
habit of using one way, for voice. They have to have sufficient
value'' to persuade people to learn how to toggle around a
cell-phone screen to make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, virtually all of the optimistic forecasts for wireless
e-commerce assume that the obvious drawbacks to cell phones _
spotty coverage in some areas, dropped calls, exorbitant airtime
charges _ will either go away or prove to be no serious obstacle to
attracting people to mobile e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems likely that some things will prove much easier to
sell over the phone. Books, CDs, airplane and Amtrak tickets, and
hotel reservations may be considerably easier to pitch wirelessly,
for example, than clothing or jewelry, for which seeing the product
first can be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken for the cellular telecommunications group by Peter
D. Hart Research Associates of 812 US wireless subscribers found
that they seem considerably less interested in using the phone for
e-commerce than in getting reliable voice service.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the most important feature they would look for in a new
phone, 46 percent of respondents cited nationwide coverage and 31
percent a long-life battery, compared to only 9 percent citing
e-mail and Internet access. Twenty-five percent said they have a
great deal or quite a bit of interest in wireless data services,
compared to 44 percent expressing very little interest. Overall, 13
percent of wireless users said they want to use the phone to shop
over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers, however, do not discourage many industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the revenues we get from wireless are minimal,'' Bezos
said, adding: ``If you look far enough into the future I think
we'll be 100 percent'' wireless sales.
</P>
<P>
   If carriers successfully push to get a commission on sales
transacted over their units, ``that's a whole new revenue source
that will be a boon for the wireless industry,'' said Steven
Guggenheimer, Microsoft's director of consumer wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, chief executive of Vodafone Air Touch PLC, which
accounts for more than 10 percent of the world's wireless phone
subscribers, said his company sees large opportunities controlling
that revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be very happy to do deals with Yahoo and AOL,'' Gent
said, but ``we want to make sure we have control of the customer
interface. We have a high ground we don't want to give up'' and
will insist that ``the first icons people will see'' on their
wireless unit screens ``will be associated with our Internet
branding, not someone else's.''

   Getting around Europe is better than ever. This year Denmark and
Sweden will open a 10-mile Oresund crossing between Copenhagen and
Malmo on July 1, completing new rail and auto connections between
the Scandinavian peninsula and the bulk of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's high-speed ICE rail station is open at Frankfurt
Airport. Norway will begin operating high-speed trains from Oslo to
Stockholm and from Oslo to Bergen and Stavanger this year; a new
4.2-mile auto tunnel is open to the island of Mageroya and North
Cape. Athens' new subway lines began operating in late January and
work continues on a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   Europe remains the fastest-growing destination for Americans who
cruise, and these include many making their first trip to Europe.
Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Aegean welcome
new ships this year. River cruises on the Rhine, Danube, Elbe, and
Rhone remain very popular, as do barge cruises through the canals
of France, England, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise passengers fly to Europe to board ships and usually
can choose from a variety of pre- and post-cruise land packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Elizabeth II will again offer regular trans-Atlantic
service and gives passengers a choice of flying one way and sailing
(six days) the other. Some sailings will be from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Europe designates one city to be its Cultural
Capital. But this year, the 15-nation European Union is designating
nine cities as Cultural Capitals for 2000. It is both the first
time more than one city and cities beyond the EU have been named.
They are:
</P>
<P>
   --Avignon, France: famous for its Mozart-loving summer festival.
In April, an exhibition called ``Beauty'' will be at the Palace of
the Popes.
</P>
<P>
   --Bologna, Italy: among Europe's oldest university cities and
famous for its food. A ``Masters at the End of the Millennium''
dance festival will be held yearlong.
</P>
<P>
   --Brussels: capital of Belgium and the EU, and rich in art and
cuisine. A ``Grand Carrousel'' equestrian spectacle will be in
June; Grand'Place will be carpeted in flowers in August.
</P>
<P>
   --Helsinki, Finland: leader in design, architecture, and music.
Culinary concerts will be held throughout the summer, and designer
shows will be held throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Santiago de Compostela: city of Spain's patron saint and a
historic pilgrimage site. Exhibitions include ``Faces of Earth''
and ``Faces of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-ECU cities participating are:
</P>
<P>
   --Bergen: gateway to Norway's fiord country. An International
Dance Festival will be held this month, and the Bergen Music
Festival in May.
</P>
<P>
   --Krakow: city of Polish kings and bishops. Avant-Garde Theater
will take place in March; ``Ballet Spring'' and Wawel Castle
exhibit in May.
</P>
<P>
   --Reykjavik: marking the 1,000th anniversary of Iceland's
Christianization and celebrating artists of every description.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not enough, consider too that Cyprus will host the
Miss Universe pageant May 12-13; European Cup finals are June
10-July 12 in Belgium and Holland; the Tall Ships will race from
Britain to Italy, Spain, and across the Atlantic from April to May,
and in the Baltic, July to August.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely no year to miss Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission offers a number of ways to save
on a trip to Europe:
</P>
<P>
   The commission suggests planning ahead and using a knowledgeable
travel agent to help find the best deals on air fares,
accommodations, and packages.
</P>
<P>
   Internet research is helpful, the ETC says, but agents speed the
shopping process with their access to reservation systems and
industry contacts, and can quickly explain the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Buy as much of the trip as possible before leaving the United
States. Consider vacation packages, which can save time and money,
and which offer a great variety of destinations. Packages range
from basic fly-drive-hotel combinations for independent travelers
to fully escorted group tours to cruises.
</P>
<P>
   --Stop at a city's tourist offices for the latest information on
events, discounts, and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   --Use public transportation. Subways and buses are generally
clean, safe, and reliable. Paris, London, Berlin, Munich, Vienna,
Budapest, Lisbon, Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, and other cities offer
discount travel cards that also often include admission to museums
and other attractions as well as discounts for dining and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   --Take trains between cities: Rail Europe offers many varieties
of the 17-country Eurailpass, as well as five-country Europasses,
regional passes, and national passes (including BritRail passes).
These can all provide savings. Call 1-800-324-RAIL. Rail Europe
also takes reservations for high-speed premier trains, including
the Eurostar trains through the Channel Tunnel. Call 800-EUROSTAR.
</P>
<P>
   --Car rentals are always less costly if reserved in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider traveling beyond major capitals where prices are
always lower.
</P>
<P>
   --Use charge cards instead of cash whenever possible to obtain
good exchange rates (be aware, however, that some cards are now
charging a 2 to 3 percent surcharge on purchase overseas). Also use
automatic teller machines for cash; they can be found almost
everywhere. Before leaving home, check with your issuer to ensure
that your PIN will work in Europe (most machines only accept
four-digit numbers). When exchanging dollars and traveler's checks
go to banks or exchange bureaus rather than hotels.
</P>
<P>
   --When calling home, use a service such as the AT&AMP;T Direct
Service in Europe. There is a local AT&AMP;T access number for
virtually every country in Europe. Also beware of hotel surcharges
to call home, even with the AT&AMP;T service. Check with the hotel as
to its telephone policy.
</P>
<P>
   --Eat where the locals eat, and look for fixed-price tourist
menus when dining out.
</P>
<P>
   -- Look for VAT (Value Added Tax) forms when shopping. Foreign
visitors can usually get refunds on VAT, which can run as high as
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: The euro came into effect in 1999. But, although it is
legal tender in 11 European Union nations, local currency _ francs,
marks, lira, etc. _ will continue to be used for all paper money
transactions until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission has annually produced an
informative booklet on travel overseas. This year, however, this
information is available only on the Internet at
www.visitEurope.com.

CMGI'S LATEST CATCH: A WEB SITE TO LAND FISH BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Check out the latest catch in CMGI Inc.'s net: GoFish.com, an
online seafood marketplace, where a fisherman in Thailand can sell
shrimp to an American grocer.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is making a $12 million venture capital investment in the
year-old company, which is Maine's leading Web business and a
frontrunner in the move toward Web-based seafood sales. CMGI is
based in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The deal wraps up GoFish's second round of financing and gives
it a big headstart over rivals, with a total of $41 million in
venture backing since August.
</P>
<P>
   For CMGI (at)Ventures, this is a pure B2B play, and the money's
coming from the firm's new $1 billion business-to-business fund.
CMGI partner Marc Poirier points out that the wholesale seafood
market is $80 billion strong in the United States and Europe alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that's well-suited to the Internet,'' Poirier
says. ``It's information-sensitive and it's time-sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI expects no less than for GoFish to be the number one online
seafood market for wholesalers. Their advantage, he says, is their
management and history as a credit-rating service to the seafood
business. Chief executive Neal Workman has been in that arena since
1985, when he founded a collection agency for New England
lobstermen. Last year, he decided to turn his SeaFax Inc. into a
Web business, and to expand from credit checks to handling the
actual buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   The company's focus is at the high-price end of the seafood
business. That means crab, shrimp, live lobsters, salmon, and
scallops. The site brings fisherman from Thailand to Equador to the
table with importers and exporters, supermarket chains like
Hannaford Brothers and Stop &AMP; Shop, and large restaurant groups.
</P>
<P>
   GoFish provides real-time prices on seafood. It also offers
credit checks and a collection service to guarantee that sellers
get paid. Since going live in November, $2 million worth of sales
have been conducted on the site. Daily visits to the site exceed
1,300.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to grow those numbers quickly, as it adds
auctions and receivables financing (courtesy of investor GE
Capital) by summer. The draw for users, GoFish says, is to save
money and time.
</P>
<P>
   Explains David Weatherbie, chief operating officer at GoFish:
``Seafood is sourced all over the world, and it can change hands
four to six times before reaching the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``On our site, you can have access to key market
information on pricing and supplies _ information you need to make
important business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all good ideas on the Web, one is never alone. Nipping
at GoFish's heels are sites like fishmonger.com and
GlobalFoodExchange.com. The latter just hooked $12.2 million in
seed financing, led by Charles River Ventures in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Every VC figures he or she has found the best of the players in
a given field. Charles River partner Jonathan Guerster says they
liked GlobalFood Exchange because ``we'd rather back the bigger
category.'' He thinks GoFish may be too narrow a business model.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's Poirier stands behind the GoFish pick: ``I think they're
far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   They and hundreds of other seafood-related companies will get to
strut their stuff this week at the International Boston Seafood
Show. The world's biggest gathering of fish industry folks will be
at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center from Tuesday
through Thursday.

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Millions of people outside the USA suppose
that life in the suburbs is similar to the portrayal in ``American
Beauty'' _ in other words, a paradise of spacious homes surrounded
by green gardens, whatever the season, and indoors a hell of
domestic hatred and frustrated dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's something like that. At times reality is worse than
fiction; at times, better. I've lived for 10 years in an East Coast
suburb and still don't understand a lot of the lifestyle. Once in a
while, on weekends, I meet with ``friends'' from Rutgers
University, and it's rare that we agree on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of them mentioned ``Picture Windows,'' a book by
Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Even, two American culture teachers
in Connecticut. In its preface, the authors confess an initial
bias: ``... We didn't think we could unearth a story in the
suburbs. We thought the suburbs produced an anaesthetized mindset;
they were a non-place ruled by conformity and consumerism.''
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs are much more than that, but human beings do tend to
simplify reality and give too much credence to first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago an Italian journalist visited me in Highland
Park. We strolled through this town of 1,200 residents which has 10
synagogues, six churches of various denominations and a Catholic
temple.
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised that on Main Street, among the travel
agencies, drugstores and pizzerias were nine luxury salons whose
only business was manicures, not to mention six or seven
barbershops, each with its own manicurist. And how busy they all
were. Some customers were willing to wait several hours.
</P>
<P>
   At noon we stopped for a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.
The girl who waited on us had outrageous nails, two inches long and
decorated with arabesques in three different colors. She moved her
fingers with the dexterity of a spider. More than once, when she
was wrapping the hamburgers, I expected those nails to drop off.
</P>
<P>
   At the tables, several fat couples devoured deep-fried onion
rings and sizzling chicken wings coated with flour and grease. Most
of the diners were overweight, and that was also true of many
people in the street when we took a walk after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I saw several neighbors, some of whom greeted me politely. My
friend asked how we had met and I told her their children went to
the same school as my daughter, and many friendships in the town
were born in meetings at school or church.
</P>
<P>
   Some days later when I read her story, I was surprised that
those few bare facts had been enough to create a full scenography:
``The suburb of the United States,'' she wrote, ``is similar to
those in the Hollywood movies. Sedentary life and fast food are
creating an overweight population of lonely people who spend their
time letting their nails grow and painting them extravagantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a kernel of truth in this oversimplification, but
actually any half truth tends to create more false impressions than
an outright lie. If the Italian journalist had stayed longer, we'd
have strolled through the town's two parks, where people run or jog
or power-walk from 7 a.m., till nightfall, year-'round. It's almost
impossible to see an overweight person there.
</P>
<P>
   In big cities, sports are often done for an aesthetic goal: The
body is something that is shown to others. In the suburbs, exercise
is done for health reasons: The body must be kept in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Another essential difference is the meeting places. The city,
all of it, is a place of encounters, a virtual square. In the
suburbs, people have to search for each other because residential
neighborhoods have no social center and people drive cars wherever
they go. Moviehouses with 20 theaters or shopping malls or churches
or even bank drive-in lanes are the substitute places for life in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, sets limits to human relations: to meet, people
make dates. Chance is almost absolutely excluded from day-to-day
life.
</P>
<P>
   The American suburb was born around 1908, when pockets of
affluent families moved from Manhattan to Long Island because they
felt their original neighborhoods were being overrun by poor
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But, as it turned out, life in the suburbs was cheaper and less
socially demanding than in the cities, so the immigrants and the
poor also ended up there. Today almost no suburb lacks a belt of
African-Americans or Hispanics living and growing by its side _ and
providing services to the great houses of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the suburbs is cheaper and safer, but infinitely more
monotonous. By 10 p.m., there's nothing to do. Not even a
restaurant is open; maybe a few bars close as late as 1 a.m. This
monotony leaves gaps in the imagination. Couples devoured by
boredom dream of a better life, and of an unconventional love life.
Any breakdown of the routine becomes an attractive alternative to
trivial reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' the movie, does have an edge in that it
discovers so many truths hidden by outward appearance.
</P>
<P>
   An even more pathetic byproduct of this lifestyle is the fate of
the old men and women who decide to seek shelter in the many
suburban residential clinics and care centers for the aged. At 9
a.m. they are picked up by a municipal bus. It drives a few blocks
to any of several supermarkets, where the old people walk the
aisles in search of an apple, a box of cookies, maybe a tomato _
not because of hunger or lack of money, but because it's something
to do. At 11 a.m., after stops at the post office and the
drugstore, they return to their rocking chairs and bingo games.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is hard to find anywhere, but in the American suburb
it's a daily miracle. ``American Beauty'' shows that such a miracle
is, almost always, a mirage, an impossible goal.

 WEB SITES ESTABLISHING DATABASE DEMOCRACY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Books, cars, and mutual funds are already hawked
online, so why not pitch a congressman or two?
</P>
<P>
   That's the aim of about a dozen new Web sites calling themselves
``democracy portals'' and hoping to turn politics into a lucrative
e-commerce application.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of politicians already have sites of their own, to raise
money and to turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the democracy portals are drawing users with their own
polls, news stories, and bipartisan e-mail debates. And they are
developing high-tech plans to sell their access to potential voters
to the candidates and political parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when all politics is marketing, election pros love the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Voter.com of Boston has signed promotional
agreements with everyone from the Democratic Leadership Council and
the AFL-CIO to the Christian Coalition and the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A rival, Grassroots.com, is targeting local races around the
country, with advice from former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu
and a content deal with the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other entrants include SpeakOut.com, Vote.com, and Voxcap.com.
</P>
<P>
   These for-profit companies all declare they want the Internet to
be an engine of public discourse. But by tracking voters' interests
and e-mail addresses, the sites also expect to build up databases
better than those kept by any political organization to date.
</P>
<P>
   The portals won't share their data with outsiders, but they will
make use of the information as middlemen, their owners say,
channelling e-mail pitches from candidates to users who have
expressed interest in certain causes.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to help candidates better target supporters and lower
the cost of campaigns _ blending the lofty goal of increasing voter
participation with a big dose of dot-com commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a cost of thousands of dollars, the services the Web
companies could provide to candidates would be far cheaper than the
television and radio ads that dominate campaigns today. And in
theory they would allow a deeper discussion of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the public, there's a tremendous frustration with the
existing tools'' of politics, said Justin Dangel, Voter.com's
25-year-old founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Television spots are too brief and expensive to allow candidates
to talk about complex matters like health care and education, he
said, while much news coverage focuses on campaign tactics, not
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No campaign in America will tell you they're happy with the
level of distribution of their issue information,'' said Lawrence
Purpuro, who oversees online efforts for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Purpuro has signed deals with several of the independent portals
since December, in hopes of reaching potential voters who might not
register themselves on sites run by the RNC or the Republican Party
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While the party has a database of 120 million voters, it has
e-mail addresses for just a small fraction of them, Purpuro said,
and needs to build up its electronic contact list to cut its
communication costs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, e-mail has reduced the RNC's fax budget from $25,000 to
$7,000 a month, he said. ``We've made it clear we need to go
digital or die, but how we get there is unclear,'' Purpuro said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and parties have made broad use of the Internet
since the 1998 election cycle, and major Internet and media
companies pump a massive amount of political news and analysis onto
their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political sites draw mainly hard-core party
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the new portals hope to attract more of the swing
voters who decide most elections, then summarize and deliver their
views to politicians and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Celmer, one of the investors in SpeakOut.com, calls it ``the
aggregation of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The packaging of information on electronic visitors begins when
users log in. Many online companies are keen to collect credit card
and Social Security numbers, but the democracy portals often ask
for a person's ZIP code, party affiliation and whether they are
registered to vote, all of which can help politicians target
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Next, many of the portals ask users to specify a few issues they
care most about, such as civil rights, the environment, or crime,
and suggest that users take a brief quiz on each area. The data
amount to a rough ideological and demographic profile of each user.
</P>
<P>
   After providing the information, visitors to Voter.com can then
call up a section called ``My Officials,'' customized by ZIP code.
A user from Dorchester, for instance, would see links to officials
from President Clinton down to the local state representative,
Democrat John A. Hart.
</P>
<P>
   These links don't generate revenue, but Voter.com collects fees
from politicians who want to display more information about
themselves. Currently these include Hillary Clinton, running for
Senate from New York, and Jon Gordon, seeking a congressional seat
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats pay several hundred dollars a month. That's
hardly a significant outlay; Gordon said he plans to spend $1
million if he wins his party's nomination, primarily on broadcast
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Voter.com thinks it can make money on volume, hoping to sign
up virtually every one of thousands of candidates seeking state or
federal office this year. That could generate enough revenue to
make it profitable by 2001, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Other revenue sources include building home pages for candidates
and collecting online contributions, in return for a percentage of
the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who once lived in Natick, said television ads are still
more important than exposure on the Web, but that may change in
several years. ``The big opportunity here (online) is to reduce the
targetting cost,'' of reaching swing voters who might not go to the
polls otherwise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Voter.com hopes to provide its services to people
running for local councils and school boards, a market it estimates
at more than 100,000 candidates nationwide. To help build trust
across party and ideological lines, it has hired executives like
Randy Tate, former head of the Christian Coalition, and Craig
Smith, former manager of Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to turn politics into e-commerce worries observers like
Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   He's made ``a little antsy'' by what he calls ``the
commercialization of citizen communications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornfield said he doubts most of the sites will draw much of
an audience. ``For all but a handful of junkies, politics is an
occasional interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses aim to prove him wrong, by showing they can
expand the market for political talk and lowering communications
costs for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're solving is making political communication
more efficient,'' said Voter.com's Dangel.

REVENGE OF THE RETAIL GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The upstarts at Amazon.com, the Web's biggest retailer, still
can't resist taking jabs at the online efforts of the nation's
biggest retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them? During the past two Christmas shopping
seasons, traditional merchants have bumbled online, irritating
consumers with frequent site crashes, delivery problems, and Web
stores as cluttered as suburban yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be the year the laughs end. There are signs the
brick-and-mortar retailing giants have begun to figure out the Web
and are ready to give their online-only rivals a cyberspace
spanking.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers have ``smelled the coffee,'' said Seema
Williams, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The recent online successes of Gap Inc., outdoors-goods retailer
REI, and even Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. are starting to get noticed in
the electronic marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Although virtual businesses still top the charts in many
categories, old-line merchants such as Victoria's Secret, Office
Depot Inc., and Best Buy Co. Inc. posted large visitor growth rates
at their Internet stores in December, according to a survey by
Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Even some traditional retailers that have had online problems in
the past can no longer be ignored. With powerful brands, they drew
large crowds of online shoppers last year. And they didn't have to
spend millions on advertising to get consumers to recognize their
names.
</P>
<P>
   It may be mammoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc., until recently a
sleeping presence online, that poses the biggest threat to
Internet-only retailers, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see the big discounters and mass
merchandisers come online,'' said Todd Canfield, an analyst with
Gomez Advisors. ``I would be concerned if someone like Amazon was
not worried. And the smaller players and those behind the curve
should be more worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some stumbles, many old-line retailers showed surprising
strength during the 1999 holiday season, said Mike May, an analyst
with the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. ``They
emerged online, and in some cases, surpassed industry watchers'
expectations,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is not yet stiff enough to still the sniping of
the online leaders, however. In a video appearance at a Harvard
Business School conference last month, Jeff Bezos, the cherubic
founder of Web giant Amazon.com Inc., said rival Barnes &AMP; Noble had
a better chance of building a chain of hardware stores in the past
than a thriving Internet bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that ``both sell books, so they must be similar''
does not fly in the new economy, Bezos maintained.
</P>
<P>
   For years, executives at many of the nation's largest retail
chains have boasted that they could easily make the transition to
the Web. They argued that strong brands, large customer bases,
marketing experience, and existing supplier relationships gave them
an edge over Internet-only firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can catch up very quickly,'' said Terry Burman,
chief executive of Sterling Jewelers Inc., which plans to create an
e-commerce site some time in the future. ``I don't think the
learning curve is very steep.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtual retailers don't buy it. They contend the lumbering
old-line merchants failed to grasp electronic commerce from the
start. As recently as two years ago, some big retailers were still
pooh-poohing the idea of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce evolved much quicker than anticipated. And in
categories like computers, books, and music, online sales picked up
so fast that traditional retailers were forced to speed up their
e-commerce efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even migrating to the Web have been items that were never
thought to be easy sells online because of their bulkiness,
expense, and touch-and-feel requirements. Shoppers can now purchase
refrigerators from Sears.com, Anne Klein dresses from
Neimanmarcus.com, and sleigh beds from furniture.com.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, Forrester predicts that online retail sales will
skyrocket to $184 billion, or 7 percent of all US retail sales,
from only $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers want a big chunk of those online sales.
And some have already become the leaders in their categories.
</P>
<P>
   Superstore operator PetSmart Inc., for one, had online revenue
of $7.8 million the fourth quarter of last year. Rival pets.com, a
virtual retailer backed by Amazon.com, had sales of $5.2 million in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales figures are incomplete or unavailable, some
analysts rate traditional retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit
City Stores Inc. as the top consumer electronics sellers on the
Web. Amazon.com probably ranks third in the category.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap and a host of catalog companies lead the apparel market
online. Although the Gap does not release its online sales figures,
Canfield, the Gomez Advisors analyst, believes its aggressive
tactics will soon make it the dominant Internet clothing retailer.
Competitors include Lands' End Inc., Spiegel Inc., L.L. Bean Inc.,
and J. Crew Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As latecomers to the Web, most traditional retailers still lag
behind their Internet-only rivals in performance. Their online
stores are clunkier _ and many don't offer features such as Web
pages personalized to an individual consumer's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual retailers continue to make advances. For example,
parents who shop at SmarterKids.com Inc., a Needham, Mass. online
education store, can type in information about their children _ and
out pops a list of games or toys tailored to their kids' needs and
learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried'' about traditional toy retailers, said
Albert Noyes, executive vice president of SmarterKids.com. ``Let's
assume they do catch up, and I'm confident they will. But it will
be 2001 or so before they get around to the educational (market).''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the most basic level, old-line merchants have discovered
the transition to cyberspace can be wrenching. Some manufacturers
have fought to keep their products offline or have tried to claim
the Web as their own selling space. Store employees finger the
Internet as an enemy that will siphon away their sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can just quickly become an Internet
presence,'' said Scott Segal, chief executive of ijewelry.com, an
Internet-only jewelry retailer. ``It's really a sense of arrogance.
It's because they don't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual retailers acknowledge their old-line rivals may have
more experience in distributing merchandise to their stores. But
that does not necessarily translate into the know-how to pack and
ship orders, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are catalog retailers such as Eddie Bauer and
L.L. Bean. Because they have the fulfillment side of the business
down to a science, they are adapting quickly to the Web and have
scored high ratings from online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for traditional merchants has been the high
market values placed on Internet-only retailers, which keeps them
flush with cash. Investors recently have cast more critical looks
at unprofitable virtual merchants _ but not Amazon.com, which still
has nearly 10 times the market value of Barnes &AMP; Noble's bn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bn.com executives say they plan to be profitable in the last
quarter of 2001, while some analysts estimate that Amazon.com will
make a profit in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that they (Amazon.com) have actually given a
date,'' sniffed Steve Riggio, vice chairman and acting chief
executive of bn.com, a joint venture between the nation's biggest
bookseller and publisher Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bn.com, Amazon.com has expanded beyond books and compact
discs into a hybrid Wal-Mart of the Web. In three years, it has
become an auction site, a toy seller, an electronics retailer, and
a landlord for other online businesses. Eventually, Amazon.com's
Bezos _ who started with books _ says he wants to sell everything
online, except live animals and guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional retailers are not going to cede their
business to the likes of Amazon.com without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and other big chains are getting more serious about
strengthening their Web sites. Last week, Wal-Mart announced it was
hiring Jeanne Jackson, former chief executive of the Gap's
successful Banana Republic, to head its e-commerce division. The
world's largest retailer also is moving its Internet unit to
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we're the Wal-Mart of the Web,'' said Wal-Mart
spokeswoman Melissa Berryhill.
</P>
<P>
   Other old-line merchants are starting to ``get it'' by
experimenting with different business models and cleaning up their
sites, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Bloomingdales.com confounded online shoppers
with blinking lights and a busy Web design. Today, the flickering
lights are gone _ and the department store's online aisles are now
clear of clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., which has struggled in the old world, has
decided to bring what it does best to cyberspace. At its Internet
store, consumers will find stoves, sewing machines, and cordless
drills.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking another way to tap into the Web, Sears recently
announced that it would team up with Carrefour SA, the world's
second-largest retailer, to create the industry's largest supply
exchange on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap is one of the few traditional retailers that managed to
knit its offline and online operations early in the game. Internet
shoppers, for example, can return purchases to regular stores. In
eight of its stores, customers can now use interactive kiosks to
check out the Internet clothing assortments.
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers can locate any Gap store on the ground with a
few mouse clicks, while offline customers will find the Gap's Web
address on shopping bags and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco retailer has added several goodies to its Web
store, including a customer wish list and a clearance section. It
is now developing a feature that will allow customers to pick out
the perfect pair of pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bn.com, in the meantime, has begun testing a 24-hour delivery
service in New York. If expanded nationwide, the company could gain
ground in its race against Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kratz, a 29-year-old public relations employee from New
York, has been won over by the service. Last week, bn.com delivered
her order for the novel ``Disgrace'' in 24 hours, giving her enough
time to read it for her book club meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When she bought her first book online, Kratz bypassed Amazon.com
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnes &AMP; Noble is a name I'm more familiar with,'' she
explained.

ON-THE-EDGE ENTREPRENEUR THRIVES ON RISK 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WOODSIDE, Calif. _ In Silicon Valley, where failure is worn
like a badge of courage, Ann Meceda is a shining example of
success.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, she is already on her third start-up, having been chief
executive of one, executive vice president of new media for
another, and now executive vice president of business development
at a third Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no signs of fatigue, Meceda agreed to sit down for
dinner recently to discuss what it feels like to be part of a new
generation of hard-charging, risk-defying, and nomadic
entrepreneurs flooding the Valley with wave after wave of Internet
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like the concept of starting with nothing and creating
something out of it,'' said Meceda, looking relaxed and composed in
her gray sweater and indigo jeans as she nibbled on a chicken
sandwich at Buck's, an eclectic diner that over the years has
become the de facto breakfast hangout for Silicon Valley venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged journey for Meceda began in 1997, six months before
she was to graduate from the Haas School of Business at the
University of California at Berkeley. Meceda and a group of fellow
classmates launched a start-up called Private Communications Corp.
as a project for a class on entrepreneurship. PCC was built around
the concept of an ``anonymous, disposable telephone number'' that
could be used by online dating services to let people extend their
online chats over the phone without having to disclose their real
phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In May, just weeks before graduating, Meceda became the
company's CEO, knowing that the business could just as easily burst
into flames as catch on like wildfire. Her decision to forgo a job
in Paris with a global entertainment company to head a risky
start-up became the subject of a 1998 Harvard Business School case
study.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after she took the job, PCC ran out of money, despite
having raised $324,000 in capital, and Meceda moved on. She jumped
to another start-up, HLH Entertainment, a music production company
in San Francisco, as chief financial officer and then executive
vice president of new media. Folks at HLH didn't bat an eyelash
over her experience at a failed start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech start-up business is like baseball, according to
Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped
found Claris Corp. among other companies. One can ``fail 70 percent
of the time and still be considered a success,'' Komisar wrote in
his upcoming book, ``The Monk and the Riddle,'' which is being
published in May by the Harvard Business School Press. ``The Valley
recognizes that failure is an unavoidable part of the search for
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Meceda, the daughter of two entrepreneurs, seems unfazed by past
adversity or the possibility of sudden failure in the future. She
is now involved in an Internet start-up that is currently in
``stealth mode,'' a Silicon Valley tactic that calls for absolute
secrecy about the company's business plan in order to prevent
copycats during the crucial ramp-up phase. The wraps come off in
April. By then, her company would have created a comfortable head
start over its rivals, Meceda says. Until then, she is not even
allowed to reveal her company's name.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she is a millionaire yet, Meceda laughed and said
no. After a moment's thought, however, she changed her answer.
``Maybe,'' said Meceda, who explained that her equity in HLH might
be worth $1 million, depending on how well the company did in its
last round of financing. ``I'm just not sure,'' she said with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Meceda noted that some of her peers talk about ``being done,''
accumulating enough wealth to be able to pursue other interests.
``It's about achieving a sense of financial freedom, to have a
choice as opposed to having money for money's sake,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Meceda doesn't look forward to ``being done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have an endpoint,'' Meceda said. ``As long as
people keep coming up with ideas, I've got a job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE AND SPOKANE _ A month ago Bill Bradley came within four
percentage points of beating a sitting vice president in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29 he trailed behind Al Gore in another stronghold of
independent voting and campaign-finance reform, Washington state,
by a humiliating 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington primary is an eccentric affair: a ``nonbinding
beauty contest'' that does not do anything so pedestrian as
allocate delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to spend six consecutive days campaigning
there _ against the advice of his staff and leading supporters,
such as New York's retiring senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan _ not
only reduced the amount of time he could spend campaigning in the
bigger states that went to the polls on March 7. It turned what
should have been a minor contest into a major test of virility.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Democratic Party elders are urging Bradley
to end his agony and pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to broadcast a five-minute-long appeal to voters on
CBS last Thursday night (appropriately at the same time that most
viewers tune into ``ER'' on NBC) suggested that he would remain in
the race, albeit as a spent force, until Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this former basketball star and Senate veteran turn out
to be such a dismal candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of money. Bradley, a darling of Wall Street,
had more cash on hand than Al Gore after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of infrastructure. The Bradley campaign
spent a small fortune in Washington state on television advertising
(including ads questioning Gore's environmental record). Every day
it sends a torrent of e-mails and faxes to anyone who has ever
expressed a polite interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And not because of a lack of ideas. Bradley courageously tried
to make health care an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that Bradley was simply mugged. A less
honorable man might have been quicker to respond to Gore's
truth-twisting attacks on his health-care policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also partly a victim of his party's electoral
timetable, which left a month between New Hampshire and the next
Democratic primary. That period has given the vice president a
chance to armor-plate his lead, while the media have focused
exclusively on the helter-skelter of Republican races.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Bradley is the fact that his
style is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Whitelaw, a British Tory grandee, once accused Labor
activists of going around the country ``stirring up apathy.'' That
has often seemed to be the essence of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a laconic speaker that one wonders whether the
candidate or the audience will fall asleep first. And he is such a
self-involved figure that he is incapable of connecting with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The omens were bad last year when he gave a speech in Los
Angeles lamenting the growing divide between blacks and whites. The
audience, many of whom were Hispanic or Asian, looked on in
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he attended one of those churches where everybody
claps their hands and sways their bodies. The impassive Bradley
could have been attending a Senate hearing on U.S.-Icelandic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with a group of sympathetic reporters in New Hampshire, he
would not even say what book he was reading, for fear of opening
up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's failings have been rendered all the more transparent
by John McCain's successes.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley mumbles that Al Gore is not entirely honest,
McCain promises to beat the vice president like a drum on the
campaign-finance question; while Bradley bows the knee to Al
Sharpton in New York, McCain taunts the religious right for being a
bunch of bigots.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that floating voters should flock to the
charismatic arsonist rather than the dithering professor. Bradley
is an insurgent who failed to insurge. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In general, Bradley's failing campaign has left Gore in a
remarkably strong position. Gore has proved that he can survive a
challenge by a well-funded and well-respected rival.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived it without leaving too many hostages to fortune
(forcing senior army officers to support gays serving openly in the
armed forces being an exception). And the Democratic machine is
solidly behind Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few doubts remain. The fact that Bradley, a man whose ear
for politics now seems so tinny, could come so close to toppling
the vice president in New Hampshire suggests considerable
discontent about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And, whatever else, the two Republicans have both been through a
ruthless examination.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from McCain, Bush distanced himself from the bigotry
of Bob Jones University; Gore has failed to condemn the bigotry of
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, who denounced ``white-boy
attitudes'' as a synonym for ``I must exclude, denigrate and leave
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore may yet come to regret Bradley's disdain for street
fighting almost as much as Dollar Bill's supporters currently do. &QL;

COLLEGES ASK FOR HELP TO END STUDENT BIDDING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid an escalating bargaining war that has colleges wooing
students with financial aid packages that include summer jobs and
trips to Europe, a growing number of college administrators want
the federal government to reverse a decade-old ban on tuition
``price fixing.''
</P>
<P>
   The colleges want the federal government to allow them to return
to a system under which they could all agree on how much financial
aid to offer needy students, preventing the current free-for-all in
which colleges try to outbid one another. In 1991, the Justice
Department charged 11 trend-setting colleges that shared this
information with violating antitrust laws, ultimately forcing them
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current free market, schools now use more and more aid
to attract top-notch, wealthier students with merit awards or
tuition discounts, leaving less aid available for needier students.
And colleges are paying for the discounts they offer the more
attractive students by targeting other groups of applicants to pay
full fare, which now reaches beyond $30,000 a year at many schools.
Those who get hurt, administrators say, are the poorer or
middle-income students who don't have some special talent to set
them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees that there's got to be a better way; this
unbridled, winner-take-all effort is extremely expensive, not only
for the institutions, but for the consumer, whose interest the
federal government was supposedly aiming at,'' said Joseph Russo,
director of financial aid at Notre Dame. ``Where do these price
discounts get funded? They get funded by tuition. Who pays tuition?
People pay tuition, and they're borrowing like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last month in Dallas, several prominent college
administrators called for the federal government to come up with a
new policy that would allow cooperation on financial aid packages _
exempting the schools from antitrust laws. They later repeated that
call in Washington before a Senate hearing on the increasing cost
of tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Those watching the debate say it will heat up in the next year,
as two things happen. First, the consent decree under which the
schools agreed to stop conferring on aid will expire. Second, the
legislation that currently limits cooperation is up for renewal,
which opens it to tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about the corruption of the essential
charitable mission,'' said Gordon Winston, director of the Williams
College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, who spoke at
the session in Dallas. ``These guys with their car dealership
mentality _ slash and burn, give them a year-end discount and sink
them _ they're forgetting entirely what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges warned a decade ago that this would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1950s, about two dozen colleges known as the
Overlap Group had met at the Wellesley Club each spring to agree on
how much financial aid to offer the students they had accepted in
common. That way, when it came time to choose which college to go
to, each student would get the same package from all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that aid would be based on need, and everyone
used the same definition of need. The general idea, the schools
argued, was that there was only so much money to go around, and
that schools should use it wisely and charitably.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, however, didn't see it as charity, but
as price fixing, and in 1991, entered a consent decree with the Ivy
League colleges under which they agreed to stop sharing any
information. Only the Massachusetts Institute of Technology fought
the government, and, after winning one round on appeal, also
settled with a similar agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the federal government changed its
definition of financial need, so that, for instance, a family did
not have to include home equity above $150,000 when figuring how
much it could afford to contribute to the cost of tuition.
</P>
<P>
   With this and the end of Overlap, there was no common definition
of need. Schools began using aid packages as a way to go after
students they really wanted. Duke, for example, famously lured a
significant number of top-ranked black students away from Harvard
in 1994 with the prospect of travel and summer jobs. Such perks are
no longer rare, and it is even more common for students to try to
use one school's offer to entice another school into giving a
better discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overlap served the very real purpose of letting us behave as
charities in a way that made sense,'' Winston said. ``We were not
squandering our charitable resources on people who were haggling
and bidding for the best deal they could get. And we are making
haggling more successful by allowing them to do it. The next-door
neighbor of the family that just got $10,000 knocked off the price
sees that and says, `But I make less money than he does. What about
me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of looking like they are buying students, many schools
insist that they offer ``need-based financial aid.'' But the
different definitions of need mean that the students they offer aid
to aren't always those who might generally be thought of as
``needy.'' As one college president said, ``Need is, if I need a
quarterback, I give financial aid to a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of directors of financial aid, many schools now
employ ``enrollment managers'' to decide what percentage of
wealthy, full-price students they need to enroll to allow them to
give aid to top-notch students, who may or may not be needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle isn't between the schools and the applicants,
it's between the poor applicants and the wealthy applicants and the
deserving but non-needy applicants,'' said Thane Scott, a lawyer at
Palmer and Dodge who represented MIT in its case against the
Justice Department. ``If I were not a spectacular cellist, but a
pretty good student and poor, these would not be good times. The
very wealthy will always have a place to go, the very talented poor
will always have a place to go. But the middle is facing increasing
problems. We're not just talking the middle quartile, it's by far
most people going to most schools.''
</P>
<P>
   College officials say they doubt anyone would want to return to
the Overlap system the way it existed. Once it was exposed and
called ``price fixing,'' colleges were shamed by it.
</P>
<P>
   What they suggest is that colleges could agree to certain
principles and practices. That would begin with a recommitment to
award financial aid according to need, but also include agreement
on how to determine need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, the federal government would make clear that schools
could enter into enforceable agreements on how they measure the
ability of families to pay for college,'' said Michael McPherson,
the president of Macalester College, who has written extensively on
financial aid and testified at the Senate hearing. ``The system
would become more transparent, it would be clearer when schools
were trying to attract students with particular qualities, and
provide an easier playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But for schools to be willing to share information, officials
said, Congress would have to pass a law explicitly exempting the
practice from antitrust laws. A statute passed in 1997 allows
schools that are entirely need-blind in their admissions _ meaning
they do not consider a student's ability to pay in deciding whom to
accept _ to share information with other institutions. Only a very
few schools, Harvard and MIT among them, are completely need-blind.
</P>
<P>
   That law is set to expire at the end of September 2001, which
has many administrators calling for Congress to revise and extend
it to include schools that are mostly need-blind in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   But that presumes that colleges would agree to the limits. And
not everyone agrees the old system was best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trustees as well as anyone who understands the free market
says, `Hey, lookit, if we put our money down, we get to set the
rules,' '' said William Elliott, vice president for enrollment at
Carnegie Mellon University, which spends between 75 and 80 percent
of its aid budget on merit aid, up from 25 or 30 percent 10 years
ago. ``In the long run, people ought to be spending their money to
improve their academic position. In the past 10 years, we
absolutely have gotten better quality of students.''
</P>
<P>
   And to some small schools, it's simply self-serving that the
bigger and richer schools would be asking to stop the competition,
a point some at the larger schools concede.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Breneman, dean of the School of Education at the
University of Virginia, who spoke in Dallas, said that even
agreement among the top schools to limit their competition would
restore some fairness to the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are perfectly understandable economic reasons why we're
never going to recapture some notion of everyone doing this on pure
need,'' he said. ``But when the very top group is not able to keep
the competition in check, there's no hope for the rest of us. The
30 or 40 top schools have a symbolic stance. What they do filters
down so dramatically in public perception. And people do feel
there's something that's been lost.''

   SEATTLE AND SPOKANE _ A month ago Bill Bradley came within four
percentage points of beating a sitting vice president in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29 he trailed behind Al Gore in another stronghold of
independent voting and campaign-finance reform, Washington state,
by a humiliating 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington primary is an eccentric affair: a ``nonbinding
beauty contest'' that does not do anything so pedestrian as
allocate delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to spend six consecutive days campaigning
there _ against the advice of his staff and leading supporters,
such as New York's retiring senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan _ not
only reduced the amount of time he could spend campaigning in the
bigger states that went to the polls on March 7. It turned what
should have been a minor contest into a major test of virility.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Democratic Party elders are urging Bradley
to end his agony and pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to broadcast a five-minute-long appeal to voters on
CBS last Thursday night (appropriately at the same time that most
viewers tune into ``ER'' on NBC) suggested that he would remain in
the race, albeit as a spent force, until Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this former basketball star and Senate veteran turn out
to be such a dismal candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of money. Bradley, a darling of Wall Street,
had more cash on hand than Al Gore after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of infrastructure. The Bradley campaign
spent a small fortune in Washington state on television advertising
(including ads questioning Gore's environmental record). Every day
it sends a torrent of e-mails and faxes to anyone who has ever
expressed a polite interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And not because of a lack of ideas. Bradley courageously tried
to make health care an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that Bradley was simply mugged. A less
honorable man might have been quicker to respond to Gore's
truth-twisting attacks on his health-care policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also partly a victim of his party's electoral
timetable, which left a month between New Hampshire and the next
Democratic primary. That period has given the vice president a
chance to armor-plate his lead, while the media have focused
exclusively on the helter-skelter of Republican races.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Bradley is the fact that his
style is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Whitelaw, a British Tory grandee, once accused Labor
activists of going around the country ``stirring up apathy.'' That
has often seemed to be the essence of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a laconic speaker that one wonders whether the
candidate or the audience will fall asleep first. And he is such a
self-involved figure that he is incapable of connecting with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The omens were bad last year when he gave a speech in Los
Angeles lamenting the growing divide between blacks and whites. The
audience, many of whom were Hispanic or Asian, looked on in
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he attended one of those churches where everybody
claps their hands and sways their bodies. The impassive Bradley
could have been attending a Senate hearing on U.S.-Icelandic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with a group of sympathetic reporters in New Hampshire, he
would not even say what book he was reading, for fear of opening
up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's failings have been rendered all the more transparent
by John McCain's successes.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley mumbles that Al Gore is not entirely honest,
McCain promises to beat the vice president like a drum on the
campaign-finance question; while Bradley bows the knee to Al
Sharpton in New York, McCain taunts the religious right for being a
bunch of bigots.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that floating voters should flock to the
charismatic arsonist rather than the dithering professor. Bradley
is an insurgent who failed to insurge. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In general, Bradley's failing campaign has left Gore in a
remarkably strong position. Gore has proved that he can survive a
challenge by a well-funded and well-respected rival.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived it without leaving too many hostages to fortune
(forcing senior army officers to support gays serving openly in the
armed forces being an exception). And the Democratic machine is
solidly behind Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few doubts remain. The fact that Bradley, a man whose ear
for politics now seems so tinny, could come so close to toppling
the vice president in New Hampshire suggests considerable
discontent about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And, whatever else, the two Republicans have both been through a
ruthless examination.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from McCain, Bush distanced himself from the bigotry
of Bob Jones University; Gore has failed to condemn the bigotry of
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, who denounced ``white-boy
attitudes'' as a synonym for ``I must exclude, denigrate and leave
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore may yet come to regret Bradley's disdain for street
fighting almost as much as Dollar Bill's supporters currently do. &QL;

FOR POLITICIANS, THERE'S GOLD IN THE CALIFORNIA HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMA, Calif. _ It all started here, in the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada. Down a slender rocky trail bordered by brambles and
blackberries is a dirty creek, only a few feet in width,
unremarkable in every way, leading, like a hundred other nameless
arms of water, to the South Fork of the American River. But on the
morning of Jan. 24, 1848, a craftsman named James Wilson Marshall
put his hand into the cold flow and removed some mysterious metal
flecks.
</P>
<P>
   The flecks were gold, and the discovery, at the site of one of
John A. Sutter's sawmills here in the gnarly green hillsides of
California, began an American river of a different sort, a mad,
manic, and miraculous flow of people into a faraway territory
occupied mostly by Indians, owned technically by Mexico, and
destined to be a place that is uniquely American. That American
river still flows, and today, more than a century and a half later,
it is the artery of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   The gold rush led miners, outlaws, speculators, dreamers,
financiers, explorers, and adventurers to bore deep into the hidden
veins of California. And what they found in their explorations
would define its politics and mold its character: Boundless hopes.
Unimaginable riches. Cultural diversity. And a primal affinity for
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of gold made California instantly rich. It became
a magnet for migrants who hurried West _ by foot in small overland
parties (vulnerable to bandits, beasts and braves), by carriage
(often wrecked, along with their occupants' hopes, in raging
rivers), by the sea (17,000 ships in the first year after gold
fever), eventually by rail (in a journey so dusty that passengers
were issued brooms). It prompted the ruthless alteration of the
landscape. It celebrated the initiative of the individual _ but it
rewarded the efforts of the big corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It set in motion waves of migration, wealth-creation, and change
that continue to this day and hour, shaping the state's government,
politics _ and voter preferences in primaries. The Gold Rush led to
the growth of a finance empire and a rail boom, which led to the
endowment of an education empire, which led to the high-tech
revolution. From Sutter's Mill to Silicon Valley in five
generations; nothing like it has ever happened anywhere, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``California uses the wealth of the last revolutionary change as
the venture capital for the next revolutionary change,'' said
William B. Fulton, perhaps the best-known urban planner in the
state. ``What makes California different from the rest of the West
is that the Gold Rush allowed California to be self-financing. The
rest of the West depended on San Francisco, or New York, for
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Western cornucopia
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And California sketches the outline of the American Dream _ here
people speak of California Dreaming, which was a process before it
was a lyric _ on a canvas that is bigger, richer, gaudier than any
canvas any place else. This is a state with 209 active oil fields,
4,856 commercial fishing boats, 847 wineries, and 504 working mines
_ mines where, geologists believe, 90 percent of the state's gold
is still to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   This is a slice of land that accounts for 158,693 square miles
of the American continent (room for 18 New Hampshires), a place so
varied that it includes the highest mountain in the 48 contiguous
states (Mount Whitney, at about 15,000 feet) and the lowest trough
in the continent (Death Valley, at 276 feet below sea level). It
created the first nationally accepted bank credit card, passed the
first no-fault divorce law (and the first ``Right to Die'' law),
was the setting for the first motion picture theater, and was the
first place that the tart, alluring loganberry was cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   It produces more goods and services than Canada or Russia. It is
high-tech exporter to the nation, and the world. It accounts for
more than a half the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts,
including 91 percent of the grape crop and 72 percent of the
lettuce crop, the raw materials of the signature California
comestibles: wine and salad. It has 685 radio stations and 90
television stations. It has 34 million people _ many of them
high-tech workers, cool and edgy in their garage laboratories,
their Silicon Valley factories or, increasingly, in their office
suites in San Francisco's Financial District _ and millions more
who, as Richard G. Lillard put it in ``Eden in Jeopardy,'' are the
people who ``chop, trim, thin, girdle, top, stoop, bend, feel, dig,
pound, cut, walk, climb, reach up and out, carry, amid heat, dust,
cold, rain, mud, insects, from dawn to sundown.''
</P>
<P>
   All that plus one more thing: Change.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Californians change. They alter their consciousness, and
ours. They change our fashions and our workspaces. They change the
way we eat (coming soon: kosher burritos), the way we drive
(right-on-red started here), the way we work, the way we entertain
ourselves, the way we love, the way we fight, the way we think.
Isadora Duncan changed the way we dance. Jack London and John
Steinbeck changed the way we read. Ronald Reagan changed the way we
govern. A new development on Redondo Beach, with 15 detached homes
(4 BRs, no garage) built around a rose garden on a concrete slab
above a retail development, may change the way we live.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the country is always catching up to California,''
says Leonard Pitt, a retired historian at California State
University in Northridge. ``The state embraces change because there
is no way to stop change here.''
</P>
<P>
   Or growth. Each day the state grows by about 2,000 people, and
it is not only the population that grows big; a tree that is known
as the General Sherman is 275 feet tall and 103 feet around. San
Diego grew more than 1,000-fold in the four decades between 1940,
when it was a sleepy Navy town, and 1980, when it emerged as a
power center and the base of a politician named Pete Wilson, who
served as mayor, senator, and governor and whose crackdown on
immigration in 1994 may one day be regarded as the pivotal
political move (and most stupendous blunder) of the 20th century.

   This wild growth _ California grew three times faster than the
rest of the nation in the 1930s and 1940s _ and the huge wealth it
spawned sometimes created a spiritual vacuum, filled by evangelists
like Aimee Semple McPherson and Robert P. Schuller, both of whom,
it is no accident, had their own radio stations. Drive around Los
Angeles today and you will see the St. Vincent de Paul Roman
Catholic Church, Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple, Iglesia de Dios
Pentecostal Church, St. John's Episcopal Church, the Russian
Orthodox Church of the Holy Virgin Mary, the Masid Omar Ibn
Ackhattab mosque and the Wilshire Boulevard Temple. In the 3.06
square miles of Jefferson Park alone, there are 96 places of
prayer, including 44 Pentacostal churches, two mosques, and places
of worship for two new Japanese religions, one for Korean
Presbyterians, and one for Rastafarians.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the state screams new, but in truth California
was transformed by both world wars of the 20th century, which
provided an economic jumpstart (bringing aircraft plants to Los
Angeles, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara and Burbank and planting suburbs
everywhere) and an ideological shock treatment (altering decades'
worth of fixed views, particularly about the world outside). A
sturdy redoubt of isolationism became, as Earl Pomeroy wrote in a
history of the Pacific Slope, ``staging area, training camp, all
but battleground, and finally meeting place for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The face of California changes constantly in part because the
faces of Californians have always changed so rapidly. Only three
dozen years ago, while the rest of the nation was engaged in a
civil rights revolution, Californians voted to repeal fair housing
regulations. Those battles seem antiquarian in a place that already
is a minority majority state; white non-Hispanics account for less
than half the population. A third of California is Hispanic. Only a
third of the residents of Los Angeles County are white today; by
the year 2040, according to new projections by the State Department
of Finance, 2 out 3 Angelenos will be Hispanics.

A DAZZLING ARRAY OF EVENTS IN EUROPE

   If there was a year to visit Europe, this is it! Europe is
welcoming the 21st century with some great happenings _ a world's
fair with a vision of the future, a mammoth picnic, a towering
Ferris wheel over London, a once-in-a-decade Passion play, and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is still the number one destination for Americans seeking
heritage, culture, architecture, museums, grand sights from ancient
castles to soaring mountains, and glorious food. This year's
celebrations, from the Jubilee Year in Rome to thousand-year
anniversaries, only add to the reasons to pack your bags and head
across the Atlantic for, perhaps, some once-in-a-lifetime memories.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with such a festive menu is deciding when to go
to join in the celebrations Europe has planned. All this means the
Europeans are expecting more Americans than ever. The number of
Americans with the means to go (adults in households with incomes
of $60,000 plus, according to the ETC) has doubled over the past 10
years to more than 60 million, and at least 25 percent of the
projected 12 million-plus US citizens heading to Europe will be
going for the first time, according to Einar Gustavsson of Iceland,
US chairman of the 29-nation European Travel Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Making the journey a bit easier is that the dollar is strong and
air fares are attractive, according to the European Travel
Commission. The ETC says the dollar is buying 19 percent more in
euros and other European currencies than it did when the euro was
inaugurated in January 1999, and with airlines adding more
trans-Atlantic flights and seats, competitive pressures are there
to fill seats and hold down fares.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, London unveiled a vast Millennium Dome filled
with 14 stunning exhibitions ranging from an enormous see-through
human body to millennial looks at communications, recreation,
spirituality, etc. Artist David Hockney and designer Sir Cameron
Mackintosh are among those who developed the projects. Performances
are held in the dome and the nearby Baby Dome.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther up the Thames is the London Eye, a
450-foot-tall Ferris wheel that at any one time will carry nearly
1,000 passengers high above the river and the Houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the Millennium, London has opened a new Tate Gallery of
Modern Art and a new Millennium Bridge. Other projects include
major new science and environmental centers elsewhere in England
and in Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   France plans two unique Millennium Year events open to all: On
June 21, the first day of summer will be greeted by PeripheRock, a
grand music fest set up on the wide peripherique highway circling
Paris. The road will be closed to traffic, transformed into a huge
nightclub with wired stages, and taken over by scores of rock
bands, music groups, and the public. There will be additional
performances in the capital's major squares and in cities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Bastille Day, July 14, more than 3 million people are
expected to take part in The Incredible Picnic, to take place on
scores of sites stretching 620 miles along the Meridieine Verte
between Dunkirk and the Pyrenees. In Paris alone, mile-long picnic
tables will be set up at the Louvre, in Montmartre and on an Orly
Airport runway. Open to all, each site will offer local
specialties. Baton relays will meet at the meridian midpoint and an
armada of aircraft will buzz the entire line between 2 and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Emperor Charles V, was the man of the 16th century, and now on
the 500th anniversary of his birth, four of the countries he ruled
will hold special exhibits and celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ghent's Prinzenhof in 1500 and brought up in Belgium,
Charles V inherited vast empires, including those of Spain,
Austria, and the Low Countries. A central figure of the 16th
century, he led the opposition to Martin Luther in Germany, fought
France for control of Italy, halted the relentless Ottoman advance
at Lepanto, and expanded Spain's new world holdings before
abdicating in Brussels in 1555 and retiring to a monastery in
Spain's Sierra de Gredos.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Ghent will exhibit 19th-century renderings of
Charles's career; in Mechelen there will be an exhibit of
tapestries of Charles (May 26-Oct. 8) and other exhibits will be
held in Leuven, Antwerp, and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Spain will hold the ``Art and the Kings of Spain'' exhibition in
Barcelona through May, and related exhibitions will be held in
LaCoruna and Granada April through June.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4 and 6, Brussels holds its annual Ommegang pageant in
the Grand'Place, re-creating Charles's spectacular procession of
1549. Madrid will follow suit with its own Ommegang procession on
July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Germany will certainly be taking center stage for many events
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hannover 2000, the first World Expo of the new millennium and
the first ever in Germany, runs July 1 through October. Planned as
a celebration of ``Humankind-Nature-Technology,'' it will provide a
395-acre platform for nearly 200 nations and international
organizations to explore global solutions to 21st-century
challenges. Thematic areas will delve into the past and future of
humankind, work, health, communications, the environment, and more.
A Planet of Vision will take visitors into utopian worlds. A
nonstop performing arts schedule _ from Faust to the Scorpions _ is
planned, as are nightly fireworks and laser shows.
</P>
<P>
   If you miss the Passion play in Oberammergau, Germany, this
year, you'll have to wait 10 years for the next performances. After
a 17th-century plague, the villagers of the Bavarian town of
Oberammergau vowed that if saved they would perform the ``Passion
of Christ'' every 10 years. The villagers have kept their promise
and this year present a millennium version of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant event will be the celebration of
Guttenberg's 600th birthday in Mainz, where he introduced printing
with movable type, which led directly to huge advances in
communications and education.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II has inaugurated the Golden Jubilee
Year, inviting Christians everywhere to make a pilgrimage to the
Eternal City and to the dazzlingly refurbished St. Peter's
Basilica. Jubilee events are planned for every week of the year,
peaking with World Youth Day (Aug. 15-20), which could draw more
than 2 million young people.
</P>
<P>
   The city has responded by restoring monuments from the Colosseum
to Nero's Golden Palace and creating a great archeological park to
link the ancient Roman forums. A number of museums have opened,
including the Palazzo Massimo, the Palazzo Barberini, and the
galleries of the Villa Borghese. Brand new are the minimalist
Church of the New Millennium and the monumental, horseshoe-shaped
Citta della Musica, an amphitheater and series of concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   Other important anniversaries:
</P>
<P>
   --One thousand years of the Hungarian Crown (March 15-31).
Exhibitions in Budapest and other cities celebrate the Crown of St.
Stephen, who introduced Christianity as king of the new Magyar
state.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1,000th anniversary of Leif Ericsson's ``discovery'' of
North America on a voyage from Iceland: A replica Viking ship will
retrace his probable route this summer.
</P>
<P>
   --The 200th anniversary of the Rijksmuseum, founded by Louis
Napoleon Bonaparte. Amsterdam celebrates this great collection,
which includes Rembrandt's ``Night Watch,'' with a year of special
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   --The 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach in
Leipzig, Germany (March 8-April 15 and July 21-30).
</P>
<P>
   The 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. Lisbon and all
Portugal celebrate the navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral and the
country's unique relationship with the sprawling South American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   --Oslo's 1,000th year. The Norwegian capital celebrates with a
special edition of the famous Holenkollen Ski Festival (now through
March 12) and with St. Hallvard's Day parades (May 13-17) followed
by a special sound-and-light show at the ruins of the original
settlement at Sorenga.

IRISH TRADITIONALISTS WON'T BUTT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ As sure of it as anything in this world, Liam Craven
crossed his arms, closed his eyes and announced, as if it was a
solemn oath, ``It'll never happen in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not talking about Ireland becoming a rich country. That's
happened, its economy the fastest-growing in Europe for a decade.
He was not talking about the Roman Catholic Church losing its
dominant role in Irish life. That's happened, too. And he was not
talking about Ireland having a female president. It's already had
two.
</P>
<P>
   What Craven insists will never happen is a ban on smoking in
Irish pubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people would revolt,'' said Craven, a bartender at
O'Neill's pub near Trinity College.
</P>
<P>
   But a government committee recommended just such a ban last
November, and the Irish government is considering it.
</P>
<P>
   And while Craven is convinced that the Irish people will never
tolerate a world in which they are not allowed to enjoy a smoke at
their local, his boss is not so sure. Declan Mannion thinks it is
only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   No-smoking sections are already common in restaurants, and
smoking was banned on buses a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, especially, are much more health conscious than
my parents' generation,'' said Mannion, 30, who manages O'Neill's.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a smoking ban as part of the inexorable change in
Ireland, and Dublin in particular, over the last 10 years. Fueled
by an economy that has made this nation of just 3.6 million second
only to the United States in producing computer software, Ireland
has grown prosperous and more European.
</P>
<P>
   Tall cranes dot Dublin's skyline, and jobs are so plentiful that
for the first time in history the English are coming here for jobs,
not the other way around. In a country that since the potato blight
of 1845 sent a diaspora of 70 million abroad, tens of thousands of
economic refugees from everywhere now want to come here. Mannion
bought his house less than two years ago for about $100,000; it has
almost doubled in value since.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional Irish pub is something ingrained deeply in
the Celtic consciousness, a place where pints of beer and
cigarettes seemed inextricably linked to conversation. It was in a
smoky pub in Dublin that Flann O'Brien once told Patrick Kavanagh
he was merely a minor poet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Homer, we all are,'' Kavanagh replied through the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional pubs are being gradually pushed aside by
super-pubs, two or three times the size of older ones, and
European-style cafes that are adorned with polished marble instead
of dark wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pubs are the last bastion of what Ireland used to be,'' said
Mannion, pulling a pint of Guinness. ``A cigarette and pint go hand
in hand. People have always accepted that when you went to a pub;
smoke was part of the scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   While Mannion and others think a smoking ban is inevitable,
others say it would be disastrous. Tadg O'Sullivan, chief executive
of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, said many pubs would go out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a pub in Galway became the first to try a ban.
The owner reversed his decision in less than a month after business
dropped precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan's group wants to introduce a voluntary system like in
Britain. Under the plan, publicans would display a notice outside
indicating if they had air conditioning or a no-smoking section.
</P>
<P>
   Some pubs like O'Neill's are big enough and architecturally
designed so that they could create non-smoking sections. But at the
Dawson Lounge, a single-room basement pub just off St. Stephen's
Green, they don't have the luxury. Nor do many smaller pubs in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Dawson, a foursome of friends all laughed when
asked if they thought a smoking ban was feasible. All four were
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Mullingar, and a pub there tried a non-smoking
section,'' said John Reilly, 23. ``It lasted two weeks. Nobody took
it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smyth, 32, from Galway, nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a group of Irish people going to the
pub that doesn't include a smoker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure they eat at restaurants that ban smoking, said Suzanne
Stewart, 26. ``Not a bother.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``A pub's different.''
</P>
<P>
   While smokers think a ban is unthinkable and downright un-Irish,
a growing number of people say they would not lament the demise of
smoky pubs, however cozy the images they conjure up.
</P>
<P>
   Dermot Brangan, an Irish diplomat, sheepishly confesses that he
does not spend much time in pubs because of the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get in and out quick,'' he said. ``I'm seldom in a pub
after 8 o'clock, because it just gets too smoky for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Limerick, Ireland's third-largest city, taxi driver Pat
O'Connor said he cannot imagine a ban on smoking, and believes it
would be unenforceable. He sees a ban as an unfair curb on personal
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a social smoker,'' he said. ``I'll have one with a pint.
Watching the races at the pub, I might have 10 or 20. I detest
smoking in a restaurant. In a pub it's different. It's a
traditional way to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   But traditions are falling hard and fast in modern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In McDaid's, on Dublin's Harry Street, where the playwright
Brendan Behan once held court, Martin Bourke pulled hard on a
filterless cigarette, which he called an indispensible
accompaniment to his pint of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary thing altogether that they're even
talking about banning smoking in pubs,'' Bourke said. ``I mean, for
Jayzuz sake, this is Ireland still.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Behan, a great raconteur and smoker who drank himself
to death in 1964 at the age of 41, would say if he were alive
today, Bourke exhaled a long plume of smoke, took a quick lash of
the black stuff, and, after some thought, said, ``Brendan would
say, `How the (expletive) did I live this long?' ''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley types who would otherwise be natural Republicans
fume about the party's position on some moral issues, notably
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 35 percent of the registered
Californian electorate _ around ten percentage points less than the
Democrats _ which makes them even more dependent on the growing
number of independent voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Bush at first seemed the dream candidate for the Californian
Republicans: a conservative with new ideas. In early 1999, a
delegation of Sacramento Republicans wrote to the Texan governor
asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a conservative who had won the trust of Latino voters
in Texas; he had tackled education, the top Californian issue, so
successfully that the state had sent several delegations to Texas
to study its approach to schools; and he looked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a South Carolina university that forbids interracial
dating was hardly likely to win Bush broad popularity in
California, where miscegenation is something of a state sport. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls now suggest that Gore would beat Bush in
California; but he would lose to McCain. The other thing is that
McCain has made the Republicans seem hip again. After falling for a
decade, the party's membership has surged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernd Schwieren of the Republican Assembly Caucus
in Sacramento, 21,000 new Republicans registered in the month
ending on Feb. 7. The party had lost 600,000 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pleasingly, the Democratic registration tally fell by
93,000. &QL;

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,325 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two
main parties, however, will allocate their delegates on the basis
of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>
<P>
   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won
California'' has the makings of a Republican nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be yet another agony in store. The current
two-count system is an awkward compromise between California's
voters, who have twice voted for propositions requiring open
primaries, and the parties, which have passed rules trying to close
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Quinn, a Republican demographic analyst, the
legal stitching on this piece of political patchwork is weak: you
can amend an initiative only with another initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the beauty contest, he might take his challenge
to the courts. Such a clash would do little for the bid by
California's Republicans to reclaim a position at the front of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the fact that California is already far more
multi-ethnic than most states will be in even 50 years' time, is
starting to make some people say that the state can no longer hope
to march at the head of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   That still seems wrong. First, the sheer weight of numbers
(California's population of 34 million today is projected to grow
to 50 million by 2030) is bound to make this a state with clout.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the basic political question in California _ how to
attract suburbanite voters who are mostly conservative on fiscal
issues but liberal on issues like abortion _ is the same question
that politicians everywhere in America are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for them, it is a question to which the Republicans have
yet to come up with a clear answer. &QL;

   Rick Steves, who has been writing guidebooks to Europe and
providing lively television programs on his visits there via public
television, has found that visiting in this millennium year will
not be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Steves, in updating his guidebooks, found that prices in hotels
are essentially the same as last year. ``Hoteliers are worried that
all the hype about crowds will scare away many travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheap air fares are now commonplace as travelers are flying
between major European cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has never been more prepared for tourists. The sights
are spiffed up and the scaffolding is down; Europe is a can-can of
architectural treats. Extra tourist information kiosks are
scattered throughout the most popular towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better time to explore Europe's back roads and
hidden towns. As EU regulations take hold, some of Europe's
old-time character will end up in the folk museums _ the victim of
modern building codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Steves is also offering a free guide to European railpasses. For
a copy, write to Rick Steves, Box 2009, Edmonds, WA 98020; call
425-771-8303, fax 425-771-0833, or visit www.ricksteves.com/rail.

wide range of information in seven languages.
</P>
<P>
   For those thinking of visiting Italy, Central Holidays
(800-935-5000) is offering five nights in first-class hotels
throughout Italy with breakfasts and, in most cases, dinner,
beginning at $350 a person. The deal is good July 1-Aug. 26.
Between March 27-June 30 and Aug. 27-Oct. 3, the rate is $465.

carrying the Westin brand are Hotel Bristol in Vienna, the
Excelsior in Florence, the Palace in Milan, Excelsior in Rome,
Europa &AMP; Regina and the Excelsior in Venice, the Palace in Madrid,
and the Hotel Maria Cristina in San Sebastian. These hotels join
some already famous Westin hotels in Europe such as the Turnbury
Golf Course and Spa in Scotland and the Trianon Palace in
Versailles, France.

   The London White Card, a discount admission pass to many of the
city's attractions, offers an inexpensive way to tour the city. The
card, now called GoSee/The London White Card, is available at $25
for three days; family and longer passes are also available. The
card can be purchased at information centers in London. Its Web
site, www.london-gosee.com, offers upcoming events.

   An inexpensive and interesting way to visit Europe is through
Untours, a Pennsylvania travel company that places travelers in
private homes or apartments in villages and cities on the
continent. From there, visits both nearby and by rail can easily be
arranged. Untours has a representative in the area where visitors

   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.

went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>

   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush

   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.

asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.

   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.

   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's

   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two

of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>

   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number

<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley types who would otherwise be natural Republicans
fume about the party's position on some moral issues, notably
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 35 percent of the registered
Californian electorate _ around ten percentage points less than the
Democrats _ which makes them even more dependent on the growing
number of independent voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first seemed the dream candidate for the Californian
Republicans: a conservative with new ideas. In early 1999, a
delegation of Sacramento Republicans wrote to the Texan governor
asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a conservative who had won the trust of Latino voters
in Texas; he had tackled education, the top Californian issue, so
successfully that the state had sent several delegations to Texas
to study its approach to schools; and he looked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a South Carolina university that forbids interracial
dating was hardly likely to win Bush broad popularity in
California, where miscegenation is something of a state sport. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls now suggest that Gore would beat Bush in
California; but he would lose to McCain. The other thing is that
McCain has made the Republicans seem hip again. After falling for a
decade, the party's membership has surged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernd Schwieren of the Republican Assembly Caucus
in Sacramento, 21,000 new Republicans registered in the month
ending on Feb. 7. The party had lost 600,000 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pleasingly, the Democratic registration tally fell by
93,000. &QL;

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,325 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two
main parties, however, will allocate their delegates on the basis
of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>
<P>
   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won
California'' has the makings of a Republican nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be yet another agony in store. The current
two-count system is an awkward compromise between California's
voters, who have twice voted for propositions requiring open
primaries, and the parties, which have passed rules trying to close
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Quinn, a Republican demographic analyst, the
legal stitching on this piece of political patchwork is weak: you
can amend an initiative only with another initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the beauty contest, he might take his challenge
to the courts. Such a clash would do little for the bid by
California's Republicans to reclaim a position at the front of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the fact that California is already far more
multi-ethnic than most states will be in even 50 years' time, is
starting to make some people say that the state can no longer hope
to march at the head of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   That still seems wrong. First, the sheer weight of numbers
(California's population of 34 million today is projected to grow
to 50 million by 2030) is bound to make this a state with clout.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the basic political question in California _ how to
attract suburbanite voters who are mostly conservative on fiscal
issues but liberal on issues like abortion _ is the same question
that politicians everywhere in America are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for them, it is a question to which the Republicans have
yet to come up with a clear answer. &QL;

OASIS' FEE FI HUM-DRUM OR, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Oasis released their fourth album of new material,
``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.'' It dropped in stores rather
quietly, free of the fanfare garnered by the latest Smashing
Pumpkins effort, ``Machina/The Machines of God,'' or ``Two Against
Nature,'' the first album in more than a decade from '70s stalwarts
Steely Dan.
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way to treat the greatest rock band in the world?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago when Noel Gallagher _ songwriter and
lead guitarist who, along with his lead-singer brother Liam, form
Oasis's heart and soul _ proclaimed, ``If it was 1965, we'd
absolutely be pop kings of the world. It would've been the Beatles,
the Stones, Oasis, and then the Who.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one for false modesty (or, for that matter, any other
kind), Gallagher had been heralding his band's greatness since
1994's ``Definitely Maybe'' became the best-selling debut album in
their native England. Although the reception here was more maybe
than definitely, there was something so cocksure about Noel's
melodies and Liam's snarly singing that one had to prick up their
ears. Just to hear Liam spit out the line, ``I was looking for some
ack-she-UN'' like a curse and a challenge on ``Cigarettes and
Alcohol'' was worth the CD's price.
</P>
<P>
   Their sophomore release, ``(What's the Story) Morning Glory?''
had the kind of stateside success that gave Gallagher's
straight-faced pronouncements of world domination some real juice.
It was one of the best albums of 1995 (and arguably, the decade,)
with hit singles ``Wonderwall,'' ``Don't Look Back in Anger,'' and
``Champagne Supernova.''
</P>
<P>
   Their critics called them as derivative as a Beatles cover band,
but there were millions who fell for their accessible and at times
gorgeous melodies and punchy guitars. At a time when the rock-star
lament of ``We hate it when we become successful'' had become
tiresome, there was something refreshing in the Gallagher brothers'
dedication to excess. They fought like Cain and Abel (or Ray and
Dave Davies of the Kinks), drank too much, and did too many drugs.
They kept the British tabloids fat and happy, traumatized hotel
managers and flight attendants, and gave the kind of candid
interviews that give publicists ulcers. (Liam calling George
Harrison a ``(bleepin') nipple'' _ the Queen's slang for an idiot _
after the former Beatle referred to him as ``silly'' was classic.)
They completely understood that rock stars might be a lot of
things, but whiny malcontents all bollixed up about fame wasn't one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ripe moment when Oasis could have owned the world. It
was before the boy bands, pop tarts, and rock-rap mooks came in and
started running things. Kurt Cobain was a year dead, Eddie Vedder
had ridden his self-righteousness into irrelevance, and grunge was
fading as fast as an old flannel shirt. The door was open just wide
enough for someone to slip in, grab the spolight, and shake things
up.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened to Oasis on their way to rock
immortality. They started to believe their own hype. Believing they
were already the best, they stopped striving for something
incredible and indelible. They forgot that a big part of being the
greatest band in the world is making great records.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, their hotly anticipated third outing, ``Be Here Now''
tripped commercially and critically. They kept making headlines _
marriages, drunken stupidity, babies _ but they stopped making
interesting music. More recently, group turmoil led to the
departure of two original members, guitarist Paul Arthurs and
bassist Paul McGuigan, and Oasis, never a rock of stability, almost
broke up.
</P>
<P>
   So now comes their latest, ``Standing on the Shoulder of
Giants'' _ not exactly greeted with a ho-hum, but far from the
hosannas one might have expected from a group that believed it was
the '90s answer to the Fab Four. It's not as good as ``Morning
Glory,'' but not as misguided as ``Be Here Now.'' All the Beatles
references are there, and the melodies are pleasantly catchy, even
if Noel still can't write lyrics as smart and engaging as
Morrissey, Bono, or his hero, John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   Already a hit in England, the CD, led by the single, ``Go Let It
Out!'' will probably do OK here, but it won't set the world on
fire. Sadder but wiser, perhaps the brothers Gallagher will have to
be content with standing on the shoulder of giants, although they
should have been giants themselves.

Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

   &UR; MEXICO'S CERTIFIABLY MAD WAR ON DRUGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is known as the ``February surprise.'' Every year, shortly
before the U.S. government announces on March 1 which countries it
``certifies'' as willing allies in the war on illegal drugs, Mexico
unveils a new and bold anti-drugs initiative. This year, though,
the surprise was on Mexico. &QL;

   &UR; THE RETURN OF A DIMINISHED GENERAL PINOCHET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the news came through in the middle of the Santiago night
that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings, and that General
Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small group of his
supporters staged a celebration. It may very well be his only
welcome-home reception. During his detention, most Chileans quickly
became bored and baffled by the legal intricacies of the case, and
lapsed into indifference. Chileans discovered that life without
General Pinochet was not only possible, but preferable. &QL;

   As the worst floods in living memory continue to swirl, parts of
South Africa, Zimbabwe and especially Mozambique desperately need
help to prevent the death toll from escalating. The floods have
pushed back into poverty large numbers of Mozambicans who had
recently begun to lift themselves out of it. And just as bad, the
flooding has almost certainly dislodged thousands of landmines and
carried them into places previously considered safe. &QL;

Getty, grandson of oil magnate J.P. Getty, and Bill Gates, who

holdings to around 70 million images. That tops its main

says, ``Intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century.'' &QL;

   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the

in southern Colombia, where an embattled president faces daunting
problems, including left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries
and the world's largest source of coca, the raw material for
cocaine. &QL;

   To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation or
just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only question the
Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a
result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than
vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active
terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.
Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

Clinton's 1992 attack on black extremism, it was a brother,
grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

   TAKE-BOS  
 COLOMA, Calif.: ... be Hispanics.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two generations ago the prevalent California image was of cool
movie stars in sunglasses and convertibles, blond surfers on the
shore, and John Wayne playing poker in the back rooms of the Balboa
Bay Club. No longer. Kevin Starr, who is the state librarian and is
regarded as the premier student of the state, says today's
California is ``an ecumenical experiment conducted on an
unprecedented level.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is the third-largest Mexican city in the world, the
second-largest Korean city in the world, one of the largest
Armenian, Iranian, and Jewish cities anywhere. A million Filipinos
live in California. Indians from the Asian subcontinent abound. As
a result, Californians have what Starr calls ``multiple states of
consciousness.'' Sometimes they think in two languages, sometimes
more. When a Californian speaks of bilingualism, the logical
response is: Which two languages?
</P>
<P>
   The great movements of immigrants are from Asia and Latin
America, with Latin America accounting for 3 out of 5 new residents
of Los Angeles. Southern California's San Gabriel Valley now is the
largest suburban concentration of Chinese in the nation, accounting
for 158,000 people. In 1960, only 6 percent of the residents of
Huntington Park, in southeast Los Angeles County, were Latino. By
1990, the population was 92 percent Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Two late-century political developments propelled Latinos into
positions of power. The first was Governor Wilson's crusade against
immigration, which emboldened millions of Latinos and sent hundreds
of thousands to naturalization ceremonies and voter registration
centers. The second was the term-limits movement, which chased
entrenched lawmakers out of Sacramento and opened seats in the
Assembly and Senate _ and chairmanships _ to people who otherwise
might have tired of waiting. today Cruz Bustamante is lieutenant
governor, Antonio Villaraigosa is House speaker, Richard Polanco is
Senate majority leader, and two Latinos are among the leading
candidates in the mayoralty election in Los Angeles _ a city
Westbrook Pegler once called ``that big, sprawling, incoherent,
shapeless, slobbering civic idiot in the family of American
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   As a trendsetter, California _ which gave the nation political
consultants, celebrity politicians and ``reforms'' limiting the
power of lobbyists to influence legislation, the power of industry
to pollute, and the power of government to tax _ has played its
role most dramatically in one classic American trend: impatience
and disinterest in government.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else do so many people live so far from the state
capital; 20 million Californians live at least 400 miles from the
elegant state house set in the leafy mall in the center of
Sacramento. The state government is powerful but remote. This is a
state with 52 House seats in Washington (almost certainly 53 after
the 2000 census and reapportionment), but only 40 state Senate
seats in Sacramento. State senators, ordinarily an intimate link
between people and politics, have bigger districts than members of
the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a state in the traditional sense of an American
political entity, California seems to be reconstituting itself as a
federation of local autonomies. Though the old talk of political
dissolution _ Northern California, for example, breaking away from
Southern California _ has all but disappeared, there is a more
subtle sense of psychological secessionism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Progressive history
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, California has a distinct political culture, with roots
in the progressive movement that brought Hiram Johnson to the fore
in 1910 and brought the initiative, referendum and recall to the
state constitution in 1911. today, for example, Californians are
voting on a ballot question to determine whether the legal word
``marriage'' should be restricted to the formal union of a man and
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the state has had deep wells of conservatism,
symbolized in turn by the rise of William F. Knowland, who ran the
Oakland Tribune, was the voice of the right before the television
era and served as a senator after World War II; by the
popularization of the phrase ``little old ladies in tennis shoes,''
coined by the Democratic operative Stanley Mosk to characterize the
voters who carried the GOP primary in 1964 for Barry Goldwater over
Nelson A. Rockefeller; and by the emergence of two indispensible
parts of the California political persona, Richard M. Nixon and
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the wells of liberalism are equally deep, symbolized by
Upton Sinclair's fabled 1934 gubernatorial campaign that spoke of
ending poverty in California; the Free Speech movement in Berkeley
in 1964 and 1965 that launched an era of student protest; the
growth of flower power and the drug culture in San Francisco at the
end of the 1960s; the celebration of gay life in the 1990s, and the
presence, today, of two Northern California women in the Senate,
Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco and Barbara Boxer of Marin
County, both of whom scored 100 percent in the Americans for
Democratic Action vote ratings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big place and a microcosm for the nation, and so
it's possible to get hippies in the streets at the same time as you
have Ronald Reagan in the governor's office,'' says Fred Smoller, a
political scientist at Chapman University in Orange County, the
heart of the new conservative movement. ``People go to the extremes
here because of a lack of stability, a lack of history. The
transient nature of the place lends itself to extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the transient nature of the place is what makes California
California _ a place that John Gunther, in the very first paragraph
of his monumental 1947 survey of the United States, referred to as
a being ``at once demented and very sane, adolescent and mature.''
The state remains the ultimate destination for the new start.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today the import of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906
isn't the disaster it wreaked but the opportunity it offered. A
newspaperman, Frank Leach, said he ``saw the debris of wrecked
chimney tops sailing past our bedroom windows.'' There would be new
chimney tops soon, and they would be higher. That, too, is the
California way. So many people responded to the lure of the new
start that in the Great Depression the state legislature actually
tried to close the state's borders. It didn't work. Between 1920
and 1940, the population of California grew from 3.4 million to 6.9
million.

</P>
<P>
   California dream deferred
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all the fresh starts work out, of course. Lower middle class
migrants often have been unable to buy a home, often are wiped out
first in the boom cycles and often feel the most threatened by new
immigration, competition and the property taxes that climb
inexorably with the increase in home values. ``This part of
California is always as big as the positive California Dream,''
says Philip J. Ethington, a University of Southern California
historian. ``Everybody dosn't make it, and even those who make it
feel uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for the sense of desperation that is entwined with
the dream of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California,'' Joan Didion wrote 35 years ago, ``is a place in
which a boom mentality and sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy
suspension; in which the mind is troubled by some buried but
ineradicable suspicion that things had better work out here,
because here, beneath that immense, bleached sky, is where we run
out of continent.''
</P>
<P>
   But California never runs out of ingenuity. Southern California,
founded on real estate speculation and good weather, always offers
something new, whether movies, the aircraft industry, or merely the
sense of the new. Northern California now thrives on the newer new
thing, the Internet, which is reshaping the economy and the psychic
landscape of San Jose and the Silicon Valley in ways that cannot
yet be calibrated.
</P>
<P>
   But not so far out of memory are some of the troubling events of
the 1990s _ biblical curses like an earthquake, drought, floods and
fires, social failures like race riots and gang warfare, political
failures like the drive to purge immigrants, an economic crisis
that led state revenues to fall by 40 percent. It was so bad that,
in 1991, U-Haul reported that there were 10 percent more one-way
rentals out of California than into the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suddenly had a sense of the tragic side of life,'' says
Starr, the chronicler of the California story. ``The unbridled
optimism suddenly was gone. People expect Massachusetts to be smart
and colorful, but nobody expects it to be utopian. People expected
California to be utopian.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't. The great horizons were cloudy, and not only with
smog.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, people still have huge hopes and they still make gobs of
money. They still even put pineapple on their pizzas. But
California, shaped by a gold rush, molded by Americans' dreams and
the American Dream, punch drunk on optimism, is a lot more sober
now. That's new, too.

CANCER DRUG SHOWS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No test of a cancer drug has been so closely watched, and seldom
has one been shrouded in such secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are indications that endostatin, the
tumor-starving substance discovered in the lab of Dr. Judah Folkman
in Boston, appears to be safe _ at least so far _ and may be
halting cancers in some of the desperately sick patients enrolled
in its first human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone takes it as encouraging that there hasn't been much
progressive disease'' among the cancer patients who are the first
humans to receive treatment with endostatin, said Dr. James Thomas
of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, one of three centers
testing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very well tolerated,'' Thomas said in an interview.
``There's been no drug-related toxicity. People are doing fairly
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas spoke last week during a meeting at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., where researchers from the three
centers conducting the endostatin trials, which began late last
year, exchanged information.
</P>
<P>
   One topic under discussion was whether, and when, to enroll more
patients to further test the dose that the current trials are
showing to be the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accrue any more patients at this time, but will
wait for the other two centers to catch up'' and complete their
quota of 15 patients each before adding more volunteers, said Dr.
Donald Kufe, who heads the trial at Dana-Farber Cancer Care.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin, viewed as a potential breakthrough in cancer
treatment, is being given to volunteers in Boston at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and three Boston hospitals, and at the
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, as well as at the
University of Wisconsin. About 100 patients are scheduled to
receive endostatin in the Phase 1, or safety phase, of the clinical
trial, which is required in bringing any new drug to market. It is
intended to reveal any toxic effects of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is a protein discovered in Folkman's laboratory at
Children's Hospital. It is one of the strongest of dozens of
``angiogenesis inhibitors'' _ compounds that block the growth of
new blood vessels _ whose existence was proposed by Folkman decades
ago. Endostatin has dramatically shrunk many kinds of cancers in
mice with no side effects, but hasn't been tried in humans until
now.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed Inc. in Rockville, Md., is developing endostatin as a
drug, with the trade name simply Endostatin with a capital ``E.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, about 33 patients have received daily
infusions of endostatin: 15 of them in Boston, 9 in Wisconsin and 9
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The first public reports on the Phase I trials may come at a May
meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   The positive buzz is one element cited in the soaring stock
price of EntreMed Inc., the company that developed Endostatin.
Shares rose to over $100 last week, up from 25 5/8 on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients and relatives, the medical community, and
biotech investors are eager for any tidbits about the trial's
progress that can be gleaned, but there has been precious little.
``We've really worked hard to quiet'' any unauthorized reports
about the trial ``to give the poor drug a chance,'' said Folkman in
a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   At least two on-line services have electronic bulletin boards
where investors share tips and speculate and argue about the
EntreMed trials. The participants scrutinize every public
appearance by Folkman, every word written in the press about
Endostatin, and every rumor in hopes of divining something about
what's going on behind the closed doors of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One patient involved in the trials has spoken publicly. Chuck
Killian, who has metastatic colon cancer drives every day from his
home outside Chicago to the University of Wisconsin to receive an
infusion of Endostatin into a tube in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Killian, an insurance executive diagnosed with colon cancer in
1998, said in a telephone interview that he feels better and more
energetic, and that pain in his liver, where the cancer had spread,
has almost disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers emphasize that such anecdotal reports are
meaningless by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One way of gauging the trial's progress is noting how many
patients drop out: the rules require them to discontinue endostatin
if their tumors grow by more than 50 percent. The patients are
going through the trials in groups of three, each group getting an
increased dose of endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported last week that at as the doses have
increased in the Boston trial, fewer patients have been dropping
out. Dr. James Pluda, a National Cancer Institute official, said
that the report was essentially accurate. This could be interpreted
to mean that higher doses of endostatin are having greater
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokesman at Dana-Farber declined to confirm or deny
the report, and a spokeswoman at EntreMed had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of endostatin in the trials is viewed as a
crucial test of Folkman's belief that the non-toxic, angiogenesis
inhibitors, used in combination with other treatments, could open a
new era of cancer control and even prevention. Folkman, however,
emphasizes that the best role for endostatin and other inhibitors
may take years to determine, and that probably most will be used in
combination with more conventional therapies, like chemotherapy and
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes that angiogenesis inhibitors in the body, like
endostatin, are perpetually keeping many tumors small by not
allowing them to switch on the growth of blood vessels from nearby
tissues. So the inhibitors may eventually serve as long-term cancer
preventives, he says.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed has licensed the endostatin rights from Children's
Hospital, and also is developing another potent anti-angiogenesis
drug, angiostatin, that was found in Folkman's lab. The Food and
Drug Administration recently gave EntreMed the go-ahead to begin
human tests of angiostatin and also of yet another angiogenesis
drug, known as 2ME2.
</P>
<P>
   Children's receives licensing fees from the company but Folkman
does not benefit personally, nor does he own EntreMed stock.

   SOUFFLE (Undated) _ Creme brulee may one day retire, but the

   PUERTORICO-CUISINE (San Juan) _ Walking into the Casita Blanca
Restaurant is like walking into a country home, one with ceiling
fans, bare cement floors and live poultry _ in this case a turkey
named Gabino and a rooster known as Pancho _ roaming the indoor
patio. In this small restaurant in the working-class neighbhorhood
of Villa Palmeras, Jesus Perez has created something that is simple
yet rare: a place where you can taste the distinctive flavors of
Puerto Rican cuisine, the traditional dishes that are almost
impossible to find outside of a home _ even here on the island. By
Mireya Navarro.

</P>
<P>
   RESTAURANT-CREDITS (New York) _ There was a time when chefs were
anonymous. No one knew their names. If a restaurant was named Chez
Louis, chances were that Louis was not the guy behind the stove. He
was the owner. When anyone dared to ask Henri Soule, the owner of
Le Pavillon, who was responsible for the greatness of his
restaurant, he had a very simple answer: ``Le Pavillon,'' he would
say, ``c'est moi.'' I found myself thinking about those far-off
days while studying the menu at Thalia recently. Down at the
bottom, the name of the chef is printed. And next to the chef,
Michael Otsuka, his sous-chefs, Bill McDaniel and Robert Martin.
Sous-chefs? The United States has often been called a credit
society. It's true in two senses. Americans love credit cards. And
they love credit _ the recognition of accomplishment,
near-accomplishment, well-intended lack of accomplishment or merely
showing up. In a success-ethic democracy, it just doesn't feel
right unless everybody wins and trophies are handed out all around.

<P>
   CONROY-FIRE _ ATLANTA _A massive fire destroyed the former home
of author Pat Conroy and damaged two other houses today in one of
Atlanta's oldest neighborhoods. The fire broke out about 3 a.m. EST
in the kitchen of a two-story, wood-frame home at 34 Peachtree
Circle in Ansley Park -- one the market for $900,000 -- and quickly
spread to two adjacent houses. Conroy lived in the house in the
1980s and wrote ``Prince of Tides'' there, according to a neighbor.
(Davis-Reid, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANICS-SOUTH _ The Hispanic population in the U.S. South is
growing at a faster rate than the Hispanic population elsewhere in
the country, according to a report released Wed. March 8 by the
U.S. Census Bureau. About 1 in 3 Hispnaics live in the South. Other
findings: Hispanics have lower education and income levels than
non-Hispanic whites, but there are dramatic differences between
subgroups of Hispanics - between Cubans, Mexicans and Puetro
Ricans, for instance. That info contradicts a widely help
perception of Hispanics as a monolithic population, the government
says. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-AFFIRM _ TALLAHASSEE _ Thousands of people were expected to
march on the Old Capitol building Tuesday to protest Gov. Jeb

<P>
   CHICKEN _ WASHINGTON - Despite a recent rash incidents involving
food purchased by the federal government for the nation's school
lunch program, the U.S. General Accounting office said in a report
released Tuesday that its investigation found few problems.
(Jaspin, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   RAILROADS _ WASHINGTON _ Hearings begin Tuesday that could lead
the way to tougher scrutiny of rail mergers and criticism that
there isn't enough competition. A chief target of those worried
about merger mania is the plan by Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Corp. and Canadian National Railway Co. to create North America's
largest carrier. (Turay, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-TESTS _ WASHINGTON _ The long-awaited report of the

teachers is released Tuesday. (Mollison, Cox News Service)

<P>
   A QUIZ FOR THE ALSO-RANS ON OSCAR NIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-NIGHT-MOVIE-QUIZ-STARBEAT _ For every Oscar winner there
are four nominees who go home empty-handed, four people who come in
as winners and go out as losers. Just in time for Oscar night on
March 26, Greenfield, Ind.-based free-lance writer S. Burelison
delivers an engaging quiz on the Oscar also-rans. By S. Burelison.
</P>
<P>
   THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERIN: ROBERTS TAKES A DRAMATIC TURN
</P>
<P>
   JULIA-ROBERTS-IN-ERIN-BROCKOVICH-STARBEAT _ Her last three
movies were romantic comedies, and they collectively grossed nearly
$400 million at the box office. But Julia Roberts goes for
something different in ``Erin Brockovich,'' her latest film:
Opening nationwide on March 17, it's a strong, based-on-fact legal
drama about a community's struggle against toxic pollution. By
Cindy Pearlman. (With color photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CROSSOVER KING: THE UNLIKELY TRIUMPH OF RICKY MARTIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SINGER-RICKY-MARTIN-STARBEAT _ Ricky Martin has come a long way
in a short time _ only a few years back, he was best known as the
singing bartender Miguel on ``General Hospital.'' But since his
memorable rendition of ``The Cup of Life'' at the 1998 Grammy
Awards, Martin has been the world's most popular male singer. By
Kevin Dickson. (With color photo.)
</P>
<P>
   DEVON SAWA, THE LAST BIG THING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEVON-SAWA-IN-FINAL-DESTINATION-STARBEAT _ Devon Sawa knows all
about the Hollywood star-making machine. Only three years ago, as
his film ``Wild America'' was in the works, Sawa was touted far and
wide as the Next Big Thing. But then the movie flopped, and he
found himself on the edge of oblivion. Now he's back, however, with
the lead role in ``Final Destination,'' a highly praised, eerie
thriller opening March 17. By Ian Spelling. (With color photo.)
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BEAUTY-EURO-LATAM-NYTSF _ Millions of people outside
the USA suppose that life in the suburbs is similar to the
portrayal in ``American Beauty'' _ in other words, a paradise of
spacious homes surrounded by green gardens, whatever the season,
and indoors a hell of domestic hatred and frustrated dreams.
Happiness is hard to find anywhere, and maybe it's true that in the
American suburb it's a daily miracle. ``American Beauty'' sets out
to show that such a miracle is, almost always, a mirage, an
impossible goal. By Tomas Eloy Martinez. (Also moved in ``k'' news
file.)
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (moved in the ``k'' news file)
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WE CAN THANK PINOCHET FOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-ETHICS-CASE-NYTSF _ For many in Chile, Pinochet is the
personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as bad as
they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he remains
the savior of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism. It is good for Chileans to have realized
this split of opinion, and for others to grasp that dealing with
the past is a very complicated matter, and that easy solutions, as
brisk and painless as they may seem, generally do not work. We can
thank Pinochet for this, but for nothing else. By JORGE G.
CASTANEDA.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET'S VICTIMS WILL NEVER STOP SEEING HIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-MENTAL-LESSONS-NYTSF _ So Pinochet has had his last
glimpse of London, but his victims will keep on seeing him,
endlessly. For Pinochet, the world was still divided into the
Marxists and the Christians, a notion that presupposed the
inevitability of a war between them. For Pinochet, this was a
matter of life and death, and anything goes. You don't merely
defeat the enemy: You destroy him. The only way to deal with an
enemy of such magnitude is extermination: concentration camps,
slavery, torture. By TOMAS ELOY MARTINEZ.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET WITHOUT HATRED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALLENDE-ON-PINOCHET-NYTSF _ I feel no hatred for Pinochet.
Hatred is a very heavy burden, one I shook off many years ago, when
I started writing. Writing has allowed me to exorcise most of my
demons and transform my pain into strength. I would like to see
Pinochet face a trial, so that the truth about his crimes is fully
exposed. But I wouldn't want the general to rot in prison, as so
many of his victims did. I merely wish that in the winter of his
life the general would ask forgiveness of all those whose lives he
destroyed, the families of the dead and disappeared, the exiled and
tortured; that he would reveal where the bodies of his victims can
be found. By ISABEL ALLENDE.
</P>
<P>
   WHY DOES THE MEDIA TREAT THIS POLLSTER LIKE A GOD?
</P>
<P>
   CULT-OF-ZOGBY-SLATE _ A little-known independent pollster based
in Utica, N.Y., John Zogby rocketed to fame by correctly predicting
the results of the 1996 presidential election. Like all religions,
the cult of Zogby relies on myths about his feats and denial about
his failures. Meanwhile, pundits, reporters and chat show hosts now
routinely genuflect to him.
</P>
<P>
   SUPREME COURT GUIDE TO DRUG-SMUGGLING AND BAG-SQUEEZING
</P>
<P>
   GREYHOUND-BUS-PRIVACY-SLATE _ The Supreme Court ponders whether
you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when you place your
illegal drug stash in the overhead compartment of a Greyhound bus.
Here's a tip from Justice Antonin Scalia: Buy hard luggage.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO CLOSE THE `APPRECIATED PROPERTY' LOOPHOLE
</P>
<P>
   KINSLEY-GIFT-LOOPHOLE-SLATE _ Is there any reason the government
should care whether you give a charity $10,000 of stock or $10,000
in cash _ care enough to reduce your tax bill by two or three
thousand dollars for choosing to give the stock? None that I have
ever heard. But it's the kind of ridiculous ``arrangement'' that
gets into the tax code unintentionally and then can't be gotten rid
of.
</P>
<P>
   MUDDLE IN THE JUNGLE: U.S. NARCS VS. COLOMBIA'S FARC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   US-COCA-WAR-ECONOMIST _ It is not Vietnam, nor will it become
so. But once again the United States is preparing to commit lots of
cash, military hardware and advisers to a battle in a foreign
jungle. This one is in southern Colombia, where an embattled
president faces daunting problems, including left-wing guerrillas,
right-wing paramilitaries and the world's largest source of coca,
the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   DEMONIZING HEZBOLLAH WON'T SAVE YOUR SOLDIERS, ISRAEL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BACK-OFF-HEZBOLLAH-ECONOMIST _ To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas
fighting Israeli occupation or just to threaten to bomb? That seems
to be the only question the Israeli government asks itself about
Lebanon these days. As a result, Lebanese civilians suffer much
more at Israeli hands than vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be
an alarmingly active terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not
quite so simple. Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it
is Hezbollah that has looked the more disciplined force of late,
and Israel that has been making innocents suffer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S RIGHT. STANLEY FISCHER IS BEST BOSS FOR THE IMF &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IMF-HEADACHE-ECONOMIST _ Doubtless, Caio Koch-Weser is a jolly
decent fellow. Germany's finance state secretary could probably do
all sorts of jobs, perfectly competently or even brilliantly. The
trouble is that running the International Monetary Fund is not one
of them. What a pity that the best man for the job _ Stanley
Fischer, the IMF's deputy managing director and, since Michel
Camdessus stepped down a few weeks ago, it's acting head _ probably
won't get it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN'S GRANDDADDY OF A `SISTER SOULJAH' MOMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-WRATH-ECONOMIST _ John McCain's behavior bears the
hallmarks of reckless political courage. Denouncing the Reverend
Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, in his own
Virginia hometown, was a remarkable moment in recent Republican
history. Never before has a presidential candidate nominee
castigated the religious right like that. It was not just a Sister
Souljah moment, mimicking Bill Clinton's 1992 attack on black
extremism, it was a brother, grandmother and indeed entire Souljah
family moment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY COLOR: QUIRKY MOMENTS ON THIS WEEK'S CAMPAIGN TRAIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARYCOLOR-COLUMN-ECONOMIST _ (This week's droll ``Primary
Color'' column) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `POSTER BOY' ELIAN BACKFIRES ON CUBAN-AMERICAN HARD-LINERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELIAN-CURSE-ECONOMIST _ Three months after Elian Gonzalez, a
six-year-old Cuban boy, was rescued from the sea off Miami, his
story resembles the fanciful tele-novelas that Latinos love to
watch. Call it ``The Curse of Elian.'' But there is also a growing
sense that the story is not playing out in the way that Miami's
hard-line Cuban-American leaders had intended. Ironically, they may
in fact be helping the very man they detest: Fidel Castro. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO'S CERTIFIABLY MAD WAR ON DRUGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DRUGS-ECONOMIST _ It is known as the ``February
surprise.'' Every year, shortly before the U.S. government
announces on March 1 which countries it ``certifies'' as willing
allies in the war on illegal drugs, Mexico unveils a new and bold
anti-drugs initiative. This year, though, the surprise was on
Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AS FLOODWATERS ROSE, THE WORLD JUST WATCHED. WHY? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `PATHETIC'-FLOOD-AID-INDEPENDENT _ Finally, a major if still
barely coordinated relief effort is under way for Mozambique. But
the flurry of action has not been nearly enough to mollify the
anger of international aid agencies at what they condemn as yet
another ``pathetic'' failure of the rich and self-centered West to
respond with sufficient speed to a crisis in a Third World country.
``If this had happened in the West, the response would have been
entirely different,'' said an angry relief worker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN-LENNON-FBI-FILE-NYTSF _ Did John Lennon provide financial
support to the IRA? Was his song ``Working Class Hero'' subversive?
Read all about it in ``Lennon's M15-FBI Files,'' a commentary by
Jon Weiner, the author of ``Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI
Files.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET SURFING HARMS YOUR SOCIAL LIFE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOG-OFF-AND-LIVE!-INDEPENDENT _ People who use the Internet for
as little as five hours a week are less likely to talk to or visit
their family and friends and are in danger of shutting themselves
off from society, according to new research. Is it time to log off
and live? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHY MUST WE WAIT TO ENJOY OUR LEISURE TIME WHEN WE'RE OLD? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT-LEISURE?-INDEPENDENT _ Why on earth do we have a tax and
benefit system that encourages workers to take all of their leisure
time when they are older, and none when it would be most desirable
to them _ in the prime of life? When will governments have the
vision to lift their eyes above the problem pensions pose for their
budgets and tackle the crazy structure of lifetime work
incentives? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT THE NET, BUT WE'LL ALWAYS NEED SHAMPOO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CYBER-SHAMPOO-INDEPENDENT _ It is, as someone once said, a funny
old world. Two global corporate titans, Ford and Unilever,
announced recently that they are getting rid of thousands of their
workers. But we are undoubtedly going to go on needing Unilever's
detergent powder, shampoo and frozen peas. And we will certainly be
driving around in Ford cars for another generation. The old economy
may be out of fashion in the cyber-new world, but we still need the
things it produces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL (moved in ``i'' news file)
</P>
<P>
   ARE WARS ALL ABOUT MONEY? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WAR'N'MONEY-ECONOMIST _ Making money and making war have long
been related activities. That soldiers loot and arms manufacturers
turn a profit is hardly news. But is competition for wealth and
resources becoming the major cause of new wars around the world? A
look at the lucrative business of war. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE UNFATHOMABLE TRAGEDY OF MOZAMBIQUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISERY-MOZAMBIQUE-ECONOMIST _ As the worst floods in living
memory continue to swirl, parts of South Africa, Zimbabwe and
especially Mozambique desperately need help to prevent the death
toll from escalating. The floods have pushed back into poverty
large numbers of Mozambicans who had recently begun to lift
themselves out of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SAD GYPSIES OF SLOVAKIA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GYPSIES-HAIDERISM-ECONOMIST _ Mikulas Dzurkinda, the Slovak
prime minister, winces when asked what he thinks of Austrian
right-winger Joerg Haider. ``I'm certain Austria will stay
democratic. But demagogues are frightening. Imagine the trouble
they could cause if they got hold of our Gypsy question.'' Indeed,
if the politics of hate were to make a comeback in lands to the
east of the present EU, Gypsies would be prime targets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS (moved in ``f'' news file)
</P>
<P>
   SLICK OPERATOR: PHOTO MOGUL GETTY TOPS GATES' CORBIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOGUL-MARK-GETTY-ECONOMIST _ It's the clash of the titans. Both
young moguls, both cornering the world market in photo archives,
both now based in Seattle: Mark Getty, grandson of oil magnate J.P.
Getty, and Bill Gates, who needs no introduction whatsoever. With
its 14th large acquisition in five years, Getty Images increased
its photo library holdings to around 70 million images. That tops
its main competitor, Gates' Corbis, which has 65 million images. As
Getty says, ``Intellectual property is the oil of the 21st
century.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERNET IS RUNNING OUT OF ADDRESSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEBSITE-ADDRESSES-ECONOMIST _ On the Internet, naming your
start-up can be more arduous than financing it. This is because
most Internet addresses, known as domain names, have been taken
already. In the .com domain, the most desirable online real estate,
almost every recognizable name has been claimed. Much is at state.
If the name space of the Internet cannot grow, e-commerce will
suffer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE REASONS BEHIND THE HIGH COST OF TOILET PAPER IN BRITAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOILET-PAPER-UK-ECONOMIST _ Why does it cost more to wipe your
bottom in Britain than in any other country in the European Union?
It is because British consumers are extremely discriminating when
it comes to toilet paper. British bums, in short, demand and get
the best. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-GENERAL (moved in ``a'' news file)

   `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   LENT-WITHOUT-INTERNET-NYTSF _ It seems almost deviant to say so,
but traditional church appears to be making a comeback among
computer-savvy baby-boomers and Generation Xers. In contrast to the
disembodied spirituality of cyberspace, people seem eager for
sensual religious experience _ kneeling, incense, bread and wine,
congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the better.
Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection to
the divine.

<P>
   DR-WEIL-HEALTH-LIFEBEAT-NYTSF _ Three new studies on Americans
and weight gain were released last fall, and the news wasn't good.
The verdict: Not only is obesity on the rise _ from 12 percent of
the population in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 1998, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention _ but more than half
of the adults in this country are now considered at least
moderately overweight. All this, despite the fact that total fat
consumption in the United States has decreased over the past
decade. What's going on here? And what to do about it? By Dr.
Andrew Weil, written with Joseph V. Amodio. With photo. (Also moved

Americans eagerly made room in their cupboards. More durable than

less time at home, their gregarious canine companions sometimes
miss out on the socializing they crave. In order to develop into
friendly companions, young animals need extended interactive

&HT;     CHINESE SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT ASKS U.S. HELP IN GETTING PRISONER
RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA and CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Followers of a spiritual movement banned in
China have called on U.S. officials to pressure the Beijing
government to release eight San Francisco Bay area practitioners
arrested over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to quash protests during the national legislature's
annual session, Beijing police raided an apartment Saturday night
and arrested 15 practitioners of Falun Gong, including the bay area
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Zeng, 31, of San Jose said Monday that he and other Falun
Gong followers were trying to exert pressure on the U.S. State
Department to lobby for the detainees' release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they (the U.S. government) can do more in pressing
China to have a peaceful dialogue with us to resolve the crisis,``
said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng's younger brother Sheng ``Johnson'' Zeng, 30, and his wife,
Yili ``Vennessa'' Wang, 28, Chinese citizens in the United States
on work visas, were among those arrested Saturday because of their
involvement in Falun Gong activities.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong practitioners are circulating petitions to protest
China's crackdown and have gathered several thousand signatures in
Northern California alone, said Zeng, a software engineer at Remedy
Corp., an e-commerce company in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrests follow months of government reprisals that
include the mass detention of thousands of peaceful demonstrators,
prison terms for four alleged ringleaders in December and a nonstop
smear campaign against the movement, founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi,
a former grain bureau clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The regime fears the grass-roots power of Falun Gong, viewing
the movement as a threat to public order and social stability.
</P>
<P>
   Passed along by word of mouth and via the Internet, Falun Gong
incorporates aspects of Buddhism and Taoism, conservative moral
values and qigong, an ancient Chinese tradition of breathing,
motions and meditation to control inner energy. It has an estimated
60 million to 70 million followers worldwide, with an estimated 400
to 600 in the bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Falun Gong has chosen opportune
moments to draw attention to their cause and organization,'' said
Mickey Spiegal, a China expert and consultant to Human Rights Watch
in New York. The National People's Congress, which convenes
delegates from all over the country, just opened an 11-day session
in Beijing. ``These are important and high-level meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who helped win the freedom of
three Californians arrested in China for Falun Gong involvement
last December, called the new arrests ``the most recent
preposterous outrage by this ruthless, totalitarian regime.`` He
said he had called the secretary of state's office, the U.S.
ambassador in China and the Chinese Embassy to try to gain the
release of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Lantos has been trying to get China to stop its crackdown since
the issue surfaced last summer, and, ``even before this latest
outrage,'' had scheduled a hearing of the Congressional Human
Rights Caucus on the problem next week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department said they were looking into
reports of the arrests to confirm whether any U.S. citizens were
detained and would try to act on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Xiaozhong Yang, consul and spokesman at the Chinese Consulate in
San Francisco, said he had no details of the arrests, though he
defended his nation's ban on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous irrefutable facts have shown that Falun Gong is an
evil cult which has offended the law by organizing and employing
cults, evading taxes, obstructing justice and causing human
death,'' Yang said. ``For foreigners who enter into China, we
welcome them to visit, but we
</P>
<P>
   discourage them from doing anything against the Chinese

<P>
   The first Europeans to reach the Pacific coast of North America
observed a bizarre custom practiced by the Kwakuitl Indians, in
which tribal chiefs would challenge each other to what was called a
``potlatch.''
</P>
<P>
   It involved the two chiefs going to the cliff edge and throwing
items of immense value into the sea to demonstrate their village's
enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Blankets, copper pots, weapons: they took turns to chuck away
everything that they needed to survive as their two tribes looked
on and gasped at their leaders' courage.
</P>
<P>
   The first one to run out of valuables was the loser. And the
explorers watched all that and thought, ``Great _ that's how we'll
choose our president!''
</P>
<P>
   Today is Super Tuesday in the United States of America. The only
accurate part of that description is that it is indeed a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiresome waste of money Tuesday'' might be a better name, or
``Let's bore everyone to tears Tuesday,'' because it is the day
when American democracy reaches its inane anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a skeptic, but it cannot be a good thing that the leader
of the free world is chosen on the basis of who has the most
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The race to become president has now become a permanent cycle of
massive fund-raising and profligate spending and, as George W. Bush
has demonstrated yet again, the candidate who accumulates the most
dollars wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Why can they not just be honest about it? Instead of spending
months flying around the country, accusing each other of being soft
on crime or dithering on abortion, why does Bush not take out his
wallet and say to John McCain, ``OK, let's get this over with _ how
much have you got?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush could take the stand and shout: ``God bless money!''
as everyone whooped, clapped and held up banners saying,
``Whoever's richest for the White House!''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore seems to have already wrapped up the Democratic
nomination on the basis that while Bill Clinton was president, Gore
was right by his side. I only hope he averted his eyes on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, has spent tens of millions of dollars and will
spend as much again when the election proper gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   When Lincoln dedicated the cemetery at Gettysburg, his speech
was only slightly wrong: ``These dead shall not have died in vain _
that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and
that government of the billionaires by the billionaires for the
billionaires shall not perish from this Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain in effect lost his battle to become the Republican
candidate last October, when a bill he had co-sponsored to limit
spending in U.S. presidential elections was defeated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Amid accusations of dirty tricks, a filibuster to prevent proper
debate on the bill was passed by just five votes, and so the 20th
attempt in the last 12 years to reform the financing of elections
was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, America's super-rich are free to throw money at the
candidate they think least likely to take any serious money off
them once in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the majority of poor Americans, who are offered
nothing by either party, take no part in the whole process, and an
apathetic apartheid is created. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the same system were used to appoint the British head
of state. The Queen's fortune would be used up in a couple of
months, buying television prime time to persuade us that the
Windsors really were one big happy family and that the Duke of
Edinburgh was not going to go all liberal on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cash had run out, she would need to have fund-raising
dinners with various showbiz millionaires, pretending to be amused
when Gazza put a whoopee cushion under her throne.
</P>
<P>
   And worst of all, I would find myself mailing a small donation
to her campaign as she emerged as the only candidate with an
outside chance of beating mogul Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in this country we have far fewer elections and
manage to be slightly more democratic than America. At least most
British citizens actually take part in a British general election.
But as ever, the trend is toward the American way.
</P>
<P>
   At the last election, the Conservatives spent (or arguably threw
away) (pounds sterling)20 million ($32 million) without shifting
their poll position one iota.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Labor Party cannot pretend that relying on donations
from the likes of Bernie Ecclestone has helped their credibility. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is an inevitable equation which states that the more money
political parties require, the less democratic the political system
will become.
</P>
<P>
   It is because today's American presidential hopefuls are so
beholden to their financial backers that there could never be a
candidate with a real program to tackle America's huge
inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   The people who need representing the most will not be voting
this supine Tuesday. And because of the narrowness of the remaining
constituency, none of the candidates can suggest any vaguely
sensible policies, such as introducing gun control or abolishing
capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that the United States is lumbered with politicians
who would not only be prepared to sell their grandmothers but, in
George W. Bush's case, to electrocute them as well. &QL;

spend as much again when the election proper gets under way.

<P>
   When Lincoln dedicated the cemetery at Gettysburg, his speech
was only slightly wrong: ``These dead shall not have died in vain _
that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and
that government of the billionaires by the billionaires for the
billionaires shall not perish from this Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain in effect lost his battle to become the Republican
candidate last October, when a bill he had co-sponsored to limit
spending in U.S. presidential elections was defeated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Amid accusations of dirty tricks, a filibuster to prevent proper
debate on the bill was passed by just five votes, and so the 20th
attempt in the last 12 years to reform the financing of elections
was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, America's super-rich are free to throw money at the
candidate they think least likely to take any serious money off
them once in the White House.

British citizens actually take part in a British general election.

political parties require, the less democratic the political system

<P>
   It is because today's American presidential hopefuls are so
beholden to their financial backers that there could never be a
candidate with a real program to tackle America's huge
inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   The people who need representing the most will not be voting
this supine Tuesday. And because of the narrowness of the remaining
constituency, none of the candidates can suggest any vaguely
sensible policies, such as introducing gun control or abolishing
capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that the United States is lumbered with politicians
who would not only be prepared to sell their grandmothers but, in
George W. Bush's case, to electrocute them as well. &QL;

<P>
   The first Europeans to reach the Pacific coast of North America
observed a bizarre custom practiced by the Kwakuitl Indians, in
which tribal chiefs would challenge each other to what was called a
``potlatch.''
</P>
<P>
   It involved the two chiefs going to the cliff edge and throwing
items of immense value into the sea to demonstrate their village's
enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Blankets, copper pots, weapons: they took turns to chuck away
everything that they needed to survive as their two tribes looked
on and gasped at their leaders' courage.
</P>
<P>
   The first one to run out of valuables was the loser. And the
explorers watched all that and thought, ``Great _ that's how we'll
choose our president!''
</P>
<P>
   Today is Super Tuesday in the United States of America. The only
accurate part of that description is that it is indeed a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiresome waste of money Tuesday'' might be a better name, or
``Let's bore everyone to tears Tuesday,'' because it is the day
when American democracy reaches its inane anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a skeptic, but it cannot be a good thing that the leader
of the free world is chosen on the basis of who has the most
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The race to become president has now become a permanent cycle of
massive fund-raising and profligate spending and, as George W. Bush
has demonstrated yet again, the candidate who accumulates the most
dollars wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Why can they not just be honest about it? Instead of spending
months flying around the country, accusing each other of being soft
on crime or dithering on abortion, why does Bush not take out his
wallet and say to John McCain, ``OK, let's get this over with _ how
much have you got?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush could take the stand and shout: ``God bless money!''
as everyone whooped, clapped and held up banners saying,
``Whoever's richest for the White House!''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore seems to have already wrapped up the Democratic
nomination on the basis that while Bill Clinton was president, Gore
was right by his side. I only hope he averted his eyes on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, has spent tens of millions of dollars and will
spend as much again when the election proper gets under way.
</P>

&HT;     CALIF. HAS ITS MONSTER BALLOT ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In every election the California ballot is
filled with monsters of the Id, to borrow a concept from the
science fiction movie ``Forbidden Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a great and prosperous state filled with good and
generous people. California is the original land of live and let
live. Yet each election presents us with one or more ballot
measures which pander to the meanness, resentment and dread
festering deep in the California psyche.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections we've had ballot measures picking on illegal
immigrants, mandating three-strike life sentences and attacking
affirmative action. Those all passed, but what did they do? Nothing
but stir up trouble and heartache.
</P>
<P>
   None of them advanced the career of Pete Wilson, the former
governor who had hoped to be carried to the White House on the
backs of his Id monsters. Good times, and bad timing, ruined
Wilson's politics of fear and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Wilson is still with us. In this election we face
Proposition 21, another Wilson brain monster, one that asks us to
punish children as adults. We also have Prop. 22, Pete Knight's
gratuitous rebuke to gays and lesbians who wish to be married, and
apparently Knight's way of communicating with his gay son.
</P>
<P>
   This election day, Californians should ask themselves what kind
of petty fools their politicians take them for.
</P>
<P>
   Before Prop. 22, did you ever hear people saying their marriages
are shaky
</P>
<P>
   because California might recognize the union of a couple of
lesbians?
</P>
<P>
   Heterosexual marriages are usually threatened by heterosexual
relationships _ extra-marital ones. If you want to defend marriage,
why not ban those?
</P>
<P>
   Before Prop. 21, did you believe it would be worth spending a
billion dollars on new prisons so 14-year-olds could be
incarcerated with hardened adults, and perhaps coerced into
homosexual acts? Think about that inconsistency between Props 21
and 22.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Prop. 21 is the way to stop all the car-jackings on
the news, the only place most people see jacked cars?
</P>
<P>
   If Prop. 21 passes, we'll live in a brave new California where
14-year-old vandals who do more than $400 worth of damage will be
felons, and could do a year of hard time in the big house with
adult murderers and rapists who can turn them into truly
professional criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any wrecked school locker that costs less than $400 to
repair?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Prop. 21 is to play upon fears of young
``predators,`` a term that has fallen from use as the crime rate
has fallen. Still, we're stuck with Wilson's Prop. 21, even though
he and his hopes of becoming the fear president have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, Prop. 21 would make felons of any teenager found
guilty of any activity loosely defined as ``gang recruitment.'' Any
kid defined by the
</P>
<P>
   cops as engaging in ``active participation'' in gangs would have
to register
</P>
<P>
   with the state or face prison.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile suspects' names could be released to the public even
before the kids are charged with crimes. The Justice Department
would be required to report juveniles' records, thus kids' felony
vandalism would follow them the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rights and rehabilitation are being wiped out so kids can be
locked away. Given the emphasis on gangs, you know the main targets
are kids who are black or Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Kids under 18 already can be prosecuted as adults by means of
judicial waiver. Prop. 21 would take this power from judges and
give it to prosecutors, who generally aren't known for
underzealousness.
</P>
<P>
   All this is an expression of pure meanness on the part of a man
who is no longer governor and has no hope of being president. For
that, at least, we should be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that Americans wildly overestimate the prevalence
of juvenile crime. It's no wonder given the school shooting stories
overplayed in the news. But most adults have no idea the trouble
the judicial system can make for kids.
</P>
<P>
   A young guy I know (who lives in another state) got arrested for
stealing money from the fine drawer of a public library. He's a kid
with an attention deficit disorder and a history of running with a
bad crowd in a small town. He's the kid who always got caught, and
he got caught right after his 18th birthday so he was charged with
an adult felony.
</P>
<P>
   The cops in the small town (the virtues of small towns are
highly overrated) told him they'd pin a bunch of petty crimes on
him and put him away forever under three strikes. So he confessed
to stealing the library's money. He escaped prison with probation
only because his grandparents paid for a good lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   After moving in with relatives in another state, and working
hard in a supermarket, he's made good, paying reparations for his
crime, and getting an even better job.
</P>
<P>
   If this young man had taken the library's coins under a Prop. 21
type of law, he'd be in a state prison learning the wrong kind of
career with some very hard men, and a major national company
wouldn't have a particularly energetic young salesman.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the sort of story we think about when we go into a
polling place to vote our fears. But these are the kind of kids we
can ruin with a hole punched in a ballot card.
</P>
<P>
   There are monsters on the streets, but there are many more
monsters in our minds. Unscrupulous politicians know how to call
them forth.
</P>
<P>
   What will it be next election? Six-year-olds tried for murder as
adults?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voters across America, from the small states of New
England in the east to the broad sweep of California in the west,
went to the polls Tuesday in ``Super Tuesday'' primaries that
looked set to crown Vice President Al Gore and George W. Bush as
the two contenders for the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Their challengers, whose rebel crusades had unexpectedly
enlivened the long weeks of campaigning, and at times even
threatened a lasting upset, appeared down, but _ in the case of the
Republican, Senator John McCain _ not yet out of contention
completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose final rally in the Southern California city of San
Diego was described by one participant as ``so sad, it was almost a
wake,'' spent the day quietly in Los Angeles, before a planned
``victory'' celebration in Hollywood after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   He and his campaign team still hoped for the sort of surprise
sprung by Michigan's voters, which brought him back into the race
after his double-figure defeat in South Carolina just three days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Latest opinion polls suggested that he had a good chance of
victory in the New England states and could still overtake Bush in
New York, but that Ohio and Georgia were lost, as _ more
distressingly _ was California.
</P>
<P>
   The best that McCain could hope for there was a narrow victory
in the so-called ``popular vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well ahead among registered Republicans, the only vote
that counted in terms of delegates to the Republican National
Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a chance that McCain could prevail in the
overall tally.
</P>
<P>
   California, like Washington state, has a two-tier system that
allows all registered voters to vote for whomever they like, but
only the votes of registered Republicans count in the contest for
convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly close results in the other states voting Tuesday
could yet postpone McCain's departure from the presidential race,
but next week's primaries across the South are expected to seal his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The future for Bill Bradley, Gore's sole challenger for the
Democratic Party's nomination looked even less bright.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator and former player for the New York
Knicks professional basketball team, was up early, meeting and
greeting commuters at a Manhattan subway station, from where he
went on to a local school to hobnob with voters as they emerged
from the voting hall.
</P>
<P>
   And while he, too, had a ``victory'' party planned for New York
City Tuesday night, he was said to have set aside Wednesday for
consultations with his staff _ consultations likely to leave Gore
the de facto Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence of both front-runners could be gauged by the
elaborate arrangements each had made for their victory parties last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Both were at their national headquarters in their home states:
Gore in Nashville, Tenn., and Bush _ who is Governor of Texas _ in
the state capital, Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was reported to have ``four buckets of
confetti'' ready for release in anticipation of a countrywide
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Texas both hold their primaries next week, but the
presence of the two front-runners at their headquarters was a clear
signal to the country that as of last night they, and only they,
were duelling to succeed President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 states voted Tuesday; 15 held Democratic primaries or
caucuses, and 13 held Republican ballots (i.e., 12 held both).
</P>
<P>
   And while the only close results were expected in New York and
the popular vote in California, America's usually voluble political
pundits were cautious, having seen their forecasts confounded in
New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As in these states, one of the biggest imponderables was the
turnout, which was expected to be the highest in primaries for
years, perhaps ever, reflecting the extent to which the energetic
insurgency of McCain had galvanized a new generation of voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 825) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   With voting brisk, a minor spat erupted on the sidelines about
the use of ``exit polls.''
</P>
<P>
   These polls, which estimate the final outcome on the basis of
asking voters how they have voted as they emerge from the polling
station, have increasingly enabled broadcasters and others to
pronounce the result, often with uncanny accuracy, within seconds
of the polls closing.
</P>
<P>
   Exit pollsters, however, also make running tallies and release
to subscribers, under strict embargo, periodic ``results'' through
the day. The leaking of these interim ``results'' on the Internet
prompted first complaints, and then legal action, from the polling
company.
</P>
<P>
   The company complained that it was abuse of its information (and
could influence the outcome). The Internet magazine, Slate, among
others, however, defended its decision to publish as being in the
interests of free speech and noted that the electoral world stood
to be transformed by the Internet and the clock could not be turned
back. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Voters across America, from the small states of New
England in the east to the broad sweep of California in the west,
went to the polls Tuesday in ``Super Tuesday'' primaries that
looked set to crown Vice President Al Gore and George W. Bush as
the two contenders for the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Their challengers, whose rebel crusades had unexpectedly
enlivened the long weeks of campaigning, and at times even
threatened a lasting upset, appeared down, but _ in the case of the
Republican, Senator John McCain _ not yet out of contention
completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose final rally in the Southern California city of San
Diego was described by one participant as ``so sad, it was almost a
wake,'' spent the day quietly in Los Angeles, before a planned
``victory'' celebration in Hollywood after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   He and his campaign team still hoped for the sort of surprise
sprung by Michigan's voters, which brought him back into the race
after his double-figure defeat in South Carolina just three days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Latest opinion polls suggested that he had a good chance of
victory in the New England states and could still overtake Bush in
New York, but that Ohio and Georgia were lost, as _ more
distressingly _ was California.
</P>
<P>
   The best that McCain could hope for there was a narrow victory
in the so-called ``popular vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well ahead among registered Republicans, the only vote
that counted in terms of delegates to the Republican National
Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a chance that McCain could prevail in the
overall tally.
</P>
<P>
   California, like Washington state, has a two-tier system that
allows all registered voters to vote for whomever they like, but
only the votes of registered Republicans count in the contest for
convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly close results in the other states voting Tuesday
could yet postpone McCain's departure from the presidential race,
but next week's primaries across the South are expected to seal his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The future for Bill Bradley, Gore's sole challenger for the
Democratic Party's nomination looked even less bright.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator and former player for the New York
Knicks professional basketball team, was up early, meeting and
greeting commuters at a Manhattan subway station, from where he
went on to a local school to hobnob with voters as they emerged
from the voting hall.
</P>
<P>
   And while he, too, had a ``victory'' party planned for New York
City Tuesday night, he was said to have set aside Wednesday for
consultations with his staff _ consultations likely to leave Gore
the de facto Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence of both front-runners could be gauged by the
elaborate arrangements each had made for their victory parties last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Both were at their national headquarters in their home states:
Gore in Nashville, Tenn., and Bush _ who is Governor of Texas _ in
the state capital, Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was reported to have ``four buckets of
confetti'' ready for release in anticipation of a countrywide
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Texas both hold their primaries next week, but the
presence of the two front-runners at their headquarters was a clear
signal to the country that as of last night they, and only they,
were duelling to succeed President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 states voted Tuesday; 15 held Democratic primaries or
caucuses, and 13 held Republican ballots (i.e., 12 held both).
</P>
<P>
   And while the only close results were expected in New York and
the popular vote in California, America's usually voluble political
pundits were cautious, having seen their forecasts confounded in
New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As in these states, one of the biggest imponderables was the
turnout, which was expected to be the highest in primaries for
years, perhaps ever, reflecting the extent to which the energetic
insurgency of McCain had galvanized a new generation of voters. &QL;

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 825) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   With voting brisk, a minor spat erupted on the sidelines about
the use of ``exit polls.''
</P>
<P>
   These polls, which estimate the final outcome on the basis of
asking voters how they have voted as they emerge from the polling
station, have increasingly enabled broadcasters and others to
pronounce the result, often with uncanny accuracy, within seconds
of the polls closing.
</P>
<P>
   Exit pollsters, however, also make running tallies and release
to subscribers, under strict embargo, periodic ``results'' through
the day. The leaking of these interim ``results'' on the Internet
prompted first complaints, and then legal action, from the polling
company.
</P>
<P>
   The company complained that it was abuse of its information (and
could influence the outcome). The Internet magazine, Slate, among
others, however, defended its decision to publish as being in the
interests of free speech and noted that the electoral world stood
to be transformed by the Internet and the clock could not be turned
back. &QL;

&HT;     FDA REVIVES PROBE OF ENERGY SUPPLEMENT AMID SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In truck stops, it's sold as a ``super-energy''
pill.
</P>
<P>
   In drugstores, it's touted as an appetite-curbing diet aid.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, it's marketed to teen-agers as an herbal
alternative to the illegal street drug, Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, a chemical cousin to the drug methamphetamine, has been
popularized in hundreds of health products sold as dietary
supplements. It's as easy to buy as aspirin, and looks safer,
because no warning labels are required.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Food and Drug Administration has collected more than 800
reports of users suffering adverse reactions, ranging from
dizziness and dementia to strokes, heart attacks and sudden deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After years of failed attempts to regulate the ephedra products,
the FDA notified Congress on Feb. 25 that it is launching a new
push to address public safety issues posed by ephedra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of concern about this particular product in
terms of its safety,'' said Joe Levitt, who heads the FDA unit that
oversees dietary supplements. ``There is a public health issue here
that needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of dietary supplement products contain ephedra, which
is extracted from the Chinese plant ma-huang and then manufactured
into capsules, liquids or powders.
</P>
<P>
   They are sold as energy boosters for athletes, as weight loss
tools, muscle builders, or as stimulants for those who need to stay
awake. A few companies even market products as an herbal
alternative to the illegal street drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that ephedra, which has a chemical structure that
differs from methamphetamine by only one atom, has an effect on the
body similar to that of the illicit drug ``speed.'' It constricts
the blood vessels, raises blood pressure and causes the heart to
beat more rapidly, according to Dr. Bill Gurley, a pharmacologist
with the University of Alabama, who has studied ephedra products.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Siegner, a lawyer who represents dietary supplement
manufacturers, said the industry's own research has shown ephedra
is safe if taken in proper doses and in accordance with package
labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry is very, very concerned about the safety of these
products as well,'' he said. ``Industry has consulted with
toxicologists and doctors and come up with a dosage that we believe
is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gurley and Haller said they believe that even small doses
can trigger devastating reactions in people who have
susceptibilities they don't know about.
</P>
<P>
   While industry officials say there is no proof that ephedra is
the actual cause of the reported problems, some of the
most-publicized cases have involved alarming injuries:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, 15-year-old Rosanna Porras of Ventura County, Calif.,
collapsed on a high school soccer field from a massive heart
attack. Friends said she had been taking ephedra energy pills
available at local drugstores to boost her athletic stamina. Her
parents believe that the pills triggered an underlying heart
condition, causing her death.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 28-year-old Seattle woman claimed that ephedra diet pills
made her slip into such severe psychosis that she became delusional
while driving and slammed into another car in Canada, killing two
teen-age girls. A Canadian court agreed that she was made
temporarily insane by the product and declined to prosecute her.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 31-year-old Newport Beach, Calif., man was hospitalized for
uncontrollable vomiting after using a tea containing ephedra to
help his body-building regimen for several months. Doctors found a
hole in his pancreas ``big enough to put a thumb through.'' He was
diagnosed with ``pancreatitis'' and told he would have to receive
daily insulin injections for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs, dietary supplements, including those containing
ephedra, are not tightly regulated by the FDA. Current federal law
allows companies to market many chemicals extracted from natural
sources as dietary supplements without first having to study the
safety or effectiveness of them. Yet medical experts say those
unstudied chemicals occurring in nature can be just as potent as
synthetic, prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   John Hathcock, of the Washington, D.C.-based dietary supplement
industry group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the
industry does not oppose warning labels, but he dismissed
suggestions that ephedra products ought to be sold by prescription
only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything that has the potential to be dangerous can be
taken off the market and made prescription only,'' he said.
``People kill themselves with liquid drain cleaner.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's earlier attempts to regulate ephedra, starting in
1997, were beaten down by political opposition and criticism that
the agency failed to scientifically prove the substance was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   With drugs, manufacturers are required to show the products are
safe before putting them on the market. But with dietary
supplements, which are regulated like foods, federal law places the
burden on the FDA to prove the product is unsafe, before it can
impose restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing adverse reaction reports collected by the agency, the FDA
originally proposed requiring companies to sell ephedra products
only in low dosages and to advise consumers to use them for no more
than seven days. The proposal also would have banned popular
products that mix ephedra with caffeine _ a combination that
medical experts say greatly magnifies stimulant effects.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA backed off the proposal, after an uproar from
industry leaders and some members of Congress and a report from the
General Accounting Office criticizing the agency's methodology for
proving ephedra was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 25 letter to Congress, the agency withdrew its
earlier proposal to limit ephedra dosages and announced it will
hold hearings to work out new ways to handle the safety concerns
about the substance.

<P>
   Many of us retreat to our homes for relaxation and security,
only to find that our senses are being attacked by a variety of
allergy-related culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the American Lung
Association say that indoor air pollution is a major health
concern.
</P>
<P>
   According to PuriTec, makers of air cleaners, the air in your
home may be four to 100 times more polluted than that in even large
cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   One way to combat airborne irritants is to use an air cleaner to
clear tobacco smoke, pet hair and dander, dust mites, molds,
bacteria and pollen. It can also remove vapors from carpets and
textiles, cleaning solvents and other pollution particulates that
exacerbate allergies and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Clean air allows you to sleep and breathe easier.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing an air cleaner, look for a free-standing model
that combines the latest technology in high-efficiency particulate
absorption, or HEPA, and carbon air filtration, which in a larger
form is the type used in hospital surgery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   HEPA technology, which has been around since the 1930s, is
essentially a type of paper that allows air to pass through while
absorbing and trapping pollutants, preventing them from moving back
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   HEPA technology was developed by the Atomic Energy Commission to
create clean and safe environments to protect researchers and
scientists. High-efficiency gas absorption, or HEGA, filtration was
released in 1998 by the British Army for use by the public. This
type of filter, which uses a granular mix, was designed to protect
troops from chemical weapons and in air cleaners to remove
formaldehyde and acetones.

   SOUFFLE (Undated) _ Creme brulee may one day retire, but the
souffle will always persist. And though chefs will never concede
it, it is not because the souffle takes great talent, but because
it is so easy. By Amanda Hesser.

   PUERTORICO-CUISINE (San Juan) _ Walking into the Casita Blanca
Restaurant is like walking into a country home, one with ceiling
fans, bare cement floors and live poultry _ in this case a turkey
named Gabino and a rooster known as Pancho _ roaming the indoor
patio. In this small restaurant in the working-class neighbhorhood
of Villa Palmeras, Jesus Perez has created something that is simple
yet rare: a place where you can taste the distinctive flavors of
Puerto Rican cuisine, the traditional dishes that are almost
impossible to find outside of a home _ even here on the island. By
Mireya Navarro.

   RESTAURANT-CREDITS (New York) _ There was a time when chefs were
anonymous. No one knew their names. If a restaurant was named Chez
Louis, chances were that Louis was not the guy behind the stove. He
was the owner. When anyone dared to ask Henri Soule, the owner of
Le Pavillon, who was responsible for the greatness of his
restaurant, he had a very simple answer: ``Le Pavillon,'' he would
say, ``c'est moi.'' I found myself thinking about those far-off
days while studying the menu at Thalia recently. Down at the
bottom, the name of the chef is printed. And next to the chef,
Michael Otsuka, his sous-chefs, Bill McDaniel and Robert Martin.
Sous-chefs? The United States has often been called a credit
society. It's true in two senses. Americans love credit cards. And
they love credit _ the recognition of accomplishment,
near-accomplishment, well-intended lack of accomplishment or merely
showing up. In a success-ethic democracy, it just doesn't feel
right unless everybody wins and trophies are handed out all around.
A critic's notebook by William Grimes.

   BOX-NY-INQUIRY (New York) _ The Manhattan district attorney's
office has seized New York State Athletic Commission records from
the Feb. 26 boxing card at the Garden, which featured the De La
Hoya-Coley fight but also included the Gatti-Gamache bout, which
was tarnished by the fact that Gatti outweighed Gamache by nearly
20 pounds when the two finally got into the ring. And that bout
ended with the 141-pound Gamache suffering a serious concussion. By
Timothy W. Smith.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, CALIF. _ At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,
in the rolling foothills of Ventura County, some 40 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, the legacy of America's most popular _ if divisive
_ recent president is enshrined in the so-called Four Pillars of
Freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy
and national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Those are political slogans that the two front-runners for this
year's Republican presidential nomination, George W. Bush and John
McCain, have no trouble embracing.
</P>
<P>
   For all the acrimony dividing them, both have invoked the Reagan
era as their inspiration. Indeed, they have tussled over which of
them deserves to be called Reagan's true successor.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for the Reagan mantle is not simply a matter of
point-scoring in debates; it is a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans want to win back the White House, they are
going to have to field a candidate with at least some of Reagan's
crossover appeal to Democrats and independents, as well as some of
the ideological zeal that galvanized the Gipper's closest
followers.
</P>
<P>
   So which of the two candidates best fits the bill? In what may
be an ominous sign for the party's chances come November, the
overwhelming consensus among Ronald Reagan devotees ambling through
the library and museum this week was that neither does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is too dependent on the powerful people who put him where
he is to be a real leader,'' opined Terry Erskine, a retired
businessman from Orange County, one of the most conservative areas
in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for McCain, he's a feisty little guy, but he doesn't have
Reagan's charisma. Reagan was a great orator. He had stature. I
don't see that in either of these two.''
</P>
<P>
   The charisma issue surfaced, unprompted, in interview after
interview with library visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Charisma was indeed Reagan's strongest political asset and a
shield that protected him from the consequences of his
administration's more outrageous acts of foreign policy adventurism
and domestic hostility to unionized workers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As a couple of visitors reluctantly admitted, a similar ability
to connect with people helped Bill Clinton reach the White House
and stay there for two terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was variously described as ``wooden,'' ``unconvincing''
and ``too much a product of his privileged background.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he scored points with some people for his ability
to reach out to a broad electorate _ the so-called ``Reagan
Democrats'' who proved so decisive in the 1980s in states like
California and Michigan _ but fell down with others because he was
perceived as being more about bluster and rebellious energy than
true charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan's quality was that he was infinitely likeable, and
that's important in U.S. politics,'' said Jan Smithers, a Canadian
sociologist living in California. ``I don't think Bush and McCain
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   If such views are representative of the electorate as a whole,
they spell trouble for both Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his campaign, Bush sold himself as the voice of
inclusion, the ``compassionate conservative'' who could appeal to
both the right and the center. His sharp turn to the right,
provoked by McCain's challenge, appears to have done considerable
damage to that platform.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he has been counting on his brash populism to
override the misgivings about him within the Republican Party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   If the sort of voter who visits the Reagan Library _ who might
be anything from a hard-line right-winger to a soft independent
centrist _ can't get excited about him, then his chances of winning
a plurality of registered Republicans seem dim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   A big propaganda coup for either candidate would be to receive
the endorsement of the Reagans themselves. Ronald, ill with
Alzheimer's disease, is presumably past making a rational choice,
and his wife Nancy has so far stayed above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The best indication of the family's preferences came this week
on a radio show hosted by Michael Reagan, the ex-president's son,
who argued with McCain about the religious right and then, after
his guest's mobile phone signal broke up, said: ``I don't want to
talk to him if he calls back.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that a tacit endorsement of Bush? If so, it is not
necessarily shared by rank-and-file Reaganites.
</P>
<P>
   One library visitor describing himself as a centrist, retired
university administrator Eugene Johnson from New York, said he
would rather vote for Al Gore than for George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans will choose Bush as their candidate, and they
will go down to defeat,'' he predicted.

AMTRAK UNHITCHES ROUTE FROM LOCAL ECONOMIES OF ALPINE, SANDERSON,
DEL RIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abilene and Odessa are going to be passenger rail stops again;
Fort Worth will be a major hub.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is making these suggestions and if no one interferes, the
new plan could be running by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The new path of the Sunset Limited between San Antonio and El
Paso has been hailed all along the Interstate 20 corridor. The
train, which begins in Orlando, Fla., and ends in Los Angeles, will
turn north at San Antonio, travel to Fort Worth, then west
shadowing the interstate. It brings new opportunities for commerce,
and additional chances for tourism dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the move isn't so celebrated in Alpine,
Sanderson and Del Rio, the cities along the old route that have
been summarily abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular route change is shortsighted when considering
the big picture of tourism and the picturesque Sunset Limited
itinerary,'' said David Busey, director of community development in
Alpine.
</P>
<P>
   To be a bit more succinct, Busey added, ``With the changes
proposed, the Sunset Limited will be scenically and culturally
challenged by being diverted northerly through monotonous plains,
oil fields and nondescript urban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's right. The charm of rails curling along the Rio
Grande, passing over the massive Lake Amistad, and winding through
the Glass and Del Norte Mountains is definitely greater than
chugging along the predominantly flat lands between Abilene and El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that this has been an historic route,'' Busey said.
``The train has been coming through here since 1883. And it is just
one more of those things that ends up being a blow to a rural
community. It's one thing after another.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sanderson, the blows have been relentless. First, the city
lost important traffic when Interstate 10 supplanted U.S. 90 as the
major East-West route across the southern portion of the state.
Then, the railroad began its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson was founded on the railroad. It was a major Southern
Pacific overhaul center with a round house and full crews. Over the
years, the work left; eventually, in 1994, the entire service
center closed, costing the city 50 jobs and $5 million in payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The newest decision, to bypass Sanderson on the Sunset Limited
line, cuts deeply into the town's emotional base. ``It's going to
hurt us,'' County Judge Dudley Harrison said. ``Anything you do to
us like that hurts. We have been working very hard to make a
comeback and a lot of that work will go by the wayside now.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Del Rio have recently joined in a ``Rails and
Trails'' program in which Del Rio visitors take the train to
Sanderson _ across the Amistad reservoir and through Seminole
Canyon State Park, with a stop at Judge Roy Bean's in Langtry. They
eat lunch at local restaurants, then return by van to Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a popular program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be gone now,'' Harrison said. ``We sure don't like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, of course, won't be dissuaded by a van full of local
tourists. The national rail line needs volume, the kind that comes
from servicing larger metropolitan markets. It needs the freight
those markets generate. It has to be off the government dole by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   It can't worry over historical concerns in Alpine, or whether
the train passengers get to see a mountain range or a West Texas
oil patch. Amtrak needs the new business.
</P>
<P>
   But so do the cities it is leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amtrak's decision to eliminate the El Paso-San Antonio sector
of the Sunset Limited route is a great disservice to the people of
the Big Bend region,'' Alpine Mayor Paul Weyerts said. ``It is also
a disservice to the thousands of future Amtrak passengers who will
be deprived of seeing one of the most scenic parts of Texas.''

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, CALIF. _ At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,
in the rolling foothills of Ventura County, some 40 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, the legacy of America's most popular _ if divisive
_ recent president is enshrined in the so-called Four Pillars of
Freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy
and national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Those are political slogans that the two front-runners for this
year's Republican presidential nomination, George W. Bush and John
McCain, have no trouble embracing.
</P>
<P>
   For all the acrimony dividing them, both have invoked the Reagan
era as their inspiration. Indeed, they have tussled over which of
them deserves to be called Reagan's true successor.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for the Reagan mantle is not simply a matter of
point-scoring in debates; it is a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans want to win back the White House, they are
going to have to field a candidate with at least some of Reagan's
crossover appeal to Democrats and independents, as well as some of
the ideological zeal that galvanized the Gipper's closest
followers.
</P>
<P>
   So which of the two candidates best fits the bill? In what may
be an ominous sign for the party's chances come November, the
overwhelming consensus among Ronald Reagan devotees ambling through
the library and museum this week was that neither does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is too dependent on the powerful people who put him where
he is to be a real leader,'' opined Terry Erskine, a retired
businessman from Orange County, one of the most conservative areas
in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for McCain, he's a feisty little guy, but he doesn't have
Reagan's charisma. Reagan was a great orator. He had stature. I
don't see that in either of these two.''
</P>
<P>
   The charisma issue surfaced, unprompted, in interview after
interview with library visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Charisma was indeed Reagan's strongest political asset and a
shield that protected him from the consequences of his
administration's more outrageous acts of foreign policy adventurism
and domestic hostility to unionized workers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As a couple of visitors reluctantly admitted, a similar ability
to connect with people helped Bill Clinton reach the White House
and stay there for two terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was variously described as ``wooden,'' ``unconvincing''
and ``too much a product of his privileged background.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he scored points with some people for his ability
to reach out to a broad electorate _ the so-called ``Reagan

California and Michigan _ but fell down with others because he was

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You work out and watch your diet, but when was
the last time you exercised your brain?
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most people, you haven't given your brain much
thought since you left school. And you probably thought that all
those misplaced keys and forgotten names were inevitable _ and
irreversible _ symptoms of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. New research is showing that it is possible to keep
your brain fit and flexible with a little regular exercise and
stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Active brain cells produce more brain chemicals which help
keep brain cells alive,'' said Lawrence C. Katz, a professor of
neurobiology at Duke University Medical School in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But Katz, who promotes a regimen called ``neurobics,'' doesn't
believe you have to read a book a day or master the New York Times
crossword puzzle to see benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While such mental challenges are helpful, they aren't the only
ways to get the brain to branch out and literally build new links
between neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Try brushing your teeth with the opposite hand. Or take a new
route to work. Any exercise that gives your brain a break from the
routine is establishing vital new pathways and circuits among brain
cells. ``The idea is to weave a more dense network of connections
so if a few fray as you get older, you'll have others to fall back
on,'' said Katz, the co-author of a new book, ``Keep Your Brain
Alive,'' by Workman Publishing Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to make you able to memorize 30 names in 30 seconds
but to keep your brain flexible,'' he said. ``It's kind of like the
brain equivalent of taking the stairs instead of the elevator. It's
not going to make you a marathon runner but it will help you stay
toned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Spurgas, the chief of neurosurgery at Ellis Hospital in
Schenectady, has already seen the anecdotal evidence. ``The
patients in my practice who read, keep up with the newspapers, they
tend to be sharper much longer in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, research has shown that the average American is
frittering away much precious mental energy, almost four hours
daily, on television _ one of the best ways to make the brain
flabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brain is designed to be stimulated by your five senses,''
said Katz, who believes social interactions with other people are
among the best ways to exercise the brain. ``Planting a garden is
brain exercise, watching a video or television show about planting
a garden isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other types of exercise, it's never too late to start a
regimen of mental workouts, according to Dr. Gary Bernardini, a
neurologist at Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Simple activities like tying your shoes a different way, reading
a book, or balancing your checkbook with paper and pencil, instead
of a calculator, are good places to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a muscle,'' Bernardini said. ``If you use
your brain and your memory, it's going to help as you get older.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, he believes, is maintaining a healthy
lifestyle to help minimize the risk of brain problems such as
stroke. ``Control your blood pressure, control your diabetes, stop
smoking,'' he said.

<P>
   Q: What's the background of the producers and writers of the TV
show ``Popular,'' and how is it doing in the ratings? The episode I
just saw was particularly disturbing and obscene.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.R., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Popular,'' a WB network sitcom that premiered in September
1999, is credited to screenwriter Ryan Murphy and film producer
Gina Matthews. Murphy wrote ``The Furies'' and ``Why Can't I Be
Audrey Hepburn?'' and Matthews produced ``Urban Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   You can write to the crew and cast in care of ``Popular,'' WB
Network, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. No. 34R, Burbank, CA 91522.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at the ratings for the show, which is
watched by about 2.5 million viewers. About 80 to 90 shows have
higher ratings each week, but the comedy is the most popular sitcom
and seventh-most-popular show on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, WB replaced two new shows with ``Popular'' reruns on
Monday nights: ``Brutally Normal'' and ``Zoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I met someone who resembles the very beautiful '50s model
Bettie Page. Where can I get a photo of her?
</P>
<P>
   _ J., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The retailer What's Hot Now sells 20 official Bettie Page
items, including lighters, coffee mugs, money clips and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (888) 500-7776 or visit the Web site www.whn.com.
Page also has an official Web site at www.cmgww.com/stars/page.
</P>
<P>
   Page, 76, quit modeling in 1957 and later worked as a counselor
for the Billy Graham Crusades and as an elementary school teacher.
She lives in the Los Angeles area today and turns down frequent
public-appearance and photo requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to see a fat old model,'' she told the
Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 1997. ``It destroys the image.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to her in care of Page's official fan club, the
Bettie Scouts of America, at 2641 S. 53rd St., Kansas City, KS
66106-3365.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I mail something to Jay Leno and David Letterman?
</P>

SHE'S SUGAR AND SPICE AND CONTRADICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A serious question for you, dear reader, one that I have no
answer to and that currently keeps the Post Toasties in my belly
all aflutter: Is there any way to keep my 5-year-old daughter from
becoming a female?
</P>
<P>
   The background: It had been a glorious Sunday morning. I woke up
early, ate some oatmeal, engaged in some quality time with a
well-known Western deity, jogged to the gym, swam a thousand
meters, walked back, lunched on a shrimp po-boy and a few adult
beverages to counteract any good the workout did for me, then
headed home. The wife and daughter were in the middle of _ I am not
making this up _ a Tae-Bo workout. I said to myself, ``Hey, the
women are busy. House is clean. Chores done. Beverage effect
kicking in. Time to kick it old-school: I'm going to break off
about a two-hour afternoon nap for the first time in years.''
</P>
<P>
   How stupid am I? Ten minutes later I was snug and cozy, fading
to sleep, my last thoughts of the restful bliss that defines a fine
lazy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?'' came the war cry.
</P>
<P>
   The wife was in the room. My heart leaped out of my chest, ran
and hid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know ... sleeping ... dear.''
</P>
<P>
   With no heart, therefore no steady blood supply, my brain was
shutting down. I didn't realize it was a trick question. Of course
she didn't want a literal answer. She wanted to know what all women
want to know in that situation: ``What makes you think I'll let you
do something solitary and enjoyable on a weekend?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this didn't really surprise me. It's part of the ``joyous
compromise'' of marriage. I had just lost my mind for a minute.
Still, I wasn't ready for what came next.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, all sinewy and lean after her Tae-Bo session,
leaped onto my stomach. ``YEAH DADDY! GET UP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
YOU'RE ALWAYS SLEEPING AND WE HAVE THINGS ... FOR ... YOU ... TO
DO!''
</P>
<P>
   A large cartoonish question mark formed over my head, complete
with a ``boing'' sound. Always sleeping? I haven't slept since she
was born. Things to do? What, watch ``Blues Clues''?
</P>
<P>
   As I settled back into my everyday dadlike, sleep-deprived
state, I realized that my daughter _ formerly ``pumpkin'' and ``my
little girl'' _ had been acting more and more like her mother in
recent weeks. I had just passed it off as my imagination, but
looking back at specific incidents _ e.g., saying she needed new
Powerpuff Girl sneakers because ``all the kids had seen her in
those a hundred times'' _ a pattern emerged. My daughter was
becoming a female.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, my fears were confirmed. As Mom was getting
ready for work, the munchkin turned on the TV in my room, then
hopped into bed to watch cartoons. I gave her a good-morning hug
and cheek-smooch.
</P>
<P>
   ``GROSS DADDY YOU STINK!'' she announced to the neighborhood.
``GO GET IN THE SHOWER! I'M TRYING TO WATCH CARTOON NETWORK!''
</P>
<P>
   Shunned, I did as I was told. A few minutes later, the wife and
I heard the daughter crying and ran back in the room. ``What's the
matter, honey?'' we asked.
</P>
<P>
   (Sniffling quietly, in a doe-eyed manner) ``Daddy won't watch
cartoons with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom looked accusingly at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... she kicked me out ... said I stunk ... I tried to
watch ...''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. At once repulsed by me and yet always wanting me by her
side. At once forceful and emotionally needy. At once assured and
teary. The transformation was complete. My daughter was, is, my
wife. She is a female.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I want her to be more masculine, piggish,
self-centered, like her daddy. But I was hoping there was something
in between, a state where my daughter would exhibit all the
glorious warmth and intelligence and caring of her mother without
all the stuff that I jes dunt unnerstan.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, I did my best. Crawled into bed so she'd have
someone with whom she could watch cartoons. I hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, did you shower yet?''

ARE WE LOSING OUR ABILITY TO DEBATE ABOUT RELIGION?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALAN COCHRUM 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hmmm. How can I put this?
</P>
<P>
   I have serious problems with Roman Catholic theology. (Which is
not a surprising thing, given a lifelong background among the
Churches of Christ.)
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe in the veneration of Mary. I do not believe in
the invocation of saints. I do not believe in the use of icons. I
do not believe in mandatory singleness for church leaders. I do not
believe in the infallibility of the church or the pope.
</P>
<P>
   I find the doctrine of indulgences baffling. I find the church's
use of annulments tragicomic. I find its practice of baptizing
infants biblically suspect, at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   So if I say all those things, am I an anti-Catholic bigot?
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, George W. Bush probably hadn't given
Catholicism too much thought recently. But thanks to GOP primary
opponent John McCain, the reaction to Bush's campaign visit to Bob
Jones University _ where Vatican City is not seen as a light among
the nations _ left the Texas governor nursing a bloody political
nose and writing an apology to a New York cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   However, a larger issue lurks behind this episode, which
actually had far more to do with the politics of religion (and the
religion of politics) than faith itself. For a moment, set aside
Bush, McCain and the specific attitudes at one South Carolina
campus. The question here is whether America is losing the ability
to debate religious claims with anything like the conviction that
they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   America's founders were intimately acquainted with the perils of
marrying civil and ecclesiastical power. So what man had joined
together, the Constitution put asunder. The church _ or, one could
add these days, the synagogue or the mosque _ was not going to be
running the state, and the state was not going to be running the
church.
</P>
<P>
   It is one divorce that has actually worked. For two centuries,
adherents of various faiths have been able to go about their
business without worrying that the next transfer of political power
could mean disenfranchisement, exile or the latest version of the
stake. But recently the divorce has birthed an illegitimate child.
</P>
<P>
   The old saying was that one didn't discuss religion or politics
in polite society. The public square was a different matter. Creeds
as well as candidates were fair game. One can log onto eBay and
find sellers offering old books and pamphlets with titles like
``The Smith-Lovelady Debate'' _ the texts of public arguments about
everything from marriage to church music.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it seems that religion is being elbowed rudely out
of the public square as well as the dining room. It's not a matter
of the truth or falsity of the faith claims _ the problem is the
proclamation itself.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that this religion is truer than that one, or seeking
to convert members of one faith to another, is ... crass. It is
gauche. It is Not Done. It encounters the kind of disapproval that
once greeted promiscuity. Better to suggest that someone's mother
wears army boots with round heels.
</P>
<P>
   What a tragedy. We are selling our birthright _ the freedom to
discuss and contend for the truth as we understand it _ for a mess
of insipid pottage, a stew of hollow tolerance that in the end
nourishes no one.
</P>
<P>
   Does religious bigotry exist? Of course _ as surely as all
prejudices exist. Many a mother can probably tell of the rejection
suffered by children when their playmates, or their playmates'
parents, discovered their religious background. The Know-Nothings,
the political activists of the mid-1800s who saw those alien Irish
Catholics as such a threat, are an old American story.
</P>
<P>
   But ``bigotry'' is a word to be handled with care, a rhetorical
diagnosis to be pronounced only when truly warranted. It is not a
muzzle to be snapped over the mouths of those who simply call our
beliefs into question.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century thinkers behind the Bill of Rights knew that
government could not be trusted to act as an arbiter and dispenser
of moral truth. The virtue of the First Amendment is that it
provides a civic space where ideas can freely fight for survival.
(Whether the truest ideas will indeed thrive is another question
altogether.)
</P>
<P>
   But when we turn this freedom into a rationale that objective
truth is undiscoverable or nonexistent _ a feeling that what is
``true'' for you need not be ``true'' for me, a sort of
Get-Out-of-Moral-Responsibility-Free card _ then we have wasted our
inheritance as Americans, and indeed as human beings. Like the
prodigal son, we will find ourselves in the fields, feeding swine
and perishing with hunger.
</P>
<P>
   If we argue that our particular religious views are somehow
sacrosanct simply because they are ``ours,'' we are not dealing
from a position of strength. We may be dealing from a position of
insecurity (from an inability to defend our dogmas) or arrogance
(from the conviction that we have ``everything'' nailed down to the
last jot and tittle), but not strength.
</P>
<P>
   America does not need more religious bigotry. What we need is a
society that understands that our religions purport to tell us the
truth about humanity and divinity, and that those faith systems are
not telling us the same thing. What we need are people who can
discuss their beliefs intelligently and vigorously and still be
good neighbors, classmates, colleagues and citizens. But that is
impossible if we turn ourselves into spiritual porcupines,
bristling at the very idea that someone might have a morsel of
truth that we do not.
</P>
<P>
   I have more than a few quarrels with the Roman Catholic Church,
and with many another religious group besides. But I have more
respect for those who assert that God is therefore unhappy with me,
and that I need to repent, than for those who argue that no one has
a moral right to try to change my mind.

A CRISP BIRD FROM A PAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sauteed chicken should have the same attributes as fried
chicken: meat that is moist and flavorful inside and crisp outside.
Getting it that way is easy, but it took me nearly 30 years of
experimentation to discover that the best method is also the
simplest one. Only three rules apply.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need a good chicken. This is not the time for a
cotton-textured, mass-produced bird. I prefer kosher chicken, but
that may be because for me the paradigm of pan-cooked chicken is my
maternal grandmother's, and she kept a kosher kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you need a large nonstick skillet, or two smaller ones,
because there is no oil used to saute and because crowding the
chicken pieces prevents them from browning. The skillet should be
large enough so that the pieces barely touch each other; they
should certainly not overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you have to pay attention. If the heat is too high, the
chicken pieces will scorch and dry out; if it is too low, they will
get soggy and never brown. The best heat level is medium, but some
adjustments may be needed to guarantee even browning.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe has only two or three crucial ingredients, but it is
easy to vary. I like to add garlic and paprika (again, my
grandmother's influence), but a mild chili powder, like ancho,
would work as well with the garlic. Other seasonings, in small
amounts, are also good, like curry powder, five-spice powder or a
mixture of cinnamon and allspice with a pinch of ground cloves.
</P>
<P>
   To finish, all you need is a squeeze of lemon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAUTEED CHICKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken, 2 to 3 pounds, cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon paprika or mild chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges, optional
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and arrange skin
side down in a nonstick skillet large enough to accommodate all the
pieces without crowding; use two skillets if necessary. Turn heat
to medium.
</P>
<P>
   2. About 5 minutes after pieces begin to make cooking noises,
peek at their undersides. If they are browning evenly, leave them
alone; otherwise, shift them as needed so they will brown evenly.
Let every piece cook until evenly golden brown and crisp-looking
before turning over and seasoning with paprika or chili powder.
Adjust heat as needed. If pieces are scorching or spattering, turn
heat down; if the chicken is cooking too slowly, raise it a bit.
</P>
<P>
   3. When chicken is nearly done, add garlic to skillet. As pieces
finish browning, turn them skin side down once again. To test for
doneness, cut into a piece or two; there should be no traces of
blood, but some pinkness is okay. Breast pieces will finish first;
you can keep them warm in a low oven. Serve with lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

&HT;     CALIF. WOMAN IS FOUND SAFE AFTER TWO DAYS IN SIERRA SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A woman from Danville, Calif., who for two days
survived by eating snow after getting lost at a Sierra ski resort,
has been found safe and unharmed, sheriff officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Allis Norvill, 37, was found Monday after spending two
nights in a
</P>
<P>
   snow cave that she dug and lined with leaves and pine needles
about two miles outside the Sugar Bowl ski area.
</P>
<P>
   She was able to walk when a snowmobile team found her about 1
p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Norvill was reported missing on Saturday when she failed to show
up to
</P>
<P>
   meet a friend as planned, a Placer County Sheriff's Department
spokesman
</P>
<P>
   said. Norvill was skiing at Sugar Bowl and apparently went
beyond the
</P>
<P>
   posted ski area boundary near Mount Lincoln and crossed into
national
</P>
<P>
   forest lands, which are not patrolled or regulated by the
resort, officials at the resort said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department began searching for her Saturday night.
On Monday, Norvill was walking downhill to find her way back when
she
</P>
<P>
   heard snowmobiles, but couldn't reach them. Three hours later
she saw them again and ran to the top of a ridge, where she located
the snowmobile tracks. About 30 minutes later, the searchers
returned to the area and found her.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to Tahoe Forest Hospital in Truckee, about 90
miles east
</P>
<P>
   of Sacramento, where she was examined. Uninjured, she was
released later
</P>
<P>
   in the day.
</P>
<P>
   During the time she was lost, Norvill used mascara and a hotel
</P>
<P>
   confirmation letter to write a note to her fiance. ``I'm so
sorry I got lost and I'm trying to resist the cold,'' Norvill wrote
in her letter. ``I love you. Be safe. I will be your guardian
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday morning, she wrote: ``Made it through the night. I'm
all
</P>
<P>
   sheltered but weak. Why didn't anyone look for me? I could have
been
</P>
<P>
   saved.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS LIKELY TO GIVE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY MORE FOREIGN WORKERS
 &HT;    800&AMP;adds. With TECH-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a labor drought this summer, technology
executives are asking Congress for relief this spring.
</P>
<P>
   They claim their businesses can grow only if sprinkled with
talent drawn from deep pools of labor found in India, China and
elsewhere. Congress must increase the ceiling on visas for
foreigners with high-tech skills to keep U.S. companies from
shriveling, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the effort believe today's worker shortages
will actually strengthen the economy in the long run. They argue
that if companies can't get a quick fix from overseas, they will
retrain older U.S. workers and work more closely with schools to
produce better students.
</P>
<P>
   With elections coming up, most members of Congress are eager to
please wealthy technology executives. And no lawmaker wants to be
accused of slowing the engine that has been driving the U.S.
economy's longest expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these lawmakers fear a backlash from workers
concerned about competition from low-wage foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there is a national labor shortage of such
dimensions that we need more visas,'' said Vin O'Neill, a lobbyist
for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a
professional association based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The visas, known as H-1B visas, allow highly skilled workers
such as engineers and computer programmers to come into the United
States for three years. Usually, a visa can be renewed once for an
additional three-year stay. Often, temporary workers use the visas
as a step toward gaining permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   This debate over foreign workers may sound familiar. Just two
years ago, spurred on primarily by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
Congress raised the annual limit on high-tech visas from 65,000 to
115,000 for both fiscal 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But under current law, the limit will fall to 107,500 when
fiscal 2001 begins Oct. 1, and the following year, the cap will
return to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, which have been hiring frantically in the
past year, will hit this year's limit even before spring is over.
Unless the law is changed, they will have to cool their heels until
new visas become available Oct. 1 and will face even a greater
squeeze under next year's smaller visa cap. Some executives even
suggest U.S. businesses will have to move operations overseas to
find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group,
says nearly 269,000 high-tech jobs are going unfilled already,
costing U.S. businesses $4.5 billion in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   To help companies, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., introduced a bill last month to increase H-1B
visas to 195,000 for this year, and to stay at that level through
fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislation also would exempt from the cap foreigners who
work for U.S. colleges and universities or research institutions,
as well as foreigners who received a master's degree or doctorate
from a U.S. college within six months of their employment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would retain a provision of the 1998 bill requiring a
$500-per-visa fee to go toward scholarships and worker training
programs in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said labor shortages are so severe that he believes
lawmakers will move his bill quickly. ``I don't think we're going
to have tremendous opposition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Congress favor a different approach. Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, has
submitted a bill that would boost the H-1B visa cap from 115,000 to
160,000, but just for this year. In 2001, the ceiling would fall to
107,500, and then to 65,000 the following year. ``Our bill seeks to
solve an immediate problem,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith bill also would boost the visa fee to $1,000 per
foreigner, with the revenues going to college scholarships for
students in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has rounded up key co-sponsors: Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.,
who co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus; Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif., whose district includes Silicon Valley, and Rep. Chris
Cannon, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte's support is especially important because he is widely
regarded as the high-tech world's best friend in Washington. If
Goodlatte says this is the best deal industry is going to get from
Congress and the White House, tech lobbyists may well take his word
for it. Tech companies would then renew their fight for more visas
when a new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   How well next year's lobbying effort goes may depend heavily on
a study being conducted by the National Science Foundation, which
was directed by Congress in 1998 to verify high-tech job needs. The
foundation is expected to complete its work by October.
</P>
<P>
   The study may at last add facts to a debate that has been argued
with largely anecdotal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of visas point to news stories about some foreign
workers who say they were lured to this country with promises of
good pay, only to earn a paltry $500 a month. But reliable research
has not determined exactly how often pay abuses occur.
</P>
<P>
   Visa opponents also say many older workers want high-tech jobs,
but young executives at high-tech companies won't offer them
training. Are there really enough older tech workers to supply
fast-growing companies with the labor they need? That question has
never been answered conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, visa opponents insist the job market is changing enough
to relieve labor shortages without more foreign help. O'Neill, of
the electrical engineers group, admits hiring has been difficult
for some companies in the past year, but attributes much of the
employment surge to the effort to repair Y2K computer bugs. Now
that those problems have been fixed, computer-related job openings
are declining and ``salaries are leveling off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Hatch-sponsored legislation, Dan Stein, a
lobbyist for the anti-immigration movement, says: ``There isn't a
single study that shows that kind of bill is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Tech employers vigorously disagree. They note that the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' employment projections through 2008 show the No.
1 industry for job growth will be computer and data processing
services, which will need 3.47 million workers in 2008, compared to
1.6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000 and 2001, the Labor Department says the five
fastest-growing occupations are computer engineers; computer
support specialists, systems analysts, database administrators and
desktop publishing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Department of Education reports that college
degrees granted in engineering are declining, while computer
science degrees are down sharply from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Stohler, a spokesman for the American Electronics
Association, a Washington-based trade group representing high-tech
companies, says U.S. colleges can't possibly produce enough
engineers to fill the labor market in coming years because very few
students are taking the math courses needed to get those degrees.
``The pipeline from K through 12 is not looking good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But given that the National Science Foundation's study on the
job market won't be completed for months, Smith and Goodlatte say
the most appropriate thing for Congress to do now is boost the visa
cap only for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the expansion is of a temporary
nature, so that our long-term goal is to make sure these
opportunities exist for American citizens,'' Goodlatte said.

ISRAELI CABINET OFFICIAL INVOLVED IN SEX HARASSMENT CASE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the latest of a series of scandals involving top
Israeli officials, Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
announced on Tuesday that he was taking a leave of absence after
police began investigating a complaint that he had sexually
assaulted a woman who works in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, 55, a member of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security
cabinet and the leader of the Center Party, emphatically denied the
woman's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened,'' he said in remarks broadcast live on
radio and television. ``I say it wholeheartedly: it never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a former defense minister and candidate for prime
minister, said that the acts attributed to him ``contradict my
moral universe, my personal values, everything I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have decided to take a leave of absence so that
the police can carry out a quiet and effective investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint to the police, the woman, whose name was not
disclosed, said that Mordechai had assaulted her in his Tel Aviv
office on February 25. Television reports said that in a detailed
account supported by a lie-detector test, the 23-year-old woman
accused Mordechai of touching her and forcing her down on a couch
before backing off when she burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said that the complaint received on Monday
was of ``an indecent act and sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation emerged a day before International Women's Day,
which was marked on Tuesday in a special session of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the legislators, Barak urged women ``not to be afraid
to complain and to report any harm to them, regardless of who the
assailant is.'' He added that ``there must be no leniency
whatsoever'' toward such assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later to reporters, Barak said that he respected
Mordechai's decision to take a leave of absence and expected it to
clear the way for a speedy investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a former army general, has been through public trials
before. In 1984, the Shin Bet security service tried to frame him
for the killing of two Palestinian bus hijackers who had been
beaten to death by its agents.
</P>
<P>
   On television on Tuesday night, Mordechai said that he and his
family were going through ``difficult days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person wakes up in the morning and finds his reality turned
upside down,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigation of Mordechai is the latest of a series of
high-level scandals that have emerged here in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Barak's election campaign are under investigation
for suspected illegal fund-raising activities. President Ezer
Weizman is being investigated for receiving large and undisclosed
sums of money from a French-born businessman. And former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been questioned by police on
suspicion of failing to return gifts he had received while in
office.

 &HT;    CONGRESS LIKELY TO GIVE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY MORE FOREIGN WORKERS
 &HT;    800&AMP;adds. With TECH-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a labor drought this summer, technology
executives are asking Congress for relief this spring.
</P>
<P>
   They claim their businesses can grow only if sprinkled with
talent drawn from deep pools of labor found in India, China and
elsewhere. Congress must increase the ceiling on visas for
foreigners with high-tech skills to keep U.S. companies from
shriveling, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the effort believe today's worker shortages
will actually strengthen the economy in the long run. They argue
that if companies can't get a quick fix from overseas, they will
retrain older U.S. workers and work more closely with schools to
produce better students.
</P>
<P>
   With elections coming up, most members of Congress are eager to
please wealthy technology executives. And no lawmaker wants to be
accused of slowing the engine that has been driving the U.S.
economy's longest expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these lawmakers fear a backlash from workers
concerned about competition from low-wage foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there is a national labor shortage of such
dimensions that we need more visas,'' said Vin O'Neill, a lobbyist
for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a
professional association based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The visas, known as H-1B visas, allow highly skilled workers
such as engineers and computer programmers to come into the United
States for three years. Usually, a visa can be renewed once for an
additional three-year stay. Often, temporary workers use the visas
as a step toward gaining permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   This debate over foreign workers may sound familiar. Just two
years ago, spurred on primarily by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
Congress raised the annual limit on high-tech visas from 65,000 to
115,000 for both fiscal 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But under current law, the limit will fall to 107,500 when
fiscal 2001 begins Oct. 1, and the following year, the cap will
return to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, which have been hiring frantically in the
past year, will hit this year's limit even before spring is over.
Unless the law is changed, they will have to cool their heels until
new visas become available Oct. 1 and will face even a greater
squeeze under next year's smaller visa cap. Some executives even
suggest U.S. businesses will have to move operations overseas to
find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group,
says nearly 269,000 high-tech jobs are going unfilled already,
costing U.S. businesses $4.5 billion in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   To help companies, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., introduced a bill last month to increase H-1B
visas to 195,000 for this year, and to stay at that level through
fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislation also would exempt from the cap foreigners who
work for U.S. colleges and universities or research institutions,
as well as foreigners who received a master's degree or doctorate
from a U.S. college within six months of their employment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would retain a provision of the 1998 bill requiring a
$500-per-visa fee to go toward scholarships and worker training
programs in this country.
</P>
<P>

lawmakers will move his bill quickly. ``I don't think we're going

<P>
   The millennial fireworks are long since over, but this spring
and summer art in Europe sparkles on.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a year for the sort of festival _ the Venice
Biennale, Documenta _ that turns the international art community
into one big traveling chat room for a week or two. (The biennial
in Lyon provides the requisite expense-account item this summer.)
Yet a cultural gala of major proportions is already under way: the
Roman Catholic Jubilee year that is transforming the Eternal City
into a vast museum-without-walls. Go, see, and be overwhelmed by
sights and crowds alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Institutional expansions and overhauls are also important
attractions in the months ahead. The Pompidou Center in Paris is up
and running again after a renovation. And late spring and early
summer in London are likely to feel like one long ribbon-cutting
ceremony. The fast-paced schedule is as follows.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the high-profile events of the season will be the opening
on May 12 in Southwark of the new Tate Modern, devoted to
international art of the 20th century. The museum will be housed in
a revamped power station, a massive central-chimney building
designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also designed Britain's
signal contribution to the communications age, the nearly extinct
red telephone booth. As for the existing Tate, it reopens as the
Tate Britain on May 24, with British art from the 16th century to
the present. The Wallace Gallery introduces new galleries on June
22, and the venerable Dulwich Picture Gallery opens new buildings
on June 25. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these museums will do something a little special to
celebrate the occasions. The Tate Britain has organized ``Ruskin,
Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites'' (through May 28), which marks the
centenary of the death of the aesthetician John Ruskin (1819-1900).
Hugely influential, he was the first British artist-critic to give
his contemporaries a big promotional push, and in this survey of
his polymath output he will be surrounded by grateful peers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year of Ruskin's demise provides the title for an ambitious
exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads'' (through April 3). It focuses on a threshold moment
when Winslow Homer was an eminence grise and Pablo Picasso a Young
Turk. All kinds of artists long forgotten (until now, anyway) are
folded in here, and they will all travel to the Guggenheim in New
York in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria and Albert picks up the turn-of-the-century thread
in ``Art Nouveau 1890-1914'' (April 6 to July 30), which will
examine a period style through the lens of fine and applied arts.
Any show that counts Antoni Gaudi, Emile Galle and Aubrey Beardsley
among its participants is an extravaganza by definition. This one
is sure to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To all the above add ``The House Beautiful: Oscar Wilde and the
Aesthetic Interior'' at the little known Geffrye Museum (July 18 to
Jan. 21, 2001). Wilde, who died in 1900, considered himself the
founder of the Ruskin-inspired Aesthetic Movement, which he
envisioned as a revolutionary break from the stifling middle-class
tastes of the day. He would be amused to learn that a century later
``middle brow'' is enjoying a high-brow art world vogue.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given Ruskin's enthusiasm for up-to-date art, it makes sense
that his Tate Britain survey will be followed by ``New British Art
2000'' (July 6 to Sept. 24), the first in a new series of triennial
temperature-taking exhibitions designed to find out what's hot
(meaning what's cool) in art. This year's version, with 20 artists,
will be the largest showcase of contemporary work ever held at the
museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Gallery is trying to spiff up its patinated
image with ``Encounters: New Art From Old'' (June 14 to Sept. 17).
Two dozen ``contemporary masters'' have been invited to respond to
a piece from the collection with work of their own. Truth to tell,
most of the matches sound snoozy, but sparks may fly in a few of
the face-offs: Lucien Freud's with Chardin, say, or Louise
Bourgeois' with J.M.W. Turner.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, it's ``1900'' all over again. That's the title of a
show at the Grand Palais (March 17 to June 26) that rustles up 400
works made between 1895 and 1905 to address such slippery issues as
national movements versus pan-European styles, and the
post-Romantic relationship of man to nature. As at the Royal
Academy, there will be familiar delights and things that no one has
taken a squint at in years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paris is also honoring the 100th birthday of the photographer
Brassai with two exhibitions. The larger one is the retrospective
at the Pompidou (April 19 to June 26), which ranges from his famous
``Paris de Nuit'' series to his covers for Harper's Bazaar. The
other is at the Picasso Museum and considers collaborations between
two modern art colossi (Feb. 2 to May 1). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Picasso's homeland of Spain, many roads lead to the
Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. Thanks to Frank Gehry's architecture, the
museum doesn't need a stitch of art to be a tourist magnet, but it
has exhibitions anyway. Through May 7, one can catch the last stop
of a traveling retrospective of work by David Salle, organized by
the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Salle is paired with another
artist closely identified with the 1980s, Francesco Clemente, in
the retrospective that recently closed in New York (through June
4).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are followed by ``Amazons of the Avant-Garde: Alexandra
Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara
Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova,'' a showcase of wonderfully
inventive women who were crucial, though undervalued, players in
early Russian modernism. The show will come to New York in
September. Early birds can catch it at the Peggy Guggenheim
Collection in Venice until May 28. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any excuse to stay a spell in Venice is the right excuse. But
Rome is where the action is this summer, even for non-Jubilee
activity. There will be a Goya show at the Palazzo Barberini from
March 18 to June 18. And two historical exhibitions that focus on
the city itself sound especially appealing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idea of Beautiful: A Visit to Rome in the 17th Century
With Giovanni Pietro Bellori,'' at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni
(March 29 to June 26), is centered on the figure of the Italian art
critic and historian who formulated the cult of Classical antiquity
in the Baroque period. A staggering array of 800 works, from
paintings by Annibale Carracci and Nicolas Poussin to antique
sculptures, will give a sense of his sources and influences. It
will be complemented by a concurrent show, ``Rome-Paris, 1640:
Classical Ideal and Baroque Epic in the Time of Poussin,'' at the
Villa Medici.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the merging of aesthetic and spiritual ideals is the
very essence of art from Asia, and no exhibition this season will
demonstrate that dynamic more exquisitely than ``Korea: The Old
Kingdom,'' covering the history of Korean art from the bronze age
into the 20th century, which ends its European tour at the Rietberg
Museum in Zurich (March 19 to July 9). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It boasts first-rank treasures from the National Museum in
Seoul, including ink paintings, Buddhist icons and celadon bowls.
And when light flickers across the surface of a centuries-old
ceremonial crown of openwork gold encrusted with jade, fireworks
are in the air again.

BARAK AND ARAFAT ARE REPORTED TO BE MEETING ON PEACE EFFORT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak was to meet on Tuesday
with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in an attempt to
restart formal peace negotiations after a break of more than one
month, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting place and time were kept secret. The last time the
two leaders met was on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's special envoy to the Middle East, Dennis B.
Ross, also was supposed to attend the meeting, the officials said.
Ross arrived for a two-day visit in Israel and the Palestinian
territories Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio reported before the meeting that Barak was prepared
to offer the Palestinians a number of inducements to reestablish an
atmosphere of trust _ or at least hope _ in the fitful
negotiations. Among them, the radio report said, were the release
of Palestinian prisoners and the payment of taxes owed by Israel to
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on formalizing a framework for a final treaty broke
down last month. Palestinian officials have complained that Barak
has not adhered to earlier agreements that call for the
step-by-step transfer of pieces of West Bank land to Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides disagree over which parts of the West Bank should
be placed under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, Arafat addressed his Palestinian parliament
and repeated his vow to declare an independent state by the end of
the year, even if the final status of relations between Israel and
the Palestinians remains unresolved.

A ROBUST RABBIT WITH TOUCHES OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the second of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef of Lespinasse in Manhattan. They are being written
with Melissa Clark.)  
 (Dining)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In France, one of the most traditional ways to serve
rabbit is hunter's style, a robust stew made with mushrooms, onions
and herbs _ the sorts of foods a hunter might come upon on his way
home through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hearty dish that was popular when I was growing up; my
mother and grandmother often made it, and I still do. But at the
restaurant I treat this rustic dish with an elegant touch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stewing pieces of the meat in a sauce, I roast the
rabbit quickly at a high temperature so the skin becomes crisp and
brown while the meat remains succulent. My sauce is enriched by the
rabbit trimmings, tomato, garlic, carrot, and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   And I serve it on a particularly creamy polenta made with milk
and Parmesan. It's as rich and soft as a buttery potato puree, an
extravagant partner for the lean rabbit meat. Polenta is, of
course, not so typical in France; mashed potatoes or rice would be
served instead, and you could do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather begins to warm, I look forward to bringing
touches of spring to the plate with vegetables like blanched
asparagus tips sauteed in butter until the ends crisp, and morels,
gently stewed with olive oil and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all those embellishments, at heart this is still a
simple dish. Its success depends on having a fresh, young rabbit;
frozen ones tend to toughen during cooking. And because the meat is
extremely lean, it's important not to overcook.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbit can even be taken off the heat a little early, when
it's still slightly pink near the bone. Then it can finish cooking
as it rests under a sheet of foil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED RABBIT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours, plus 1 hour's simmering &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 rabbits, hind legs and forelegs separated from loins, hind
legs cut in two at joints, trimmings reserved
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 white button mushrooms, quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, sliced
</P>
<P>
   12 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   } cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tomatoes, cubed
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch tarragon
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch thyme
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, sliced &QL; 
For the polenta:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup quick-cooking polenta
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   { cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large, deep skillet over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon
oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Add rabbit forelegs, trimmings (except
liver) and salt to taste. Cook over high heat, stirring, until
golden brown on all sides. Add mushrooms, onion, carrots, 4 cloves
garlic and tomato paste, and cook, stirring, until vegetables are
tender, about 10 minutes. Add { cup wine and simmer until it
evaporates. Add tomatoes, { bunch tarragon and { bunch thyme and
water to just cover. Simmer until reduced by half, about 1 hour.
Strain, pressing on solids. Discard solids.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place loins on a work surface with cavities facing up. Lay
remaining thyme and tarragon and remaining garlic on centers of
each of loin. Roll up loins so that filling is enclosed and tie
with kitchen twine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large, oven-proof skillet
over high heat, heat remaining oil and butter. Add loins and hind
legs and sear until golden brown, adding salt to taste. Place
skillet in oven and roast 5 minutes. Turn rabbit pieces, reduce
temperature to 425, and roast until meat is slightly pink at bone,
15 to 20 minutes. Transfer rabbit to a platter (reserving skillet
and its drippings) and cover with foil to keep warm. Let rabbit
rest 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. To finish sauce, place skillet with drippings over medium
heat. Add shallots and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add
remaining wine and cook until it evaporates. Add sauce and simmer
10 minutes. Strain sauce, pressing hard on shallots.
</P>
<P>
   5. While sauce simmers, prepare polenta. In a medium saucepan,
simmer milk. Add polenta and salt, whisking well, until polenta
absorbs milk but is still soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cheese and
butter. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cut twine off loins and remove garlic and herbs. Carve loin
meat off bones. Arrange loin and leg meat over polenta. Pour sauce
around meat and serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

 &HT;    TEACHER TESTS DON'T MEASURE COMPETENCE, PANEL SAYS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Today's teacher-licensing tests don't predict
whether a teacher will do well in the classroom, the prestigious
National Research Council reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tests ``are not designed to predict who will become
effective teachers,'' concluded a panel of academic experts headed
by chemical physicist David Z. Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The educators and researchers on the panel were chosen by the
council, which is administered by the national academies of
science, engineering and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The number of states that test people seeking licenses to teach
in public schools rose from three in 1977 to 44 in 1987, and has
remained steady at 41 in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law designed to shame bad teacher colleges into doing
a better job will go into effect next year. Passed unanimously by
Congress in 1998, it will require states and colleges to report how
many of their education students pass their own state's
teacher-licensing tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's findings raise doubts about the law's
usefulness:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is ``little evidence'' that the cut-off scores between
those who pass and those who fail such tests distinguish fairly
between those who are ``minimally competent to teach'' and those
who are not. In fact, most states cope with teacher shortages by
waiving the tests or lowering the passing scores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comparisons of passing rates among states ``are not useful for
policy purposes because of the diversity of testing and licensure
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Because teacher colleges differ in aims and student bodies,
differences in the passing rates of their graduates are ``difficult
to interpret as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tests find out whether someone is literate, can do simple
math, knows a particular subject or knows about ways to teach that
subject, said Robinson. But they don't show which practitioners
``will be successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly surprising, commented Penelope Earley, chief
lobbyist at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher
Education, which includes 735 public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, does the lawyer who had the highest score on a
state bar exam automatically become the state's best litigator?''
she said. ``Tests measure what an individual knows, not how an
individual applies the knowledge in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the panel's findings support schools of education that
oppose being judged solely by how many of their graduates can pass
state exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have the National Research Council _ a group
that might be perceived by those in the policy world as being more
neutral than we are _ saying that,'' Earley said.
</P>
<P>
   The council said that its full report would be posted on the
Internet shortly after 5 p.m. EST Tuesday at
http://national-academies.org.

A FLIER'S GUIDE TO COMPLAINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., March 12) 
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Complaints to the Department of Transportation about air travel
doubled from 1998 to 1999, rising to 20,495 from 9,608. The major
factor in the rise was the opening of electronic portals, including
those run by private companies that pursue passenger complaints.
Instead of having to write, copy an address and find a stamp,
disaffected consumers can send their grievances by clicking a
mouse.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norman A. Strickman, assistant director for aviation consumer
protection in the Department of Transportation, said that
one-quarter of the complaints to his department were now arriving
electronically, either directly to the department's e-mail address,
airconsumer(at)ost.dot .gov, or through links provided by private
Web companies. Whatever level the numbers reach, the department
says, the content is steady, with flight delays and cancellations
ranking at the top, followed by service issues and luggage
problems.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., co-sponsor of the passenger-rights
legislation that was set aside in the face of airline pledges of
new policies, said in an interview that passengers ``have had a
bellyful.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are treated like cargo,'' he said. ``They have heard how
the industry was going to adopt voluntary programs, and they find
it is business as usual.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation does not adjudicate or mediate
the individual complaints it receives, although it can fine an
airline when it finds violations of the few remaining regulations:
deceptive advertising on fares, for example, or failure to
compensate travelers whose flights are overbooked and who are not
taken to their destinations within a specified time. The complaints
that come into the department are watched for patterns that might
lead to penalties, but verified civil rights violations tend to
bring immediate action against an airline.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right now, as a result of Wyden's amendments to a Department of
Transportation bill, the inspector general in the department is
monitoring the flow of complaints in two areas: finding the lowest
fare and overbooking.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress has asked for a report by the end of this year on the
impact of consumer-satisfaction programs established by the big
U.S. airlines on Dec. 15. There will be an interim report in June,
according to Scott Macey, the inspector general's project director
for the review of the airlines' customer-service commitments.
Complaints to the department are one yardstick for whether
travelers consider they are being badly informed, maltreated or
cheated. Government auditors have visited the airlines'
headquarters to learn how they do business, Macey said, and will
also visit major airports to see for themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation's electronic mail basket had
been in service almost 22 months when the airlines presented their
consumer programs; it was set up late in February 1998. Of the
9,608 complaints and inquiries it got that year, just 626 arrived
by e-mail, the rest on paper or by telephone. In 1999, 5,650 of the
20,495 complaints came by e-mail. And almost half of these were
relayed by a site called passengerrights.com, a no-fee enterprise
set up by a travel agency in Florida. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several Web sites harvesting complaints. At least
two new Web entrepreneurs will process consumer complaints for a
fee and seek compensation for their clients. There is usually no
reason travelers should not do this themselves, saving a $19.95 or
$25 fee. But if the choleric complaints sent as copies to this
department are any indication, the discipline of filling in blanks
and confining an account to one page is in short supply; a concise
account by a professional probably speeds the problem to the
cashier's window.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief tour of the electronic grievance gallery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengerrights.com is an offshoot of Global Travel
International, a travel agency with its telephone center in
Maitland, Fla. The costs of the Web site, according to Randall J.
Warren, who owns the agency with Michael A. Gross, are sustained by
subscriptions to the travel agency's monthly newsletter, Travel
Confidential, which costs $59 a year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Complaints are forwarded to the airline involved, Warren said,
and to the Department of Transportation. ``We find out a lot from
the complaints,'' he said. ``For instance, a traveler told us she
learned after buying a ticket that Southwest Airlines does not take
pets, in the cabin or as cargo. So if a pet-owner wants to travel,
she needs to make other plans.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most complaints received through the Web site have to do with
misinformation. ``The gate people don't know anything,'' Warren
said. ``Passengers are told a ticket is not refundable, and it
is.'' The newsletter can be reached by writing to Post Office Box
940103, Maitland, Fla. 32794; (888) 802-8878; its separate Web site
is www.travelconfidential .com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1travel.com is another travel agency with complaint channels on
its Web site. These are an adjunct to its consumer-affairs
material, prepared by Terry Trippler, a travel writer and
publisher. The ``rules of the road'' link on the home page at
1travel.com leads to addresses of airlines' complaint offices and
to a hyperlink at the Department of Transportation. The site gives
advice on writing a complaint letter and emphasizes the importance
of sending a compliment when something goes right.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travelproblems.com and complain.com are new enterprises that
will handle complaints for a fee. These organization do not handle
complaints that seem trivial; their work is based on the assumption
that the problem is serious enough to merit recompense from the
company _ cash, a voucher or frequent-flier miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travelproblems.com was begun Nov. 17 by David Jarashow, a lawyer
in West Orange, N.J.. He charges $25 to process a complaint that
may yield up to $200; beyond that the fee is $50 plus a 20 percent
commission. When a traveler gets a response in frequent-flier
miles, Jarashow values them at $25 for a thousand miles _ ``what
the airline charges if it sells them,'' and sets his fee
accordingly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jarashow said that so far he had handled 80 complaints, with
about half resulting in a settlement for the consumer, and that he
had decided against pursuing many cases, some because they were
frivolous.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jarashow's experience is in mediation and arbitration and he has
also worked for an insurance company. The major complaint category
he encounters is canceled flights, ``long delays, with employee
rudeness.'' Runway confinements are the next category.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He cites two cases. James Daly of Bensalem, Pa., returning from
London through Kennedy Airport last November, reported that the New
York-Philadelphia flight was canceled by American Airlines and he
ended up being bused to Philadelphia, a trip that took three hours.
American Airlines provided a $200 voucher in response to his
complaint. On the other hand, a Texas woman who ordered a ticket on
priceline.com was booked to Denver instead of Aspen last July.
After Jarashow took up her case, she was told that a credit would
be put through in two billing cycles. Three cycles later, it had
not yet been put through. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Complain.com is based in Mountain View, Calif., and charges
$19.95 to handle a complaint, regardless of the outcome. The
company takes complaints only after a traveler's first effort has
failed, according to Steven Ericsson-Zenith, the founder. It gets
payment by credit card before the complaint is acted on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since it started in June 1999, the company has handled about 100
complaints. Priscilla Harriman, who learns the details and packs
them into a one-page complaint, said that about half had produced
results. But since the responses go directly to the consumers, she
does not always know the outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most complaints are directed to airlines, Harriman said, but
hotels and car companies are also high on the list. Complain.com
handles any complaints involving a product or service. ``We do not
get into legal questions,'' she said. ``We are quite experimental.
A lot of companies are springing onto the Web.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau of New York has gone on the Web, too,
at www.newyork.bbb.org. There is no charge for using this. Jennifer
Dikes, an information and investigation specialist, said that the
bureau relays complaints to the Department of Transportation when
it sees patterns _ particular companies, particular types of scams.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Department of Transportation, Macey said, there has been
an increase in complaints about airlines direct to the inspector
general's office. On Feb. 1, it set up an electronic in-basket for
complaints about two particular topics, pricing and overbooking,
called www.oig.dot.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The entry ``airline overbooking/air fares'' provides forms to
use. The airlines understand, Macey said, that these particular
complaints made direct to the inspector general in this period will
be followed up with the airline within 60 days. Forms are also
available by phone: (800) 884-9190. Complaints can be mailed to
Department of Transportation, Office of the Inspector General,
JA-2, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, D.C. 20590.

   CLINTON-PAKISTAN (Washington) _ President Clinton will stop in
Pakistan on his trip to South Asia this month, the White House said
Tuesday in a terse statement that gave no hint of the decision's
difficulty. The White House said details of the visit are still
being worked out with Pakistan's government, which is run by the
military leaders who seized power in a coup last fall. By Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-MEDIA (Johannesburg) _ The South African Human Rights
Commission holds a hearing on racism in the media; some see this as
part of a government effort to pressure the press into more
favorable coverage. By Rachel Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-UNREST (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Dozens of people were
injured in shootings and grenade attacks in the divided town of
Mitrovica on Tuesday, among them up to 20 French peacekeepers and
both ethnic Albanian and Serb civilians. What began as a street
brawl escalated rapidly into a number of retaliatory attacks
between ethnic Serbs and Albanians, catching the peacekeepers in
the middle. The violence comes on the back of a whole month of
serious disturbances, which have caused at least nine deaths in the
town, and dashed hopes of the international community that the
worst was over. By Carlotta Gall.

   MARKET (New York) _ Blue-chips extended their slide as worries
about the earnings outlook for consumer companies pushed market
indicators down. Shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble, the culprit in the
earnings fears, declined 28 1/8, to 59 5/16, and the selloff
extended to blue-chip issues in related areas. The Dow industrials
closed off 347 points. By Gretchen Morgenson.

<P>
   DEUTSCHE-DRESDNER (Frankfurt, Germany) _ In the most radical
example yet of corporate restructuring in Europe, Deutsche Bank of
Germany plans to acquire Dresdner Bank in a deal worth more than
$30 billion. Deutsche Bank, already the world's biggest bank, would
become a powerhouse with more than $1.2 trillion in assets, twice
the volume of Citigroup. By Edmund L. Andrews.

 THERE's A LITTLE SPOT I KNOW IN PARIS ...  
 (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One of the best wine lists in Paris is at a little place
up an alley near the Bastille. Not a blind alley, because it has
entrances at both ends, but what's called a passage. Specifically,
the Passage de la Bonne-Graine, and the place with the great wine
list is called _ inevitably, perhaps _ Le Passage.
</P>
<P>
   About to celebrate its 10th anniversary next month, Le Passage
was for most of its early years a secret among Paris wine lovers.
Never advertised, and hidden behind two of the busiest streets in
the east end of the city, the Rue du Faubourg St.-Antoine and the
Avenue Ledru-Rollin, it could never attract walk-in business. There
are locals and visitors who report looking for it in vain.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just the way Soizik de Lorgeril, the owner, likes it
(Soizik is a Breton name). With no previous restaurant experience,
she opened the tiny wine-oriented restaurant because she was tired
of the public relations business.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, with the new Opera de la Bastille under
construction, the area was beginning to change. Clubs, restaurants
and galleries began to move into empty storefronts and
long-abandoned lofts and ateliers. She and her husband, Gerard
Pantanacce, a decorator, lived in the neighborhood and were caught
up in the creative ferment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our friends were urging us to do something different, and
this is what we chose,'' she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Pantanacce kept his day job, doing apartments and lofts for the
writers, media and advertising people who are making the area the
SoHo and the TriBeCa of Paris. Four years ago, with Le Passage
doing well, he abandoned his swatches and sketches and opened a
little restaurant and nightclub around the corner from Le Passage,
called Le Cafe du Passage. It has a smaller menu, lots of wine by
the glass, an exceptional list of single malt whiskies and a lively
retail wine business.
</P>
<P>
   Le Passage has a longer wine list, but in fact the two are
interchangeable. At Le Passage, many of the wines are listed on two
big blackboards _ the place is too small for any more _ and in a
formidable printed list enhanced with articles on some of the
restaurant's favorite producers. The current list features a long
article, in English, about Alain Graillot, a relatively new
winemaker in Crozes-Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the wine expert,'' Ms. de Lorgeril said of her husband.
``I run the restaurant.'' Perhaps, but she is more than ready to
discuss the differences between, say, a Cote-Rotie from Pierre
Gaillard and one from Jean-Michel Gerin. Or to explain how Auguste
Clape makes his Cornas and how Robert Michel makes his.
</P>
<P>
   Pantanacce, when he isn't conducting Saturday morning tastings
at the cafe, may be giving a wine lecture in Denmark or visiting
winemakers in the Loire or Burgundy or in the Rhone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   When I stopped in to the cafe the other afternoon, Pantanacce
was getting ready for the 5 o'clock opening. Spread before him on a
table was a group of large, striking photo portraits of some of his
friends in the Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down there last month for the annual fair of producers
in the Cote-Rotie area,'' he said, ``and I hired a photographer
with an old-fashioned portrait camera to get these pictures.''
Among the subjects were Graillot, Gerin, Gaillard, Francois Villard
and the brothers Jean-Luc and Jean-Paul Jamet. Soon the cafe's back
room will be a gallery of winemaker portraits. Pantanacce has not
completely abandoned his decorating skills.
</P>
<P>
   While Rhone wines predominate at both Le Passage and the cafe,
there is no lack of alternatives. The Burgundy list includes
Jayer-Gilles, Armand Rousseau, Denis Mortet, Comtes Lafon and Louis
Jadot. The Bordeaux list is short but distinguished, and there are
wines from every important area in France. Italy, Spain, South
Africa, Austria and Portugal are also represented.
</P>
<P>
   Should you find yourself in Paris this Saturday with nothing to
do, Patanacce will be staging a tasting of wines from California,
Italy, the Loire Valley and Beaujolais. On March 18, he will be
focusing on Jadot Burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   Le Passage is at 18 Passage de la Bonne-Graine. Le Cafe du
Passage is at 12 Rue de Charonne, both in the 11th arrondissement,
both a short walk from the Place de la Bastille.
</P>
<P>
   Even if wine were not the principal attraction at Le Passage, de
Lorgeril's food would be worth noting. She specializes in, of all
things, andouillette. For the uninitiated, andouillette is a
pungent sausage made mostly from pig's intestine. Central though it
may be to traditional French bistro cooking, andouillette is, as
they say, an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   Le Passage is probably unique in the world in featuring eight
kinds of andouillette, each from a different part of France. My
favorite comes from a M. Hardouin in Vouvray, a little more intense
in flavor than some of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Served grilled with a bit of mustard and a gratin dauphinois, it
is, well, perhaps not quite fit for a king, but delicious _ once or
twice a year. With what wine? Andouillette needs a strong wine to
tame it. I'd try any one of Le Passage's Cote-Roties, perhaps the
1995 from Mathilde and Yves Gangloff. Le Passage's better wines are
not inexpensive: this is about $80.
</P>
<P>
   For clients on a budget, de Lorgeril offers a delightful young
red from Auguste Clape for about $18. It's called Le Pas Sage,
which means, loosely, the smart move. Little French joke there.

HELPFUL ADVICE FOR THE LAY PHARMACIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the latest book on herbal remedies landed on my
desk, my first reaction was to put it in the giveaway pile with all
the rest of the home remedy books, especially after Page 1 brought
me face to face with cures like gin-soaked raisins for arthritis
and Archway coconut macaroons for diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw who wrote the book, ``The People's Pharmacy Guide
to Home and Herbal Remedies'' (St. Martin's $27.95), I decided to
put aside skepticism. The authors, Joe Graedon, a pharmacologist,
and Teresa Graedon, a medical anthropologist, have been writing
sound and sensible books about drugs for nonscientists for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest, the couple lay out not only the pluses but also
the minuses of self-medication in language that is easy to
understand. If you want a single source of good information without
the usual hype, this is the book to choose.
</P>
<P>
   As a skeptic of most of the claims made for herbs and dietary
supplements, I had a hard time getting past the peripheral advice:
garlic to get rid of fleas, cider vinegar to cure headaches and
cherries to relieve gout.
</P>
<P>
   The Graedons do not say these home remedies necessarily work,
certainly not for everyone, but they do say the remedies are
harmless, so why not give them a try.
</P>
<P>
   But once I moved on to the scientific information, I was more
impressed. Readers should resist the temptation to jump to their
favorite ailment before reading Pages 7 through 22, which offer
valuable precautions. The book ``is not intended as a substitute
for the medical advice of a physician,'' write the authors, who
also warn that ``home remedies are generally untested'' and that
``any symptom that persists or gets worse should be attended to by
a physician.''
</P>
<P>
   As for interactions between herbal remedies and prescription
drugs, the Graedons advise: ``Please recognize that not all
interactions have been discovered or reported in the literature,''
and ``long-term side effects and interactions, in particular, have
not been well explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Graedons' book was being released, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a warning that St. John's wort causes
``significant drug interaction'' with the prescription drug
indinavir, used to treat HIV infection. And it was only last week
that a conference sponsored in part by the National Institutes of
Health called for regulation of medicinal herbs, though some
speakers noted it might be too late. Americans spend an estimated
$4 billion a year on herbal supplements, and the Graedons note that
the industry is ``virtually immune from regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these caveats, the authors think that ``used sensibly,
herbs and home remedies can be of great help in self-care'' and
that they ``appear amazingly benign when compared with prescription
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into two parts: an alphabetical list of
common ailments from asthma to warts, and a guide to herbal
therapies from aloe to valerian.
</P>
<P>
   A typical segment in the first section comes under the heading
for insomnia. It discusses the impact of caffeine, exercise,
relaxation, snacking and television, as well as the use of herbs
like chamomile, valerian, hops, kava-kava and lavender. It also
describes melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone that is crucial
for setting the body's sleep cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Graedons have some cautions about its use. That said, they
fail to discuss the safety of using a hormone _ any hormone _ on a
regular basis without medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The section on asthma notes that the condition is so serious
that ``we do not believe its treatment is a do-it-yourself
project.'' But, the authors write, adding vitamin C to the diet of
someone under the care of a physician would not be risky, and some
evidence suggests that vitamin C can be beneficial to lung
function.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Graedons recommend against the Chinese herb
ephedra, or ma huang, as a primary treatment for asthma, although
many herbal reference books suggest it. They point out that its
effects are short-lived and that it has a number of very serious
side effects ranging from irregular heartbeat to death.
</P>
<P>
   The second section of the book, which deals with herbal
therapies, provides all the information about each herb in one
place, including active ingredients, dose, special precautions,
adverse effects and possible interactions. Under chamomile, for
instance, readers will learn that it is used to treat digestive
distress (see Peter Rabbit and chamomile tea) and as a mild sleep
aid; that people who are allergic to ragweed and chrysanthemums
probably shouldn't use it; and that ingesting a large amount of its
dried flowers may cause vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   As for gin-soaked raisins and Archway cookies, the Graedons
don't pretend to know why some people find them useful, which is
reason enough to recommend ``The People's Pharmacy Guide to Home
and Herbal Remedies'' as the most sensible book of its kind. &QL;

EXPLORING ENTRY-LEVEL PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)

 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only two things stand in the way of regularly
enjoying the glories of vintage port: time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Time, because if you buy a vintage widely available now, like
1994 or 1997, the bottle will usually need a lot more aging, maybe
as much as 15 years from the vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Money, because if you can find an older bottle that's ready to
drink, say a 1977 or a 1983, it could cost $100 or more. Not a bad
value, perhaps, compared with a fine aged Bordeaux, but still not
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an excellent alternative to vintage port: aged
tawny port, which not only can be wonderful in its own right, but
is less expensive than vintage and is finished aging by the time
you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage port is made only every few years, when makers consider
a single harvest to be exceptional. After a couple of years in
barrels, it is bottled and ready for years of aging. Tawnies are
blends of wines from years that were not declared vintages. They do
their aging in barrels or vats so that when they are finally
bottled they are ready for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse aged tawny, which is 10, 20, 30 and sometimes 40
years old (and labeled as such), with simple tawny, a wine that
achieves its tawny color not from aging, but by the mixing of pale
and dark wines.
</P>
<P>
   A well-aged tawny can be complex and delicious, offering
balanced sweet and spicy flavors from caramel and chocolate to
cinnamon, cloves, figs and mint. For my list, I concentrated on
10-year-olds, which, at $20 to $30 a bottle, are the entry-level
aged tawnies, but I also added a couple of 20-year-olds for
comparison's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Even tasted blind, the older tawnies easily stood out as
smoother and rounder with a wider spectrum of flavors. The younger
ones were sweeter and more concentrated but less wily, giving you
everything they have immediately instead of allowing flavors to
unfold over time.
</P>
<P>
   The six tawnies in the accompanying table are listed in order of
preference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR FLADGATE 20-YEAR-OLD $50 &QL;

   Pale reddish brown with chocolate and cinnamon flavors. &QL;

<P>
   If someone out there stole about 4,200 Oscar ballots in hopes of
stuffing the ballot box and creating a surprise outcome at the
March 26 ceremony, the motion picture academy says forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and
its accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, were preparing to mail
new ballots to its California members to replace the batch
apparently lost by or stolen from the Beverly Hills post office
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The original ballots were delivered by PricewaterhouseCoopers on
March 1 during one of several pre-Oscar photo opportunities.
Academy spokesman John Pavlik said their disappearance came to
light Saturday during the Scientific and Technical Awards event
when some members asked why they hadn't received them. (Ballots to
out-of-state and foreign addresses were mailed a week earlier with
no problem.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, Pavlik has been checking with various California
academy voters, and none had received a ballot. Meanwhile, postal
employees have been searching as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what happened either,'' Pavlik said. ``This
has gone all the way to Washington, as I understand it. Somebody
told me they have inspectors opening every bag of mail in the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the search continued Tuesday, the academy was pressing
forward with a new mailing that was to go out late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reprinting new envelopes with new numbers,'' Pavlik
said. He said the revised return envelopes will be yellow, while
the originals were white, making it easier for the accountants to
sort out any bad ballots that may come back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``PricewaterhouseCoopers keeps track of each ballot,'' he said.
``They know who they went to and who should be sending them back.
If somebody thought they could grab a handful of ballots and start
stuffing the box, it won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballots we get back will be actual ballots from voting
members, and we'll be back on track by tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the current schedule, voters have until March 21 to
return their ballots. He said it's possible the accounting firm
will extend the deadline by a day or two if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that we'll get together after this and see how
we can keep it from happening again,'' Pavlik said. ``If it turns
out that someone stole them, and we find out about it, yeah, we'll
prosecute them, you betcha.''
</P>
<P>
   However, unless there is evidence of theft or deliberate
destruction, he said, the academy will dismiss it as ``a simple
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the academy had a ballot mailing snafu was in 1982
with nomination mailers. When the post office found them, officials
there agreed to send them special delivery. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Give the people at NBC credit _ in their efforts to draw
audiences, they've pulled in some pretty heavy hitters this past
season. First, they hired the President of the United States to
star in their hit drama ``The West Wing.'' And now, they've
recruited both God and the devil to grace the new animated comedy
``God, the Devil and Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God et al.'' concerns Bob (voiced by French Stewart), a
Detroit Everyshlub who becomes the battleground for a bet between
God (James Garner, naturally) and the devil (Alan Cumming). If Bob
can go against his instincts and bring a modest good to the world,
God wins the wager; if not, the devil wins. More importantly,
mankind loses.
</P>
<P>
   The show, premiering Thursday before taking up residence on
Tuesday nights, was created by Matthew Carlson, a former seminary
student who more recently busied himself with the devil's work _ or
whatever you want to call the failed sitcom ``Men Behaving Badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming, who describes his character as a ``snarling brat,''
says of the show, ``I just couldn't believe it was getting made _
it walks a fine line between shocking and hilarious.'' He adds of
co-star Garner, ``He's so funny. His parking space at the studio
reads, `James Garner: God.' So if we do another season, I'm
demanding my parking space read, `Alan Cumming: devil.'''
</P>
<P>
   We secured the ultimate interviews _ with God and the devil _
through their earthly intermediaries, Cumming _ a Tony winner for
``Cabaret,'' who has also played oily types in ``Titus'' and the
remake of ``Annie,'' and stole Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut''
by flirting madly with Tom Cruise _ and Carlson, the series'
Creator's creator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What drew you to the project?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: I could tell you how much I wanted to try my hand at
comedy, but the truth is, I needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: I have so many friends already in television that it
seemed a logical progression to star in my own show. I think of
this as a fly-on-the-wall documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you consider your finest accomplishment and,
conversely, your biggest disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: My finest accomplishment is microwave popcorn. My biggest
disappointment would have to be Buckner missing that ground ball in
the `86 World Series. He asked for an easy grounder, I gave it to
him _ did he want me to catch it for him, too? Now you got me
started again ...
</P>
<P>
   The devil (discretely interrupting): I think my finest
accomplishment would be American television, and, in a funny way,
my biggest disappointment would be American television, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q (to the devil): Do you feel that you're the victim of bad
press? Does God just have better publicists?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: God's always got the higher moral ground, obviously,
because he invented it. I don't think God's got publicists. I have
a slew of publicists, I have many friends in that world.
</P>
<P>
   Q What can you point to as absolute proof that you exist?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: My mailbox. Hey, I'm getting the Pottery Barn catalog _ you
tell me.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: The success of the Backstreet Boys. McDonald's.
Pokemon. Things like that _ get `em while they're young.
</P>
<P>
   Q What's your favorite part of L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Well, L.A.'s my pride and glory, it's my finest work.
Geographically, it's an earthquake waiting to happen, and of
course, Hollywood was my idea _ and it's working very well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your idea of a perfect date?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: There's a scene in an upcoming episode where there
are nuns fighting, and I say, `Nuns kicking nun butt _ it doesn't
get any better than this.' So watching nuns fight would be a good
date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Turn-ons?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: In everyone, there's a little bit of a mirror that I
see myself in, so that's a turn-on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Turn-offs?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Marie Osmond. It switches off pretty quick there.
(Note: God, being God, had the good sense not to participate in
this part of the interview.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see yourself in five years?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: Running a string of yogurt shops. My friends tell me I
should aim higher.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: At the top. God will have retired by that time, and
I'll have taken over. I think I'd mature into the position but
never lose my inner child.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorite TV show?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: ``Maverick,'' for some reason. I couldn't tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' was a
stroke of genius, and I didn't have to do anything for that to
happen. All the things I think about people came out there. The
rise of the American game show, that occupies my time. I think
Regis was thrown out of heaven about the same time as me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorite music?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Dolly Parton. She's a surprising, yet willing,
disciple. She sends subliminal messages in her music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You two meet at an auto show at the beginning of the series _
what kind of car do you prefer?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: DeLoreans were one of my ideas that didn't quite go
through. I don't like SUVs; anything that's safe I'm not for. But,
of course, they kill other people. That's a really good thing. You
have fewer accidents if you're driving one, but more people die
when they're hit by one. So basically, you have to get one of those
or you're screwed.
</P>
<P>
   Q (to the devil): What did you think about ``Eyes Wide Shut''?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: It was a brave attempt, but obviously it only
scratched the surface. A brave attempt. Good try.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the biggest misperception about you?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: The biggest is that heaven is where all the good
people go. All the boring people go to heaven. All the cool people
go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   GOD: I've actually got tiny hands. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was like a scene out of a Graham Greene novel. On
a rain-swept December morning in the late 1960s, the novelist
Shirley Hazzard was sitting by herself at a table in a cafe on
Capri. While working on a crossword puzzle, she overheard a
conversation at the next table. A man she recognized as Greene was
quoting the Robert Browning poem ``The Lost Mistress'' to a friend.
He reached the penultimate line, ``I will hold your hand but as
long as all may ... '' and was unable to remember the end of the
poem. After Hazzard had finished her coffee and the puzzle, had
paid her bill and put on her raincoat, she said, as if passing on a
coded message, ``The line is `Or so very little longer.''' Without
waiting for a response, she walked out of the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   That evening Hazzard and her husband, the biographer Francis
Steegmuller, were at their favorite Capri restaurant, as were
Greene and his friend. Years before, Greene had met Steegmuller in
New York. Now at last he knew the identity of the mysterious woman,
and he invited the couple to join him for dinner. Many dinners and
meetings followed. Before leaving the island that winter, Greene
paid Hazzard the ultimate compliment. He said, ``I'm glad I forgot
that line of Browning.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the two novelists would have eventually met, but for
Greene, the manner of the meeting was tantalizing, and it opened
the door to what became a remarkable personal and literary
friendship that lasted for more than 20 years _ until his death in
1991. That friendship is the subject of Hazzard's new memoir,
``Greene on Capri.'' Meeting Greene, she said in a recent
interview, was one of those ``sheer strokes of destiny,'' chance
encounters that have defined her life.
</P>
<P>
   In most respects the two were opposites. Greene, a British
novelist of moral and psychological complexity, was known as a
difficult, often cantankerous figure. A former spy for British
Intelligence, he lived life on the edge of danger, and that became
the subject of many of his books.
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard, an Australian transplanted to the United States, is
marked by decorum in her private life and in her fiction. ``The
Transit of Venus,'' winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award
in 1981, and her other novels and stories shimmer with lapidary
language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disparities, the two writers shared common ground,
a love _ and a comprehensive knowledge _ of literature. They would
quote freely from favorite texts, as Hazzard continues to do in the
normal course of conversation. ``We will not see someone like
Graham again,'' she said. ``He belongs to a great past in our
literature, which is not past, which will go on forever. How
exciting it was to be with him because of the unexpected
illuminations, the lightning that was always striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene has been the subject of harshly critical books as well as
Norman Sherry's authorized biography. In her memoir, Hazzard
catches him off guard in moments of conviviality as well as
animosity, and offers an intimate, understanding view of what she
calls ``a labyrinthine man'' and ``an octagon'' of a personality.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait is filled with apparent contradictions. Greene
could be rude to friends or, conversely, polite to strangers,
although sometimes, she said, he would lash out at an interviewer
or a photographer. Everything had to be ``on his terms.'' Hazzard
explained that Greene exercised a certain discipline over his life
in order ``to live very simply and to dictate how he would dish out
his time.''
</P>
<P>
   His home on Capri was a sanctuary for work, whereas Hazzard was
there also because of the splendor of the environment. Greene, she
said, was not interested in having a visual experience and had no
patience with pleasure. ``It cloyed very quickly,'' she said. ``He
was born to want to suffer. I've quoted him on that: `I feel
discomfort, therefore I am alive.' There was a vein of a suicidal
feeling for all his life. Yet he lived to be 86 and very
productive, but if he had not been productive he could not have
lived.'' Asked why Greene wrote, she quoted Trollope: ``To deliver
my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she switched to Shakespeare: ``Hamlet says, there was a
kind of fighting in my heart that would not let me rest. There was
a kind of fighting in Graham's heart. You respected that, and as he
got older, he was still engage.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of his anger and his willfulness, he sometimes
seemed to be testing the limits of friendship. ``People withdrew
and then they would make up or perhaps he would make the
rapprochement.'' At least once Steegmuller said to his wife, ``We
are not here to indulge him.'' But their friendship endured.
</P>
<P>
   Greene had a blind spot when it came to most female writers,
firmly declaring that he had not read _ and obviously had no
intention of reading _ ``Pride and Prejudice.'' Hazzard said that
he had a greater interest in writers like Beryl Bainbridge and
Muriel Spark, who were distinguished by their astringency and
asexuality.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she met Greene, Hazzard had written several books.
In the course of their friendship he commented on her work. She
said that he liked ``People in Glass Houses,'' her sardonic stories
drawn from her days working at the United Nations, and her novel
``The Bay of Noon,'' but something bothered him about ``The Transit
of Venus.'' She recalled, ``He said repeatedly that it had
wonderful reviews, which is like saying it had a beautiful cover.
There are a couple of remarks of his in the book that he might have
recognized, and that wouldn't have pleased him.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in their relationship, Greene talked about academic
theorists as ``wounded people'' who needed special attention. ``One
has to be specially nice to them,'' he said, adding, ``as one is to
Indians and women.'' That, she said, ``was a sign of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction to Indians remains obscure, but his attitude to
women was clear though double-edged. She said he was resentful ``of
their hold on his life'' at the same time ``he needed their
adoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a long marriage, he had a series of infidelities,
including his affair with Catherine Walston, the inspiration for
the character of Sarah Miles in his novel ``The End of the Affair''
(played by Julianne Moore in the current film). In life as in
fiction, the romance continued with the knowledge of the woman's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard never met Walston, but in the years before she knew
Greene she would see the two of them together on Capri. ``By that
time she was not young anymore, but she was very good-looking,''
she said. ``I don't know how to say this, but she was the
incarnation of Woman, like some mature Venus _ so pleasing,
intelligent, delightful company and yet always the sensual
vibration.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene wanted to divorce his wife and marry Walston, but she
refused to leave her husband, which caused Greene to threaten
suicide. Subsequently he had a long liaison with Yvonne Cloetta,
who for years accompanied him to Capri.
</P>
<P>
   After her meetings with Greene, Hazzard made no notes, except to
mark the dates in her appointments book, but she and her husband
would talk about what was said and the words and images would be
firmly recorded in her mind. Asked if she had a photographic
memory, she said: ``It's extremely selective. I remember what
interests me and what I like, and, unfortunately, things I'm
ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Then she traced the genesis of her memoir. After Greene's death,
she received a letter from his friend Michael Richey recounting
their first meeting on Capri and asking the name of the poem that
brought them together. About the same time, Sherry, working on his
biography, asked her for her memories of Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recollections came pouring back,'' she said. She put aside her
novel in progress and began writing the memoir. As she talked about
it, she went on about Capri and about her husband, then suddenly
wondered how she had come to this point in the conversation.
Reminded that she had been asked about her memory, she laughed and
said, ``I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she recalled a scene in a Laurel and Hardy movie about the
Foreign Legion, in which each soldier is asked why he joined and
what he wanted to forget. When the question finally arrives at the
two clowns, they look at each other blankly: they had already
forgotten what it was they wanted to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hazzard has known many other celebrated literary
figures, she said, ``Greene on Capri'' will be the only book of its
kind for her. Besides being about Greene, it is her celebration of
Capri and, she said, ``a love letter to the life I had with my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her husband died in 1994, she has continued to return to
Capri and to Naples every year, splitting her time between Italy
and Manhattan, where she lives in an apartment filled with art,
mementos of her earlier travels and books. In her study are several
shelves of works by her friend Graham Greene.
</P>
<P>
   She is eager to finish her next novel, which she has been
working on for years. Asked what it was about, she said, ``As
always, it's about life, love, death, God.'' As with ``The Transit
of Venus,'' it is set around the world, including a section on the
Far East, where she lived with her parents after they left
Australia. When finished, it will be her first novel since ``The
Transit of Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about her husband and about her friendship with Greene,
she remembered a line from her last novel: ``Past, past, past, that
can turn even the happiest memories to griefs.'' ``When I wrote
that,'' she said, ``I thought I understood it, but I understand it
much better now.'' As she has found, a flood of memories can lead
to ``a great sadness of mortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In much the same way that ``The Blair Witch Project'' became a
huge hit due to its Internet component, author Dave Eggers is
successfully exploiting the Web to hawk his book, ``A Breathtaking
Work of Staggering Genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggers' critically acclaimed book offers a most ambivalent,
ironic take on the memoir genre: The author spends a lot of time
fretting over and making fun of how he's exploiting his own pain
for financial gain. Eggers writes of the death of his parents, who
both succumbed to cancer within weeks of one another, and how he,
as a fresh college graduate, took it upon himself to bring up his
7-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
   Much to his apparent dismay, Eggers has become a media darling _
though the title of his book is jokey, intentional bravado, it has
clearly done its work and focused a lot of attention upon him.
Since early profiles depicted the writer as reticent and laconic in
interviews _ one even suggested readers would be doing him a favor
by not buying his book _ Eggers has been canceling press interviews
right and left. No matter: The Internet, which doesn't require face
time with actual people, is doing his promotional work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers is also the editor of McSweeneys, a quirky literary
magazine (like its editor, it's nearly impossible to get ahold of)
whose Internet component (mcsweeneys.net) has been charting the
progress of his book-signing tour, which passed through Los Angeles
and Pasadena last week. His book signings have taken on the patina
of performance art: At one stop, he recruited an Auto Club
representative to lecture the assemblage on road rage, and he
sometimes takes requests _ fans call out numbers, and he'll read
from that page in his book.
</P>
<P>
   More ingeniously, McSweeneys has initiated a contest for fans:
Whoever submits the best fake ``review'' of ``Breathtaking Work''
to Amazon.com wins a free subscription to the magazine.
Participants must adhere to a couple of rules: They must give the
book five stars, and their review must be utterly confused and have
nothing to do with the actual book. Since the contest began, the
overworked editors at Amazon.com have caught on and have begun
deleting the most bizarre reviews, but they're still receiving a
deluge of contest entries.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers' travails have also been turning up with regularity in
the Obscure Store and Reading Room (obscure.com), a daily
compendium of oddball and media-related news. And Modern Humorist
(modernhumorist.com) has concocted an inspired parody blending the
season's biggest literary phenomena, ``Harry Potter and the
Breathtaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' which describes, for
example, a game of Quidditch in the same luxuriantly florid
language Eggers reserves for playing with his Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers' book is climbing the New York Times best-seller list,
currently at No. 12 in the non-fiction category; it's also put time
in in the top 10 of Amazon.com's updated-hourly compendium of top
sellers. &QL;

WITCHES OF UPDIKE FLYING TO LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., March 12)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is to replace ``Miss Saigon,'' which has just ended a
10-year run at Drury Lane? Since this is London's oldest, grandest
theater _ once owned by the dramatist Sheridan, who sat drinking
nearby as it burned down and famously remarked, ``Surely a man may
take a glass at his own fireside'' _ the answer is as important as
it is surprising. The impresario Cameron Mackintosh is presenting a
new musical by two Americans, John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe, based
on John Updike's novel about New England witches who use martinis
and peanut-butter brownies to conjure up a demonic Lothario to be
played by Ian McShane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Witches of Eastwick'' arrives on July 18, and is the
climax of a more-than-usually busy period for musicals in the West
End. After ``Lautrec,'' a celebration of the artist that boasts
music and lyrics by Charles Aznavour, opens at the Shaftesbury on
April 6 we get another large-scale show on a French theme, ``Notre
Dame de Paris,'' at the Dominion May 23. In between there is more
familiar stuff: Elaine Paige in a revival of ``The King and I'' at
the London Palladium on May 3 and an adaptation of the movie
``Singin' in the Rain,'' which comes to the National Theater on
June 8 from one of Britain's leading repertory theaters, the West
Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.
</P>
<P>
   The two big drama openings announced so far for the West End
this spring are Terry Johnson's version of the movie ``The
Graduate,'' which brings Kathleen Turner to the Gielgud as the
formidable Mrs. Robinson on April 5, and Nicholas Wright's
``Cressida,'' with Michael Gambon in the role of an actor and
talent scout. However, the setting isn't modern Shaftesbury Avenue
but the seedy, troubled London of 1630, when the Puritans were
readying themselves to close Britain's theaters and the Juliets,
Violas and Cressidas were still played by boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cressida'' is being staged at the Albery on April 4 by the
Almeida, the tiny north London theater that took Diana Rigg's Medea
to the West End and Broadway and followed the same route with Ralph
Fiennes' Tony-winning Hamlet. Indeed, Fiennes is again at the
forefront of the company's thinking. Starting April 12 and June 14
respectively, he plays Shakespeare's Richard II and Coriolanus for
the Almeida, this time at the Gainsborough, which is a large
disused film studio in Shoreditch, in the heartland of the Cockney
East End.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Almeida is so active and enterprising at the
moment you could almost call it the National Theater of the Fringe.
Among the productions it is scheduling for the summer are Richard
Eyre's staging of his own adaptation of Sartre's ``Dirty Hands''
and the British premiere of Arthur Miller's ``Mr. Peter's
Connections.'' But March 22 sees a still more notable opening at
the company's Islington headquarters, a double-bill comprising
Harold Pinter's first play, ``The Room,'' and his latest, the
yet-unseen ``Celebration.'' Since the dramatist, in my view still
Britain's most original, seldom produces new work these days, this
is sure to receive plenty of attention.
</P>
<P>
   But then so will the National Theater of New Writing, as the
Royal Court likes to call itself. How will this company, which has
just returned from a three-year exile in the West End, fare in the
Chelsea theater it has rebuilt at a cost of $43 million? We critics
are feeling quietly optimistic after sitting, like swells in a
vintage Bentley, in its comfy leather seats for Conor McPherson's
portrait of an alcoholic mortician, ``Dublin Carol''; but firmer
judgment must await Jim Cartwright's tough, brash ``Hard Fruit,''
which opens April 6, and the premiere in the Court's studio theater
a week later of ``The Force of Change'' by Gary Mitchell, who
specializes in even tougher, brasher plays set in his native
Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's the real National Theater, which
has recently opened a fine adaptation of Tennessee Williams' ``Baby
Doll.'' That is to be followed by an updated version of Gay's
``Beggar's Opera'' on April 11; David Edgar's new play about
Hitler's favorite architect, ``Albert Speer,'' May 25; Alan Howard
in ``The Heiress,'' a well-tried adaptation of Henry James'
``Washington Square,'' June 13; and Alan Ayckbourn's new comedy,
``House and Garden,'' Aug. 9. Comedy, do I say? With his customary
display of dramatic bravura, Sir Alan is giving us twin comedies
about a village fete and staging them simultaneously in each of the
National's big, adjacent auditoriums. You and I spend one
performance in the Olivier and another in the Lyttelton while the
actors move between them, depending on whether their interlocking
scenes are occurring in a house or a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who enjoyed Sir Alan's ``Norman Conquests,'' which
consisted of three self-sufficient plays involving the events of
the same weekend as they occur in living room, dining room and
garden, will know that this outre idea can work well. It's not the
only oddity the National is offering this summer. Late in August
the theater starts previews of a ``Hamlet'' I myself am
particularly eager to see, since the prince will be played by Simon
Russell Beale, a brilliantly gifted actor but short, podgy and not
at all the ``glass of fashion and the mould of form'' described by
Ophelia. The other day, a fellow critic rather rudely said he
resembled Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a slimmer, taller Hamlet, he can be found from June
9 onward at the Globe, the replica of Shakespeare's original
theater that stands 300 yards farther along the Thames. Yet Mark
Rylance, who takes the part, is not the most conventional of
theater people either, since he played Cleopatra at the same
address last year and, as the Globe's artistic director, is
continuing a policy of gender-bending in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has seen many distinguished actors, from John Gielgud to
Ian McKellen, play Prospero in ``The Tempest'' in recent years, but
never, I think, an actress assay the Milanese magician. On May 26,
though, the beauteous Miranda will find she has a mother, not a
father _ and the lady will be the actress whom Tennessee Williams
once described as the finest in the world, Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the Royal Shakespeare Company, Britain's prime
guardian of the dramatist's reputation? Out of London for much of
the summer. Nonetheless, early-season visitors to the capital will
still get the chance to see the bold and vigorous Antony Sher in a
fast-paced revival of ``Macbeth,'' which arrives at the Young Vic
from Stratford-on-Avon on April 27, as well as Adrian Noble's even
better received production of Chekhov's ``Seagull'' at the Barbican
from April 25. And anyone who ventures north to Stratford itself
will find some interesting, ambitious Shakespeare on offer.
</P>
<P>
   True, several of the more popular plays are being staged there:
``As You Like It'' on March 23; ``The Comedy of Errors,'' April 20;
``Romeo and Juliet,'' July 5. But the prime event in the RSC's
three Stratford theaters is ``This England,'' a millennial season
that starts March 29 and will eventually include all Shakespeare's
histories except ``King John.'' ``Richard II'' will be followed
April 19 by ``Henry IV Part One'' and June 29 by ``Henry IV Part
Two,'' each with the gloriously funny Desmond Barrit as Falstaff.
``Henry V'' comes into the repertory Aug. 31, with the three
``Henry VI'' plays joining it at some unspecified date afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And if you feel like venturing farther north, you'll find
another millennial event, a June-and-July staging in York's
cathedral, York Minster, of the city's medieval miracle plays,
among them the most powerfully realistic, painfully graphic
pre-Shakespeare drama of all, the ``York Crucifixion Play.''

   Go a bit farther, and, starting Aug. 13, there's the Edinburgh
Festival, whose most notable theatrical event this year promises to
be Calixto Bieito's production of Ramon del Valle-Inclan's
``Barbaric Comedies.'' Myth, superstition, sex and violence: the
setting is turn-of-the-century Galicia but could, I fear, be
turn-of-the-millennium anywhere at all.

   &UR; New Palm Island Resort Opens in the Grenadines &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, remote Palm Island, in the Grenadines chain of islands
between St. Vincent and Grenada in the Caribbean, has a new upscale
beach resort, an all-inclusive cottage hotel named Palm Island.
</P>
<P>
   The previous resort on the island, the more rustic Palm Island
Beach Club, was bought and leveled by the developer of the new
property. Palm Island, open since Jan. 18, has a cluster of 40
units in 22 cottages, two open-air restaurants, a 90-foot long
free-form pool, and a private launch to whisk guests back and forth
from the small airport on Union Island, a 10-minute boat ride
through turquoise water.
</P>
<P>
   The 135-acre island has five beaches, coral reefs on three
sides, and three small mountains but has neither airport nor
automobiles and no other hotels. Transport is by golf cart or
bicycle. It is within sight of the Tobago Cays, a group of islets
with beautiful beaches protected by a snorkeling reef.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the cottages were built with local off-white coral
stone; the other five are on stilts. The decor is Indonesian with
dark hardwood from an Amazon forest and bamboo furniture. Fabrics
are Egyptian cotton in pastels and earth tones. The accommodations
have air-conditioning, ceiling fans and mini-refrigerators but no
telephones or television.
</P>
<P>
   Cuisine at the two restaurants is a combination of continental
and Caribbean. There are three walking trails and a tennis court
surfaced with artificial grass. High-season double rates at Palm
Island, (800) 345-0356 or (784) 458-8824, fax (784) 458-8804, start
at $670; from April 1, they begin at $550. That includes meals,
beverages, afternoon tea, the use of non-motorized water-sports
equipment and bicycles, one boat trip to the Tobago Cays, taxes and
service.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2002 Olympics Tickets To Be Sold on the Web &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just about anything can be ordered on the Web, and beginning in
the fall, tickets for the next Olympic Games in the United States
join the list. Tickets.com, a Costa Mesa, Calif., company, has been
selected as the ticket-selling service for the 2002 Olympic Winter
Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1996, sells tickets to sports and
entertainment events, as well as airline and cruise tickets, at
www.tickets.com. It will also accept telephone and mail orders for
Olympic tickets; the phone number and address will be announced
later.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 tickets _ the total supply so far for United
States residents _ will be put on sale in October; on the Internet,
at www.saltlake2002.com. All orders received by Internet, phone and
mail will be included in a lottery-type selection, and the winners
will be notified no later than April 2001. A deadline for orders
for this first wave of ticket sales has not been set, nor have
details on payments for ticket orders.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining individual tickets will go on sale by Internet and
telephone in June 2001, with consumers able to choose specific
seats and receive immediate confirmation, and box-office sales
should start by January 2002. The Games are scheduled for Feb. 8 to
24, 2002. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee says that ticket
prices will range from $20 to $425, with 78 percent of the tickets
less than $100, and the average sport ticket $82.

<P>
   &UR; Dirty Tricks, Circa 1828, In a Nashville Exhibit &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Elect Jackson,'' an exhibition recounting the campaign in 1828
that led to Andrew Jackson's becoming the seventh president, opens
March 15 and runs through Nov. 10 at the Hermitage, Jackson's Greek
Revival mansion in Nashville. The campaign between Jackson and John
Quincy Adams made history as one of the dirtiest in American
politics and is credited with reviving the two-party system and
giving rise to the Democratic Party. It is also significant for the
fact that Jackson directed the campaign himself from the Hermitage
instead of deferring to party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As a major general in the War of 1812, Jackson, who was born on
March 15, 1767, became the hero of the Battle of New Orleans. His
admirers also called him Old Hickory; during the campaign hickory
leaves turned up everywhere, and hickory poles were raised in towns
throughout the country to show support for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On display are campaign artifacts like newspaper articles that
accused the Jacksons of adultery and a handbill that said Jackson
had soldiers executed without due process during his military
career. Also exhibited are campaign coins (a first for an
election), portraits of Jackson, song sheets, cartoons, lithographs
and excerpts from Jackson's writings.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage, accessible from Exit 221 of Interstate 40, is
open daily except Thanksgiving and Christmas from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and attracts about 250,000 visitors a year. Admission, including a
two-hour tour, is $9.50 (reduced to $3 on March 15 in honor of
Jackson's birthday). The visit includes a 15-minute film, a stop in
the museum on the former cotton plantation, a self-guided
archaeology walk, Jackson's tomb, some of the original log cabins
on the property (one built to house slaves and another that was
home to the Jacksons before the mansion was finished), the Old
Hermitage Church and a tour of the mansion.

   &UR; `Luisa Miller' to Open Spoleto Festival &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new production of ``Luisa Miller'' will open the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., on May 26. The Spoleto
Festival Orchestra's performance of the 1849 opera by Verdi will be
conducted by Yves Abel, the founder of the Opera Francais de New
York, and directed by Christopher Alden.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto, founded in 1977 by the composer Gian-Carlo Menotti, is
the American companion to the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy. This year's U.S. festival is being affected by the
controversy over the Confederate flag, which flies over the State
Capitol in South Carolina. The state branch of the NAACP has
organized an economic boycott to protest the flag's continued
presence, and as a result Bill T. Jones and his dance company have
withdrawn from the festival. Nigel Redden, the general director of
Spoleto, said that although he personally opposes the flying of the
flag, the festival will go on.
</P>
<P>
   Major presentations in Charleston will include Gluck's
``Iphigenie en Tauride''; ``The Silver River,'' a new version of
the music-theater work by Bright Sheng with libretto by David Henry
Hwang, based on Chinese folklore; and ``Running Man,'' a
collaboration by the poet Cornelius Eady and the jazz composer
Diedre Murray. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wachovia jazz series with Kurt Elling, Fred Hersch and Bill
Frisell; choral and orchestral concerts, and the annual chamber
music series led by Charles Wadsworth are also part of the
festival, which runs through June 11. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Courage and Her Children,'' Brecht's drama of war and
survival, will be presented by the Shared Experience Theater of
London. Nancy Meckler will direct the play and Kathryn Hunter, who
made a mark in the festival's 1991 presentation of ``The Visit,''
by Friedrich Duerrenmatt, will star. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the dance schedule, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens will perform
a program of ``Great Europeans'' (the choreographers Jiri Kylian,
Nacho Duato, William Forsythe). Susan Marshall and Co. pay tribute
to the new millennium, and Mats Ek's radically reconfigured ``Swan
Lake'' will be performed by the Cullberg Ballet troupe of Sweden.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, ranging from $17 to $60, can be ordered at (877)
386-7765. On the Internet: www.spoletousa.org.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bauhaus Home Of Klee, Kandinsky Opens in Dessau &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Bauhaus, the progressive school of art, architecture and
design established in 1919 in Weimar, grew to its greatest fame
after moving to the industrial city of Dessau in 1925. In Dessau,
the architect and school founder Walter Gropius (1883-1969) created
the avant-garde, glass-and-concrete Bauhaus studio building in
addition to four smaller ``master houses,'' fashioned from
interlocking cubes, that served as residences for professors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the master houses, the restored two-family dwelling
occupied by the artists Paul Klee (1879-1940) and Wassily Kandinsky
(1866-1944) during their tenure as Bauhaus instructors, reopened to
the public last month. The interior walls have been repainted with
the 170 rainbow colors that Kandinsky and Klee used for its
original decor. Through May 7, the two-story house, at 69-71
Ebertallee, welcomes an exhibition of works by Klee and Kandinsky
from their Dessau period.
</P>
<P>
   While Bauhaus principles strongly influenced architecture in the
United States, where Gropius and his fellow Bauhaus luminaries
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy emigrated after
Nazi persecution of the school, the Dessau campus was neglected
under the East German Communist regime. Its inclusion on the Unesco
World Heritage List in 1996 helped reinvigorate interest in the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Klee-Kandinsky house can be visited in conjunction with the
restored Bauhaus studio building at 38 Gropiusallee, which is
presenting an exhibition called ``1929'' through April 24, with
photographs and documents exploring the development of the movement
and events of the period. The Klee-Kandinsky house is open Tuesday
to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4, at 2 marks to $1.
Contact (49-340) 6508 251 or www.bauhaus-dessau.de.

`THE BOOK OF REVELATION': A PRISONER OF SEXUALITY, OUTWARDLY AND
INWARDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A warning: ``The Book of Revelation,'' Rupert Thomson's new
novel, may produce a powerful disquiet in you. It may keep you up.
It may give you nightmares. In a quiet, straightforward,
unspectacular way, Thomson stirs emotions we usually try to keep at
bay, telling the story of an unnamed man who is kidnapped by three
women and used as a sex slave for 18 days. They release him, and he
then spends the five years of the novel's span trying to pick his
way through the psychic desolation his experience has caused.
</P>
<P>
   This might make ``The Book of Revelation'' _ or at least its
first half _ sound like a pornographic fantasy, and indeed it is
prurient in its raw, torture-chamber physicality. Thomson, an
English novelist who seems likely to become better known in the
United States than he has been until now, has produced an erotic
horror story, but there is nothing banal or sensationalist about
it. ``The Book of Revelation'' (whose mock-biblical title is itself
a satirical master stroke) delves uncompromisingly and with
lucidity into the mysteries of power and sexuality. His book
subverts the standard sexual classifications, forcing the reader to
experience his or her own fantastical, confused and forbidden
stirrings.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson begins with a narrative archetype: the man who goes out
for a bottle of milk and never returns. In the case of ``The Book
of Revelation,'' the man is an English dancer who works in
Amsterdam choreographing and performing for a successful company.
He lives with his girlfriend, a slender beauty named Brigitte, a
dancer in the same company. Life, in other words, is good, until
one day during rehearsals Brigitte runs out of cigarettes and the
dancer, while disapproving of her smoking, goes out to buy her some
more.
</P>
<P>
   On his errand, he sees three cloaked and hooded figures approach
him. Thinking that they are street-theater actors and harmless, he
stops to talk them. Suddenly he is stabbed by a hypodermic needle
and goes unconscious. When he awakens his wrists and ankles have
been chained to railings on the floor of a bare room with a
skylight. One of the three women stands over him. ``You belong to
us,'' she says. ``You're ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The archetype has always been powerful because it projects the
common terror represented when we dream about being naked in a
public place; it reminds us that what we normally experience as the
solidity of ordinary life is actually an abyss. To that generalized
dread, Thomson adds a fantasy of imprisonment, of balls and chains,
of the dungeon, but what is so clever about his particular
nightmare is its psychoanalytical sophistication. ``We don't want
you to suffer,'' a woman says to a man the three have chained to a
floor. They subject him to a creative series of erotic enticements
and punishments. In his utter powerlessness, he desperately strives
to avoid additional cruelty by ingratiating himself with his
captors and obeying their kinky demands.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there is a reversal of the standard male-female sexual
pathology here and also a version of the Stockholm syndrome, in
which a captive person begins to identify with his captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had reached a point where he had begun to feel as if his
fate was no more or less than he deserved,'' Thomson narrator
intones. ``There was nothing random or accidental about what had
happened to him. There was nothing unlucky about it. All those
years of performing on stage _ exhibiting himself ... What was
dance if it was not exposure of the body? It was as though he had
advertised himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the dancer is released and Thomson's story turns into
a kind of thriller, full of unexpected twists and turns and a sense
of danger lurking in the shadows. After a long period during which
he avoids anything having to do with his earlier life, the dancer
embarks on a campaign to find the women who imprisoned him. But he
acts entirely alone. His story is too fantastical to be believed,
but there is a deeper reason he does not tell it.
</P>
<P>
   During his imprisonment he was sexually abused by one of the
women, who whispered into his ear the dehumanizing obscenities that
male rapists are said to use on their female victims. Like many
female victims of rape, the dancer feels ashamed and vaguely
guilty. This is in part because of the humiliation and the
suffering itself. Even more so it is because the dancer knows that
in some secret and troubled part of himself, he took a measure of
unwanted and unexpected pleasure in the experience, and that
pleasure completed and perfected his powerlessness and subjugation.
</P>
<P>
   When the nightmare is over, silence is his principal response to
it, but not his only one. He also takes on some attributes of his
abductors. Sex for a time becomes dissociated from pleasure or
affection; it becomes a means to establish his power. Even when
that phase seems to reach a conclusion and he begins to regain a
healthier sexual persona, he remains caught between contradictory
impulses: to put what happened behind him and to get revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As these themes intertwine, Thomson's story becomes almost
unbearably suspenseful. It is impossible to know until literally
the last page whether the novel will turn on a piece of private
detective work or whether it will reach a more purely psychological
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's spare narrative, not minimalist exactly but far from
Dostoyevskian, carries the story with deceptive ease, making its
psychological complexity almost imperceptible. But despite its
smooth, uncluttered form, ``The Book of Revelation'' casts a jagged
chill.
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to the Sadean and Freudian genre that plumbs the
darker and more perverse connections in the human mind. What makes
it extraordinary is Thomson's ability to draw the reader into the
dancer's emotional world, to actually experience the disturbing
connections between subjugation and guilt, cruelty and pleasure
that we normally like to keep, like sleeping dogs, undisturbed.

SAVE TIME THE KITCHEN WITH CONVENIENCE AND CREATIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 3 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all of us cook each meal from scratch. In fact, it's
probably the rare cook who does. Manufacturers keep coming up with
solutions for easy, no-fail, creative meals.
</P>
<P>
   With a little imagination and a few fresh touches, a good
kitchen magician can dress up supermarket shortcuts and turn them
into a delicious fast meal. Don't feel guilty. Once you get in the
habit of using these tricks _ which in most cases don't compromise
taste _ you'll begin to rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   While some of these timesavers may cost more than if you did
everything yourself, you save time and energy and skip
labor-intensive steps. The convenience is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are vast, but here are some of my favorite
step-saving ingredients _ and ways to use them.
</P>
<P>
   CANNED CHICKEN, BEEF AND VEGETABLE BROTHS: Since I rarely make
stock from scratch due to time and freezer storage constraints, I
usually reach for the canned variety for soups, sauces and the
like. I generally opt for the reduced-salt versions. You can whip
up a soup in short order with canned broth, canned diced tomatoes,
tomato paste, combinations of fresh and/or frozen veggies, canned
beans and chopped meats.
</P>
<P>
   CREAM CHEESE: I always keep several packages _ including regular
and reduced fat (Neufchatel) _ stashed in the fridge to use on a
moment's notice for dips and sauces. You can microwave an 8-ounce
package with some cream or milk and Dijon mustard for a creamy
sauce to mix with hot cooked pasta, vegetables and a little diced
cooked ham or chicken. Or process a package of softened cream
cheese in a food processor with bottled roasted red peppers, basil,
a splash of red wine vinegar, garlic pepper and some milk or cream
to come up with a quick wonderful sauce for hot cooked pasta.
</P>
<P>
   PREWASHED SALAD OR LETTUCE MIXES: These mixes are a boon to
those who avoid salads because they're too tired or too frazzled to
wash and dry lettuce. You can buy blends with a wide variety or
just a single lettuce. Open the bag and you have a salad almost
instantly when you toss in a few extras _ tomatoes, mushrooms,
olives and cucumbers; or oranges, blue cheese and chopped pecans _
and add some dressing, either bottled or a little olive oil and red
or white wine or balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Try the mixes as the base for a main-dish Greek salad, cobb,
chef, Caesar or antipasto salad. You'll be amazed how quickly you
can turn out a meal when the lettuce is ready to toss. I avoid the
mixes with the little packets of dressings and other items in them
_ they're a little pricey and don't taste as good as doctoring up
the lettuce mixes yourself.
</P>
<P>
   PREWASHED FRESH SPINACH: Use as a base for main or side-dish
salads or steam it and serve as a side vegetable to accompany
meats, fish and chicken. It also makes a good bed or base to
showcase grilled fish, chicken and the like. You can also toss
fresh spinach into quick, homemade soups or microwave it, cool and
chop and use it in cream cheese or sour cream dips.
</P>
<P>
   PREBAKED PIZZA STYLE CRUSTS (such as Boboli): Available in
assorted sizes and thick or thin crusts. Short of using pizza dough
from an Italian market or homemade, this wins hands-down for
designing your own pizzas at home. (The pizza crusts in cans and
the refrigerated rolled out variety in the supermarket refrigerated
deli section don't have as much flavor). I've used Boboli
successfully for the base of Thai chicken pizza, barbecued chicken
pizza, goat cheese and sun-dried tomato pizza, Tex-Mex renditions
with salsa, corn, black beans and shredded cheeses, and more. You
can also drizzle the crust with a little oil, add a sprinkle of
fresh herbs and perhaps some Parmesan or goat cheese and bake for a
bread accompaniment to a soup, salad or entree.
</P>
<P>
   TORTILLAS: Keep flour or corn _ or some of the newer flavors
like spinach, tomato, etc. _ handy in the fridge or freezer to use
for quick quesadillas, burritos, tacos, sandwich wraps or in
Tex-Mex style lasagna or casseroles (layer with cooked chicken
pieces and cheese and salsa or canned soup). You can fill them with
canned or quick homemade chili and cheese for burritos and wraps or
whip up pan-grilled stove-top quesadillas fast with shredded
cheese, a little salsa and some diced green chiles (and even toss
in some leftover meat). Accompany with guacamole and sour cream or
your favorite fruit salsa (such as pineapple or mango). Also
consider scrambled egg-filled tortillas for brunch or a light
supper.
</P>
<P>
   CANNED BEANS: The possibilities are numerous and lend themselves
to a wealth of ideas from dips to soups, cassoulets, entrees and
salads. Keep your pantry shelf stocked with cans of black,
cannellini, garbanzo, red kidney, chili, barbecue, Boston baked and
refried beans. For a hassle-free dinner, you can turn out beef or
sausage and barbecued beans (stir in a few spoonfuls of prepared
mustard and ketcup or hickory-flavored barbecue sauce to zip them
up) or Tuscan white bean salad with tuna, garlic, chopped tomatoes,
lemon juice and fresh basil or all kinds of fast homemade chilis in
less than 15 minutes. You can turn out a good hummus with
garbanzos, garlic, lemon and tahini (sesame paste) in a food
processor.
</P>
<P>
   CANNED PEELED CUT-UP TOMATOES: These are a cook's lifesaver _
and I couldn't live without them. Granted, when homegrown tomatoes
from the garden are available and in season, they'd be my first
choice, but the season doesn't last long. Peeled and diced canned
tomatoes are a great substitute, and I use them often. Available in
14 1/2- and 28-ounce cans (S&AMP;W is the favored brand), they're
fabulous in chiles, soups, stews, pasta dishes, casseroles,
spaghetti sauces, and skillet dishes like Spanish rice. I prefer to
add my own herbs, spices and seasonings to avoid flavored and
stewed tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   And don't cringe. When fresh tomatoes cost a bundle, I even
drain off the liquid from these canned tomatoes and toss them in
pasta salads or with assorted lettuces in my green salads. It's
called making do.
</P>
<P>
   ALL READY PIE CRUSTS: With these, packaged in a 15-ounce box of
two pastry crusts and available in the refrigerated deli section of
the market, pie-baking is simple. No rolling or pastry making
required. Each rolled-out crust comes folded in quarters in a
plastic pouch so you simply unfold to make a 9-inch crust. Either
prebake the crust and fill or simply fill (with sweet or savory
ingredient combinations) and bake all at once. You'll need both
crusts for a double crust pie. Besides using to line standard pie
pans, the crusts work well in fluted tart pans and can be used as
the base for other recipes such as bar cookies.
</P>
<P>
   These are versatile and can be kept frozen until needed. (You
can cheat and thaw a few seconds in the microwave if you need to
use pronto out of the freezer, but watch carefully to avoid
softening too much). When I've used these crusts people often ask
me for my pastry recipe. The only drawback is that they contain
lard, which is loaded with cholesterol, but that's what makes pie
crusts flaky and tender.
</P>
<P>
   FRESH OR DRY PASTAS: I'm not about to make my own pasta so I
keep fresh pasta in the freezer along with assorted shapes and
colors of dried pastas on my pantry shelf to build terrific
spur-of-the-moment meals. Opt for different variations of fresh,
including tortellini, tortelloni, ravioli, gnocchi, etc., stuffed
with cheeses, herbs, sausage, chicken and beef, as well as angel
hair, fettuccine, linguine or whatever strikes your fancy. Fresh
pastas cook even faster than their dried counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Top with the usual tomato sauces or try with prepared pesto
sauce thinned with a little cream and some veggies. A sauce of
whipping cream and melted brie cheese is delicious too. Keep in
mind that you can make a Tex-Mex or Italian-style lasagne without
precooking the noodles first; simply add more liquid to the layers,
cover and bake. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALSA: There are plenty of flavor and texture options here, so
pick a couple of bottled favorites to keep handy in the pantry. If
you plan to use them within a week or two, you might want to
purchased the refrigerated salsas, which are fresher tasting but
not as convenient. Salsas of all varieties (tomato, pineapple,
mango and the like) lend themselves to adding Tex-Mex and other
flavors to skillet creations, dips, rice, cold bean and corn
salads, salad dressings and more. Also use salsa to top grilled
chicken breasts, steaks and the like. And of course, it's a great
dip with chips when you have nothing else on hand.
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN VEGETABLES: Keep a supply of lots of different single
vegetables as well as combinations to use in salads, soups,
stir-fries and more. Some favorites include corn for chowder, sugar
snap peas and various combinations for stir-fries, assorted strips
of red, green and yellow peppers, baby peas and haricots verts. I
like the quality of some of the Trader Joe's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN FRUITS: Lots of possibilities are available including
pineapple, raspberries, strawberries, mango, melons and assorted
fruits to make into quick fruit salads or compotes (serve topped
with cottage cheese for a light dinner during summer), cobblers or
pies. Single fruits or combinations are also great whirred into
smoothies for breakfast or a snack or pureed for sauces for ice
cream, cake or waffles. Try processing frozen raspberries with tofu
in a food processor for a quick frozen dessert.
</P>
<P>
   SHREDDED CHEESES: Keep several kinds (flavor- and fat-wise) _
including some of the blends _ ready to add to tostadas, lasagna,
casseroles, salads, pizzas, sandwiches or English muffins. The
larger the bag, the bigger the price break. Once opened, these
cheeses have a tendency to lose freshness faster than a large block
of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED RED PEPPERS: Available in jars (Mezzetta brand is my
preference), these are wonderful for those in a hurry. Rinse and
drain them, then puree in a food processor for sauces or dips or
cut them up and toss in soups, salads, sandwiches and main dishes.
Also try marinating pieces in oil, vinegar and a little garlic and
serve as part of an Italian antipasto platter. Once you get in the
habit of using the bottled, you may never go back to roasting your
own.
</P>
<P>
   CANNED GREEN CHILES: Available whole or diced, these give a
flavor boost to dips, quesadillas, rice, chiles rellenos, sauces,
chili, pizzas, entrees of all kinds and more. Whenever I whip up a
crustless quiche for brunch or dinner, I pour beaten eggs mixed
with a little milk or cream and seasoned with chiles and seasoned
salt and garlic pepper over plenty of shredded cheese in a pie
plate. Bake until set and you're in for some tasty dining.
</P>
<P>
   CANNED AND BOTTLED OLIVES: I keep all colors and flavors of
pitted olives handy for tapenades (made in no time flat in the food
processor) as well as to embellish casseroles and, particularly,
salads and pasta dishes. The tapenades can be mixed with cream
cheese for a dip, spread on rustic bread slices to accompany soups
and more.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I prefer the canned to frozen (which I find
watery and flavorless). Buy quartered and rinse and drain well (I
add a sprinkling of red wine vinegar and drain well to get rid of
the canned taste) before adding to cold marinated vegetable or
pasta salads. Also great in baked artichoke cheese dip. You'll find
many ways to use them.
</P>
<P>
   PACKAGED ROASTED REFRIGERATED CHICKEN BREASTS: What a fabulous
and convenient shortcut. To save money, I purchase these at a
warehouse store (Tyson brand) where they are in the neighborhood of
$10-$12 per package of 6 or so breasts. Remove the skin and bones
and slice, chop or cut in strips to use in the full gamut of dishes
from soups and salads to entrees. Keep some frozen to thaw on a
dime when you don't have any other protein on hand to help solve
the dinner dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ASSORTED MUSTARDS: I've been hooked on a large variety _
including Dijon, honey mustard, grainy, hot and prepared yellow
mustards _ for years. I keep a large assortment in the fridge to
jazz up chicken and all kinds of salads, sauces, pasta creations,
salad dressings, chicken breasts and much more. One of my favorite
fast creations is a sauce for pan-grilled skinless, boneless
chicken breasts made by heating together whipping cream and Dijon
mustard until boiling (and then cooking down a minute or two).
Gussy up with a sprinkling of chopped fresh parsley or tarragon. I
also combine Dijon or honey mustard with apricot jam for a dynamite
glaze for baked ham or chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   BOTTLED TOMATO SAUCES: At one time I was horrified that cooks
would rely on these, but there are so many flavor options and
different brands that I've joined the ranks, especially when I'm
tired and there is nothing else around to eat. Most often I doctor
them up with red or white wine, extra dried basil, canned or fresh
mushrooms, olives and even broccoli florets or other veggies.
Sometimes I toss in pieces of microwaved sausage for a flavor
boost.
</P>
<P>
   BOTTLED SALAD DRESSINGS: Although I prefer combining oil and red
wine or balsamic vinegar with a few seasonings for my dressings, I
keep a few bottled dressings (Italian, Ranch and a couple of
others) on hand to use in a pinch for marinating meats (try on
round or flank steak), fish and poultry before grilling, doctoring
up assorted salads and adding to cooked shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Now you get the idea. There are other food items like barbecue
sauce, ground beef, canned tuna, sun-dried tomatoes, pudding and
pie filling mixes, whipping cream and semisweet chocolate chips
that are standards in my kitchen, too. You probably have your own
reliables.
</P>
<P>
   So keep your pantry, fridge and freezer well stocked and you'll
never be in a panic. You'll be able to create many meals with
lightning speed. &QL;

 &QL; 
NATALIE'S FAST TURKEY BLACK BEAN CHILI &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 onion, chopped &QL; 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil &QL; 
2 large cloves garlic, crushed through a press &QL; 
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder &QL; 
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt &QL; 
1 (28-ounce) can diced, peeled tomatoes, undrained &QL; 
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste &QL; 
2 (16-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained &QL; 
2 to 3 cups diced cooked turkey OR chicken &QL; 
Dairy sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes and
chopped green onions for top
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, cook onion in oil over medium-high heat a few
minutes, stirring often, until onion is soft. Add garlic, chili
powder, cumin, salt, undrained tomatoes, tomato paste and black
beans. Heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer, covered, 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in turkey and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Serve topped with sour cream, cheese, tomatoes and green onions,
if desired. Makes 5 to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Chili can also be made with 1 pound lean (uncooked) ground
beef or ground turkey instead of cooked turkey or chicken. Add beef
or turkey to skillet along with onion and cook, stirring often,
until beef or turkey is browned, crumbly and cooked through. Drain
off any excess fat. Add other ingredients as directed (except
cooked turkey) and proceed as recipe directs.
</P>
<P>
   This chili is versatile and can also be used as a base for
tostada salad (line plate with chili and top with shredded or
cut-up lettuce, chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream and
guacamole as desired). Chili is also good as a burrito or taco
filling, or mixed with cream cheese and shredded cheese for a
hearty dip. &QL;

STEPS OF AMBITION AND INNOVATION

<P>
   This is the European summer for those intrigued by Asian dance.
Homegrown dance will also be easy to find. There will be new work
by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and Lucinda Childs, the latter with a
text by Susan Sontag. Americans will be able to catch up on the
work of Maurice Bejart, rarely seen these days in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The award for sheer ambition should go this summer to the
Montpellier and Lyon festivals and to Julidans in Amsterdam. A
fitting start to the European summer dance season might be the
International Dance Day in Sweden on April 29, with more than 100
events around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions in Stockholm include the Royal Swedish Ballet in
Kenneth Kvarnstrom's offbeat ``Carmen?!'' at the Royal Opera House
and ``Exit'' by Petter Jacobsson, the company's director, along
with a new work by Ohad Naharin, open dance rehearsals, all-day
dance for children and dance by students in open squares and
subways. Also in Stockholm, ongoing programming in May at Dansens
Hus will include performances by the companies of Saburo
Teshigawara and Paul Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Montpellier Danse Festival International (June 20 to July 9)
celebrates its 20th anniversary with ``Modernism and the South,''
an exploration of Mediterranean and African modern dance alongside
companies from countries more traditionally known for the form.
Participants include Childs, Nacho Duato's Compania Nacional de
Danza, Jan Fabre of Belgium, Salia ni Seydou from Burkina Faso and
William Forsythe's Ballett Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Lyon, more than 20 modern-dance companies from China, India,
Taiwan, Korea and Japan will perform with their French counterparts
in the Ninth Biennale de la Danse (Sept. 8 to 30), commemorating
``The Silk Road,'' the 2,000-year-old commercial route between
China and Europe. Other French stops might include Le
Chore-graphique 2000 festival in Tours (May 17 to 21), a showcase
for the newest in French modern-dance choreography, and the
Festival d'Avignon (July 6 to 30), which will feature international
avant-garde dance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a rich selection of folk dance in France at two
events in Brittany: the Festival de Cornouaille in Quimper (July 17
to 23) and the Festival Interceltique in Lorient (Aug. 4 to 13).
And homage will be paid to that loveliest and most austere of
Spanish folk dances, the sardanas, in the French Festival de la
Sardane in the streets of Ceret in Languedoc (July 28 and 29).
</P>
<P>
   Saburo Teshigawara opens the adventurous Julidans festival (July
3 to 22), now in its 10th year in formal and funky theater spaces
in Amsterdam. One triple bill explores the different ways that
Dutch and Japanese cultures work with senior dancers. The Dutch
Dansgroep Krisztina de Chatel will collaborate with the Japanese
multimedia collective Nest. Other companies and choreographers
include Dumb Type from Japan and Felix Ruckert from Germany, with
more dance from Italy, Spain and America.
</P>
<P>
   Serious experimentalists should head for Austria and
tanz2000.at-ReMembering the Body (July 12 to Aug. 13), co-presented
by the Vienna Festival and ImPuls Tanz, which aims to explore no
less than radical 20th-century concepts of movement from Vaslav
Nijinsky, George Balanchine and the Bauhaus on to American
postmodernism of the 1960s and '70s. From early May to mid-August,
the months surrounding the festival proper bring performances,
workshops and film and video screenings. There will be an
exhibition on Merce Cunningham and his work (May 5 to June 11),
open rehearsals and a video-based installation called ``Stress''
(May 17 to Aug. 27) that focuses on ``the complex choreography of
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballet attractions promise a little light relief this summer,
starting with the Royal Ballet at the newly restored Royal Opera
House in London. Highlights include a ``New World'' program, with
Jerome Robbins' ``Concert,'' William Tuckett's new ``Crucible,''
based on the Arthur Miller play and set to music by Charles Ives,
and George Balanchine's ``Serenade'' (April 12 to May 4). ``The
Diaghilev Legacy'' (May 6 to 20) includes Bronislava Nijinska's
perfumed ``Biches,'' Nijinsky's ``Jeux'' and ``L'Apres-midi d'un
Faune,'' and Michel Fokine's ``Firebird.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in England, the Brighton Festival (May 6 to 28) will
present performers including the Chinese Guangdong Modern Dance
Company, Teshigawara, Jin Xing from Beijing, the Bill T.
Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from America and, from England,
Wendy Houstoun, the sharply perceptive performance artist, and
Wayne McGregor's Random Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to walk in London in June, when everyone promises to
be sashaying through the salsa, lindy and Javanese dancing. Those
are among the 30 styles in the free Feet First festival beginning
June 10 and running for five weeks at 15 theaters and studios
around the city. Organized by Arts Worldwide, Feet First will end
on July 23 with a giant outdoor dance party in Finsbury Park, North
London. And at the venerable Edinburgh Festival in Scotland (Aug.
13 to Sept. 2), there will be performances by the Nederlands Dans
Theater and the modern-dance troupe of Mathilde Monnier of France.
</P>
<P>
   Spain will play host to the Bolshoi Ballet in performances of
``The Sleeping Beauty'' at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona
(June 27 to July 2) and in late August, at the Festival
Internacional de Santander (Aug. 1 to 31), where the Russian troupe
will also perform ``Giselle.'' Modern dance will also be well
represented in Spain, however, in the Summer Festival of Barcelona
Grec 00 throughout the city, with the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company opening the festival's dance component with outdoor
performances at the Teatre Grec (July 19 to 21). Work by Cesc
Gelabert, Mar Gomez and Catherin Allard will be seen in the hallway
and women's garden of the Centre de Cultura Contemporania de
Barcelona (July 3 to 19), and by Tomas Aragay and Sonia Gomez at
the gaudily enticing La Paloma grand ballroom (July 6 to 16).
</P>
<P>
   In Denmark, the ballet choreographer Peter Schaufuss and his
company will present an unlikely-sounding program at the Ostre
Gasvaerk in Copenhagen that includes dances based on the film
``Midnight Express'' (May 23 to 26), on ``Hamlet'' (May 27) and on
the life of Elvis Presley (May 29 to June 4). Also in Copenhagen,
the Danscenen theater will present new modern dance by emerging
Danish, English and American choreographers (through June 15).
</P>
<P>
   The Icelandic dance hero Helgi Tomasson will return home with
his San Francisco Ballet to present ``Swan Lake'' at the Reykjavik
Arts Festival (May 26 to 28), followed by that clattering revue
``Stomp'' (June 27 to July 2), which is one of Reykjavik's Cultural
City 2000 events. And in early September, everyone will be invited
to participate in a dance choreographed for the Wind Festival 2000,
which celebrates the important role that the wind plays in nature
and culture in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, a dizzying variety of dance will be packed into the
weeklong Kuopio Dance Festival in pretty Kuopio (June 28 to July
4). The headliners include the ballet stars Irek Mukhamedov and
Carlos Acosta and the tap stylist Herbin ``Tamango'' Van Cayseele.
There will also be folk dance from Ireland, hip hop from America
and modern dance from England, Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance will be imaginatively represented in Norway in the
48th Bergen International Festival (May 24 to June 4), opening with
Carte Blanche of Norway and continuing with Philippe Decoufle's
Compagnie DCA from France, the ubiquitous Teshigawara and the Paul
Taylor company.
</P>
<P>
   A new work from De Keersmaeker, known for the fierce
intelligence and theatricality of her dance, is always an occasion.
The premiere performances of her new work ``In Real Time'' at
Studio de Rosas in Brussels, co-produced by the Theatre de la
Monnaie, should warrant a stop on any dance itinerary.  &QL;

UNDATED: ... cheese for a hearty dip. MICROWAVE HALIBUT AND VEGETABLES
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one of the fastest and most delicious ways to prepare

&HT;     WORDS, DRAWINGS BRING ILLUSTRATOR MONSTEROUS SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPENCERTOWN, N.Y. _ Jacqueline Rogers lives in a cluttered
farmhouse with a couple of cats, a dog and an army of monsters,
critters and funny, saucy children. While some of these creatures
are three-dimensional (her two daughters, for example), many are
painted extensions of Rogers' deeply inventive, childlike
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has illustrated more than 50 children's books, including
lively preschool stories such as ``Monkey See, Monkey Do,'' jackets
for chapter books, including the Amber Brown series, and picture
books filled with magical detail. She's worked with Jacqueline
Onassis and Sarah Ferguson, the Dutchess of York, as well as Boomer
Esiason and Danielle Steel.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest book, ``Fairies, Trolls and Goblins Galore,'' is her
third poetry picture book on the subject of scary beasts and the
children who love them. The short poems are beautifully illustrated
in rich, vivid watercolors, each picture packed with details like
tiny green fairies hidden in the grass or a scolding mother wearing
furry bear slippers, complete with claws. The children here are
dreamy and wise and capable of telling goblins from elves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play games in my books,'' said Rogers, sitting in
her home studio, a room off the kitchen with wide plank wood floors
and walls covered with watercolor paintings and charcoal drawings.
``I like to give kids lots of things to look at, because I remember
that from my childhood. I loved the books that every time I picked
them up, I found something new. And also, I remember feeling
overwhelmed by the feelings I would get from the pictures I looked
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Her enthusiasm for children's books has not diminished since her
own childhood. When she launches into a loving description of
several scenes from ``Go Dog Go,'' you want to run out and read the
1960s children's classic immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' work ranges from the folksy to the fanciful. ``I have a
real love for animals, so I have an animal direction,'' she
explained, offering as an example her book ``Best Friends Sleep
Over,'' which is the story of a young gorilla who spends the night
at the house of his friend the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I have the saucy, feisty kid with the socks falling off.
You know, like my children. I get a lot of work for the kids' faces
and children's character pieces because I do them well. Then
there's the monster avenue, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those pesky monsters.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what else Rogers was working on, somehow pages of her
sketchbook would be filled with drawings of trolls and dinosaurs
and other assorted beasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept appearing,'' said Dilys Evans, who has been Rogers'
agent for about 15 years. ``I finally said to Jackie, `We've got to
find a home for these guys. They're auditioning all the time for
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Dilys, knowing that I needed a vehicle for my monsters,
went desperately out to try and find a way to get my monsters
published,'' said Rogers, who talks about ``her monsters'' as if
they were some kind of furry and feathered cousins. ``They're
real,'' Rogers said, laughing. ``Those are soul creatures for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans began compiling children's poems, which Rogers then
illustrated with rich watercolor paintings. And thus her first book
for her creatures, ``Monster Soup and Other Spooky Poems,'' was
hatched in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love poetry books because every page is like a new story, so
you don't have the burn out of doing 32 pages about the same
situation,'' Rogers said. ``Everything is fresh and new. It's
always a challenge to tie them all together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird Pet Poems'' followed in 1997, about which The New York
Times Book Review wrote: ``From the collection's cover, in which
the letters of the title are decorated with snakeskin, animal fur,
even the face of a bulldog, Rogers' beasts exude personality.
Twinkling of eye, exuberant of pose, they manage charm without
cuteness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 41, grew up in Westport, Conn., the youngest of six
children, all of whom are artists. Her mother was a portrait
painter and her father was a gifted craftsman who owned a marketing
research company in New York City and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art was really promoted in my family. A lot of materials were
always around for me to use, and my imagination was just really
rich,'' Rogers said. ``I loved sci-fi growing up. Some of the first
things I drew were dinosaurs and bugs and monsters. I just loved
aliens and making up my own creatures. I couldn't just draw a
horse, I had to draw a horse that was in the army or was going to
camp or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went with my imagination. Of course, my imagination can
get me in a lot of trouble in my personal life too, but it sure
worked well in the art world.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rogers always knew she wanted to be an artist. ``There was never
any doubt in my mind. I think in third grade I wanted to be a nurse
for about a week and that was it. It was art all the way without
question. And it was really the only thing I was really good at, so
it kind of made it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who is close to all her siblings, was especially
attached to her older brother Martin when they were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I were joined at the hip. He was two years older,''
Rogers said. ``He had an incredible imagination. Every time I do a
picture book, he's in there. Something we played or some way he
dressed; his influence on me is always in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of the tail end of the litter,'' said Martin
Rogers, now a sign painter in Westport. ``So we pretty much fended
for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair spent lots of time drawing together, even illustrating
their dreams. But by the time his sister was 5 or 6, Martin Rogers
said, her drawing ability had progressed well beyond his own. She
was producing pictures ``with excellent proportion and
perspective,'' he said proudly. ``I couldn't keep up with her in
that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up drawing for fishing, but luckily for children and
fish everywhere, Rogers did not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she studied art at Arizona State University, then the
Rhode Island School of Design. After graduating in 1981, Rogers
started illustrating immediately, ``but never with the intent of
going into children's books,'' she said. ``Being the youngest of
six, I had no experience with children. I didn't like them. I was
scared of them, actually. I would baby-sit and I'd be like'' _ here
she makes a praying motion _ ``Please be asleep, please asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a terrible baby-sitter. I just didn't relate to
children. Until my older brothers and sisters started to have their
own kids. Then I could play with them and give them back.''
</P>
<P>
   She began shooting photographs of all her nieces and nephews,
creating pictures for her portfolio of 4-year-olds (based on them)
feeding porridge to monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to me that I was leaning toward children's
books because that's what I liked to do for samples,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas about children began to change, too. In 1986, Rogers
got married and had her first daughter about a year later. She and
her now ex-husband moved to Spencertown so he could be closer to
his job in Troy. ``We drove through it and fell in love with it,''
Rogers said of her adopted hometown, where she lives with her
daughters Martha, 12, and Emma, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe what a change that was from being afraid
of children to absolutely loving them,'' said Rogers, shaking her
head. Now she volunteers at schools, teaching youngsters how to
paint, in addition to staying busy splashing her inner child on the
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. It's always a challenge to me. I know that I'm in
the right place when I'm scared to death to start a new book
because that's where I get my fire. That place of being afraid,''
she said. ``Then I know it's a challenge and there are obstacles to
overcome. Because if I'm too confident or too complacent, then it's
not going to have any zest to it. So I like to keep that nervous
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy in this field. I absolutely love my job.''
</P>
<P>
   And her children, pets and monsters.

   OLD GREENWICH, CONN. _ About 6-ft. tall and almost as wide, they
look like a cross between a Wurlitzer, an old-fashioned telephone
board and some kind of end-of-the-pier one armed bandit.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the big red lever at the front, from left to right, and a
curtain will draw behind you. (When they are fully closed, a little
bell will ring.) It is the curtain that gives them away. These
contraptions, made of metal and mounted on wheels, are nothing more
mysterious than voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved for their creakiness and eccentric design, they have for
decades done their bit for American democracy. When ballots need to
be cast, out they come.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, for example, in the gym of Old Greenwich
Elementary School Tuesday, designated as Polling Station for
District 6 in Connecticut, one of 16 states that participated in
the ``Super Tuesday'' presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although six had been installed, only three were in use. There
was one for Democrats, on the left of the gym, and, two to the
right, for the Republicans, who are more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   The person responsible for the station is 70-year-old Tony
Hayden. His title is ``moderator'' and his first task at 5 a.m. _
the polls opened one hour later _ was to remove the little steel
seals from the machines and then take the four keys necessary to
get each one ready.
</P>
<P>
   The keys themselves are sealed in little manila envelopes. He
then checked that every machine was in good order and set at zero.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Hayden, the choices Tuesday were entirely
straightforward. Once installed behind their curtain, Democrats had
only to press one of three little buttons on a large board. They
read Al Gore, Bill Bradley and ``Uncommitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had McCain and Bush to choose between, although
there were buttons also for candidates who have actually withdrawn,
like Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the choices can be much more numerous and that is when
the queues can begin.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, like New York, voters Tuesday had to choose
between slates of delegates representing the different candidates.
In others, such as California, there were also ballot issues before
the electorate, for instance on gay rights. Then the voting machine
boards can be crammed with dozens of buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the close of the polls _ 8 p.m., in Connecticut _ do the
machines reveal their secrets. Moderators take a fifth key and open
a panel at the back. Wherever there is a button, there is a counter
behind it, like an odometer on a car.
</P>
<P>
   They will record the total for each button _ candidate, delegate
or ballot question. These will then be phoned in to state election
offices where final results are tallied.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, a teacher, cannot say how long the voting machines have
been around, but it is surely a long time. He has been working the
polling stations in Greenwich since 1960 and they were here when he
started and they have never been modernized.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they seem to help much with reducing labor. Ten people
were on hand to help Hayden Tuesday, each one paid $100 for a
15-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in America may not be quite so Dickensian for long. Far
away on the other side of the country Tuesday, Arizona was the
first state to make a leap from the age of the voting Wurlitzer to
voting in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, when the state will hold its Democratic primary,
voters in Arizona will be able to cast their ballots on the
Internet via their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if things seemed less than frantic at Connecticut's
District 6 Tuesday, Hayden was unconcerned. (By 9:15 a.m. only 280
voters had passed by, of which 180 were Republicans and 100 were
Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know, for a primary, this is unusually active,'' he
commented contentedly. &QL;

CRESS: GREEN WITH AN ICY BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With food as with people, passion can lead to unintended
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Take watercress, for example. English cooks of the early
Victorian era were so mad about this spicy green that they even
pressed it into service as a sandwich filling.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the sandwiches in question were dainty, crustless
affairs featured at overly refined formal teas. As a result,
watercress became fixed in the public mind as a somewhat silly
food, the epitome of effete eating.
</P>
<P>
   But this typecasting is actually quite misleading. Watercress is
a green with real character, capable of standing up to a multitude
of culinary roles.
</P>
<P>
   To restore the more muscular reputation that watercress enjoyed
before it was caught in a web of Victorian manners, think of the
generals of ancient Greece, who commanded their troops to eat it as
a source of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for a more modern source of inspiration, look to the cooks
of China and Southeast Asia. Although watercress originated in the
Mediterranean region and was not introduced to Asia until the 19th
century, cooks in those regions took to it with a passion,
stir-frying it with intense flavor accents and tossing it into
soups by the handful.
</P>
<P>
   You might also consider watercress as an alternative to those
Italian darlings of the produce market, radicchio and arugula, with
which it shares a characteristic boldness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, watercress' generic Latin name, nasturtium, translates
roughly as ``twisted nose,'' a testament to the grimaces caused by
its pungent bite. But unlike many other members of the far-flung
mustard family (not to be confused with the garden nasturtium),
watercress also has a surprisingly cooling effect in the mouth that
makes it refreshing. Because its leaves are paper thin and tender
while its fleshy stalks have some real crunch, this green also
incorporates a pleasant textural contrast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its purely sensual virtues, watercress is a
prototypically healthful food, rich in potassium, iron, folic acid
and vitamins A and C.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for growers, watercress spreads easily and requires
little care. The original hydroponic vegetable, it grows with its
roots in cold, fresh-running water. If you look carefully along the
shady bank of a spring or stream in early spring, you are likely to
catch sight of its bright green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The watercress found in produce markets is a cultivated variety,
grown in special watery beds. Today, good-quality watercress is
available at a reasonable price 12 months a year. During the
summer, wild watercress can be found at the Union Square
Greenmarket in Manhattan..
</P>
<P>
   Although there are many varieties of watercress, the differences
are subtle, said Andy Brown of B&AMP;W Quality Growers, a family-owned
business based in Fellsmere, Fla., that describes itself as the
world's largest producer of watercress.
</P>
<P>
   All varieties, he said, belong to one of two strains. The type
most common in the United States has the thick, juicy stems and
ovoid leaves preferred by Chinese-American cooks, who he estimates
buy 35 percent of all watercress sold in this country. The second
strain, most of which is sent to Europe, has thinner, more delicate
stems and more consistently round leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds are versatile in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   When raw, watercress makes an excellent lettuce substitute in
salads of all kinds. Because it brings a more substantial flavor to
the mix, it encourages the use of more intensely flavored
ingredients _ like ham or horseradish dressing _ than lettuce does.
</P>
<P>
   But our favorite way to use raw watercress is as a bed for meat
or fish. The freshness and gentle bite of the greens provide an
ideal balance to the richness of pork, for example, and somehow
make even a richly sauced meat dish seem rather light. We found
this to be true even when pork tenderloin is teamed up with other
rich ingredients like Madeira, olive oil, walnuts and blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   As a cooked green, watercress is particularly well suited to
soups. The point at which you add it depends on the texture you
want.
</P>
<P>
   As with classic Chinese watercress soup, the cress can be added
several minutes before the end of cooking so that it becomes very
soft and tender. But we prefer the Southeast Asian approach, mixing
the watercress with other greens or herbs in a bowl, then dousing
them with hot stock just before serving. That way, the leaves
become wilted while the stems retain some vestigial crispness.
</P>
<P>
   Those strong stems are one reason watercress also responds well
to quick, high-heat cooking methods like stir-frying. Quickly
wilted by intense heat, watercress has a pleasant crisp-tender
texture, and its potent taste makes it a good match for strong
Asian flavorings like ginger, garlic and chilies.
</P>
<P>
   However you are going to use the cress, it should be washed
thoroughly but quickly and only when you are just about ready to
use it, since the leaves become soggy if soaked for very long.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing watercress, look for vibrant green color in the
leaves and a little crispness in the stems; if you bend a stem back
on itself, Brown said, it should snap just before it touches. The
flavor of both stems and leaves should be pungent but not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pungency of individual bunches of watercress varies
quite a bit, it is' also a good idea to sample a leaf or two before
buying the whole bunch. Obviously, avoid wilted or yellowish
leaves, which are signs of age.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clean watercress like other greens. Place it in a large bowl of
cold water and swish it around for 30 seconds or so. The grit will
drift to the bottom. Gently lift out the greens, empty the dirty
water, and repeat until the water is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Watercress is quite perishable and will keep only a couple of
days in the refrigerator. To store it, place its stalks in a bowl
of water, which should be changed daily, and cover its leaves with
damp paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   If you must, you can even use it in a sandwich. &QL;

&HT;     ALEUTIAN GOOSE COMEBACK WILL BE CELEBRATED IN CALIF. 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. _ In 1967, when the species population
fell to 800, the Aleutian goose's goose was just about cooked.
</P>
<P>
   But in a remarkable, human-assisted comeback, these geese are
flourishing anew. And on March 24-26, their arrival will be
celebrated in Crescent City at the second annual Aleutian Goose
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   All the world's Aleutian geese, numbering about 35,000, are
resting up on tiny Castle Island off the Crescent City headlands
for their 2,000-mile flight to the rocky, wind-blasted islands in
the Gulf of Alaska where they breed.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is unusual in that it shuns fireworks, music,
floats, pageantry and booze and emphasizes the natural beauty of
the flora and fauna of Del Norte County in California's far
northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   If guided trips by kayak and redwood forest walks, watching a
sky full of rare geese, are your thing, the Aleutian Goose Festival
is for you. It is billed as ``A Celebration of Wildness.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleutian geese, a smaller version of Canada geese, with a more
abrupt forehead, shorter bill and a white neck ring, were hunted to
the verge of extermination by arctic and red foxes, which were
introduced to the Aleutian Islands for fur breeding. When the fur
breeders quit in the 1930s, the abandoned foxes made the gooses'
breeding grounds their dining commons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Aleutian goose was recognized as an endangered
species long before the Endangered Species Act became law, the 1973
act was the tool that empowered U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
rangers to terminate the foxes with prejudice to protect the geese.
</P>
<P>
   Result: the goose population has recovered so well that its
de-listing as an endangered species is in the works, even though it
is far from occupying its original range, which extended from
Japan's Kurile Islands to southern Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, the entire flock rises and wings off Castle Island for
a day of feeding on the grasslands of the Smith River Delta _ an
event of breathtaking beauty that becomes a bit of a problem for
the mainland dairy farmers on whose grasslands they feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we bought the ranch eight years ago, the (goose)
population was seven or eight thousand birds, and what we did was
let 'em eat,'' said Blake Alexandre, a dairyman who milks a herd of
1,400 Holsteins south of the Smith River. ``It was kind of fun when
the population was small, but now it's more than doubled in size.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleutian geese are grazers, and ``if the grass grows a quarter
of an inch a day, they'll eat it,'' Alexandre said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Ferguson, a dairyman and president of the Del Norte County
Farm Bureau, said the geese ``spend about 55 to 60 percent of their
time on private land.''
</P>
<P>
   To mitigate the goose problem, Alexandre has received permission
from the state to manage 500 acres of state land on the adjoining
Lake Earl Wildlife Project Area for goose grazing. ``It gives us a
place to chase the geese,'' said Alexandre. But he added that ``now
it's not enough land.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said that farmers in the area, who employ 3-wheelers to
chase the geese, have calculated that the birds are costing them
$225,000 to $250,000 a year in lost grass and labor.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, they are in the process of forming a Resource
Conservation District and working with the California Coastal
Conservancy on a plan by which they might receive some compensation
for the grass the geese are eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a win-win situation so far,'' Alexandre said.

 &HT;    Sudden interest in Marino leaves Dolphins on the hook
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Marino let the Miami Dolphins off the hook in February. By
voiding the final two years of his contract, he solved a salary-cap
problem that otherwise would have resulted in the unthinkable, a
pink slip for the franchise's signature player.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, with the news that another team wants Marino,
the hook has been reset, and deeper than before.
</P>
<P>
   Pity new head coach Dave Wannstedt. He's the guy who got stuck
with this no-win quarterback quandary as Jimmy Johnson skipped out
the door. Marino's retirement, at least, would have represented a
draw. You know, the Dolphins take some heat for judging Marino
irrelevant, but get some vindication when the rest of the league
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green's offer to lead the Minnesota Vikings puts Marino
back in circulation. Here's a coach who not only believes a
39-year-old quarterback can be an effective NFL starter, he has the
proof of former Viking Warren Moon making the Pro Bowl at that age
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Green has run out of time for Randall Cunningham, 36,
and is prepared to release him to help make room for Marino, but
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   We have more than enough to talk about right here with Danny and
the Dolphins. It's a relationship that can never end, even if
Marino joins the Vikings. For instance, if Minnesota makes the
playoffs in 2000 with No. 13 in the huddle, woe unto Wannstedt if
he falls short without him. And what if Marino's wearing purple
when the Dolphins and Vikings play at the Metrodome this season?
That's a loyalty test no Miami fan can take without some serious
guilt pangs.
</P>
<P>
   Who would you rather see take a blind-side sack from a blitzing
safety? Dan Marino, who played 258 games for the Dolphins, or Jay
Fiedler, who's played zero?
</P>
<P>
   Who would you rather see celebrating a touchdown pass? Dan
Marino, who threw 48 of them in 1984, or Damon Huard, who's thrown
eight in his career?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions Wayne Huizenga never wants asked. No doubt
he has a golden parachute all ready for Marino, a reward for
spectacular services rendered over 17 seasons. Monday was but a
taste of the afterlife for an NFL superstar, a sun-splashed round
of golf for Marino on Huizenga's private course in Palm City.
Huizenga was vilified for selling off the best of the 1997 World
Series champion Florida Marlins, an affront to baseball's
credibility, but he can be extraordinarily generous toward causes
that are nearer to his heart. A year ago Wayne opened his wallet
for the United Way, donating $1million to be divided evenly between
member charities in Martin and St. Lucie counties. There is good in
the man, and an appreciation for success that consistently places
Marino in the path of his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the distinct possibility that Marino will be getting
his warm hugs from Minnesotans next fall. Longtime Miami fans are
willing to share him for a season, given the alternative of Dan's
Super Bowl dream being extinguished once and for all. The Dolphins,
however, desperately need the clean break that comes with Marino
calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   It still could go that way. This Vikings offer, supposedly
everything Marino could want, is no slam dunk or he'd already be
signed. To leave Claire and the kids for six months at a stretch is
an agonizing decision. Marino's never had to do it and never
dreamed it would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the uncertainty over Marino's arm strength. Only he
knows what's really left, measured against decades of experience
with off-season soreness and fatigue. What's more, a little
homework will show Marino that Minnesota's offensive line allowed
43 sacks last year, six more than Miami, and that was before
Randall McDaniel was released as a salary-cap casualty.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there's no reason to pile on the Dolphins for ending it
with Marino. The time had come. There is something fascinating,
however, about watching him make the team twist a bit, and so
unexpectedly. I, too, was convinced that no one else would want him
as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between me and the Dolphins, in this very unusual
case, is that I rather enjoy being proven wrong.

ANNAN FORMS PANEL TO ASSESS U.N. PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Tuesday
that he was appointing an international panel to look at every
aspect of U.N. peacekeeping and make recommendations on how
missions can be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly it is a question of being clearer about what we are
trying to do,'' Annan said at a news conference. ``And partly it is
a question of getting the nuts and bolts right.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the questions to be posed to the panel, he added, is
``What do you do if the peace you are trying to keep breaks down
and large numbers of civilians are in danger of being massacred?''
The question is not hypothetical: the United Nations has come under
severe criticism for the failure to stop the killing of Muslims in
Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995 and the massacre of ethnic Tutsi in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Two tough reports last year on those incidents found
considerable shortcomings in the organization, including in the
peacekeeping department, which at the time of those events was run
by Annan. But the new panel is not being formed to conduct another
post-mortem. Instead it will look more broadly at how the United
Nations is often handed difficult assignments by member nations on
the Security Council and then not given the means to carry them
out. The contrast to NATO-led missions or other operations outside
the U.N. system is stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When member states take on some of these operations under
multinational force arrangements, they usually go in with much
larger forces,'' Annan said Tuesday. ``But when the U.N. is going
to do it, we are often given a very low and arbitrary ceiling and
resources do not always match the mandate. One of things I hope the
panel will look at is the quality of the mandates we get.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel will be led by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian
foreign minister who has been a troubleshooter for the
secretary-general in Afghanistan, Haiti and other countries. It
will also be expected to consider how to adapt peacekeeping
missions to Annan's new policy of being more willing to overstep
borders when human rights are threatened by governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in the next six months or a year we would have
enough ideas on when and how we intervene,'' Annan said. ``Under
our charter, we are allowed to use force in the common interest.
But there are questions that we will have to answer. What is the
common interest? Who defines it? Who defends it? And under what
authority and under what circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general asked the panel to produce a report by
July, before a summit meeting of heads of government in early fall.
The report is to be written by William Durch, an arms control and
Balkans expert at the Henry L. Stimson Center, an independent
institute in Washington that studies issues of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members announced Tuesday were J. Brian Atwood, former
administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development;
Dame Ann Hercus of New Zealand, a former representative of the
secretary- general in Cyprus; Richard Monk of Britain, a member of
the police task force in Bosnia; Gen. Klaus Naumann, former chief
of the German defense staff and chairman of the military committee
of NATO; Hisako Shimura, president of Japan's Tsuda College and a
former peace negotiator for the United Nations; Gen. Philip Sibanda
of Zimbabwe, a former peacekeeping force commander in Angola; and
Cornelius Sommaruga of Switzerland, who has just retired as
president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that one or two other members may be added.

major ad campaign ($35 million to $50 million) that is meant to
''re-position'' the company. The company is looking to nudge its
name recognition higher among younger, more tech-savvy customers.
The television spots will start running on NBC Thursday and then
during the NCAA playoffs. They are a far cry from the Chatsford,
home town campaign, although they are also radically different from
the in-your-face Internet dotcom gerbils-out-of-cannon ad. (Kanell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   GLOBALSPEAK _ ATLANTA _ Frank Baia, CEO of Atlanta-based
Globalspeak, is an old-time advertising man and business publisher,
but his business is cutting edge _ a multimedia platform for
staying in business touch and doing transactions worldwide. Among
the features of the company's powerful website is the cability to
conduct international trade missions, with a recent example
allowing Nigerian businessmen to do business with Atlantans,
without stirring from their offices in Lagos. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   OT-ABUSE _ The nation's factories and offices are running
full-tilt. So, too are workers. And many aren't taking the extra
work load lightly. Instead, they're taking their employer to court
for overtime abuse. On the other side of the argument: the
workplace is changing thus creating a grey area: who should get
paid overtime? And who's exempt? A look at this issue. (Joyner,

   HOTEL-SUPPLIES _ ATLANTA _ An Atlanta-based Internet site for
buying and selling hotel and restaurant supplies is expanding its

Suddenly, though, with the news that another team wants Marino, the
hook has been reset, and deeper than before. Pity new head coach
Dave Wannstedt. He's the guy who got stuck with this no-win

Marino's retirement, at least, would have represented a draw. You

 &HT;    Christians may be missing the point of Lent
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Today is Ash Wednesday, the first day of the 40
days of Lent that lead up to Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, it's a time of prayer, discipline and penitence
that culminates with the celebration of Christ's resurrection and a
sense of spiritual renewal.
</P>
<P>
   But the faithful who think of Lent as a time to give up
something _ say, chocolate or television _ may be missing the point
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, 'sacrifice' does not mean to give up, but to
make holy,'' says the Rev. James Manning of St. Albert the Great
Church in Kettering. ``If you use the hour you usually spend on TV
to read the Bible, the focus should be on what you get, not on what
you give up.''
</P>
<P>
   This Lenten season is a special one for the Catholic Church, a
Jubilee year in which Pope John Paul II has asked Catholics to take
stock of the sins committed by the Catholic Church through history.
</P>
<P>
   In an apostolic letter, John Paul wrote, ``The church rejoices,
gives thanks and asks forgiveness, presenting her petitions to the
Lord of history and of human consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   As the church is conscious of its own sins, Lent can be a time
for individual Catholics to focus on their own shortcomings, says
Dan Andriacco, spokesman for the Cincinnati Archdiocese, which
includes the Miami Valley area.
</P>
<P>
   The Jubilee _ which occurs every 50th year _ is a Jewish
tradition, mentioned in the book of Leviticus, a period that is a
special opportunity for grace, Manning says. It is a time for rest,
for fair dealings with neighbors and business associates, and for
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cincinnati Archdiocese, Catholics can observe Lent during
this Jubilee year by making a pilgrimage to churches that have an
artistic or historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The seven churches in the Dayton area are: Our Lady of the
Immaculate Conception, 2300 S. Smithville Road, in Kettering; Holy
Family Church, 140 S. Findlay St., in Dayton; Emmanuel Church, 149
Franklin St., in Dayton; Holy Trinity Church, 272 Bainbridge Ave.
in Dayton; St. Joseph Church, 411 E. Second St., in Dayton; St.
Mary Church, 310 Allen St., in Dayton, and Holy Angels Church,
Brown and L streets, in Dayton. For more information about the
pilgrimage, visit the archdiocese Web site at www.archdiocese
cinti.org., or pick up a brochure at any of these churches.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian denominations observe Ash Wednesday with a
ceremony in which a priest or pastor uses ashes burned during the
previous year's Palm Sunday (the Sunday before Easter) to mark a
cross on the foreheads of worshipers. This blessing is based on the
passage from Genesis: ``... for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
thou return.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40 days of Lent symbolize the 40 days that the Bible says
Jesus spent in the desert before beginning his public ministry.
It's a powerful number throughout the Old and New Testaments,
Manning says, considered to be an ideal time needed to prepare for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whether it's 40 or 39 or 41 is not the issue,'' he says.
``The point is to prepare for the new life of Easter.''

SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT

  (Pedro Gomez is assistant manager of A Royal Flush, a provider of
portable toilets.) 
(DW) 
 By PEDRO GOMEZ with PATRICIA R. OLSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm responsible for setting up portable toilets at special
events in the city such as street fairs, road races, concerts. Once
a driver drove over the Great Lawn in Central Park _ where Diana
Ross sang _ and left tire tracks. Now I'm the only one the Parks
Department will trust to set up toilets there.
</P>
<P>
   I work seven days a week. Many times, I start at 2 or 3 a.m.
People are just coming out of the clubs, and I see a lot of
interesting things at that hour. I enjoy it. I do all the planning
for the jobs, drop off the toilets and pick them up after the
events. Another guy pumps out the toilets into a truck after the
event and then puts locks on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Once I was picking up some toilets from a construction site. I
had one of them ready to load when someone inside started
screaming. He had been locked in. The toilet flushed up, and when
he came out, his whole back was blue. It wasn't funny for the guy
who put the lock on. He was fired.
</P>
<P>
   When a water main breaks, we're one of the first services the
city calls. After the World Trade Center bombing, we set up units
for the disaster relief people. When President Clinton comes to
town, we set up two toilets on the tarmac for the Secret Service
men who stay with the plane. We've also got handicapped-accessible
units.
</P>
<P>
   Customers don't always know what they want. We use a tool like a
slide rule to figure the number of toilets they need, according to
the crowd they're going to have. It also depends on whether people
are going to be eating and drinking. The true test of whether
enough were ordered is how full the units are when we pick them up.
If they're full to the top, the customer didn't order enough.
</P>
<P>
   At the St. Patrick's Day parade. there's no drinking allowed on
the route, but people go into bars and drink. It took over a week
to pump the toilets out after the New Year's Eve celebration in the
city. A lot of the time we find empty bottles in the units.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on a lot of movie sets. I met Bruce Willis during the
filming of ``The Siege,'' and I met Richard Gere when the Dalai
Lama held a service in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   After I've loaded all these toilets in the back of my truck, the
odor can be overpowering. When I stop at a light, I know what's
going to happen. Once I pulled up next to a group of girls with the
car windows down and the radio blasting. After a minute they looked
over at me, started yelling, rolled the windows up and ran the red
light. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   For occasions like lawn weddings, I have larger, V.I.P units
with sinks, paper towels and soap, and flush toilets. Once an
actress said she'd like to take one on the road, and someone
whispered: ``Do you know who that is? You should ask for her
autograph.'' But I'm a professional; I don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always immaculately dressed, and my truck is always clean.
Still, some people ask, ``How can you do this?'' I tell them: ``If
you saw my check, you'd understand.''

&HT;     `FEMALE GRISHAM' CREATES A LIE WORTH TELLING 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By BOBBIE HESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People magazine has called Lisa Scottoline ``the
female John Grisham.'' Grisham is fun, but Scottoline is more
creative.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest legal thriller ``Moment of Truth'' (HarperCollins,
$25, 355 pages) is a fresh addition to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Newlin had no choice but to frame himself for murder.
Once he set his course, his only fear was that he wouldn't get away
with it. That he wasn't a good enough liar, even for a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer with Philadelphia's top firm, Newlin arrives home late
for dinner and finds his heiress wife stabbed to death. Believing
his 16-year-old daughter Paige was the killer, he rigs the murder
scene to make it look like only he could be the murderer. He calls
911 and says he has just killed his wife. Taken into custody, he
waives his rights and confesses. Then he hires an inexperienced
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   His only problem is that everyone knows he is lying, but nobody
agrees what the lie is. The district attorney is ecstatic because
he is sure he has an open and shut capital murder case. The lead
homicide detective knows something is wrong and starts looking for
other suspects. And Newlin's lawyer, Mary DiNunzio, believes a
loving father would do anything to protect his daughter, even die
for her.
</P>
<P>
   So DiNunzio sets out to prove that Paige, a model living away
from home, killed her mom. She learns that Paige's mom had abused
her for years and tries to get the girl to confess.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book you pick up and find you can't go to bed until
it's finished because of a realistic plot driven by likable and
highly believable characters who talk like people you know.
``Moment of Truth'' truly is a thriller that delivers.

   ``Void Moon.'' By Michael Connelly. Little, Brown and Co.
$24.95. 391 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's latest thriller has a sassy female protagonist who
moves the plot along at a rapid-fire pace.
</P>
<P>
   Six years before, Cassie Black was on top of the world. She and
her lover Max had planned one last robbery of a Las Vegas casino
gambler before retiring from crime life. But something went
horribly wrong, Max fell to his death and she was sent to prison.
Now on parole, Cassie works at a Porsche dealership in Los Angeles.
Suddenly, she decides she needs a great deal of money and calls
Max's half-brother Leo and asks him to set up one more heist.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen days later Leo calls her back and says there is contract
job in Las Vegas and that she can net $150,000. The mark is a
big-time gambler and all she needs to do is wait until he goes to
sleep, slip in, grab the money and get back to Los Angeles with it.
But Leo warns her not to do the job between 3:22 a.m. and 3:38 a.m.
Thursday _ the time of a void moon, a time of very bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie goes to Vegas, sets up the heist, slips into the mark's
room and gets the money _ but oops, she's still in the room at
3:30. She also grabs his briefcase and takes off. When she
discovers that there is $2.5 million in the briefcase, she knows
she's in big trouble. Turns out that mark was a courier for the
mob. Now Cassie is on the run being trailed by the man who set Max
up.
</P>
<P>
   None of Connelly's thrillers has been made into a movie, but
``Void Moon'' should be. The main character is likable, smart and
resilient. Her nemesis has no conscience and has no qualms about
killing anyone who gets in his way. There are some unexpected plot
twists, interesting minor characters, good dialogue and a pace that
just keeps on building.

UNICEF TO COMBAT CULTURALLY SANCTIONED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ UNICEF will begin a global campaign Wednesday
against acts of homicidal violence against women who live in
cultures where laws and society fail to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a number of organizations focusing on this issue as
they meet in New York for two weeks to assess progress five years
after the largest international gathering of women _ from the grass
roots to governments _ assembled in Beijing to share their hopes
and grievances. They refer to the issue as culturally sanctioned
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a violence that is almost sanctioned,'' said Carol
Bellamy, the executive director of UNICEF. The campaign will focus
on such acts as ``honor killings,'' dowry deaths, female
infanticide and acid attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, even when laws defending the right of men to
use violence against women are repealed, the culture that created
them continues to exert a tremendous influence over behavior, these
groups say. The situation is worst across a swath of countries
stretching from the Mediterranean to the edge of Southeast Asia,
especially Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's violence everywhere, there's gender discrimination
everywhere,'' said Bellamy. ``But South Asia _ when we assign
people there they come back raving feminists in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies and thousands of local organizations from scores
of countries have found, their leaders say, that the path toward
better lives for the world's most oppressed women leads inevitably
into a collision with laws that favor men. And they contend that it
may explain why some countries never develop to their full
potential
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the violent attacks on women are technically
illegal. But some recent information compiled by UNICEF, with the
help of grass-roots organizations, indicates that they continue to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   They found that in Bangladesh, reported acid attacks on females
_ often by males they had rejected _ rose from 47 disfiguring
assaults in 1996 to more than 200 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In India, more than 6,000 ``bride burnings'' or other dowry
deaths were reported in 1997. The women died because they did not
bring what in-laws considered a satisfactory dowry or, sometimes,
because the groom was not happy with a bride chosen by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, according to the most recent available
information, about 300 women in one province in Pakistan were
reported killed by relatives in the name of saving a family's
honor. India also has a version of ``honor crimes,'' as young
people from different Hindu castes, or caste Hindus and so-called
outcastes, may meet violence if they cross lines to marry.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in its latest annual survey of human
rights, published Feb. 25, said that in India there are also
reported to be about 10,000 cases of female infanticide annually,
not counting an unknown number of abortions to avoid giving birth
to a girl.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``UNICEF is a children's agency,'' said Bellamy, ``but you can't
deal with children without the implications of the parents,
particularly the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of child survival is already compromised if you're
talking about a mother who is malnourished in the first place. As a
child she's less well taken care of than a boy. She leaves school
early for early marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very often physically abused, and so much of that abuse
comes in the family. She doesn't get adequate prenatal care.
There's no obstetric emergency care. And we wonder why there's a
question of child survival.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy and other experts say that too much violent behavior is
excused in the name of culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health
Coalition and a former Ford Foundation representative in
Bangladesh, said the cloak of culture and religion enables many
societies to evade the issue of the misuse of unrestricted male
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, female genital mutilation came to
public consciousness and there was a sense of horror about it,''
Germain said. ``This year's topic seems to be honor crimes, and the
tendency to blame them on a particular religion, namely Islam. This
is not a religious phenomenon. It has to do with male dominance,
patriarchy and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinar Ilkkaracan, the founder of the Turkish organization Women
for Women's Rights, said in an interview here that sometimes the
West is too simplistic in holding religion responsible for women's
problems in Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ilkkaracan said many Muslim women consider it ultimately
unhelpful to hold religion responsible where a crime like ``honor
killing'' is involved.
</P>
<P>
   These deaths are condoned in Jordan, Palestinian areas, Lebanon
and eastern Turkey more often for traditional cultural reasons,
these women say, and to blame Islam invites a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Ilkkaracan, who has studied and campaigned against the high
level of these killings among rural tribal societies in eastern
Turkey, said she has had to tone down her work recently because it
was being portrayed by outsiders as an Islamic issue.
</P>
<P>
   She argues, in fact, that culturally sanctioned violence against
women is a Mediterranean phenomenon, and that even in Spain and
Portugal, it was unofficially condoned until those two countries
joined the European Union. The machismo of Latin America, she
contends, has its roots in the Iberian peninsula.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, Equality Now, which aids women's groups around the
world, is involved in a drive to lobby governments to re-examine
and rewrite or repeal laws that discriminate against women.
Equality Now publishes a booklet that quotes from the relevant laws
and lists the address of the head of state or government to promote
a letter-writing campaign to change discriminatory laws. The United
States, where citizenship laws can discriminate, is not exempt from
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Widyono, codirector of the group, says that women are
increasingly focusing on the international agreements and covenants
on human rights that governments have signed and then ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments made commitments in Beijing,'' she said. ``They
made them at the population conference in Cairo. They make them
over and over again. We are calling for accountability. The message
now is: sign a document and be accountable.''

 &HT;    Upscale touches create cook-friendly Atlanta interior _ and
you're invited
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 9.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackie Cottrill's kitchen may look like it's straight out of a
decorating magazine, but, being an avid cook, she insists it's used
every day.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is in her own design. ``A kitchen is a necessity, but
I didn't want mine to look like one,'' the Atlantan said. ``I
wanted it to look like a room with nice furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabinetry she chose not only hides her appliances but was
designed with varying depths, heights and surface materials to
avoid a static line around the room. And by nixing wall cabinets in
favor of floor ones, Cottrill further enhanced the idea of a
decorated room.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is definitely high-end, yet it's jammed with
cost-saving ideas. That makes it one highlight on the Tour of
Kitchens on March 18 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrill knew exactly what she wanted in a kitchen when she and
her husband, Richard, built their Atlanta home last year. After
all, it was their 18th house in 25 years, and she has designed or
decorated every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The couple not only love to cook but to entertain _ not big
formal parties but casual dinners for small groups. For that
reason, Cottrill, aware that guests always end up in the kitchen,
wanted hers to put on its best face.
</P>
<P>
   French doors separate the kitchen from adjoining rooms, and two
short islands, instead of one long one, make the room less
predictable. They are working islands. But at the end of one is an
eating area, designated by a pair of rattan bar chairs on either
side, not your typical row of stools.
</P>
<P>
   The neoclassical French design began with a couple of monkey
chandeliers Cottrill found in an antique store. She painted the
monkeys' blue coats in a leopard pattern, adding tones of black and
beige that inspired the room's color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley McFarlane of Kitchensmith of Atlanta designed the
cabinetry Cottrill wanted, warm Heritage pieces with an aged maple
finish that contrasts with countertops mixing matte black enamel
and limestone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of banking the cabinets in a uniform row, the are
staggered in different depths to make them look like furniture.
``Things don't have to be on the same plane all around a room,''
Cottrill said.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of wooden, nickel and black-accented hardware also
makes the cabinets look like fine individual pieces. The metal
accents yet another surface, the appliances' stainless steel _ a
feature that helped the kitchen recently win a regional Sub Zero
design award.
</P>
<P>
   On one end of the room is an electric stove with gas cooktop,
above which Cottrill used mosaic tile to create a backsplash with a
fish design.
</P>
<P>
   On the other is a wall oven surrounded by cabinetry that houses
a hidden TV above it and art and other collectibles on glass-front
shelves on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Although at $150,000 the kitchen was pricey, Cottrill put the
money into features that make a difference, such as a few
lattice-front cabinets in the butler's pantry _ the area through
which guests pass on their way to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's somethng you want to do and it's too expensive,
just use it as an accent,'' she said. ``That makes more of a
statement anyway than if you used a lot of one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   COTTRILL'S COST SAVERS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When you can't afford custom cabinets, buy stock cabinets and
arrange them in varying depths to create the look of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a less expensive door or drawer style on cabinets and
use the savings to upgrade the cabinets with the finish or design
you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dress up cabinetry by adding accents, such as stair ballusters
to the end of islands or a mix of interesting hardware on doors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use granite tiles on countertops to give the look of more
expensive solid granite.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose inexpensive shelving for less visible areas, such as
butler's pantries, instead of kitchen cabinetry.
</P>

 &HT;    Georgia guides head down roads less traveled
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture it: A busload of Dutch tourists disembarking at Andrew's
Oyster Bar in Bainbridge to slurp the house special _ swamp gravy.
Or how about a band of beret-wearing bohemians oohing and aahing
over folk art at the Frogbottom Grist Mill in Hazelhurst? Or a
gaggle of big-city bon vivants gossiping over cocktails in the
lobby of the Windsor Hotel in Americus?
</P>
<P>
   OK, stop laughing. True, these off-the-beaten-path Georgia sites
may not be major tourist meccas yet. But recent efforts to showcase
the state as a whole _ including two new travel guides and a state
government push to make rural areas more peachy to tourists _ may
mean more vacationers heading down Georgia roads less traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Call up Amazon.com on the Web, and you'll find plenty of travel
guides on Atlanta, Savannah and the mountains, but guides to
getting around Vidalia, Fitzgerald and Brunswick have been mighty
rare. But two first-edition guides _ ``Hidden Georgia'' from
Ulysses Press and ``Compass American Guides: Georgia'' from Fodor's
_ join a handful of others, including Moon Travel's comprehensive
``Georgia Handbook,'' in its third edition, in exploring the entire
state.
</P>
<P>
   The books arrive in the wake of Georgia's post-Olympic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at tourism numbers for destinations across the
country, and Georgia's numbers are very strong,'' says Ulysses'
marketing manager Bryce Willett. The publishing company was
impressed by the fact that visitors kept coming after the Olympics
were over: The Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism
reports the state racked up $18.19 billion in tourist dollars in
1998, the latest year for which there are figures. That's up about
21 percent from 1996, the year of the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fodor's publisher Kris Klieman thinks we can also thank a
certain best seller. ``Interest in Southern culture has grown in
part because of `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''' she
says. ``Think about it _ that book was published all around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``the Book,'' as Savannahians call it, the two new travel
guides burrow beneath Georgia's smiling surface to find its
eclectic, eccentric soul. ``Hidden Georgia,'' published in
February, highlights obscure attractions, from Jack Wingate's
Lunker Lodge in Bainbridge to the gator-rich Colemans Lake Resort
near Midville.
</P>
<P>
   Author Marty Olmstead, a Savannah native, spent months exploring
the state and found it ``satisfyingly quirky.'' She raves about
stops such as the Frogbottom Grist Mill, where visitors can buy a
batch of homemade cane syrup, peruse local folk art and perhaps
encounter some indigenous fauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner killed a snake while we were there!'' Olmstead says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlantan John T. Edge found himself having to downshift a
bit while doing research for ``Compass American Guides: Georgia,''
published in December. ``People talk about the pace of life being
slower in South Georgia, and I really did feel that. I could feel
my grip on the steering wheel loosen as I drove South.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge, who was born in Clinton and lives in Oxford, Miss., took a
shine to recently rejuvenated Augusta. ``The renaissance of the
downtown area is really wonderful. Broad Street has all these great
little restaurants and shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorites: the Soul Bar, a watering hole with a James
Brown theme, and Luigi's, an Italian eatery that boasts a plethora
of Masters memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The evenhanded approach that both guides take to covering
Georgia should please officials who are trying to give the state's
rural areas a boost. Last month, the Georgia Senate voted to
approve a proposal by Gov. Roy Barnes to create the OneGeorgia
Authority, which will promote business in the state's rural
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-the-way attractions are a top priority at the Georgia
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, which is mounting a
promotional campaign focusing heavily on ecotourism adventures in
the Okefenokee Swamp and coastal areas. There are also plans to
have a virtual tour of Georgia, including Civil War trails in every
county in the state, online by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to get people interested in places other
than the big cities,'' says spokeswoman Heather Potts.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's Oyster Bar better start cooking up more of that swamp
gravy _ a tasty stew made from fried fish leavings, by the way.

 &HT;    Know what's afoot with surfaces for the kitchen
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 9.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you walk in the kitchen, take a good look at your
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Do spills dot your vinyl like a trail of blood in a scene from a
suspense thriller?
</P>
<P>
   Does your tile show more skids than the Downtown Connector?
</P>
<P>
   Are your hardwoods so scratched by Rover that they've formed a
new pattern?
</P>
<P>
   Could be time to pamper your floor _ or to simply buy a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Just be prepared. The array of options in materials, designs and
finishes may floor you. Competing with hardwoods and stone are
laminates, vinyls and ceramics designed to resemble those natural
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it all goes way beyond the superficial appearance.
Choosing a flooring is all about lifestyle,'' said Steve Cambas,
assistant manager of Expo Design Center in Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a kitchen floor has come a long way from the old days
of rolling out a sheet of Congoleum. Costs alone can be major _
especially when you consider that surface materials are just one
expense in furnishing a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you can drop $100,000 on a kitchen just like that,''
Cambas said. ``A few years ago, that was a house.''
</P>
<P>
   These days consumers are far more savvy about products than they
were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so value conscious _ not so much interested in what
the flooring costs per square foot but in knowing it will last for
a long, long time,'' said Jere Bowden of Rutt, a kitchen design
firm in Atlanta. ``They're investing in something that's an
integral part of their home, something that's attached and won't
have to be replaced like other surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a floor for the room where family and friends most
often congregate, consider aesthetics, durability, comfort and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Then factor in your lifestyle. ``We always ask people, `Do you
have children? Do you have pets?''' said Paulette Rewis of Just
Floors, an Atlanta flooring company. ``If they don't, they have a
lot less to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they cook and entertain often, that's also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   It almost becomes a sensory thing, Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the whole room, with its ceiling
treatment, the sound the floor creates and how loud it will be when
the whole family's in the room or when the dishwasher's running,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the visual flow of floor materials from room to
room, and how the kitchen surface feels to stand on for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is people want something that is unique to them
in their home, and with large areas of floor, pattern is
important,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   In high-end kitchens, many people are opting for floors that
combine natural stone and wood, she said. They're choosing woods
such as cherry, hickory and mesquite in 12-inch widths, often using
``reclaimed'' lumber salvaged from old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford the real thing, take heart: Man-made
materials, such as vinyls and laminates, are supplying the look for
less cost.
</P>
<P>
   So which floor's for you? Here are some pointers from flooring
experts about each of the five major groups:
</P>
<P>
   VINYL
</P>
<P>
   The look: Vinyl has advanced tremendously in recent years.
Although sheet vinyl remains the backbone of kitchens, vinyl tiles
provide versatility when it comes to creating different looks that
use wood, stone or other natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   One brand, Amtico, can be mixed and matched to include borders,
medallions and other details because it's sold in rectangles,
strips and other shapes. ``You can get the 3-D effect of slate, add
a strip to look like the grout lines of ceramic tile, put borders
around a room. It's custom all the way,'' Cambas said.
</P>
<P>
   The strength: All vinyl is extremely durable, but one advantage
of vinyl tile is that if damage occurs, you need only replace a
square or two, as opposed to removing a section of sheet vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   The feel: Vinyl by far is the softest of kitchen surfaces, so it
is a natural choice for diehard cooks.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup: It's also among the easiest to clean, though
manufacturers sell their own products for maintaining the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: Sheet vinyl ranges from $9 to $60 per square yard.
Vinyl tiles start at about $3 per square foot and can go up to $15
per square foot installed. ``Tiles generally cost about twice as
much as sheet vinyl installed, but dollar for dollar with tile
you're paying only for what you use, not for the waste of the
sheet,'' Cambas said.
</P>
<P>
   HARDWOOD
</P>
<P>
   The look: Wood has become extremely popular in kitchens for two
reasons: Homeowners want to blend the room with great rooms that
contain hardwoods and are increasingly drawn to natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   The strength: Hardwoods are a practical choice for kitchens
because manufacturers are using aluminum oxides to create harder
finishes. ``We have three dogs, and hardwoods have been no problem
in our own kitchen,'' Rewis said. ``But nothing is impervious to
living.''
</P>
<P>
   The key is the wood's thickness and polyurethane finish. ``If
you drop a pot, you could get a dent, and with heavy traffic it
will scuff,'' Cambas said. ``But the floor itself isn't what takes
the abuse _ it's the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical 3/4-inch-thick flooring contains three to seven
layers of wood, and the top should be at least 1/8 inch. That's so
the floor can be lightly buffed after losing its luster, typically
in seven to 10 years, Cambas said.
</P>
<P>
   The feel: Wood is middle of the road _ softer than stone or
ceramic tile, harder than vinyl and laminate.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup: Easy. Grain hides spills and some scuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: Prefinished wood sells for about $3 to $10 per square
foot, or about $10 to $15 per square foot installed.
</P>
<P>
   LAMINATE
</P>
<P>
   The look: Commonly called by the trade name Formica, laminate is
a hard synthetic material affixed to a layer of wood or
particleboard. One hot seller is Pergo, which provides the look of
hardwood or stone but at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   The strength: The material is extremely durable, Cambas said,
but proper installation is crucial. It's sold in 4-foot-by-7
1/2-inch planks laid tongue-and-groove in order to appear solid.
Joints must be properly glued to prevent moisture penetration and
buckling. If a section is damaged, the whole surface usually must
be replaced, Cambas said, unlike vinyl tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The feel: A real softie.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup: Like hardwoods, the finish hides a lot, and
laminate cleaning products are available.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: It starts at about $4 per square foot, or $7 to $10
per square foot installed.
</P>
<P>
   CERAMIC TILE
</P>
<P>
   The look: Natural stone is the craze, but at about one-third the
cost, ceramic tile can provide a similar look. Large tiles _
18-by-18s and 12-by-12s _ are more popular than smaller ones. In
addition to smooth glazed tiles, there are ones that simulate
stone. ``There are so many innovations in ceramics these days that
you can even get fossil-looking images in the tiles,'' Cambas said.
A variety of grout colors also provides different looks.
</P>
<P>
   The strength: In kitchens and baths, ceramic is more practical
than stone because advances in fired-on finishes have made ceramic
inpenetrable. And while chipping does occur, the grout makes tile
more forgiving of wear and tear than stone.
</P>
<P>
   The feel: A hard surface.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup: Damp mopping is best. (Make sure grout is sealed to
prevent stains.)
</P>
<P>
   The cost: At $2 to $7 per square foot, it's worth attempting by
the do-it-yourselfer; $10 to $20 per square foot installed.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL STONE
</P>
<P>
   The look: Natural materials have never been hotter, and
manufacturers are dressing up stone tiles with borders and accents
so homeowners can customize their designs. Any stone _ travertine,
granite, porcelain, Jerusalem stone _ is suitable for kitchens
except marble, Cambas said, because it's so porous.
</P>
<P>
   The strength: Because most prefer to abut the stones rather than
grout them, proper installation (over a level concrete surface) is
critical. A move as minor as dragging a bar stool across the floor
can chip the stone if its surface isn't level.
</P>
<P>
   The feel: Tough on the feet for extended periods.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup: Easy. Special products also available.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $15 to $25 per square foot installed.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOOK HARDWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Gigliotti: My dream kitchen will have it.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Niyomkul: We have this at home. I like the naturalness.
</P>
<P>
   LAMINATE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Pretty good look, though not as pretty as hardwoods.
</P>
<P>
   NN: It doesn't look finished enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   VINYL TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Lots of nice new looks, but I'd use a top-quality vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Looks clean and like it would last a long time.
</P>
<P>
   CERAMIC TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: A very natural look with certain kinds of tile.
</P>
<P>
   NN: It looks cheap. I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL STONE (below)
</P>
<P>
   LG: I love this look.
</P>
<P>
   NN: This look is beautiful, just great.
</P>
<P>
   THE FEEL HARDWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Gigliotti: Comfort factor is good for extended periods of
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Niyomkul: It's even comfortable to bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   LAMINATE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Feels like it has rubber in it. Probably good for standing.
</P>
<P>
   NN: A lot softer than real wood.
</P>
<P>
   VINYL TILE (left)
</P>
<P>
   LG: Feels very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   NN: It's soft. I'd love it.
</P>
<P>
   CERAMIC TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Too hard on legs and heels _ bad for varicose veins.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Not comfortable, especially with the grout.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL STONE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Probably not too comfy for a long time on the feet.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Fine, if not on your feet for very long.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRENGTH HARDWOOD (above)
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Gigliotti: Strong, but put felt under chair legs because
it will scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Niyomkul: No problem if you drop things.
</P>
<P>
   LAMINATE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Probably scratch resistant.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Texture can cover a lot of marks, dents.
</P>
<P>
   VINYL TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Wouldn't worry. You can abuse this.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Very durable. I'd never worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   CERAMIC TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: I worry about chipping and cracking.
</P>
<P>
   NN: This, I'd worry about.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL STONE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Strong. Natural flaws would mask scars.
</P>
<P>
   NN: I'd worry about chipping.
</P>
<P>
   HARDWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Gigliotti: Cleanup is so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Niyomkul: I've got three dogs, and it's no problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   LAMINATE (above)
</P>
<P>
   LG: A no-brainer. Scuff marks come off easily.
</P>
<P>
   NN: This looks easy to take care of.
</P>
<P>
   VINYL TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: This wouldn't show a lot of stains.
</P>
<P>
   NN: An easy job _ and it's not slippery.
</P>
<P>
   CERAMIC TILE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Tile's OK, but grout is a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Grout makes cleanup the worst. Worry about wine spills.
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL STONE
</P>
<P>
   LG: Only if I had a maid _ and paid her well.
</P>
<P>
   NN: Texture collects dust, dirt. Cleanup seems difficult.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional warmth will reach its peak Wednesday from the Ohio
Valley to the interior Middle Atlantic States. Plentiful sunshine
will boost afternoon temperatures to record-setting levels from the
middle 70s to lower 80s across these regions. Farther to the north
and east, the flow of wind around expanding high pressure will draw
cooler ocean air and patchy clouds into New England and parts of
Middle Atlantic Coast keeping temperatures 15 to 30 degrees cooler
than areas to the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous storm will produce a band of rain from central
Dakotas to the western Great Lakes. The windswept rain will change
to wet snow across the northern and western Dakotas as colder air
is drawn into the system. The rain and snow will end overnight as
wintry air envelops the region. Meanwhile, broken bands of showers
and potent thunderstorms will develop Wednesday afternoon as an
advancing cool, dry air mass lifts the unusually warm air over the
northern and central Mississippi Valleys. Strong winds shifting
with altitude will impart rotation to some of the storms
heightening the risk of isolated tornadoes. Farther west, a surge
of dry air will promote sunny skies over Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will persist in the West. Intermittent snow
will occur near the east slopes of the northern Rockies as moist
winds ascend the sloping terrain. The latest in a series of Pacific
fronts will produce showery rain from central California to the
Pacific Northwest Coast. Mountain snow and valley showers will
develop in Nevada and western Utah.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: When It Rains, It Pours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It does not rain very often in the desert, but when it does, it
often rains hard. From Saturday through Tuesday afternoon, 2.77
inches of rain fell in Phoenix as a series of potent storms passed
through the Southwest. This total produced over one-third of the
typical yearly rainfall of 7.66 inches in Phoenix. On average, when
it rains in Phoenix, about 0.2 inches falls, which is nearly 3
percent of the normal annual rainfall. By comparison, a typical
rainstorm in New York City produces 0.4 inches, or less than one
percent of the normal rainfall for a year.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Today is Super Tuesday in the United States of
America. The only accurate part of that description is that it is
indeed a Tuesday. ``Tiresome waste of money Tuesday'' might be a
better name, or ``Let's bore everyone to tears Tuesday,'' because
it is the day when American democracy reaches its inane anticlimax.
Call me a skeptic, but it cannot be a good thing that the leader of
the free world is chosen on the basis of who has the most

   SIMI VALLEY, CALIF. _ If the Republicans want to win back the
White House in November, they are going to have to field a
candidate with at least some of Ronald Reagan's crossover appeal to
Democrats and independents, as well as some of the ideological zeal
that galvanized the Gipper's closest followers. So which of the two
GOP candidates best fits the bill? A consensus among Reagan
devotees ambling through his presidential library this week
presents an ominous sign for the party's chances: neither one. &QL;

These contraptions are nothing more mysterious than voting
machines. Beloved for their creakiness and eccentric design, they
have for decades done their bit for American democracy. When
ballots are needed, out they roll. But not for much longer... On

the voting Wurlitzer to voting in cyberspace. &QL;

it is the day when American democracy reaches its inane anticlimax.

White House in November, they are going to have to field a
candidate with at least some of Ronald Reagan's crossover appeal to
Democrats and independents, as well as some of the ideological zeal
that galvanized the Gipper's closest followers. So which of the two

devotees ambling through his presidential library this week
presents an ominous sign for the party's chances: neither one. &QL;

   Getting around Europe is better than ever. This year Denmark and
Sweden will open a 10-mile Oresund crossing between Copenhagen and
Malmo on July 1, completing new rail and auto connections between
the Scandinavian peninsula and the bulk of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's high-speed ICE rail station is open at Frankfurt
Airport. Norway will begin operating high-speed trains from Oslo to
Stockholm and from Oslo to Bergen and Stavanger this year; a new
4.2-mile auto tunnel is open to the island of Mageroya and North
Cape. Athens' new subway lines began operating in late January and
work continues on a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   Europe remains the fastest-growing destination for Americans who
cruise, and these include many making their first trip to Europe.
Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Aegean welcome
new ships this year. River cruises on the Rhine, Danube, Elbe, and
Rhone remain very popular, as do barge cruises through the canals
of France, England, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise passengers fly to Europe to board ships and usually
can choose from a variety of pre- and post-cruise land packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Elizabeth II will again offer regular trans-Atlantic
service and gives passengers a choice of flying one way and sailing
(six days) the other. Some sailings will be from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Europe designates one city to be its Cultural
Capital. But this year, the 15-nation European Union is designating
nine cities as Cultural Capitals for 2000. It is both the first
time more than one city and cities beyond the EU have been named.
They are:
</P>
<P>
   --Avignon, France: famous for its Mozart-loving summer festival.
In April, an exhibition called ``Beauty'' will be at the Palace of
the Popes.
</P>
<P>
   --Bologna, Italy: among Europe's oldest university cities and
famous for its food. A ``Masters at the End of the Millennium''
dance festival will be held yearlong.
</P>
<P>
   --Brussels: capital of Belgium and the EU, and rich in art and
cuisine. A ``Grand Carrousel'' equestrian spectacle will be in
June; Grand'Place will be carpeted in flowers in August.
</P>
<P>
   --Helsinki, Finland: leader in design, architecture, and music.
Culinary concerts will be held throughout the summer, and designer
shows will be held throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Santiago de Compostela: city of Spain's patron saint and a
historic pilgrimage site. Exhibitions include ``Faces of Earth''
and ``Faces of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-ECU cities participating are:
</P>
<P>
   --Bergen: gateway to Norway's fiord country. An International
Dance Festival will be held this month, and the Bergen Music
Festival in May.
</P>
<P>
   --Krakow: city of Polish kings and bishops. Avant-Garde Theater
will take place in March; ``Ballet Spring'' and Wawel Castle
exhibit in May.
</P>
<P>
   --Reykjavik: marking the 1,000th anniversary of Iceland's
Christianization and celebrating artists of every description.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not enough, consider too that Cyprus will host the
Miss Universe pageant May 12-13; European Cup finals are June
10-July 12 in Belgium and Holland; the Tall Ships will race from
Britain to Italy, Spain, and across the Atlantic from April to May,
and in the Baltic, July to August.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely no year to miss Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission offers a number of ways to save
on a trip to Europe:
</P>
<P>
   The commission suggests planning ahead and using a knowledgeable
travel agent to help find the best deals on air fares,
accommodations, and packages.
</P>
<P>
   Internet research is helpful, the ETC says, but agents speed the
shopping process with their access to reservation systems and
industry contacts, and can quickly explain the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Buy as much of the trip as possible before leaving the United
States. Consider vacation packages, which can save time and money,
and which offer a great variety of destinations. Packages range
from basic fly-drive-hotel combinations for independent travelers
to fully escorted group tours to cruises.
</P>
<P>
   --Stop at a city's tourist offices for the latest information on
events, discounts, and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   --Use public transportation. Subways and buses are generally
clean, safe, and reliable. Paris, London, Berlin, Munich, Vienna,
Budapest, Lisbon, Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, and other cities offer
discount travel cards that also often include admission to museums
and other attractions as well as discounts for dining and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   --Take trains between cities: Rail Europe offers many varieties
of the 17-country Eurailpass, as well as five-country Europasses,
regional passes, and national passes (including BritRail passes).
These can all provide savings. Call 1-800-324-RAIL. Rail Europe
also takes reservations for high-speed premier trains, including
the Eurostar trains through the Channel Tunnel. Call 800-EUROSTAR.
</P>
<P>
   --Car rentals are always less costly if reserved in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider traveling beyond major capitals where prices are
always lower.
</P>
<P>
   --Use charge cards instead of cash whenever possible to obtain
good exchange rates (be aware, however, that some cards are now
charging a 2 to 3 percent surcharge on purchase overseas). Also use
automatic teller machines for cash; they can be found almost
everywhere. Before leaving home, check with your issuer to ensure
that your PIN will work in Europe (most machines only accept
four-digit numbers). When exchanging dollars and traveler's checks
go to banks or exchange bureaus rather than hotels.
</P>
<P>
   --When calling home, use a service such as the AT&AMP;T Direct
Service in Europe. There is a local AT&AMP;T access number for
virtually every country in Europe. Also beware of hotel surcharges
to call home, even with the AT&AMP;T service. Check with the hotel as
to its telephone policy.
</P>
<P>
   --Eat where the locals eat, and look for fixed-price tourist
menus when dining out.
</P>
<P>
   -- Look for VAT (Value Added Tax) forms when shopping. Foreign
visitors can usually get refunds on VAT, which can run as high as
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: The euro came into effect in 1999. But, although it is
legal tender in 11 European Union nations, local currency _ francs,
marks, lira, etc. _ will continue to be used for all paper money
transactions until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission has annually produced an
informative booklet on travel overseas. This year, however, this
information is available only on the Internet at
www.visitEurope.com.

   JERUSALEM _ In the latest of a series of scandals involving top
Israeli officials, Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
announced on Tuesday that he was taking a leave of absence after
police began investigating a complaint that he had sexually
assaulted a woman who works in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, 55, a member of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security
cabinet and the leader of the Center Party, emphatically denied the
woman's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened,'' he said in remarks broadcast live on
radio and television. ``I say it wholeheartedly: it never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a former defense minister and candidate for prime
minister, said that the acts attributed to him ``contradict my
moral universe, my personal values, everything I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have decided to take a leave of absence so that
the police can carry out a quiet and effective investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint to the police, the woman, whose name was not
disclosed, said that Mordechai had assaulted her in his Tel Aviv
office on February 25. Television reports said that in a detailed
account supported by a lie-detector test, the 23-year-old woman
accused Mordechai of touching her and forcing her down on a couch
before backing off when she burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said that the complaint received on Monday
was of ``an indecent act and sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation emerged a day before International Women's Day,
which was marked on Tuesday in a special session of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the legislators, Barak urged women ``not to be afraid
to complain and to report any harm to them, regardless of who the
assailant is.'' He added that ``there must be no leniency
whatsoever'' toward such assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later to reporters, Barak said that he respected
Mordechai's decision to take a leave of absence and expected it to
clear the way for a speedy investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a former army general, has been through public trials
before. In 1984, the Shin Bet security service tried to frame him
for the killing of two Palestinian bus hijackers who had been
beaten to death by its agents.
</P>
<P>
   On television on Tuesday night, Mordechai said that he and his
family were going through ``difficult days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person wakes up in the morning and finds his reality turned
upside down,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigation of Mordechai is the latest of a series of
high-level scandals that have emerged here in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Barak's election campaign are under investigation
for suspected illegal fund-raising activities. President Ezer
Weizman is being investigated for receiving large and undisclosed
sums of money from a French-born businessman. And former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been questioned by police on
suspicion of failing to return gifts he had received while in
office.

 &HT;    OFFICIALS URGE CAUTION IN CONSIDERING RAILROAD MEGA-MERGER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several witnesses warned the Surface Transportation
Board on Tuesday that allowing new mergers of railroad companies
would lead to less competition and poorer customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day hearing, which began Tuesday, is board's first
comprehensive review of rail consolidation. It was triggered by the
announcement that Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and Canadian
National Railway Co. plan to merge. If approved, the merger would
form North America's largest railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the board that recent railroad mergers, which
have left only a handful of lines operating in North America, have
caused rail car shortages and shipping delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger, if approved, will lead to other mergers, and the
last thing the industry needs is concentration,'' said Sen. Byron
L. Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, an assistant agriculture secretary, described service
troubles arising from past mergers that he said caused farmers to
lose money. Citing what he called ``merger fatigue,'' Dunn said
there are serious concerns about whether further consolidation
should take place.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of railroad customers, the Alliance for Rail
Competition, said that in some regions ``service has been so bad
that customers have been forced to shift production to other
regions,'' said spokesman Diane Duff.
</P>
<P>
   Even the board's chairman, Linda Morgan, noted widespread
feelings that it's time to take a ``breather'' on mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the two railroads said the merger is necessary
because the industry is suffering from a lack of growth. ``Truckers
are beating us,'' said Canadian National Railway Co. CEO Paul
Tellier.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers can contribute positively to the railroad industry and
have done so in the past, said Chairman Robert Krebs of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. He said the number of carriers is less
important than the quality of the carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction is not an ego trip,'' Tellier said. ``I don't
dream of being the CEO of the largest railroad company. We are
doing this to serve customers better.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the companies are expected to file a merger
application by March 20. They are looking to form a railroad system
with 50,000 miles of track that would generate about $12.5 billion
in revenue a year.
</P>
<P>
   This week's hearings are not expected to resolve the question of
whether the new merger should be allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the board is to hear from more customers and
rivals of the proposed merged railroad, as well as labor leaders
and financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 160 witnesses that are expected to testify, more than
half are customers such as General Motors Corp., duPont Co. and the
Department of Defense, all of which are expected to tell of
merger-related delays.

   WASHINGTON _ Several witnesses warned the Surface Transportation

IN PUERTO RICO, HOME COOKING IS REBORN AS NUEVA COCINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Walking into the Casita Blanca
restaurant is like walking into a country home, one with ceiling
fans, bare cement floors and live poultry _ in this case a turkey
named Gabino and a rooster known as Pancho _ roaming the indoor
patio.
</P>
<P>
   In this small restaurant in the working-class neighborhood of
Villa Palmeras, Jesus Perez has created something that is simple
yet rare: a place where you can experience the full scope of Puerto
Rican cuisine, including the traditional dishes that are usually
not found outside a home, even here on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Perez cooks the recipes he learned from his mother, Aurora Ruiz,
dishes like pastelon, a sweet plantain pie with layers of string
beans and ground beef that is baked like lasagna, and majarete, a
creamy porridge made with rice meal, coconut milk and cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a poor house, in a slum, but every day we had a
banquet,'' Perez said. ``There was always an open pot simmering on
the stove for anyone who wanted to drop in to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   This is food that is complex in flavor, not spicy, never hot,
but well seasoned, full bodied and like cooking nowhere else, even
though the ingredients are similar to other cuisines of the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But the true character of Puerto Rico's cooking remains largely
a secret because it has been for the most part kept at home.
Serious restaurants serving Puerto Rican food are scarce in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the best _ if limited _ examples of Puerto Rican
food in American cities like New York is found in neighborhood
fondas, lunch-counter type places like La Fonda Boricua in East
Harlem (under a sign reading Gina y George, its former name), where
the food is served in big heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs explained this underrepresentation by noting that the
Puerto Rican clientele are hard to please because they often find
restaurant dishes lacking and expensive when compared with what is
served at the family table.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, some chefs said, the nature of the Puerto Rican
migration _ one of constant travel back and forth between Puerto
Rico and the mainland _ makes restaurants less vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A restaurant indicates nostalgia or not being able to go to
your country,'' said Alex Garcia, the executive chef of Calle Ocho,
a pan-Latin restaurant In Manhattan. ``And the reality is that even
though there are many Puerto Ricans here, Puerto Rico is very
accessible to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Puerto Ricans crave their food, they think beyond the
tostones and fritters, the rice and beans, the roast pork shoulder
and other staples commonly associated with their cuisine. Instead,
one might think of a serenata, a salad of dried codfish and boiled
root vegetables like yautia, name, malanga, green bananas and yuca,
in a peppery lime vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Or salmorejo de jueyes, sauteed crab meat with the intense taste
of the island's small native crabs, which are increasingly hard to
find as they lose their habitat to new development. Or pasteles,
the tamale-shaped packets made up of a paste of grated plantains,
pork, garbanzo beans, olives and raisins wrapped in plantain
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who was born in Cuba but spent part of his childhood in
Puerto Rico, found the restaurant business particularly difficult
on the island, where he closed a restaurant after only eight
months. ``How do I sell an empanada for $10 if they can make it
better or find it elsewhere for $2?'' Garcia asked.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few chefs who are taking Puerto Rican cuisine
into high-toned restaurants. At places like Pikayo in the Condado
tourist area of San Juan and Su Casa at the Hyatt Dorado Beach in
Dorado, a half-hour drive east of San Juan, chefs are
reinterpreting traditional recipes in the way so many other
pan-Latin chefs have in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   They offer fusion inventions like conch egg roll, sauteed foie
gras over candied plantains, and grilled veal chops served with
terrine of eggplants in tamarind sauce.
</P>
<P>
   This new Puerto Rican cooking, called nueva cocina criolla, is
not unlike the dishes found in Manhattan restaurants like Calle
Ocho and Cuba Libre in Chelsea, except that it emphasizes Puerto
Rican flavors. At Pikayo, for example, Wilo Benet, the chef and an
owner, serves sushi tuna on arroz pegao, the crispy layer of rice
scraped from the bottom of the cast-iron pot that some Puerto
Ricans fight over at the end of the meal. It's a surprising,
delicious combination.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of other Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries, Puerto
Rican cuisine has its roots in Spain and in influences that can be
traced to African slaves and the native Indians of the region. But
the food is different, island to island, and one key difference is
the mix and proportion of the herbs and spices in stews and rice
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cubans, for instance, are partial to cumin, and Dominicans to
oregano. In Puerto Rico, the indispensable ingredients are cilantro
and recao, a strong-smelling herb with long, spiky leaves found
there in backyards.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the cooking is the sofrito, a mixture of recao
and cilantro leaves, small sweet chili peppers, onions, green
peppers and garlic. Sauteed in corn or olive oil, it becomes the
foundation for most dishes, like chicken with rice, red beans and
asopao, a soupy rice stew made with chicken or shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   So vital is the sofrito in Puerto Rican kitchens that cooks _
using a blender to grind or, even better, mortar and pestle to
crush the ingredients _ make it in bulk and freeze it to have it
handy at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mix those ingredients up and it's like magic,'' Perez
said, bringing out a mortar whose aroma impregnated the air at his
restaurant like incense.
</P>
<P>
   The other defining seasoning is adobo, a blend of salt, oregano,
peppercorn and garlic, all crushed by mortar and pestle with olive
oil and vinegar. So powerful is this seasoning that when applied to
turkey it can make it taste like pork. In Puerto Rico, the term
pavochon _ from pavo (turkey) and lechon (pig) _ has been coined
for turkey seasoned and roasted like pig.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such intense flavors, Puerto Rican food is never spicy.
(Puerto Ricans who want a stinging experience sprinkle their dishes
with pique, a water-based hot sauce that is homemade but can also
be bought at stores and some restaurants.) If anything, there is a
tendency toward sweet and salty combinations that make heavy use of
ripe plantains and sweet vegetables like pumpkin and sweet potato.
</P>
<P>
   Nueva cocina criolla can be traced to Alfredo Ayala, an
industrial engineer who in 1979 decided to make a career out of his
cooking hobby. His first restaurant, Ali Oli, opened in 1981 in a
middle-class neighborhood in Carolina, next door to San Juan, with
a menu rich in Puerto Rican produce and ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who sold Ali Oli in 1988 and is now the chef and owner of
Su Casa, was heavily influenced by chefs in San Francisco, where he
lived during the rage over chefs like Alice Waters and Jeremiah
Tower and their emphasis on the French-style preparation of local
produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were discovering passion fruit and I'd say, I've eaten
passion fruit since childhood!'' Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, Ayala turned to homegrown ingredients for his
dishes _ things like squash, arugula, mango, pineapple and
swordfish caught off Puerto Rico's coast. While other restaurants
offered soup with canned asparagus or mushrooms, Ayala served
celery root soup. He started a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, however, dislikes the term ``new cuisine.'' ``What's new
about it?'' he said. ``What it has is an actualization of the
cuisine, but I'm not reinventing Puerto Rican cuisine. I'm using
very basic knowledge and combining it with ideas from outside
Puerto Rico, but I try to maintain the basic roots pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Even old standards like mofongo, a garlicky mound of mashed
plantains filled with chunks of pork, shellfish and other meats,
can rise to the occasion. At Pikayo, a mofongo with shrimp is $28.
Asked what made his mofongo worth nearly double what most others
charge, Benet answered: ``Five pieces of very large shrimp.''
</P>
<P>
   Benet, who worked as the chef for the governor of Puerto Rico
before opening Pikayo in 1990, heightens traditional dishes by
using the best ingredients possible. For his version of bistec
encebollado, an onion-smothered dish usually made with tenderized
top round, Benet uses beef tenderloin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I like to invent, but I also like to do the
classics really well,'' he said. ``My point of departure is
childhood _ what did your mother feed you?''
</P>
<P>
   In my case, some of the best Puerto Rican food I have had. This
year, as a millennium gift, I gave my family a calendar filled with
recipes I grew up with, the traditional dishes that no one had ever
bothered to write down.
</P>
<P>
   There is arroz con pollo de Dora (my mom, Dinorah E. Perez,
enhances the flavor by boiling the chicken separately, then using
the broth to cook the rice), and las costillitas con berenjena de
Mami Lucy, my 82-year-old aunt's country-style ribs with eggplant
fricassee.
</P>
<P>
   In Mami Lucy's creation, the meat is as tender as the eggplant.
My Titi Edda's arroz con gandules, or rice with pigeon peas, is so
fluffy and flavorful it can be eaten by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Professional chefs bemoan the fact that many Puerto Ricans, my
relatives included, have grown accustomed to using artificial
flavors and seasonings as shortcuts to speed up cooking time. But
some also note that the talent found in private kitchens is to
blame for the scarcity of Puerto Rican restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with the food,'' Ayala said. ``It has to
do with the mentality that I'd rather eat at home because my mom or
my grandmother makes the best beans.'' &QL;

   &UR;  &LR; So much ideological guff has been floated during the last 20
years about the kind of world we live in: ``a private enterprise
system,'' ``an opportunity society,'' ``market capitalism,'' and so
on _ all of it partly true.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who harbors the slightest doubt, however, that we live
more than ever in a ``mixed economy'' should have stopped by Boston
College Monday. There a parade of financial celebrities turned out
at the invitation of US Representative Edward Markey for a daylong
conference on The New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the economy was
growing too fast for its own good and the market went down,
anticipating further increases in short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Gerstner of IBM Corp. speculated on the impact of the
Internet on large firms. Arthur Levitt of the Securities and
Exchange Commission described the changing missions of his agency,
as did Frank Zarb of the National Association of Securities
Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs including CMGI's David Wetherell, Gururaj ``Desh''
Deshpande of Sycamore Networks, Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Asset
Management, and Kay Koplovitz of Working Woman Network participated
in panels.
</P>
<P>
   And opening the conference, Boston College president William P.
Leahy SJ underscored the politically charged theme that underlay it
when he spoke of ``the justice and fairness issues that have been
at the core of religious concern since the days of the prophets.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowed Markey to an audience of more than 1,000 people, most of
them BC graduates like him (class of 1968, law school 1972), it was
``one of the all-time all-star lineups ever assembled anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What brings Markey such drawing power? He's the ranking Democrat
on the House subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer
protection.
</P>
<P>
   And it is through the committee that virtually all legislation
concerning the Internet, communications satellites, and telephone
services and cable television must pass.
</P>
<P>
   Markey's district bristles with companies that manufacture the
next generation of switching equipment and software for the
Internet. Low rent and a ready-made work force are part of the
story about bustling I-495 _ but so is the direct access that a
factory in the district affords to the world's ultimate
standard-setting body, the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BC understands this nexus of markets and politics better than
most. Monday's meeting took place in the Silvio O. Conte Forum, a
basketball and hockey palace named for the former Western
Massachusetts representative. On the hill above sits the Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill Library. Like Conte, the late US House speaker was
a BC alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   An only-slightly-different ethic prevails at the Massacusetts
Institute of Technology, where the strictly personal is so frowned
upon that, until recently, the buildings were numbered instead of
named for great or generous men and women. Nevertheless, most of
MIT's growth has derived from federal spending on R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
   So when US Representative Michael Capuano recently found $600
million in ostensibly new money headed for the Department of Energy
in the Networking and Information Technology Research and
Development Act, he filed an amendment shifting half of it to the
National Science Foundation, where it would be doled out to
universities _ perhaps even MIT _ rather than government labs.
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, a letter from the Energy Department arrived
over the House fax claiming that the measure would close the
nation's largest unclassified computer facility at California's
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The amemdment sailed through on a
voice vote nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked about it; they never answered until it was too late,''
Capuano said. The funding may be restored. But what better way to
serve notice that the congressman who represents Harvard and MIT
now has a seat on the science committee?

<P>
   &UR; NBC Quits the Club &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NBC continued to go its own way in the broadcasting industry
Tuesday, announcing that it had quit the National Association of
Broadcasters, the Washington-based organization charged with
representing the industry's interests with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   NBC thus joins Fox in a move that illustrates how their
interests have diverged from those of other networks. Fox left the
association in June, but ABC and CBS have announced their
intentions to stay, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The crux is a decision by the group not to push for further
relaxation of rules in areas like station ownership and the
networks' relationship with their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cotton, general counsel for NBC, said Tuesday that the
network could no longer take part in an organization that was
sticking with ``archaic, anachronistic rules'' in a ``marketplace
that is turning upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC had sought backing for an effort to change rules that limit
the number of stations one company can own. One organization cannot
own television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the
country. NBC argued that the association had been extremely
aggressive in pushing to relax regulations that had limited station
ownership in radio but had held back in television.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the association, the NBC president, Bob Wright,
said the network had no alternative but to leave the organization
because of its ``continued unwillingness to embrace a
forward-looking strategy.'' He said the association treated
broadcasters as if they ``still lived in a world where Americans
gathered around their black-and-white televisions to watch Milton
Berle and `Bonanza.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fox quit the association for similar reasons. But many of the
corporate owners of television station groups _ which make up the
majority of the membership and dominate the association's board _
have opposed lifting the cap on station ownership. Dennis Wharton,
an association spokesman, said, ``Our board has told us they think
the 35 percent cap in appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks and other station owners have been on a collision
course in recent years, especially over the issue of the networks'
payments to stations that carry their shows. The networks have been
trying to end that practice, which goes back to the days of network
radio; stations have been fighting to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Stations fear that if the networks gain too much power it will
be easier for them to force their affiliates to hew to their
wishes. Station owners are also concerned about networks' having
the ability to buy more stations, fearing they might bid up the
prices of stations that come up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton said the 35 percent coverage limit was absurd because it
was applied geographically, not in terms of actual audience
reached. He said that NBC had calculated that, given the growth of
competition from cable and other outlets like satellite television,
its stations reached only about 6 percent of the national audience.
He compared that figure to individual cable companies, some of
which reach 20 percent of the national audience.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's departure means the loss of $400,000 in annual dues for
the association. Wharton said the organization was still strong,
though NBC's decision to abandon it ``certainly hurts us on a
perception level.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Those Strong `Walls' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HBO had its biggest Sunday night in three years on the strength
of ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' also its highest-rated original
movie in three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the other big part of the story was ``The Sopranos,'' which
proved that its popularity can even survive an unusual scheduling
move. Despite being moved up an hour to 8 p.m. on Sunday night, a
change that went unnoticed by many fans of the series, Sunday's
``Sopranos'' episode scored a lofty 13.8 rating in homes that
subscribe to HBO. That is among the higher ratings the series has
received.
</P>
<P>
   It was also enough to boost ``If These Walls Could Talk 2'' to
an 11.5 rating, the highest rating for any HBO movie since January
1997, when it ran a film called ``Dead Silent.'' (Each rating point
for HBO represents approximately 260,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   The score for the movie, while good, did not come close to the
rating for the original ``Walls,'' which played in 1996. That movie
got the highest rating for any movie ever on HBO, an 18.7. Of
course there was one difference: this time HBO was up against some
different programming on Sunday night at 9, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   That powerhouse game show proved impervious even to steamy sex
scenes starring Sharon Stone and Chloe Sevigny in separate
vignettes. Even in HBO homes ``Millionaire'' was the No. 1 show on
Sunday night at 9.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That's the News &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw has been the leading
network news broadcast for much of the last three years and
continued its dominance in the February sweeps, beating ABC and CBS
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for the evening news on both NBC and ABC stayed
relatively constant with their performances last February, but the
CBS news broadcast continued to show signs of falling off. For
February CBS' program was down 9 percent from a year ago in
household ratings and 12 percent in total viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC meanwhile was off only 3 percent in households and 2 percent
in total viewers. ABC was off just 1 percent in households and 2
percent in total viewers.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Dozens of people were injured in
shootings and grenade attacks in the divided town of Kosovska
Mitrovica on Tuesday, among them French peacekeepers and both
Albanian and Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a brawl quickly escalated into a number of
retaliatory attacks between the ethnic groups, catching the
peacekeepers in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The violence comes on the back of a whole month of serious
disturbances, which have caused at least nine deaths in the town,
and dashed hopes of the international community that the worst was
over.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 17 French soldiers were wounded, all from shrapnel
from hand grenades thrown in their midst, a spokesman for the
peacekeepers said. Television pictures showed some of them being
carried on stretchers, in scenes of burning cars and further
explosions. None of the soldiers were in serious danger, the
spokesman said, and only three were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 Serbian civilians and 5 Albanians were reported
injured, although figures were not precise, and even spokesmen from
KFOR, the Kosovo peacekeeping force, were giving out different
numbers. Several strong explosions were heard later in or around
three apartment buildings inhabited mostly by Albanians. It was not
clear if there were further injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With the violence, some 50 Albanians fled their homes in the
north, making their way to the Albanian district south of the
river, The Associated Press reported. One of them, Aida Kadriu,
said her uncle had been injured in a grenade blast, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800 Albanians live among the Serbs in the north of
the city but their lives are increasingly precarious. Most of the
violence of the last month has been centered in the north part.
Peacekeepers had only just persuaded some 40 Albanians to return to
their homes after an outburst of Serbian violence Feb. 3 that
killed eight Albanians and caused 1,000 more to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which is patrolled by over 1,000 troops, came under
curfew at 8 p.m. Tuesday night. Four suspects were arrested in
connection with the grenade attacks, the French military spokesman,
Lt. Matthieu Mabin, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out in the middle of the day in an Albanian
area that borders the Serbian-dominated sector of the city. An
argument broke out between a Serb and an Albanian, when a second
Albanian pulled a gun and shot the Serb, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An angry crowd of Serbs gathered and French troops moved in to
break up the confrontation, when Albanians suddenly lobbed several
grenades into the crowd. The French soldiers do not appear to have
been the target, but they bore much of the damage. Two cars began
to burn as troops carried away the wounded and reinforcements
arrived.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The area where most of the violence occurred Tuesday is known as
the Bosnian quarter and is especially volatile. Mostly inhabited by
Albanians, it was the scene of fierce fighting Feb. 13 when two
French soldiers and a number of Serbs were wounded, and an Albanian
gunman was shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians say they are under threat from the Serbs who want
to push them out from their homes on the northern bank of the River
Ibar. The Serbs say the Bosnian quarter is home to Albanian armed
extremists, who are seeking to push the Serbs out of Mitrovica
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The French troops, who have command of Mitrovica as part of
their northern sector, are trying to keep the two apart, but have
failed to calm the local communities. The Albanians complain that
Serbs are trying to attack them from behind the shadow of the
French troops. That may be an exaggeration, but television pictures
of Tuesday's violence showed Serb civilians milling around the
French troops, taking shelter behind armored vehicles, and
essentially sharing the same front line.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians say those throwing the grenades are aiming at Serbs
who are attacking them, but the more radical of the Albanians say
they now consider the French troops to be on the same side as the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, canceled a visit to
Mitrovica Tuesday, NATO officials said after the attacks. They did
not say if the violence was the reason.

BUILDING ON A NORTH CAROLINA BACKGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Luther Cochrane is chief executive of Bovis Lend Lease, a New
York-based construction and project manager owned by the Lend Lease

 By LUTHER COCHRANE with DEIDRE LEIPZIGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   I come from a town in North Carolina called Weldon. It had about
2,000 people when I was born and has about 2,000 today. Not much
else has changed there, either. Though I've lived in a lot of
places since, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool North Carolinian.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 12, with a little help from a lot of people, I worked
on a renovation project for the home of this lady in Weldon, using
ideas I'd seen in magazines. A builder actually used my ideas. The
lady paid me $200, and I won an honorable mention in a Good
Housekeeping contest. Then a friend of my mother's wanted to build
a house for the family who worked her farm. She asked me _ I think
mostly to humor my family _ to give her some design sketches. That
was built, too. So by the time I was 13{, I had two construction
projects under my belt.
</P>
<P>
   I was hooked. I wanted to be an architect. But when I was in
high school, I was a reasonably good football player. North
Carolina State University in Raleigh, which had a good architecture
school, didn't recruit me, though; they told me I wasn't a very
good football player. The University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, which had liberal arts, did, so I went there. Turns out
Raleigh was right: I wasn't very good at football, and I soon quit
playing.
</P>
<P>
   I finally got my undergraduate degree from Chapel Hill, then
decided I would study law because I wasn't ready to work yet.
</P>
<P>
   While scrambling for a summer clerkship, I met Buck Griffin, who
is one of the great influences of my life. He worked with an
Atlanta firm that did construction law. I liked this guy so much
that despite my intention to stay in North Carolina I accepted an
internship there. Then, I liked that Atlanta firm so much that I
accepted a job offer with them after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   One week on the job, McDevitt &AMP; Street Co., which evolved into
Bovis, became my first client. I was still wet behind the ears, but
because McDevitt was North Carolina-based, the firm sent me.
</P>
<P>
   When Buck and I started our own firm in 1980, McDevitt came with
us as a client. While I was outside counsel, McDevitt asked me to
sit on the board. Bob Street, who was the owner, named me his
successor _ you know, just to have one.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1989, Bob suddenly took ill. He had just run a marathon.
He said: ``Luke, I've got to go to the Mayo Clinic. How about
dropping everything to run the year-end executive meeting? I'll be
back in a week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   He died in early April of 1990, of Lou Gehrig's disease. What we
had both thought would never occur had occurred. I moved full time
to McDevitt.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neat things about my business is that you create
something tangible _ something that people enjoy. It makes you feel
good to do that _ though you remember, of course, here's a floor
slab that didn't go right, there's a building that came in four
months late.
</P>
<P>
   When my son, Robert, was around 2{, we drove past a big building
in Charlotte that my company had worked on. I said, ``Robert, did
you know that Daddy built this building?'' then amended that to,
``I didn't actually build it, I did the contract.'' I thought he
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while driving around with my wife, Robert pointed out the
building. ``Daddy built it all by himself,'' he said.

   The annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament starts today in
Stamford, Conn. When and where was the crossword puzzle invented? &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To get the point ACROSS, this week's featured wine should go
DOWN well with those who like a well-made chardonnay. It's also the
finest chardonnay I've ever had from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I tasted the wine ``blind'' and wrote down that it was obviously
from California and probably from the Russian River Valley, because
the 1998 Llano Estacado ``Cellar Select'' Chardonnay _ 4 1/2 stars
_ had excellent, spicy apple-pear fruit and just the right amount
of oakiness to complement the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a crackerjack effort. About $15.99. From Republic
Beverage.

SOUFFLES ARE EASIER THAN THEY LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the world of dining, no drama is more riveting
than the one surrounding the souffle. It starts building early in
the meal, when the souffle must be ordered: The anticipation is
sealed, a captive audience guaranteed. Then, when it is finally
ready, it is rushed through the dining room like a crying baby to
its mother, so that when it arrives at the table _ inflated,
determined and wobbly _ the reaction is inevitably the same: The
diner is silenced, in awe of the genius who concocted it.
</P>
<P>
   For the assumption is that to create cooking's most fragile and
temperamental dish takes immense skill, the finesse of a dancer,
the timing of a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why chefs have never let it die. Creme brulee may one
day retire, but the souffle will always persist. And though chefs
will never concede the point, it is not because the souffle takes
such talent, but because it is so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs know that souffles are forgiving. They know it's not
necessary to whisper while a souffle bakes and that opening the
oven door will not make a souffle fall. And they know that souffles
can be made ahead of time, assembled completely, then simply baked
to order. Generations of intimidated home cooks could have
triumphed with those three small tips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chefs have been changing the souffle, too, keeping it
up to date. The classic and often stodgy souffle _ made with pastry
cream or bechamel, with a sauce poured in at the table _ is being
replaced with souffles made without flour and ingredients so
flavorful that no sauce is needed at all. Le Cirque 2000's
chocolate souffle is flourless, yolkless and made a day ahead.
Lutece serves a grits souffle. At Cello, there is one so
concentrated with lime it makes you pucker.
</P>
<P>
   These are hardly disrespectful, though, for a souffle is
actually one of cooking's most frivolous pursuits. A souffle should
be playful. Think of it as nothing more than an omelet, and few
omelets are served without some kind of adornment. This past week,
I made many souffles and discovered that despite my efforts to
challenge the classic recipe with loose liquid bases and vigorous
folding, it is difficult to fail. And more than that, the
possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   Well, to a point. A souffle may be sweet or savory, flavored
with ingredients as varied as cardamom and cheese, but if it is not
aerated with egg whites, it is not a souffle. Some restaurants have
begun using the word souffle to describe almost anything. Many pass
off oozy chocolate cakes as souffle cakes. Every cake expands a
little in the oven, but that does not make a souffle. At Balthazar,
a ``lemon souffle cake'' is actually just a lemon tart. It is as
much a souffle as a chocolate chip cookie.
</P>
<P>
   So, to begin, it is helpful to understand just what a souffle
is. It is, essentially, a flavorful sauce suspended in whipped egg
whites and baked in the oven. As the souffle bakes, the heat causes
the air in the egg whites to expand, separating the base into a
fluffy custard, sealing in any aromas and bursting vertically out
of its baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes out of the oven and begins to cool, the air
contracts and the souffle deflates, which is why it must be eaten
quickly. If you let a souffle deflate, you will be left with an
omelet. (But one that will be much lighter than a typical omelet.
Any failed souffle can simply be turned out of its dish and served
without shame, like an unmolded custard.)
</P>
<P>
   A good souffle is rich with contradiction. It has a firm outer
shell, while inside it is impossibly light; it is supported by egg,
but its taste is not compromised by it; it defies gravity and yet
is fragile. And if it is correctly made, spoonfuls of rich, gauzy
foam and all of its contradictions will disappear on the palate.
Anyone who can create that experience is worthy of praise.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who can make an omelet and whip cream can make a
souffle.
</P>
<P>
   Classic souffles are made up of two parts: the base and the
whipped egg whites. The base is a kind of sauce, often thickened
with egg yolks. Many recipes call for about one egg per person. So
if you are making a souffle for four, you would use four to five
eggs, reserving the yolks for the base.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else that goes into the base has one of two purposes:
flavoring or thickening. This could mean, for a savory souffle,
making a bechamel sauce with flour, butter and milk and then adding
egg yolks to enrich it. Or aromatics could be used: sauteed garlic
and herbs, crab meat, cheese, even asparagus puree.
</P>
<P>
   Classically sweet souffles have a base of pastry cream. But
pastry cream is time-consuming. A more modern approach would be to
use creme anglaise, a simple sauce of milk, eggs and sugar, adding
pureed or whole fruit, melted chocolate or even something as simple
as almond extract for scent. Simpler still: Omit the yolks and use
a dense fruit puree or jam as a base.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the base, it needs to be highly flavored so that once
the egg whites are folded in, the flavor does not disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the egg whites is perhaps the most critical part.
Recipes often instruct you to add a little salt, lemon juice or
cream of tartar before whisking to help the egg whites form
smaller, tighter bubbles. I have found that all three work equally
well, though in a savory souffle I lean toward salt, which also
seasons the whites. With sweet souffles, it is helpful to add a
little powdered sugar at the beginning (about a tablespoon for
every four egg whites). This helps the whites form tight bonds and
for the finished souffles to rise evenly in tall, firm cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The whites should be whisked until they form peaks somewhere
between soft and stiff. If they are too soft, the whites tend not
to rise to their potential; too stiff, and they may begin to break
down.
</P>
<P>
   Once they are whisked, though, they are extremely durable.
Classic French cookbooks will tell you to fold the base and whites
together gently. But if the base and whites do not form a
homogeneous mixture, the souffle may rise unevenly and have pockets
of egg white. Using a rubber spatula, I fold mine vigorously,
turning the bowl as I fold the ingredients over again and again,
and have never had a souffle flop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are just a few details to know. Buttering
souffle molds is not the time to be shy about butter. Many classic
recipes say to butter the mold once, put it in the freezer and then
butter it again _ a great waste of time. Instead, use soft butter
and smear it on generously the first time, making sure to cover
every inch of the mold. Another method is to add a light dusting of
a dry ingredient to coat the butter, which gives the souffle a kind
of lattice to climb while baking. With sweet souffles, sugar is
often used, and with savory, bread crumbs or finely grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   If the coating is too thin or misses a spot, the souffle mixture
could latch onto that spot and leave you with a lopsided souffle.
</P>
<P>
   The mold should be refrigerated or frozen so that when the
souffle mixture is added, the butter does not slide down the sides.
And when filling the molds, the filling should be dropped in the
center of the mold and allowed to settle by itself. The filling
should be highest in the center and slope down to the sides of the
mold, not be smoothed over with a spatula as with a cake batter.
</P>
<P>
   When the souffle is in the oven, you want it to rise as quickly
as possible before the sides seal and stop expanding. One way to
help this is to place the baking rack on the bottom shelf of the
oven and to put a baking sheet on the rack while the oven heats.
When the souffle dish, cool from the freezer, begins to warm, the
souffle will expand without cooking through too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What puts off many home cooks is the assumption that souffles
are a last-minute affair. But almost any souffle can be made ahead.
Simply complete the recipe up to the point of baking, fill the
molds and cover them with plastic wrap, then refrigerate until a
few minutes before baking. If the egg whites have been whipped well
and the mixture combined thoroughly, it will hold for several
hours. The cool temperature helps firm up the ingredients, too.
</P>
<P>
   Le Cirque 2000 makes its chocolate souffles up to a day ahead,
refrigerates them and pops them in the oven when an order comes in.
Pascalou, a bistro on the Upper East Side, goes a step further.
Pascal Bonhomme, the chef, assembles both chocolate and cheese
souffles, and then freezes them. When one is ordered, he puts it in
a microwave oven for 40 seconds, then transfers it to the oven for
seven final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A great trick to know _ and to know when not to use. Though I
have made souffles up to a day ahead, I have found them to be at
their peak when baked within four hours. Uniform homogeneous
mixtures like chocolate, cheese and vanilla hold best. But ones
with ingredients like mushrooms or onions, which ``weep'' over
time, or looser mixtures like yolkless souffles, may not rise as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But even in those cases, the base can be made and the molds
prepared, so that all you have to do at the last minute is whisk
the egg whites. That's like whipping cream for an apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   Capsouto Freres in TriBeCa still makes souffles to order. One
reason Jacques Capsouto, the pastry chef, can do this is the
simplicity of his recipe. He keeps pastry cream around so that when
an order comes in, he need only add the flavoring ingredients and
whisk the egg whites. For his raspberry souffle, for instance, all
he does is swirl raspberry jam into the pastry cream, fold in the
whipped egg whites and then spoon the mixture into a prepared mold.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few days of experimenting, souffles streamed from my
kitchen with a kind of ease, a kind of liberty to wander from the
classic, and often with fewer ingredients than most cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with the Parmesan souffle found in so many restaurants, I
tried adding the gratings of a hard sheep's milk cheese to a plain
base. It was nutty and earthy and as complex as the cheese itself,
a perfect contrast to a souffle's light texture. Even better was a
goat cheese souffle, with lumps of the soft cheese dropped into a
plain souffle base. Each bite was different: Some were like eggy
custard, others had pockets of warm tangy goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   With that same thread of thought, I had another success. Rather
than using milk in the base I tried creme fraiche. It was the
lightest, most delicately flavored souffle you can imagine, and it
had just four ingredients: creme fraiche, butter, flour and eggs.
It inspired another idea: a souffle base made with buckwheat flour,
so that it is like a blini. When the souffle comes out of the oven,
break open the center and spoon in a little creme fraiche and
caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvisations are possible. At Cello, Laurent Tourandel,
the chef, serves a bitter almond chocolate souffle. An almond
souffle rises like a doughnut around a round chocolate disk inlaid
in the top. More pieces of molten chocolate are suspended within
the souffle. You could do the same with chopped nuts, sprinkling
some over the top just before baking.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches at the table are also a good idea. With a
mushroom souffle, into which I folded chopped sweated mushrooms, I
sprinkled on a few drops of truffle oil just before serving. The
heat of the souffle made the oil come alive, and its essence
trickled down through the base.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about the souffle is that knowing its secrets
does not spoil its charm. I have made dozens of souffles, and not
once have I failed to be amazed when I've opened the oven door and
peered in at one, inflating like air in my lungs.

   NEW YORK _ Any solitary child who has ever longed for a pet,
created an imaginary friend or inhabited a fantasy world of high
adventure seems likely to identify with Pascal in ``The Red
Balloon,'' the little charmer that will play through Sunday at the
New Victory Theater in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   If the title of this engaging production by the Visible Fictions
Theater Company of Scotland rings a bell, believe the bong. ``The
Red Balloon'' was adapted by the company from the story by Albert
Lamorisse, whose film of the same title won an Academy Award in
1957 for best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   As interpreted by the versatile four-member Visible Fictions
Troupe through dialogue, mime, dance, puppetry and music that
ranges from pop to classical, the 55-minute ``Red Balloon'' proves
once more to be a vehicle that can soar with joy and plumb the
depths of loneliness and despair. At times funny, at times
suspenseful, trenchant and buoyant _ after all, the balloon of the
title packs plenty of mischief _ ``The Red Balloon'' is a fine
fantasy, calculated to entertain children as young as 4 while
holding substantial rewards for their older companions.
</P>
<P>
   So once again the little French boy, played now by Veronica Leer
with the proper mixture of youthful spirit, impudence and
rebelliousness, is refused a pet by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his fantasy adventures built around his only playmate,
a cloth hand puppet, a quest for a cat proves fruitless. ``Frank
searched for miles and miles,'' Pascal narrates. ``There was no
cat. He will never have a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But one day an enchanted red balloon enters Pascal's life,
touching off a series of adventures and encounters among bus
riders, schoolmates, the school janitor, the overbearing principal
(who gets a few bops from the balloon for her pains) and the
slingshot-toting rowdies who are the villains of this piece.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon, manipulated by Douglas Irvine, who plays a variety
of roles _ as do Kate Brailsford and Yngvil Vatn Guttu _ proves to
be a character filled with more than hot air or helium. The balloon
is a good friend, with a broad red cheek to hug and the good sense
to wake Pascal with a firm bop when he oversleeps. But it is
equally mischievous, occasionally jealous and often disobedient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balloon, you have to come when I call you,'' Pascal warns.
``You'll get us both in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That trouble is part of the wit and wisdom that makes ``The Red
Balloon'' so durable and beguiling a tale.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Moving through the weak winter sunlight early one
morning, Terry Gross reached the threshold of WHYY-FM's offices
here, dragging behind her a portion of American culture, packed
into a salesman's sample case. It was a Thursday, the busiest day
of the week for Gross in her role as host and co-executive producer
of ``Fresh Air,'' the syndicated arts show that reaches nearly
three million listeners daily on National Public Radio and thus is
an increasingly influential taste maker.
</P>
<P>
   Before day's end she would moderate an hourlong live broadcast,
conduct two interviews for future shows and wade into the morass of
books, films and CD's vying for coverage in the coming week. The
sample case, her usual means of transporting material to and from
the radio station, suffices for any evening except a Thursday. That
night she would load her car with crates full of submissions to
take home.
</P>
<P>
   Gross had stayed up until 11:30 the previous night working her
way through the sample case's contents. She watched a documentary
on the theremin, an electronic instrument; made notes on the bond
between Chinese food and culture and played tracks from a few discs
of synthesizer music, trying all the while to catch snatches of the
Grammy Awards broadcast. ``If I'm doing one thing, then I'm missing
another,'' she said of the regimen. ``To keep up with one part of
culture, you ignore the other.''
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 that morning she had scanned the newspaper obituaries
for any cultural figure worthy of a memorial segment and packed a
bagel, fruit and an egg-white sandwich for the breakfast and lunch
she knew she would eat at her desk. As she entered the WHYY
building at 8:15, she found Daniel Miller, her fellow executive
producer, listening through headphones to one of the interviews
scheduled for broadcast that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresh Air'' will have its 25th anniversary in September, and
over the years it has done more than grow from a local feature on
WHYY to a programming staple of 290 stations. The program has made
Gross, with her rolling laughter and falsetto leaps of enthusiasm,
a trusted voice and arbiter in the cultural landscape. From Gross'
interviews to commentary by a stable of critics, ``Fresh Air''
guides listeners to choices as considered yet eclectic as the soul
singer Arthur Alexander, the novelist Nadine Gordimer and the
director Roger Corman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say that we have The List,'' Gross, 49, said of the
show's decisions. ``We don't have the resources to be encyclopedic,
and I don't think we present ourselves as doing that. We're saying,
`Here are current and interesting books and movies and CD's and
issues.' I see our listeners as people who are smart and curious
and like to have a new idea, like to be challenged, don't want to
just go with what they already know.'' Or as one of Gross'
producers, Naomi Person, put it, ``It's that feeling of finding
something great and wanting to tell everybody you know about it.''
As a national show ``Fresh Air'' stands nearly alone in the
broadcast media for its abiding commitment to culture. ``Given the
almost complete cop-out of television in arts and cultural
programming, you have to look to public radio for coverage that
shows curiosity and enterprise as distinct from tracking big names
and celebrity,'' said Michael Janeway, director of the National
Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University. ``Every time I
listen to `Fresh Air' I'm struck by the range of interest, the
originality. They're doing very creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   With such credibility has come marketplace clout. ``It's one of
those shows you want, badly want,'' said George Gibson, the
president of Walker &AMP; Co., a publishing house best known for Dava
Sobel's ``Longitude'' and ``Galileo's Daughter.'' ``It speaks to a
highly intelligent, motivated audience _ people who buy books and
will respond to an intelligent dialogue about them. Terry Gross has
a gift for getting below the surface, for bringing out intriguing
aspects of an author or a book. And she's quirky. It's a mystery to
me, and I suspect even to her producers, what works for her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One thing that worked on this particular Thursday in February
was ``The Chinese Kitchen,'' a new book by the chef Eileen Yin-Fei
Lo. A few minutes before 10 a.m., Gross settled into the studio for
a taping with the author. Since she originated ``Fresh Air'' in
1975, Gross has conducted some 5,000 interviews, and like the jazz
singers she admires, her neck veins and supple cheeks attest to
years of vocal projection. She gently steered her discussion with
Lo toward the idea of cuisine as culture, lowering her eyebrows in
concentration, rubbing her fingers together as if handling beads.
</P>
<P>
   By the session's end Gross had conjured from Lo stories about
foot-binding, the kitchen god and the ``sweet-birth vinegar''
consumed by pregnant women. Lo had recounted her escape from China
in 1950 and her refusal ever to return to the home village where
her relatives were punished in retaliation. Of her first ambition
outside Communist China, Lo confided to Gross: ``I always wanted to
be a spy. CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   From exactly 58 minutes 59 seconds of tape, Person and an
associate producer, Ann Marie Baldonado, would extract 22 minutes
of dialogue, the length of most interview segments. But the editing
would not occur until the next week. For now production remained
incomplete for the program to be broadcast live at noon. (Many
stations carry the program on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Headphones at his ears, razor in hand, Miller hunched over his
editing machine, listening again and again to a few inches of
Gross' interview with Christopher Lloyd, the executive producer of
the NBC television comedy ``Frasier.'' Gross led into one question
by summarizing the plot of a recent episode, and Miller wanted to
slow down her delivery just a bit for clarity. ``Looking for
breath,'' he muttered as he scrutinized the tape. ``Gaspy breath.''
</P>
<P>
   He was still searching for it when Roberta Shorrock, director of
``Fresh Air,'' entered the control room at 11:55 a.m. to speed-dial
the number of the U.S. Naval Observatory. On the opposite side of
the glass Gross tapped away at a laptop in the studio, finishing
the text for the introduction to the show and the bridges between
its recorded segments. With Shorrock assured by the Navy that
``Fresh Air'' had the correct time down to the second, the show
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:27 p.m., with an opening segment about medical errors just
about finished, Miller strode into the control room with the first
of three reels of the segment with Lloyd, now enhanced by a
transplanted syllable of gaspy breath. By ``Fresh Air'' standards,
that timing was not even alarming. On one show a few years ago, an
edited tape reached the control room so close to broadcast time
that it could not be threaded onto the takeup reel and instead
unspooled onto the floor as it played. ``Somebody once accused me
of being hypnotically attracted to chaos,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   What allows a certain composure on ``Fresh Air'' is a veteran
production team. Miller, Shorrock and the segment producers _
Person, Phyllis Myers, Amy Salit and Joan Toohey Weisman _ have
variously logged from 11 to 22 years with the show. Their
backgrounds, as diverse as the program they develop, range from
salsa musician to documentary filmmaker to drama student. More than
the rest, Person and Salit act as filters, deciding what fraction
of the tonnage of material submitted to ``Fresh Air'' should be
funneled to Gross.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15 that Thursday afternoon, Salit was all but barricaded
behind her desk by 21 mail crates of books, CD's, press kits and
Federal Express packages. ``I didn't even get today's mail yet,''
she said. She wouldn't for a few more hours, either, because at 2
p.m. she had to go to the control room to produce Gross' interview
with Robert Moog, inventor of the synthesizer. Salit, who has a
passion for alternative music and club-hopping, was the one who had
suggested Moog as a subject.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Person was wedged into her carrel trying to watch
stretches of Eric Bross' film ``Restaurant'' on a VCR while reading
a press release about National Poetry Month in April. On her desk
was a pad of phone messages in triplicate, the brainstorm of an
efficiency consultant whom WHYY recently hired. Above Person's
computer hung a Buddhist proverb: ``Chaos should be regarded as
extremely good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward 4 p.m. Salit and then Person reported to Gross' office
with one mail crate apiece. A book about the film ``All About
Eve,'' a CD by a Romanian pan-pipe virtuoso, some reviews of
Charles Durning's performance in a revival of ``Glengarry Glen
Ross,'' a videocassette of a James Toback film with Robert Downey,
Jr. _ the women picked and mulled over all that and more. ``I like
the title. ... Here's a band from Nashville getting good reviews.
... I know there's a press kit with this. ...''
</P>
<P>
   A youthful Frank Sinatra gazed dreamily from an enlarged photo
above Gross' desk, a reminder that, in the end, she has her own
tastes and judgments. She grew up in Brooklyn smitten with musical
theater and aspiring to become a lyricist, and her adult love of
jazz is one she shares with her husband, the music critic Francis
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Salit returned from a screening of Paul Thomas
Anderson's ``Magnolia'' certain that Gross would find it
pretentious. On the contrary, Gross enjoyed the film enough to see
it twice.
</P>
<P>
   With the afternoon sun waning and the WHYY entrance falling into
shadows, Gross lurched toward her car with her crates, her first
step outside in nine hours. She would stay up until midnight trying
to make choices and still give herself a night's sleep before
Friday's interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may lose your energy,'' she said before leaving the
office, ``but you never lose your love for culture. The thing that
burns you out also keeps you going.''

 &HT;    STUDY FINDS FEW SAFETY PROBLEMS WITH FEDERAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a recent rash of incidents raising concerns
about the safety of food purchased by the federal government for
the nation's schoolchildren, a General Accounting Office
investigation has found few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few outbreaks of food-borne illness have been reported''
involving government-donated food, the GAO said in a report
released Tuesday. In fact, the report said, U.S. Agriculture
Department officials ``may have prevented or mitigated such
outbreaks'' by helping to remove suspect food before it reached
kids.
</P>
<P>
   However, the GAO faulted the Agriculture Department for not
sufficiently documenting problems with food that the federal
government donates through the National School Lunch and School
Breakfast programs, which provide a total of 33 million breakfasts
and lunches at thousands of schools each day.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the agency for not giving guidance to
local school districts when they purchase food to supplement that
which is provided by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unacceptably large gaps in our knowledge about
whether we are doing all we can to ensure the safety of 33 million
meals eaten every day by our nation's children'' Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said in a statement accompanying release of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin requested the GAO study a year ago following a Cox
Newspapers report on an E. coli outbreak at an elementary school in
Finley, Wash., that health officials linked to government-donated
beef. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While the report dealt only briefly with the Finley outbreak, it
said the Agriculture Department tested a sample of the ground beef
used in the meal and found nothing wrong. However, the GAO included
that incident among those in which food-borne illnesses were
associated with federally-donated foods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the GAO said it found 17 outbreaks of food-borne
illness during 1997 and 1998 that could be tied to food served in
schools. However, that number could be larger because the GAO,
lacking any nationwide statistics for 1998, instead said it
surveyed only ten states.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Oleson, the GAO official in charge of preparing the
report, said Tuesday his investigators did not call all 50 states
because it was a ``time issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said federal procurement officers told
investigators they ``consider the potential suppliers' records for
compliance with food safety regulations in their reviews of bids''
for contracts to provide food. However, the report does not discuss
what federal purchasing officials considered when they bought
ground beef from Northern States Beef, the Nebraska-based company
that supplied the meat suspected in the Finley outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department records show that in the 18 months prior
to its purchase from Northern States Beef, food safety inspectors
cited the company 171 times for ``critical'' food safety
violations.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a plant operated by Hudson Foods, which in 1997
had the largest recall of meat in U.S. history because of E. coli
contamination, amassed 90 critical violations the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Oleson said he never heard of Northern States Beef and could not
explain precisely what the government had considered before
purchasing from the company. He said he would have to talk to his
investigators about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited the 1999 Supreme Beef case in Texas as an
example of how the Agriculture Department has established policies
to ensure the safety of food bound for school meals. The report
says that the day after the agency began enforcement proceedings
against the Dallas-based company for not complying with food safety
standards, the government ``terminated (the company's) school food
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to federal records, Supreme Beef flunked three rounds
of tests for Salmonella contamination over a period of roughly
eight months prior to its action. During that time, the government
continued to buy meat from the company for the school meals
program.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Agriculture Department action against Supreme Beef
late last year, concerned Texas school officials embargoed the
ground beef that the federal government had purchased at the same
it was discovering Salmonella. Eventually, after the agency assured
the state the meat was safe, it was released to local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Oleson acknowledged the government was buying beef at the same
time it was discovering Salmonella, but said the Agriculture
Department was locked into a contract with the company. Oleson said
as long as Supreme Beef was open for business and being inspected
by the federal government, the government was legally obligated to
buy what was being produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food system in the United States is not one hundred
percent safe,'' Oleson said, ``There are not guarantees. You are
going to have outbreaks. You are going to have illnesses.''

PENTAGON SLOW TO ALERT TROOPS ABOUT FAULTY SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN M. DONNELLY ASSOCIATED PRESS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although a Pentagon agency warned the Army and Air
Force in early February not to use potentially flawed chemical
suits, the services didn't pass the message on to the field until
weeks later _ the day after the problem was made public, military
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is unclear how widely the message has spread among
US forces deployed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, the Defense Logistics Agency told all the military
services' logistics offices not to use suits from two suspect lots
in any real emergency. But it was not until Feb. 28, the day after
the Associated Press reported that many of the suits contained
holes and tears and the contractor had been charged with fraud,
that the message went beyond the logistics offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of the problem's scope were troops at Army and Air Force
bases who, the Pentagon inspector general says, could have been
killed wearing faulty suits during a gas or germ attack.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Friday did the Defense Logistics Agency send a memo to
four-star generals and admirals on every continent, the Army and
Air Force chiefs, and others _ as opposed to logistics offices. The
latest memo provides more detailed information on what items to set
aside and who to call with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 warning said 1989 and 1992 lots of ``battle dress
overgarments'' made by Isratex Inc. of New York City should be
removed from the active inventory. An alert in December to the same
logistics offices mentioned only the 1992 lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force didn't tell bases around the world that either lot
was defective until the day after the story broke, said Major Donna
Nicholas, an Air Force spokeswoman. The Army had told its soldiers
about the 1992 lot but not about the 1989 lot, because Army
headquarters didn't get the Feb. 3 memo and first learned about it
in the press, said spokeswoman Nancy Ray. A Navy spokesman,
Lieutenant Matt O'Neal, said sailors and Marines have their own
protective suits and none are made by Isratex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 lot has not been proven defective, it was
pulled with the 1992 lot and is considered suspect because of the
company that made it, agency and inspector general officials have
said. The company provided 780,000 suits to the military at a cost
of $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas said officials at Air Force headquarters never got the
December message. And she said the Feb. 3 warning was sent to the
wrong Air Force location and wasn't received by headquarters until
Feb. 15. Nearly two more weeks passed before the Air Force issued a
warning memo Feb. 28, the day after the AP story.
</P>
<P>
   The belated Feb. 28 memo was sent not to field units, such as
air bases in Korea or the Middle East, but to the supply offices of
major commands and to Air Force centers that store such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The service telephoned bases in ``high-threat'' areas such as
Korea to notify them of the problem suits, Nicholas said, though
she could not document such contacts or say precisely when they
occurred. She called it ``coincidence'' that the service's warning
came soon after the press report.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army warned field units about 1992 lots,
headquarters never received the Feb. 3 memo on the 1989 lot, Ray
said. She and others said the news stories alerted officials to the
1989 lot and that on Feb. 28, phone calls were made to warn US and
overseas units about both lots.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Larry Barker, responsible for chemical gear for the
85,000 troops in the 18th Airborne Corps, said the first time he
heard about the 1989 lot being a potential problem was Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have conceded they knew as far back as 1994
that Isratex was being investigated for allegedly selling inferior
products with the intent to defraud the military. Eventually, five
Isratex contracts were included in an indictment against the firm.
Last September, company officials pleaded guilty to various charges
in US District Court in New York. Sentencing is set for April.
</P>
<P>
   After tests last September showed flaws on suits from the 1992
lot were more serious than previously believed, the Defense
Logistics Agency issued the Dec. 2 warning to 18 logistics offices.
The December warning cites only the 1992 deal but says all suits
``that are connected with/manufactured by subject contractor be
used for TRAINING ONLY!''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 memo was sent to the same recipients. This time it
said the 1989 and 1992 lots ``have been tested and identified as
being unsuitable as chemical protective suits.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no deadline for action in either memo, but both
requested ``widest possible dissemination of this document.''

OUTSPOKEN MCCAIN HASN'T HELPED HIMSELF IN DIXIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the beginning, Senator John McCain's courtship of
Dixie has been star-crossed, and the primary road through the South
next week offers little encouragement for someone struggling to
stay within striking distance of Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle shifts to Bush's ground, McCain, the rebel
candidate, is at a further disadvantage because he has managed to
make many enemies across old rebel territory with his outspoken
style. According to political leaders and analysts, Bush appears
poised to sweep the six states involved in the next major round of
primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The big contests will take place in Bush's home state and in
Florida, where his brother, Jeb Bush, serves as governor, and the
outlook for McCain is just as daunting in Tennessee, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Oklahoma. A total of 340 Republican delegates are
at stake. Attempting to nail down the last of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the Republican nomination, Bush has plans to travel
across the region over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the futility of his efforts in the South,
McCain is concentrating on the Mountain States, where 91 delegates
will be chosen in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming on Friday. As
McCain's press secretary, Howard Opinsky, remarked sarcastically
the other day, ``We're going to leave the Southern strategy to
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley was never competitive in the South in the
Democratic race against a native son, Vice President Al Gore. He
said he chose to concentrate on states where he felt he had a
chance, and never established any beachhead in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But for a military hero with a strong conservative voting
record, McCain's failure to make inroads in the South has crippled
his chances.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign in South Carolina last month, McCain was
asked why he had not invoked his family's Southern background,
which dates back to Confederate days, to win affinity with Southern
voters. He said he refused to play the Southern card because he did
not want to inflame the controversy over the presence of the
Confederate battle flag atop the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was critical of Bush's appearance at Bob Jones
University, a fundamentalist college. A few days later, a wave of
Christian conservatives swamped McCain in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain escalated hostilities with the religious right with
a sweeping attack on two fundamentalist leaders, Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell, prior to last week's Virginia primary, he triggered
another backlash by the core constituency of the Republican Party
in the South. He lost the state decisively.
</P>
<P>
   But the antipathy he created among Republicans in Mississippi,
which elects 33 delegates Tuesday, is an especially instructive
case study of McCain's problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In his best-selling autobiography, ``Faith Of My Fathers,''
McCain wrote of his Confederate ancestors in Mississippi, saying
``my family's history was my pride.'' His great-great-grandfather
died while serving in the Mississippi cavalry; his
great-grandfather ``barely 14 years old at the end of the Civil War
offered to enlist as well, giving his age as 18. He was rejected,
but later in his life would express his patriotism by serving as
sheriff of Carroll County, Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   As the child of a naval officer, McCain said he ``spent many
happy summer days'' at the family plantation there. His
grandfather, who became an admiral, attended Ole Miss for two years
before enrolling in the Naval Academy. Two military bases in
Mississippi were named for members of McCain's family. The
situation seemed ripe for McCain to make a connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan was once playfully introduced as ``Mississippi's
third senator'' by his colleague, Trent Lott. But McCain ran afoul
of the Senate majority leader over tobacco and campaign finance
legislation before his presidential campaign began and later
antagonized Republican executives in Mississippi by appearing at a
fund-raiser with prominent Democrats in Jackson 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The event was hosted by Richard Scruggs, a high-powered trial
lawyer who worked closely with McCain on anti-tobacco matters.
Though Scruggs is Lott's brother-in-law, he is a nominal Democrat
and a close associate of the state's Democratic attorney general,
Mike Moore, who praised McCain at the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was rebuked by state Republican chairman Mike Retzer in a
strong letter that accused him of offering ``considerable aid and
comfort to our enemies'' while being ``devious and disloyal'' to
Republican Party officials who knew nothing of his appearance in
the state until they read about it in a Jackson newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fired back with his own angry letter to Retzer. ``I take
offense at the tone and language of your letter,'' he wrote. ``I
use words like devious and disloyal very sparingly, sir, for I
recognize that they are used to call another's character into
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Retzer is now running Bush's campaign in several Southern
states, including Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana, and he says
internal Bush polling shows that McCain is doomed throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Of McCain's foray into Mississippi, he said, ``It's ironic that
Mr. Anti-Special Interests came down to get payback from the
anti-tobacco special intersts. Whenever we find a McCain supporter,
we fax them a copy of the newspaper article'' concerning McCain's
consorting with Mississippi Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The entire hierarchy of the state GOP is behind Bush, who plans
to campaign in Mississippi as well Tennessee next Monday. ``Bush
will win Mississippi comfortably,'' said Senator Thad Cochran, the
senior Republican officeholder in the state and an early Bush
backer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say McCain may find some support in a couple of
congressional districts in Tennessee, where Senator Fred Thompson
is leading his campaign, but that represents no threat for Bush to
carry the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's only other opening in the South appears to be a tier of
congressional districts in northern Florida, running from Pensacola
to Jacksonville, where there are several naval air installations
and many retired military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is McCain's best shot,'' said Susan MacManus, a
political science professort at the University of South Florida.
``He's got the veterans' support and he's doing well among the
older voters. The good news for him is that a high percentage of
older people vote. The bad news is that they tend to be party
loyalists.'' And in the Florida primary, which is closed to all but
registered Republicans, the party line favors Bush.

MOZAMBIQUE DEBT RELIEF URGED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As floodwaters recede in Mozambique, many advocates
for the poor say Washington's reaction should be more than food,
shelter, and rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gift, they say, would be in helping poverty-stricken
countries eliminate their debt.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of clergy, non-profit leaders, and senior Clinton
administration officials Tuesday pressed Congress to help unlock an
international debt-relief plan that would aid Mozambique and other
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the House Appropriations Committee, which will take up a
$210 million debt relief contribution Thursday as part of a $5.2
billion supplemental bill, has cut funding for the program because
administration officials did not follow proper procedures, said
committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Morra.
</P>
<P>
   Morra said House Republican leaders and Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers had agreed the committee would fund new debt
relief only with authorizing legislation, and no such bill has been
introduced. In addition, she questioned whether debt relief should
part of an emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether it's a real emergency,'' Morra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said it was, as did several others Tuesday, including
three from Massachusetts: Cardinal Bernard Law; the Reverend M.
Thomas Shaw, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts; and
Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, who recently
returned from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mozambique, debt relief means flood relief,'' Shaw said at
a news conference. ``. . . We must seize this historic opportunity
to take moral action, grounded in Scripture and our compassion for
those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said erasing much of the African nation's debt ``is a
good investment for the United States.'' He also announced the
administration was forgiving the remainder of Mozambique's debt to
the United States, a largely symbolic gesture amounting to less
than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique owes $6 billion, much of it to Russia, and until
recently had been paying $2 million a week in debt service _ more
than it spends for education and health care combined.
</P>
<P>
   In the world's 33 poorest countries, that is a depressingly
familiar story.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the advocates say, debt service has kept the poorest
countries wedded to misery. In these nations, life expectancy is 25
years less than in developed countries. People are 40 percent less
literate. Women are 30 times more likely to die during pregancy.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of the largest industrial nations last year in
Cologne, Germany, leaders created the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Trust Fund. The fund aims to collect $28 billion that
will allow those countries to write off about $90 billion in debt,
the difference mostly made up of interest payments. The US share is
$960 million in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was designed so that all creditor countries contribute.
Several countries have put their share on hold until they see what
Congress does with the $210 million request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funding is critical not only because of what it will
supply directly but also because of the important inducement it
will provide for other donor countries,'' Law wrote to House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   If the trust fund works, the countries still would be $37
billion in debt, but it would free millions of dollars for social
services and infrastructure. In Mozambique, weekly debt payment
would fall from $2 million to $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frees up about $800,000 a week for reconstruction of that
country,'' said James McDonald, a policy analyst at Bread for the
World, a nonprofit citizens' group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam's Offenheiser said debt relief becomes especially critical
in the aftermath of a natural disaster. ``We learned from Hurricane
Mitch in Nicaragua and Honduras that relief aid really helps
short-term needs, but debt relief has real long-term effects,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Hispanic population rising faster in the South
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hispanic population is increasing faster in the South than
in the rest of the country, according to a report released today by
the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The report paints the portrait of a nation undergoing a profound
transformation from a mainly biracial population to one sprinkled
with people of more various racial and ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experiencing a major demographic change in the United
States,'' said Roberto M. Ramirez, author of the report. ``Across
the board there have been increases in the Hispanic population all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, he said, the number of Hispanics in the South
increased 23.6 percent while the number of Hispanics nationwide
went up 18.9 percent. He estimates that the South's Hispanic
population increased 4.6 percent last year, compared with a 2.9
percent national increase.
</P>
<P>
   The census bureau considers the South a 16-state region that
includes the District of Columbia and stretches from Florida to
Delaware to Oklahoma and Texas. It says 10.4 million of the
nation's 31.7 million Hispanics live in the South. About 84 percent
of the South's Hispanic population live in Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While Census estimates last year said Georgia's Hispanic
population had shot up 100 percent since 1990, Latinos still make
up only 2.9 percent of the state population. By contrast, Hispanics
made up 30 percent of the population in Texas and 15 percent in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Maritza Soto Keen, executive director of metro Atlanta's Latin
American Association, said Latinos will gain more political power
as their numbers increase across the South. Last year, Gov. Roy
Barnes appointed a Latino Forum to recommend changes to state law
to benefit the estimated 220,000 to 480,000 Latinos here. In North
Carolina, Gov. Jim Hunt created an Office of Hispanic/Latino
Affairs in 1998. Georgia ranks fifth nationally in percentage
increase in Hispanic buying power since 1990, according to a
University of Georgia study. Only Arkansas, Nevada, North Carolina
and Vermont had bigger increases in disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   Only three states had higher growth rates in their Hispanic
population in the 1990s than Georgia, and two of them _ Arkansas
and North Carolina _ were in the South. The fourth state was
Nevada; thousands of Latinos have taken jobs in recent years in the
hotels and casinos of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said the largest wave of immigration _ legal and illegal
_ in nearly a century has increased the nation's Hispanic
population, but so have high birth rates. He said Hispanic women
have an average of 3.2 children and that non-Hispanic white women
have an average of 1.5 children. His report says Hispanics are
three times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to live in poverty
and that they generally have lower education levels than
non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   It also points out statistical differences among Hispanics
grouped by nationality. While 23 percent of Hispanic families lived
below the poverty level, according to the report, the number is
higher for Mexicans (24 percent) and Puerto Ricans (27 percent)
than for Cubans (11 percent). The report says 6.1 percent of
non-Hispanic white families live below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Among all Hispanic groups, about 50 percent of Mexicans had a
high school diploma or more, compared with 64 percent for Puerto
Ricans, 64 percent for Central and South Americans and 70 percent
for Cubans (88 percent of non-Hispanic whites had a high school
diploma).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think Hispanics are a homogenous group. They don't
realize there are stark differences,'' he said.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following

   EAST-WEST-FILM (Paris) _ The end of the cold war was definitely
bad news for those novelists and screenwriters who were counting on
the ``evil empire'' to provide them with plots for life. And yet,
while the KGB may no longer be a credible adversary, the old Soviet
Union has not been exhausted as a font of good stories. In fact,
thanks to the collapse of communism, it is now possible to see many
human dramas long obscured by the glare of the ideological
struggle. Regis Wargnier's new movie, ``East-West,'' nominated for
best foreign language film in this year's Oscars, recounts one such
drama. ``I could have made this movie in any place or any country
where there had been a totalitarian regime,'' the 51-year-old
French director said of ``East-West,'' which opens in New York on
April 14. By Alan Riding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHYAMALAN-FILMS (Philadelphia) _ Ascribe it to a sensitivity
earned from a youth in schools as the only Indian among Americans,
the only Hindu among Catholics. Attribute it to the eye that is
trained when a 10-year-old is given a movie camera, which he uses
to make 45 short films before age 15. Whatever the reason, it
should seem appropriate that M. Night Shyamalan _ M., for Manoj;
Night, a name he adopted at 17 (``romantic, mysterious, poetic'');
Shyamalan (pronounced SHA-ma-lan) _ would come up with ``The Sixth
Sense.'' After all, it's a thriller about a boy, Cole, who sees
things that no one else can see (dead people, as it happens), and
it features an alarming secret, numerous clues to which have been
sitting in plain sight. Shyamalan has a way of seeing things other
people do not see, and recognizing things others are slow to grasp.
By Jamie Malanowski. &QL;

<P>
   ACADEMY-AWARDS-FILMS (Undated) _ This year I'm really going to
do it. When Billy Crystal bounds onto the stage of the Los Angeles
Shrine Auditorium on March 26, I will have seen every single film
and performance nominated for an Academy Award in every major
category, so help me God. Even if I have to go to a movie about an
old man driving a lawn mower across Iowa. By Anita Gates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACADEMY-AWARDS-DOCUMENTARIES (Undated) _ In contrast to past
years, when popularity at the box office seemed to disqualify a
documentary from academy consideration, this year's five nominees
include one film that found an unusually large audience for a work
of nonfiction: ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' about a group of
forgotten musicians from prerevolutionary Cuba. The other nominees
include some well-regarded pictures, two of which also focus on
musicians. In the past, academy officials acknowledge, the choice
of nominees in the documentary category was skewed by rules that
required every member of the screening committee to watch every
eligible film in a theater, subjecting them to a marathon of as
many as 65 films in the space of two months. By Terry Pristin. &QL;

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-CITY-BALLET _ While waiting for the next Balanchine to fill
the original Balanchine's shoes, the trick is to preserve his
legacy and breathe fresh air into the company he founded. One
solution, as the New York City Ballet demonstrated this winter is
to present an exuberantly danced season, introduce young and gifted
dancers, and realize that there is no second Balanchine. For
starters, it would be helpful to accept the idea, 17 years after
George Balanchine's death, that his kind of genius comes along only
every 100 years and to stop measuring other choreographers in the
company by his standard. By Anna Kisselgoff. &QL;

   FUDDY-MEERS-THEATER (New York) _ A student at the Milton Academy
near Boston, David Lindsay-Abaire, who finished fourth in a
national ''speech team'' competition, is appearing in a new comedy,
``Fuddy Meers,'' at the Minetta Lane Theater. As the seemingly
nonsensical title suggests, the play is filled with shards of
broken speech uttered by fractured characters. By Peter Marks. WITH

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIVICA-GENAUX-OPERA (Washington) _ Not many rising opera stars
would choose to make their New York recital debuts singing chamber
music, and little-known Baroque chamber music, at that. Yet that is
what Vivica Genaux, 30, an American mezzo-soprano, plans to do
Monday evening at Weill Recital Hall. With Chatham Baroque, a
period-instrument group, she will delve into cantatas and arias by
Bononcini, Handel, Scarlatti, Vivaldi and the obscure 18th-century
Spanish composers Pablo Esteve and Antonio Literes. By Cori
Ellison. &QL;

<P>
   MUSIC-REMAKES (Undated) _ The notion of artists changing their
music to please the prudish and commercial elements of society is
critically odious, but in the case of several recent singles, the
editing has actually improved the song. In a music landscape in
which the crude come-on has replaced the sly innuendo, some remakes
are bringing a touch of subtlety back to urban music. By Neil
Strauss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOB-DYLAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young
folk singer warning that the times were a-changin', one change he
probably did not envision was that he would become a darling of the
high-art world. Yet last fall, nearly 40 years after he made his
first records, Dylan was declared one of the greatest artists of
the 20th century by Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate. And
now the composer John Corigliano, commissioned to write a song
cycle for the soprano Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital on
Wednesday evening, has produced ``Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems
of Bob Dylan,'' a 35-minute song cycle. By Allan Kozinn. WITH

   ARTISTS-TIME-BOXES (Waltham, Mass.) _ In a stage-worthy scene,
the artists Richard Artschwager, Daniel Buren, Sol LeWitt and
Robert Ryman met here recently to reveal the secret contents of
four steel boxes they individually filled and sealed 25 years ago.
These artists' time boxes, and the dramatic opening held at the
Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University on Feb. 24, are both part of
a quarter-century-long collaborative project initiated by another
artist, Stephen Antonakos. The boxes, their contents and a neon
installation by Antonakos will be displayed here through Sunday as
part of the museum's millennium celebration. By Ann Wilson Lloyd.

   AFRICAN-MONEY-ART (Washington) _ Over the last 15 years, spurred
by exhibitions of African masks and ceremonial sculpture in
galleries and museums, collectors have been acquiring African
money. A pioneer collector, William Greenspon, a New York
psychiatrist who became an art dealer and painter, assembled a
large holding of African and other tribal money and sold it in 1986
to the Chase Manhattan Bank. These sculptural pieces were then
displayed as art in the bank's executive offices. Now both kinds of
African money, mostly owned by collectors, is going public in two
exhibitions. The smaller but more important show, ``The Artistry of
African Currency,'' opens here Sunday at the Smithsonian's National
Museum of African Art and remains through July 23. The show, the
first of African money in an American museum, includes 50 artifacts
in a variety of metals and humbler materials: cowrie shells, beads
and cloth. The larger exhibition, ``Africa's Iron and Copper
Currencies,'' is on view in Manhattan this month in the Low
Memorial Library at Columbia University. By Rita Reif. &QL;

   TV-ROBERT-TROUT (New York) _ Robert Trout came out of a cold
drizzle and into a nearly deserted midtown restaurant the other
day, ordered a bowl of risotto and a glass of red wine and began to
chat amiably, almost shyly, about broadcasting, cab driving and
Warren G. Harding. Trout is 90, and while osteoporosis has bent his
back and skewed his sense of balance, he is still the very model of
the suave, modern anchorman. And still very much in demand. By

ABC REVAMPS ITS EXCLUSIVE OSCAR PRESHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC, which has exclusive rights to air live arrivals coverage in
the half hour before the Academy Awards ceremony, is promising a
preshow that is a lot livelier than last year's critically drubbed
broadcast hosted by actress Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   This year there will be three hosts covering the red carpet
outside the Shrine Auditorium, among them Meredith Vieira of ABC's
``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her experience as a broadcast journalist and talk-show
interviewer, it's likely Vieira will be more comfortable working
without the script safety net Davis employed.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokesman Dan Doran said Vieira's colleagues for the March
26 telecast are expected to be announced later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's first attempt at the exclusive preshow, during which other
broadcasters could tape footage but were forbidden to show it live,
was criticized as boring, relying on too much old footage, canned
segments and Davis' interviews inside the theater, thereby dousing
the spontaneity and you-are-there enthusiasm viewers savored on
several TV channels earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the feeling has been that they wanted it to be more
red-carpet oriented,'' Doran said. ``There will be pretaped
packages _ you can't help that. The idea is to make it very
fast-paced, and it will be a seamless transfer right into the
regular show.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the critical pans prompted the change in the
show's format, Doran said, ``Last year was the first year and it
was an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC exclusive preshow begins at 5 p.m., with the ceremonies
starting at 5:30. Other broadcasters covering earlier star arrivals
at the Shrine Auditorium include E! Entertainment on cable, KTLA
and KABC. &QL;

PENTAGON SLOW TO ALERT TROOPS ABOUT FAULTY SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN M. DONNELLY ASSOCIATED PRESS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although a Pentagon agency warned the Army and Air
Force in early February not to use potentially flawed chemical
suits, the services didn't pass the message on to the field until
weeks later _ the day after the problem was made public, military
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even now it is unclear how widely the message has spread among
US forces deployed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, the Defense Logistics Agency told all the military
services' logistics offices not to use suits from two suspect lots
in any real emergency. But it was not until Feb. 28, the day after
the Associated Press reported that many of the suits contained
holes and tears and the contractor had been charged with fraud,
that the message went beyond the logistics offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of the problem's scope were troops at Army and Air Force
bases who, the Pentagon inspector general says, could have been
killed wearing faulty suits during a gas or germ attack.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Friday did the Defense Logistics Agency send a memo to
four-star generals and admirals on every continent, the Army and
Air Force chiefs, and others _ as opposed to logistics offices. The
latest memo provides more detailed information on what items to set
aside and who to call with questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 warning said 1989 and 1992 lots of ``battle dress
overgarments'' made by Isratex Inc. of New York City should be
removed from the active inventory. An alert in December to the same
logistics offices mentioned only the 1992 lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force didn't tell bases around the world that either lot
was defective until the day after the story broke, said Major Donna
Nicholas, an Air Force spokeswoman. The Army had told its soldiers
about the 1992 lot but not about the 1989 lot, because Army
headquarters didn't get the Feb. 3 memo and first learned about it
in the press, said spokeswoman Nancy Ray. A Navy spokesman,
Lieutenant Matt O'Neal, said sailors and Marines have their own
protective suits and none are made by Isratex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 lot has not been proven defective, it was
pulled with the 1992 lot and is considered suspect because of the
company that made it, agency and inspector general officials have
said. The company provided 780,000 suits to the military at a cost
of $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas said officials at Air Force headquarters never got the
December message. And she said the Feb. 3 warning was sent to the
wrong Air Force location and wasn't received by headquarters until
Feb. 15. Nearly two more weeks passed before the Air Force issued a
warning memo Feb. 28, the day after the AP story.
</P>
<P>
   The belated Feb. 28 memo was sent not to field units, such as
air bases in Korea or the Middle East, but to the supply offices of
major commands and to Air Force centers that store such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The service telephoned bases in ``high-threat'' areas such as
Korea to notify them of the problem suits, Nicholas said, though
she could not document such contacts or say precisely when they
occurred. She called it ``coincidence'' that the service's warning
came soon after the press report.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army warned field units about 1992 lots,
headquarters never received the Feb. 3 memo on the 1989 lot, Ray
said. She and others said the news stories alerted officials to the
1989 lot and that on Feb. 28, phone calls were made to warn US and
overseas units about both lots.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Larry Barker, responsible for chemical gear for the
85,000 troops in the 18th Airborne Corps, said the first time he
heard about the 1989 lot being a potential problem was Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have conceded they knew as far back as 1994
that Isratex was being investigated for allegedly selling inferior
products with the intent to defraud the military. Eventually, five
Isratex contracts were included in an indictment against the firm.
Last September, company officials pleaded guilty to various charges
in US District Court in New York. Sentencing is set for April.
</P>
<P>
   After tests last September showed flaws on suits from the 1992
lot were more serious than previously believed, the Defense
Logistics Agency issued the Dec. 2 warning to 18 logistics offices.
The December warning cites only the 1992 deal but says all suits
``that are connected with/manufactured by subject contractor be
used for TRAINING ONLY!''
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 3 memo was sent to the same recipients. This time it
said the 1989 and 1992 lots ``have been tested and identified as
being unsuitable as chemical protective suits.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no deadline for action in either memo, but both
requested ``widest possible dissemination of this document.''

 &HT;    Using Internet to sell homes means door is always open
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the old days of buying and selling real estate, the
process was decidedly low-tech _ and high tedium.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we had to go around to each real estate office
and pick up a key to the house, then show the house and go back and
take the keys back to that office,'' recalls Jim Bulla of Re/Max
Greater Atlanta's Cobb County office.
</P>
<P>
   In superaccelerated, Information Age time, those days are eons
ago _ back in 1978 _ when Bulla began selling homes in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the real estate industry has gone high tech, and Bulla
has ridden the information technology wave in order to transform
his old business practices to meet the demands of Internet-savvy
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I love it so much is there isn't any competition,''
he says. ``Right now, according to the National Association of
Realtors, 7 percent of the nation's Realtors are doing 93 percent
of annual sales nationwide. I'm in the 7 percent, if you want to
know where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   To compete at that level, Bulla uses the high-tech tools of the
trade, including fax machine, four computers (two at home, two at
the office), scanners, a Palm Pilot, two cell phones, two Web sites
and five printers.
</P>
<P>
   His target: a healthy share of the estimated 62 percent of
buyers who are now beginning their home search on the Internet.
Last week, for example, Bulla sold two houses for about $250,000
apiece. Both buyers were Internet shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can document over $4 million of sales direct from
Internet,'' Bulla says.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla has been competing on the Internet for some time now. ``I
started five years ago with my first Web site, and it wasn't
anything more than a billboard with my name on it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that small offering, he saw results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a hit on it,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla sold a house to that client, who turned out to be familiar
with Internet technology, and together they upgraded Bulla's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bulla has created multiple Web sites, some of which
target specific categories of buyers, including a Web page for
senior citizens and one for buyers relocating to the Atlanta metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla himself moved to Atlanta 18 years ago, and he's been with
Re/Max for 10 years. He's originally from Indiana, where he was
raised on a hog farm and attended a school with a total of 125
students. ``I graduated in the top 10 of my class,'' he laughs.
``There were nine of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he went to the same school from first through 12th
grade, Bulla says he never experienced the anguish of moving from
one school to another. Last year, when a client from Chicago
decided to move to Atlanta, Bulla was struck by the reaction of one
of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the daughters just started crying. She was leaving all
the friends and kids she'd ever known,'' he says. ``I just never
had that kind of trauma. As obvious as it is, it just never struck
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to that child's reaction, Bulla created a Web site
for kids, to help ease the anxiety of moving and to provide
kid-related information on schools, extracurricular activities and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   To further distinguish himself on the Net, Bulla has
incorporated ``virtual tours'' of many of his home listings. These
Web-based tours allow a potential buyer a 360-degree, full-color
view of key rooms in the home, as well as its exterior features.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Web activity, Bulla has turned his office
into a miniprint shop. Using desktop publishing technology, he
customizes relocation kits for potential clients with
how-to-buy-a-house information, a personal moving inventory log and
detailed information on the schools in the area of their new home.
</P>
<P>
   Bulla also publishes informational pamphlets for his home
listings, which potential buyers can take with them after visiting
a property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually put a customized book in the house that has
pictures of all the rooms, a copy of the school report,'' Bulla
says. ``It tells the (home's) features, lists property disclosure
where the owner will tell you all he knows about the house, and a
termite disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get to the end of the day and they've looked at 20
houses and they can't remember any of them, they can remember ours
because they've got the book,'' he says.

MOZAMBIQUE DEBT RELIEF URGED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As floodwaters recede in Mozambique, many advocates
for the poor say Washington's reaction should be more than food,
shelter, and rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gift, they say, would be in helping poverty-stricken
countries eliminate their debt.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of clergy, non-profit leaders, and senior Clinton
administration officials Tuesday pressed Congress to help unlock an
international debt-relief plan that would aid Mozambique and other
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the House Appropriations Committee, which will take up a
$210 million debt relief contribution Thursday as part of a $5.2
billion supplemental bill, has cut funding for the program because
administration officials did not follow proper procedures, said
committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Morra.
</P>
<P>
   Morra said House Republican leaders and Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers had agreed the committee would fund new debt
relief only with authorizing legislation, and no such bill has been
introduced. In addition, she questioned whether debt relief should
part of an emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether it's a real emergency,'' Morra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said it was, as did several others Tuesday, including
three from Massachusetts: Cardinal Bernard Law; the Reverend M.
Thomas Shaw, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts; and
Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, who recently
returned from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mozambique, debt relief means flood relief,'' Shaw said at
a news conference. ``. . . We must seize this historic opportunity
to take moral action, grounded in Scripture and our compassion for
those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said erasing much of the African nation's debt ``is a
good investment for the United States.'' He also announced the
administration was forgiving the remainder of Mozambique's debt to
the United States, a largely symbolic gesture amounting to less
than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique owes $6 billion, much of it to Russia, and until
recently had been paying $2 million a week in debt service _ more
than it spends for education and health care combined.
</P>
<P>
   In the world's 33 poorest countries, that is a depressingly
familiar story.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the advocates say, debt service has kept the poorest
countries wedded to misery. In these nations, life expectancy is 25
years less than in developed countries. People are 40 percent less
literate. Women are 30 times more likely to die during pregancy.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of the largest industrial nations last year in
Cologne, Germany, leaders created the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Trust Fund. The fund aims to collect $28 billion that
will allow those countries to write off about $90 billion in debt,
the difference mostly made up of interest payments. The US share is
$960 million in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was designed so that all creditor countries contribute.
Several countries have put their share on hold until they see what
Congress does with the $210 million request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funding is critical not only because of what it will
supply directly but also because of the important inducement it
will provide for other donor countries,'' Law wrote to House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   If the trust fund works, the countries still would be $37
billion in debt, but it would free millions of dollars for social
services and infrastructure. In Mozambique, weekly debt payment
would fall from $2 million to $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frees up about $800,000 a week for reconstruction of that
country,'' said James McDonald, a policy analyst at Bread for the
World, a nonprofit citizens' group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam's Offenheiser said debt relief becomes especially critical
in the aftermath of a natural disaster. ``We learned from Hurricane
Mitch in Nicaragua and Honduras that relief aid really helps
short-term needs, but debt relief has real long-term effects,'' he
said.

&HT;     THE LAME DUCK FLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation may be preoccupied with choosing the
next president, but the current president is busy running his own
sideshow, trying to burnish his legacy in the few months that
remain to him.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't doing too badly, either.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his impeachment by the House, Bill Clinton turns out to
be neither much of a liability for Vice President Al Gore nor
irrelevant on Capitol Hill. He may not get the public attention he
used to attract, but he is still brokering deals with the
Republican Congress, raising money for Democratic candidates,
sounding off on major issues, rallying the troops with partisan
speeches and traveling the globe like an elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain have had
a good time arousing Republican audiences by denouncing what they
say are the shabby ethics and dishonesty of the Clinton era. They
have been competing to be the anti-Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not as simple a task as it appeared only a short
time ago. Clinton's job-approval rating remains high, in the 80s in
some polls. The booming economy is keeping voters content with the
status quo. An electoral rebellion does not yet seem in the air,
although cleaning up Washington and tossing out the rascals has a
certain universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be old hat these days, but he is still here. And he
still has an overstuffed agenda and a cheerful countenance. To see
him chattering away on television, you'd never guess he was almost
bounced from office only a year ago. His foes ignore him at their
peril; for a has-been, he's still very much present tense.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to make a major speech Wednesday putting forth
the case for expanded trade with China, an issue on which both
parties in Congress are divided. It will be one of the key votes of
the session, and if it passes Clinton will get some of the credit.
If it loses, he will blame the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he met at the White House with congressional leaders
who could, if they would, break the legislative logjam over gun
control. He tried to utilize the outrage over the Feb. 29 killing
in a Michigan school of Kayla Rolland by another 6-year-old by
pressing the lawmakers for a compromise. Although the issue remains
intractable, the president gets an A for persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Clinton keeps up his international diplomacy
by going to India, a vast, impoverished nation with which we have
often had tense relations. He will also visit Bangladesh and
Pakistan. We will soon see pictures of him posing at the Taj Mahal.
Hopefully, he will not imitate President Lyndon Johnson and yell
``Yahoo'' in the place.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton doesn't deserve credit for the recent House vote to let
more senior citizens earn as much as they can without losing Social
Security benefits, a move so popular it had heavy bipartisan
support. The Senate is expected to follow suit soon. Clinton has
said he will sign the bill, wrapping up the first legislative
achievement of the new century and giving him another forum in
which to act presidential before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   It does not seem likely there will be many more such
achievements. Some congressional Democrats prefer stalemate, in
hopes it would signal to voters that Republicans are no good at
running the place and that it's time to return Congress to the
Democrats. Some Republicans feel the same way, for other reasons _
they don't like compromising and would rather send Clinton bills
they know he will veto to clarify their differences with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP leadership is inclined to feel that a record of some
accomplishment, no matter how marginal, sells best at the ballot
box even if they have to share some of the credit with Clinton. So
there is still hope.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is said to be worried about his legacy and hoping to
make up this year for the rotten year he had in 1999, when the
Senate refused to convict him of obstruction of justice and another
charge in connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   He has the good sense to be solidly behind his vice president's
campaign for president. Gore in the White House could protect
Clinton against further criminal prosecutions by extending a
pardon. Gore in the White House would continue Clinton's favorite
programs and policies, unlike the Republicans who would dismantle
what they could.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a given that a president supports his own party's
nominee to be his successor. Ronald Reagan, who never did care much
for Vice President George Bush, stayed out of Bush's 1988
presidential campaign. Johnson undercut his veep's 1968 campaign,
afraid that Hubert Humphrey would not resolve the Vietnam war but
that Richard Nixon would. LBJ, of course, regretted that decision
when Nixon later ignored him and failed to end the war for several
more years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is musing sadly about life after the White House, and
what to do with it. Until that time comes, Clinton is being his
irrepressible self.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO ANNOUNCE ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Treasury Department plans to roll out its heavily promoted
anti-money laundering program Wednesday as part of the Clinton
administration's effort to combat international financial crime.
</P>
<P>
   In what it bills as a ``national money laundering strategy for
2000,'' the Treasury Department will offer an array of legislative
and regulatory initiatives aimed at money laundering, including the
designation of metropolitan areas deemed as high-risk zones for
such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas that the Treasury Department will cite as
particularly attractive to money launderers are metropolitan New
York, Los Angeles and San Juan, Puerto Rico, according to people
with knowledge of the initiative. Other metropolitan areas are
expected to be added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said that the
Clinton administration plans to ask Congress for broad new powers
to combat money laundering, including the authority to ban
financial transactions between U.S. banks or brokerage houses and
offshore financial centers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's proposals will flesh out the domestic component of
the initiative, and will call for greater coordination between
financial regulators and federal, state and local law enforcement
officials to help combat money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comprehensive strategy to fight money laundering,''
said Rep. Nydia M. Velazquez, D-N.Y., who has worked closely with
the administration on its proposal. ``For the first time we are
coordinating the activities of various regulatory and law
enforcement agencies charged with combating money laundering.''
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering refers to the practice of filtering profits
from illegal activities through banks to disguise their origin.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal will call for enhanced scrutiny of the
role played by accountants, lawyers and other professionals who
participate in financial dealings that might involve money
laundering. It will also establish milestones for judging how
adequately banks and brokerage firms are monitoring suspect
accounts and suspect transactions at their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a response to heightened awareness of money
laundering abuses that emerged in the wake of last year's
disclosure that $7 billion in suspect Russian funds had moved
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's anti-money laundering proposal has been
criticized by some in Washington as being too little, too late. The
House and Senate Banking Committees already have submitted
anti-money laundering legislation and members of both committees
have been working closely with one another to craft a compromise
bill. That legislation would place a greater burden on financial
institutions to police money-laundering problems themselves or be
penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House has made some efforts to work with
those crafting the congressional legislation, those involved in the
talks said that the Clinton administration has provided little
feedback on those bills.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, which prefers the Clinton administration's
proposal to legislation introduced in the House and Senate, has
argued that there are already adequate legal and regulatory tools
in place for battling money laundering and that further regulation
will put banks in the United States at a disadvantage with
competitors abroad.

TALKING UP A STORM: TV DIALOGUE WITH A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a two-hour movie, the average screenplay runs 120 pages.
Maybe 125. For ``A Few Good Men,'' Aaron Sorkin's weighed in at
149. For ``Schindler's List,'' on which he did a final ``dialogue
polish'': 183 pages. And when he delivered the first draft of ``The
American President'' to director Rob Reiner five years ago: a
sumo-class 385 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely fell in love with the sound of my own voice,''
Sorkin admits.
</P>
<P>
   The writerly ringleader of ``Sports Night'' and ``The West
Wing'' does like to talk. Fast. If there were a speed limit on
elocution, he'd be ticketed whenever he opened his mouth. Most of
his characters talk the same way. Faster than a politician in a
frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Talk fascinates Sorkin. It's what made him become a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have stories to tell,'' he says, quite serious, his
words spilling out between glottal stops and piling on top of each
other like slices from a Salad Shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't. I'm desperate for stories to tell. What I love
is the sound of dialogue and the music of dialogue. It's what I
like to write.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the chat-happy style of ``Sports Night'' and ``The
West Wing'' is as appealing as waxy yellow buildup. But to viewers
who can't stomach another punchline with canned laughter, or
another pregnant pause that delivers diddly, Sorkin has become TV's
newest Ubermensch.
</P>
<P>
   With an ego that steps nimbly between confidence and arrogance
while frantically avoiding the inevitable tide of writer's
insecurity, Sorkin likes the attention. There aren't many writers
who don't. Not even the reclusive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone accused me of writing as if I'm perpetually on a first
date with a girl I really want to have a second date with,'' Sorkin
says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't dispute it. Both ``Sports Night'' and ``The West
Wing'' have an ingratiating eagerness that's not unlike a splash of
Hai Karate: A little goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the (writing) experience is very much like a date,''
Sorkin says. ``It's not unusual that I'm really funny here and
really smart here and maybe showing some anger over here so she
sees maybe I have this dark side. I want it to have been worth it
for everyone to sit through it for however long I ask them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people who get paid to watch TV think Sorkin's work is
worth sitting through. In the latest poll of television critics by
the trade publication Electronic Media, ``The West Wing'' was
ranked No. 1 and ``Sports Night'' No. 5, ahead of such audience
favorites as ``The Simpsons'' (No. 6), ``Friends'' (No. 13) and
``ER'' (No. 17).
</P>
<P>
   It definitely has to do with the writing. His scripts are so
full of dialogue that paying attention is a course requirement in
Sorkin 101. Of course, high praise is hollower than a ``Veronica's
Closet'' episode if the only people paying attention are TV
critics. ``Sports Night'' has never been a big ratings winner for
ABC, and while good buzz from critics occasionally saves a
struggling show from exile after its first season, a second
reprieve is rare if the show doesn't show a trend that its audience
is building. Since its debut in 1998, ``Sports Night,'' a half-hour
dramedy about the people who produce a cable sports show, has
improved a bit, but its albatross is a tendency to lose much of the
audience delivered by its lead-in show, ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' Networks
hate to see that, considering it a serious breach of team ethics
even if the two shows are about as compatible, well, as Dharma and
Greg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing,'' a first-year show that airs on NBC, has done
better, currently tied with ``Ally McBeal'' for 29th in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorkin has little control over who's watching in either
case. That doesn't make him any less fidgety. He smokes cigarettes
as fast as he talks and has the overall demeanor of someone on the
Juan Valdez All-Caffeine Diet. But you'd be buzzed too if you were
the main man, the principal writer, on two network TV shows. For
those keeping score, that's 44 episodes in a span of 36 weeks,
September to May.
</P>
<P>
   The only other person doing that right now is David E. Kelley,
with ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Sorkin said he spoke with Kelley and learned that
Kelley is a Zenlike master of personal discipline. Sorkin recalls,
``He said, `Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I write `Ally McBeal,'
Thursday, Friday, Saturday I write `The Practice,' Sunday I'm with
my wife and kids.' And I thought, I have a real schedule, too.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday I freak out cuz I haven't thought of
what next week's show is. Thursday I start yelling at people
because I haven't thought of what next week's show is. Friday I go,
`Ohmigod, there's going to be a half hour of dead air on ABC next
week,' and then it finally gets done.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of ``The West Wing,'' Sorkin admitted to some
serious sweat stains at the prospect of failing spectacularly. But
he's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nuts not to think it's the opportunity of a lifetime,''
says Sorkin, who will be 40 next year. ``I'm not crazy. This whole
thing may end with everyone realizing I bit off more than I could
chew to the peril of not one but two network television shows. But
it's not going to end with me saying, `This is too much work, I'm
tired.' Somehow it's going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Sorkin gets it done is unorthodox for TV. If Kelley is
the master of well-ordered compartmentalization, Sorkin is the
master of miracles out of chaos. He flies so close to the edge that
he usually has no idea what next week's episode will be when this
week's episode is being shot. It can make for ill-advised plot
developments, such as having Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman) come
up with the goofy idea of requiring that the guy who loves her date
other women before committing to a relationship with her on
``Sports Night.'' Or, on ``The West Wing,'' giving the president of
the United States a form of multiple sclerosis because he needed to
be bedridden in one scene.
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, one of the creative types behind the success of
``ER'' and now head of a production company responsible for ``The
West Wing,'' jokes that Sorkin's seat-of-the-pants approach can be
exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get him to be more like me,'' says the
jacket-and-tie-wearing Wells, ``and he tries to get me to be more
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin, given to faded jeans and dark V-neck sweaters worn over
white T-shirts, doesn't expect to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very
moment that I have to. It's dismaying to John,'' he admits, ``but I
don't sit down and think to myself, `This is what the person had
for breakfast when they were 5. This is sort of the book on this
person.' ... I like to answer those questions at the very moment
that it's being dramatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the neon example of Sorkin's penchant for winging it is
the first meeting he had with Wells, a lunch arranged by his agent
even before ``Sports Night'' had debuted to critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This will be a nice lunch to have.' Well, I went
there and almost as soon as I sat down I realized John Wells is an
awfully busy guy. He's expecting me to pitch him something. He's
expecting me to have an idea of some sort that I think might be of
interest to him. And so, on the spot, I started saying, `What about
the White House ...?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was the obvious thing to say. ``The American President,'' a
breezy, feel-good film about a widower president who falls in love
with a lobbyist, had been Sorkin's most recent project. And having
boiled down that first draft from 385 pages to something more
manageable, Sorkin still had lots of material that never made it
onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born ``The West Wing,'' a weekly drama that makes
politics almost noble and government almost human. (Sorkin is
heavily into wish fulfillment.) Martin Sheen plays the president,
married this time and surrounded by smart, capable people you'd
want to take home to meet the family. No one-dimensional slimy
villains here, at least not in the regular cast. No wacky
neighbors, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dramatic mileage in a character incapable of
certain things,'' Sorkin says. ``What I prefer is that everybody I
write is capable of being smart, stupid, mean, nice. ... It's not a
clambake every week, but what there is is a great respect for
someone else's mind and their heart and their ability to do a good
job, and I'm attracted to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin, born in Manhattan and raised in the suburbs, has been
attracted to writing since childhood. But not just any kind of
writing. Playwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing television, writing movies, was as foreign to me as
writing an opera would be,'' said Sorkin, whose college degree is
in musical theater and whose first full-length play, ``A Few Good
Men,'' opened on Broadway in 1989, when he was 28.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a head-spinning decade: a successful
Broadway run, a movie adaptation of the play in 1992, another film
(``Malice'') the following year, ``The American President'' in
1995, ``Sports Night'' in 1998 and ``The West Wing'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the three films have grossed about $400 million for
their makers, and ``The American President'' alone pretty much
changed Sorkin's life. It directly spawned ``The West Wing'' and
indirectly led to ``Sports Night,'' which he dreamed up in the L.A.
hotel room where he watched endless editions of ESPN's
``SportsCenter'' while writing ``President.'' To top it off, he met
his wife, Julia, at Castle Rock, the studio that produced ``The
American President.'' As Sorkin tells it, she was the lawyer
responsible for paying him as little money as possible for his
screenplay, and he would remind her of it when they were house
hunting. ``I'd say, `You like that house? You want to live there?
You can't! You want to know why?'''
</P>
<P>
   Don't shed any tears for the guy. As executive producer and
writer of two network television series, Sorkin can probably afford
the high-priced spread. And the playwright who knew nothing about
TV, and who still assumes he'll return someday to the New York
stage, is smitten with the almost immediate gratification he gets
in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were writing a screenplay right now, I could write a joke
and not hear a laugh for another two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking a script is still a challenge, though. (In that
385-page version of ``The American President,'' he realized on page
90 that he still hadn't introduced the woman into the story.) It's
the downside of liking dialogue so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the storytelling elements there are, plot is the one
I'm least comfortable with,'' Sorkin says. ``I wish that we lived
in a world where we could be entertained by a half hour's worth of
crackly dialogue and nothing else, because plot frightens me a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, happily for Sorkin's fans, annoyingly for his
detractors, is some windy preaching that seems to wag its finger at
the viewer the way a parent might. Sorkin insists he's not telling
anyone to eat his vegetables. ``The things that I write need to
respect the properties of dramatic writing, and that's all,'' he
says. ``The speechifying on `Sports Night,' the speechifying on
`West Wing' are there for the purposes of drama.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``When people talk, as they tend to do in things that I
write, they tend to be hypercommunicative, which is to say they
can't shut up. It's not for the sake of winning your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those viewers who devote Web sites to the mistakes they
spot in each episode of Sorkin's shows, he confesses he's not a
stickler for research. ``I really don't care about reality,'' he
says, ``only the appearance of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin will often make up an entire workplace language just to
keep the audience leaning forward, trying to keep up with the
dialogue. It's why some viewers don't like his work, but Sorkin
isn't apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make the audience chase me,'' he says. ``Involving the
audience, making them a participant in the experience, is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're out of breath after a half hour of ``Sports
Night'' or an hour of ``The West Wing,'' now you know why.

   VATICAN: POPE'S APOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican formally presented a document outlining the
theological background for the sweeping apology for historical
errors of the church the pope plans to deliver on Sunday. Officials
said the pope is expected to express regret for mistakes committed
by Catholics over the past 1,000 years, including the Inquisition
and acts against Jews.

   Broadcasters lost a bid to televise the trial of two Libyans
accused of the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988 that killed 259 people. Judge Lord Macfadyen of the Edinburgh
High Court ruled that televising the trial, to begin in May in the

   TURKEY: WATER TALKS
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah of Jordan arrived in Ankara for talks that are

   President Jacques Chirac has denied a plea for a pardon on
medical grounds from Maurice Papon, 89, the former Vichy official
sentenced to 10 years in 1998 for his role in helping to deport
thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps. It is widely believed that
Papon's attempt to flee the country rather than begin serving his
sentence influenced Chirac's decision.

   Rafael Caride Simon, 54, convicted for terrorist activities, was

 &HT;    Entrepreneur sees Internet as platform for connecting
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frank Baia, chief executive officer of Atlanta-based
Globalspeak, is an experienced advertising man and business
publisher, but his newest business is cutting edge _ a multimedia
platform for staying in business touch and doing transactions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Globalspeak, in existence a year, gained notice several weeks
ago with its Webcasts of the troubled Seattle conference of the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``While so much of the attention was on the demonstrations
around the meetings, we allowed people to focus on the real
business,'' said Baia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did not dodge the controversy _ in fact we deliberately
provided a forum also for the
</P>
<P>
   protesters, and for economists who wanted to answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the journalist side of him that suggested the controversy
and the proceedings were important, but that neither should cancel
out the other.
</P>
<P>
   Providing a platform is the main business of Globalspeak, says
Baia, anaffable man who believes that the communicating side of the
Internet is one of the keys to growing business-to-business
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the company's Internet site, Globalspeak.com, shows
directories of business news, heavy on international events, as
well as an offering of Webcasts and similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proudest moments in Globalspeak's young life took
place last July when the company worked with the Commerce
Department, the Small Business Administration and Commerce's
International Trade division to link American businesses via the
Internet with Nigerians to explore trade opportunities. All this
was done via live Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed businesspeople to learn and also present
themselves, in a convenient way that will be more common in the
future,'' Baia said.
</P>
<P>
   Arranging these meetings by way of broadband technology will
allow businesspeople and trade specialists to learn and do business
in unique ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, evolving technology will allow executives to watch
a trade conference by way of online video, identify a likely
business contact and signal that person to get online for
interactive discussions and transactions, even as the conference
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING THE SHOW
</P>
<P>
   It is an example, Baia said, of how the technology will soon
move the technology specialists aside and allow businesspeople to
run the show and capitalize on the opportunity the machines and
networks represent.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business the way Globalspeak likes it, he said, consists
of standing back and letting the participants hold forth _ much
like the way C-SPAN covers public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the very important added ingredient, allowing for
interaction, so it's not just performers and viewers, but
interaction among participants that all belong to the event,'' Baia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baia dates his earliest business experience to the 1970s when he
ran an advertising business in South Florida with a number of
partners, including Atlantan Dan Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him experience in formulating business concepts and in
learning the value of communicating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Baia sold his business and semiretired to the
Rome, Ga., area and the life of a gentleman farmer of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to circumvent wealth and go straight to happiness,''
Baia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived a pleasant life there with my designer cows and
chickens, Rhode Island Reds,'' he said, all the while ignoring the
smirks of his farmer neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious side, he was really drawn to the North Georgia
economy, including the old manufacturing base in his area and
related businesses in carpeting, poultry and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a business magazine, the Coosa Valley Review, and
got drawn into trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time we began to appreciate the fact that businesses up
there needed opportunities to expand their markets overseas, and at
the same time, tap into import businesses abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The critical importance of the two-way nature of trade relations
led him and his partners eventually to explore the Internet as a
base for international contact.
</P>
<P>
   Farther out, in terms of his online business concept, there will
be free-flowing electronic procurement sites, auctions, in effect,
where supplies and goods can be obtained at optimum prices 24 hours
a day, Baia said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Globalspeak can have roles as communications
platforms, he says, offering live exchanges, or archived or
recorded programs.
</P>
<P>
   With the thought to expanding its reach, Globalspeak, which has
offices here and in Los Angeles, is talking to C-SPAN about access
to public affairs material that can be a part of the business
information mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before long we will have the full business experience
available online,'' Baia said, ``including virtual plant tours,
demonstrations of technology, machines and products of all sizes
and types.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he said, can be compared to the interstate highway
system, complete with high-speed, nonstop roads and bridges, except
it's global.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now time to let businesses and the business imagination
take over from the highway builders,'' he said.

BNSF-CN MERGER PLAN HITS SOME SLOW ORDERS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bold plan to unite two national freight railroads
_ one in the United States and the other in Canada _ to form the
biggest network of tracks and trains in North American history ran
into stiff opposition on Tuesday from shippers, competing railroads
and members of Congress who told regulators that the merger would
cripple service and dampen competition.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual day of hearings before the Surface Transportation
Board, the federal agency that regulates railroads in the United
States, witnesses painted a gloomy picture of how the proposed
merger of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and the Canadian
National Railway Co. would force the remaining large railroads in
both countries into another round of consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time such mergers ended, several witnesses predicted,
only two national freight railroads would be left to serve the
entire North American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure my great-grandfather would have liked that, but we in
West Virginia do not,'' said Sen. Jay D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat
from West Virginia and a critic of the railroads who testified at
Tuesday's hearing. Rockefeller complained that few of the service
improvements or cost efficiencies promised in mergers that occurred
over the last five years had been realized, and he does not expect
much to come of the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., did not oppose the merger on its
own merits. ``On paper, the proposed merger looks great,'' he told
the board. ``But I ask you to withhold approval of the merger until
comprehensive plans to deal with the kinds of short-term problems
and the long-term problem of real competition are put forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern and Canadian National announced in December
that they would seek regulatory approval to combine their two
systems into a single 50,000-mile network reaching into most states
and provinces. The executives of the railroads said the combined
system would allow them to improve service because they could ship
bulk goods like coal and manufactured goods like automobiles across
country, and across borders, without having to switch lines.
</P>
<P>
   But many shippers, annoyed by long delays and costly mix-ups
that continue to plague railroads in the United States, have not
embraced the merger proposal, and neither have the competing
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers think we're nuts to start a new round of mergers
today,'' said Richard K. Davidson, chief executive of the Union
Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and the executives of the four other so-called Class I
North American railroads urged regulators to impose a moratorium on
mergers for up to five years to give the industry and shippers a
chance to digest the last round of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation, said he did
not believe a moratorium was ``the right response.'' Instead, he
urged tightening performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings, which are to continue through Friday, focus on the
proposed merger, but they were intended to serve as a review of the
future of the railroad industry. Although the Burlington
Northern-Canadian National proposal was made public last year, a
formal application cannot be filed until at least March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, Linda J.
Morgan, said in an interview that she intended to listen to all the
testimony and then decide whether the board should take any action
before the merger application is filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a message,'' she said, ``about how the board is
going to handle this application and how it is going to handle
further consolidations.'' Morgan had previously refused to rule out
a moratorium. On Tuesday, though she was careful not to tip her
hand, many of her questions touched on the effect that a delay
would have on railroad stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad stocks have been hit hard lately. By one count, the
major rail lines have dropped a total of 25 percent since
mid-December, an equity loss calculated at about $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of the merging railroads argue that it is unfair
for them to be judged on the failures of their competitors to pull
off their own mergers. Paul M. Tellier, president of Canadian
National, told the board that this merger would not inevitably lead
to others unless those mergers also made economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a moratorium, Tellier invited the board to impose
additional service standards to ensure that the merger does not
cause disruptions. The two railroads have already guaranteed
shippers in writing that they will bear financial responsibility
for any losses that occur because of the merger.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The subpoena landed on the editor's
desk on a Friday afternoon in February. It ordered him to appear
before the country's Human Rights Commission, which was
investigating racism in the media. It said he must account for his
newspaper's reporting or face up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the commission issued 36 such subpoenas to editors _
white and black _ of newspapers, radio and television stations. And
in a country where freedom of the press was only recently enshrined
in the constitution, where newspapers were frequently closed and
journalists arrested under the apartheid regime, the subpoenas
inevitably sent shivers through the newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `My God,' '' said the editor, Phillip van Niekerk,
who is white and who runs The Mail &AMP; Guardian, a weekly newspaper
in Johannesburg. ``I really didn't expect them to go that far. The
jackboot approach is something we thought we'd got away from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the outcry that ensued, the subpoenas were withdrawn and the
editors agreed to appear voluntarily before the commission. van
Niekerk and other white editors say they're willing to discuss the
issue; they just don't want to be forced to discuss the issue.
Nonetheless, the hearings on racism in the media, which started
this week, have stirred a roiling debate over whether the
commission and the government of President Thabo Mbeki are seeking
to stifle criticism and dissent in the press.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Mbeki and his ruling party, the African
National Congress, remain deeply suspicious of the white-dominated
news media. ANC and government officials, who helped write the
country's liberal constitution, say white journalists seem intent
on discrediting the black government and typically disregard issues
important to the black majority.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's politically influential newspapers,
including van Niekerk's Mail &AMP; Guardian, are run by white editors.
There are also several popular newspapers directed at black
readers, of which the largest is the daily tabloid Sowetan.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, the ANC and commission members deny that they want to
muzzle the media, but they rarely sugarcoat their critical views.
The ANC, for instance, applauded the commission for issuing the
subpoenas. Last month, in its annual report, the ruling party
described the media as a ``hostile press'' that is ``still
primarily owned and controlled by antagonistic forces with minority
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But those opinions are increasingly shared by black editors. At
Tuesday's hearing, five black editors broke ranks with their white
colleagues to support the commission's investigation, which has
been largely derided by whites. The black editors testified that
the media still portrays blacks as corrupt and incompetent, focuses
almost exclusively on the white minority and drowns out the stories
and concerns of ordinary black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our contention that in a country like South Africa, it
simply cannot be right that, because of its dominance in the media,
a minority should continue to set the public agenda,'' said Mike
Siluma, editor of Sowetan, the nation's largest daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe very strongly that, in the interest of the country,
a way will have to be found to ensure that this group's dominance
of public debates is reduced and the black majority, especially the
African component in it, has a voice commensurate with its
numbers.'' The black editors said the issue was so important that
they would have willingly testified under subpoena, which stunned
their white counterparts, who had unanimously attacked the
subpoenas as an infringement of press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about a rainbow nation, but we're still living in
different places,'' said van Niekerk. ``We still occupy different
head space.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the editors, both black and white, battled racism and
apartheid in South Africa and suffered for it. In 1988, van
Niekerk, who worked at for what was then The Weekly Mail, saw his
newspaper shuttered for several months because the government
decided the newspaper had portrayed ANC guerrillas favorably.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Peter Sullivan, who is white and is now the editor
of The Star, who then worked for the liberal Rand Daily Mail and
was forced to justify his reporting before a government commission
in the 1970s. And Aggrey Klaaste, the editor-in-chief of Sowetan,
who is black, was jailed for six months in 1977 after the
government closed what was then Sunday World.
</P>
<P>
   All three men run influential newspapers. All agree that the
commission's interim report on racism in the media, which was the
foundation of the investigation, was seriously flawed. The report,
for instance, criticized a photograph of two black birds sitting
near an overflowing garbage can, saying the birds depicted
Johannesburg's black downtown and the garbage can its decay.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that the subtle racism and stereotyping described in
the report continues to surface in newspapers and television and
radio broadcasts. ``We mirror a very racist society,'' Sullivan
said. ``If there was no racism in the media, it would be absolutely
astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the similarities end. The white editors say
they are already working hard to hire blacks and improve coverage,
and that the commission's investigation was, for the most part,
unnecessary. The black editors disagree.
</P>
<P>
   After this week's hearing, the commission will present its
recommendations to Parliament. ``People must not pretend that
things are normal when they are not,'' Klaaste said. ``The country
is run by white people, economy-wise. These newspapers are run by
white people. We know that. There's no point in trying to be coy
about this kind of thing. They say there is racism in the media,
but they say that and do nothing about it.''

</P>
<P>
   The commission began looking at the issue two years ago when the
Black Lawyers Association and the Association of Black Accountants
called for bias inquiries into two papers, including van Niekerk's
Mail &AMP; Guardian. The groups pointed out that The Mail &AMP; Guardian
had written 14 times about allegedly corrupt blacks but only 4
times about whites.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists counter that that should not be surprising since the
most government officials these days are black.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that the major newspapers have also given Mbeki
some favorable coverage. Mbeki and Trevor Manuel, the finance
minister, both received rave reviews last month for their state of
the nation and budget speeches. The Mail &AMP; Guardian, in its
evaluation of the new government, gave Mbeki an A- for his first
few months in office.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's statistics, progress has been made
in the hiring and promotion of blacks, but whites still
overwhelmingly dominate the top tiers of management. Last year, the
commission said, about 76 percent of the country's top media
managers were white as compared to 88 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But whites are not the only ones to voice concerns about Mbeki's
commitment to freewheeling discussion and critique. Earlier this
year, two black professors complained about what they described as
the dampening of dissent within the ruling party in a column in the
recently revived Sunday World newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Trevor Ngwane, an ANC councilman in Johannesburg,
was suspended from his party positions for publicly criticizing the
ANC-led council's planned privatization of government services.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Mankahlana, a spokesman for President Mbeki, says the
Human Rights Commission, an independent body that reports to
Parliament, is no mouthpiece for Mbeki. Last year, he notes, the
commission sharply criticized the government for seeming to scale
back the rights of accused criminals and initiated an investigation
into the government's policy against the distribution of the
anti-AIDS drug AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Mankahlana emphasizes that it was the black government, not the
white government, that gave this country its first constitutionally
protected rights to free speech.

MAKE LENT PAINLESS WITH THIS SACRIFICIAL `MISS LIST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As kids, my brother and sisters and I would always have to give
up five pleasurable things during Lent as a sign of our Christian
self-discipline. I once promised to give up lentils till my mom
reminded me I had never eaten lentils in my life. Still, it became
a game among my siblings and me to forgo something we wouldn't
really miss. In that spirit of sacrifice on the EZ plan, I hereby
abstain from the following during this Lenten season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence.'' After panning the first few episodes last year,
I confessed that I'd somehow become addicted to this weekly taste
of treacle, maybe because I grew up in Rhode Island. It certainly
wasn't because of the writing, which Melina Kanakaredes praised
effusively at the TV Guide Awards Sunday night, but which is about
as engaging as the fine print on a car-rental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' The party's over. Time for
Regis to pack it in and go looking for a successor to Kathie Lee. I
realize he just signed a new big-bucks contract with ABC, which
means ``Millionaire'' will overstay its welcome by a factor of
jeezlouise, but when I'm surfing these days and I come across the
all-too-familiar set with its high-tech gloss and overwrought
music, my reaction registers somewhere between torpor and
phlegmaticness. This is partly good, because I like to use the word
phlegmatic, but bad for ABC because I hit the remote faster than
you can say, ``Is that your vinyl ant, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal.'' Hard to believe I used to rearrange my schedule
to see this show. Now Monday night rolls around and I don't even
remember it's on. Maybe it's just me, cuz the show is still Fox's
most-watched, but I prefer to remember the likable characters from
the first season, not the unpleasant narcissists they've become.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files.'' Don't tell anyone, but it actually became the
``Ex-Files'' for me sometime last season. Maybe it was the move to
L.A., maybe it was just the ennui creeping in during the sixth
season. Or maybe the truth really isn't out there in the ether.
It's in ``Roswell,'' on The WB.

CLINTON, CITING CONCERNS OVER KASHMIR AND TERRORISM, TO VISIT
PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to follow; See also PAKISTAN-U.S.) 
 (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arguing that important national security interests
would be jeopardized if he stayed away, the White House announced
Tuesday that President Clinton would visit Pakistan ``for a few
hours'' at the end of his lengthier trip to India later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which came after weeks of fierce in-fighting
within the Clinton administration, was based on the need to urge
the Pakistani military government to work toward resolving the
heightened conflict with India over Kashmir and to clamp down on
terrorism, senior officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been described by his aides as confident that he
could personally engage the new Pakistani military leader, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, and decided that he should go.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government had made virtually no progress on any
of the three major requests that administration officials laid out
for Musharraf during a visit in January _ to shut down a particular
terrorist group, to agree to a timetable for the restoration of
democracy and to improve its record on nonproliferation, the
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But they asserted that it was most important to ``keep the
channels of communication open'' so that Clinton could develop the
kind of relationship with Musharraf that enabled the president to
persuade the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to back down in
Kashmir last year.
</P>
<P>
   A White House statement tried to dismiss the notion that
Clinton's presence in Pakistan would confer legitimacy on the
military government, which came to power in October, an argument
that was made by anti-terrorist experts at the State Department and
elsewhere in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will go to Pakistan because the Pakistani nation
is a friend, not because he approves of, or acquiesces in, the
government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It also added that Clinton was not going to mediate the Kashmir
dispute, an idea that India vehemently opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In order to differentiate between Musharraf, to whom Clinton
will try to deliver a stern message, and the people of Pakistan,
the administration is exploring the possibility of the president
addressing the nation in a television address, a senior
administration official said.

AN UNUSUAL PATH TO OPERA, WITH ROSSINI AS GUIDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CORI ELLISON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not many rising opera stars would choose to make
their New York recital debuts singing chamber music, and
little-known Baroque chamber music at that. Yet that is what Vivica
Genaux, an American mezzo-soprano, plans to do Monday evening at
Weill Recital Hall.
</P>
<P>
   With Chatham Baroque, a period-instrument group, she will delve
into cantatas and arias by Bononcini, Handel, Scarlatti, Vivaldi
and the obscure 18th-century Spanish composers Pablo Esteve and
Antonio Literes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, little about Genaux's career has been conventional.
Now 30, the mezzo has hurtled from her 1994 professional debut at
the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee to a dramatic debut at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1997 and regular appearances in international
musical centers. And although she has performed around the globe,
her career trajectory has been uncommonly focused; the brunt of her
activity has been nearly 100 performances of the same three lead
roles, in Rossini's ``Cenerentola,'' ``Italiana in Algeri'' and
``Barbiere di Siviglia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few seasons, Genaux has begun judiciously expanding
her repertory to 17 roles, most of them bel canto. She has made a
vivid impression at the Caramoor International Music Festival in
Katonah, N.Y., bringing her winning combination of daredevil
vocalism, keen musicianship and personal magnetism to cherishable
concert performances of Rossini's ``Cenerentola,'' ``Donna del
Lago'' and ``Gazza Ladra'' and Donizetti's ``Lucrezia Borgia,'' all
conducted by Will Crutchfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great asset for Vivica is that the timbre of her voice is so
individual,'' Crutchfield said. ``That's a real plus, because a
distinctive voice lasts in the memory of listeners as part of their
experience of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Genaux's concentration on bel canto has been so consuming that
her more recent forays into the Baroque and French repertories seem
colossal leaps. Having tested the waters with Handel's
``Ariodante'' in 1998, she added Hasse's ``Solimano'' last year and
is tackling Vivaldi's ``Giustino'' and Handel's ``Arminio'' this
year. In 2001, she is to record Baroque arias with Rene Jacobs and
Concerto Koln, and to take on her first Monteverdi opera, ``Il
Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, `When are you going to sing something other
than Rossini?''' the sylphlike Genaux said recently, polishing off
an implausibly hearty stack of French toast in a Georgetown hotel
the morning after a Kennedy Center performance of Handel's ``Giulio
Cesare.'' ``I said, `Rossini is not just ``Barber.''' My recitals
and recordings of his songs and arias are a real statement. Rossini
is very diverse.'' She is scheduled to appear in four more
productions of ``Barbieri'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her Mediterranean looks and her Swedish given name,
Genaux was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1969. Her father, of
Belgian descent, was a biochemistry professor at the University of
Alaska and her mother, of Swiss-German extraction, was a language
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Genaux studied violin, piano and dance, but it was
her stint as Eliza Doolittle at 13 in a summer camp production of
``My Fair Lady'' that sealed her fate.
</P>
<P>
   She started on a practical path, studying genetics at the
University of Rochester. But by her sophomore year, she had
transferred to Indiana University and enrolled in the studio of the
soprano Virginia Zeani and her husband, the bass Nicola
Rossi-Lemeni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graduated as a soprano in 1991,'' Genaux said. ``But when I
was preparing to start auditioning, I couldn't find five soprano
arias that would work for me. Plus I didn't identify with soprano
characters. They were too woe-is-me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of my lessons with Miss Zeani, I was singing `Come
scoglio,' and really laying into those low triplet runs. She said,
`My dear, if you want to sing this way, you must be a
mezzo-soprano.'''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that she would starve awaiting the odd ``Carmen'' or
``Barbiere,'' Genaux scoured the card catalog of Indiana
University's record library for mezzo roles. ``Then I realized the
writing had been on the wall,'' she said. ``When I played violin, I
always wanted to play second violin, and I always loved viola. When
I sang in choir, I always wanted to sing alto because I loved the
inner harmonies. And mezzo characters are so much fun, so clever
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   She auditioned for the Ezio Pinza Council for American Singers
of Opera, which sponsors an annual summer school in Oderzo, a small
town outside Venice. There, she met Claudia Pinza, the great
basso's daughter and the organization's director. Pinza swiftly
became a vital mentor, and in 1992, after the first of Genaux's
four summers in Oderzo, she moved to Pittsburgh to continue
studying with Pinza.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on MOnday, Dec. 15, 1997, Genaux's manager phoned,
saying that the Met had inquired about her availability to sing
Rosina in ``Barbiere'' that Wednesday evening and in the Saturday
broadcast. Genaux worked with Pinza for an hour, and at 5 p.m. they
called to accept the offer. Genaux arrived in New York at midnight,
and reported to the Met on Tuesday morning for a rehearsal with a
smattering of cast members and covers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, after meeting her colleagues Simone
Alaimo, Dwayne Croft and Bruce Ford for the first time, she stepped
on stage to face a sold-out house primed for the Met debut of the
heralded Bulgarian mezzo Vesselina Kasarova. One of those classic
performers' nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really fun,'' Genaux said. ``We had a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was in Alaska, I went to the place where we
used to go blueberry picking. You're on this hill and there are
mountains here and there, then a rock outcropping so far down you
think you'll never get there. But you just keep walking, looking at
the flowers and picking blueberries, enjoying every step you're
taking. So that's my philosophy in life, too. Enjoy the steps for
themselves, for what they are.''

RELEASE OF EXIT POLL DATA IS DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to stop early leaks by online publications, the
organization that conducts Election Day exit polls delayed the
release of its findings Tuesday by two hours. The later
distribution caused hardship for some subscribers in the news
business that depend on the data to help devise news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter News Service, whose exit polling is jointly
administered by ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, CNN, Fox News Channel
and The Associated Press, pushed back the release of its first wave
of polling information from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. ET. The action was
taken, news executives said, because Web sites like Slate and the
National Review's NR Online had disclosed the numbers hours before
the polls closed on recent primary election days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is, the dot-coms have broken the rules,'' said
Roger Ailes, chairman of the Fox News Channel. ``The 4 o'clock
release is just an effort to shut down the leaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the surveying organization had sent letters both to
Slate and to the National Review, demanding that they stop
publishing the data. Tuesday, neither site posted the numbers
early.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay caused other problems. Rich Morin, director of
polling for The Washington Post, said the decision was not only
inconvenient, but ``it punishes people who have used the data
responsibly in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained, for instance, that in its coverage of the Virginia
primary last week, the Post found a gender gap in the statistics
from the earliest exit polls, which allowed the newspaper to
dispatch reporters in time to prepare an article for the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our corporate counsel made several phone calls eloquently
expressing our displeasure,'' Morin said.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the service's governing board were not subject to
the delay; it affected only subscriber organizations across the
country, including The New York Times.

SENATORS QUIZ INS HEAD ABOUT HIRING MORE BORDER PATROL AGENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators criticized the head of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service on Tuesday for her agency's failure to hire
as many Border Patrol agents as mandated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives?'' asked Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. ``Why can't
we get some people employed?''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came during a hearing before a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee considering INS's 2001 budget request.
The $4.8 billion proposal, an 11 percent increase from this year's
budget, includes funding for 430 new agents next year instead of
the 1,000 required each year under a 1996 law intended to beef up
the Border Patrol by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican who helped push
the law through Congress, called the shortfall ``appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded INS Commissioner Doris Meissner that half of the
drugs and illegal immigrants coming into the United States from
Mexico passes through Texas, and two of Mexico's four largest drug
cartels, the Gulf and the Juarez cartels, operate along the Texas
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can't let up. Four hundred and thirty new agents is not
enough. It is not sufficient,'' she said. ``I don't want to
micromanage your agency ... but we are frustrated because we have
been very clear in the mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., warned
that he might seek cuts in the Border Patrol's administrative
budget if the agency doesn't hire more agents and purchase new
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is going to take that very seriously,'' he
said. ``We do have the final say in this exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said hiring remains a high priority for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did fall behind last year,'' she said, ``and we need to
make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the booming economy has made recruiting Border Patrol
agents difficult because of competition from other law enforcement
agencies. However, she assured committee members that if her agency
cannot recruit enough agents by a June 1 deadline, it will make
good on a promise to put the money currently earmarked for new
personnel into efforts to retain veteran agents.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the INS has almost doubled in size since
1993, and nearly one-third of the new personnel planned for next
year will be Border Patrol agents. Next year's budget request also
sets aside $40.9 million for promotions and pay increases for
existing agents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and other committee members acknowledged that Meissner
has requested funding for more agents, only to be thwarted by the
Clinton administration, which they said has ignored congressional
efforts to make controlling the country's borders a priority. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Texas senator also praised Meissner for taking the
subcommittee's suggestion to increase testing and recruiting of new
agents along the border. But she said the agency should also
consider giving hiring bonuses to bilingual agents, rather than
sending non Spanish-speaking recruits to a Spanish school in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can continue to work together,'' Hutchison told
Meissner, ``because we're not succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in opening remarks to the committee, Meissner cited
several Border Patrol accomplishments, including Texas' Operation
Rio Grande and Arizona's Operation Safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two years of Operation Rio Grande, an effort to
crack down on drug trafficking and illegal immigration in South
Texas, apprehensions in the border city of Brownsville fell by more
than 160 percent, she said. The numbers continue to decline, she
said, falling another 45 percent so far this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said, the agency has improved services for people
seeking to immigrate legally, cutting in half the average
processing time, from 28 months in 1998 to 12 months in 1999. This
year, she said, the agency is committed to reducing the waiting
time to an average of six months.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also has made progress in detaining and deporting
immigrants who commit serious crimes, Meissner said. Since 1994,
the number of criminals in INS detention has quadrupled to more
than 12,000, while the number of criminal immigrants removed from
the country reached 63,000 last year, more than double the number
deported in 1994.

DOW SUFFERS FOURTH-LARGEST SINGLE-DAY DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A vulnerable Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 4 percent
of its value Tuesday after a warning of lower profits by Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co. fed into investors' fears that rising oil prices and
interest rates would slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 374.47-point decline was the Dow's fourth-biggest drop in
one day and pushed the index to its lowest closing since March 31,
1999. The Dow finished the day at 9796.03.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly invulnerable Nasdaq Composite index, which had
soared more than 100 points to just over 5000 in the morning,
eventually gave in to the Dow's downward pull. The Nasdaq began to
fall after nervous investors in technology stocks cashed in some of
their enormous profits. The index fell 57.01 points, closing at
4847.84.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's decline came as investors were reminded of twin
threats to the nation's economic expansion. The down day coincided
with a surge in US crude oil prices, to more than $34 a barrel, and
came a day after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan restated
his intention of cooling the economy by continuing a policy of
boosting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq's muted reaction to the Dow's plunge
reflected a growing belief among investors _ still unproven _ that,
if the economy slows, the high-tech companies that dominate the
Nasdaq may be insulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in uncharted territory,'' admitted Bruce Addison, branch
manager of the Boston office of First Union Securities. ``The
height of the market, the new psychology of Internet day traders,
online traders, people rolling money out of value funds and buying
growth stocks _ it's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's fall was a dramatic reaction to a surprise
announcement from Procter &AMP; Gamble that profits would be
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer products giant said profits in the March quarter
would fall 10 percent from last year, rather than rise more than 7
percent as the company had earlier forecast. Profits are expected
to rise in the fourth quarter. Procter &AMP; Gamble blamed rising
prices for raw materials, especially paper pulp and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch then downgraded the entire consumer products
sector, depressing stocks such as Colgate-Palmolive and
Kimberly-Clark, triggering a fall in the Dow, an index of big,
blue-chip industrial and financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Local consumer products stocks also suffered. Gillette Co., the
shaving giant, fell 2 7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange to 32
7/16. Staples Inc., the office supplies retailer, dropped 13/16 to
19 3/8 on the Nasdaq. Overall, the Bloomberg Massachusetts index of
local stocks closed down 7.68 points to 397.14, after hitting a
record Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Procter &AMP; Gamble announcement ``makes everybody think
potentially this could happen to anybody,'' said Manuel Weiss,
portfolio manager for the Putnam Investors fund, which has $14
billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why investors reacted Tuesday to oil prices, which
have been going up for months, Weiss suggested, ``maybe investors
had not quite put into their estimates the impact of $30 oil'' on
company profits. ``Suddenly, today everybody started thinking, `Oh
boy, maybe we have to be more cautious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Only Exxon Mobil Corp., a beneficiary of higher oil prices, and
Microsoft Corp., which seems immune, kept the Dow from falling
farther. Exxon Mobil gained 8 1/16, to finish at 81; Microsoft rose
2 1/4, to 92 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index fell as investors took profits in a basket of
stocks that had risen by 5 percent in March alone. Despite
Tuesday's decline, the Nasdaq has gained 19 percent this year,
while the Dow is down nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see nervousness with a drop this big,'' said Larry Rice,
chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon &AMP; Ross, referring to
the Dow's drop. ``But I'm not considering a 60-point drop in Nasdaq
anything to be concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the Nasdaq's continued strength despite Tuesday's
swing, Kevin Park, chief equity officer of Massachusetts Financial
Services, said the technology industry is not a ``single industry''
whose stocks will, necessarily, rise or fall together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so much of the market lumped under one banner
headline,'' Park said. But, ``there are multiple layers and
multiple industries within the sector. Parts are probably
overvalued and parts aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said some technology stocks, including Oracle, LSI
Logic, and Norwood's Analog Devices, are expected to report strong
first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals which have been driving this market are still
intact,'' said First Union's Addison, ``But expect more
fluctuations and more wild swings.''

GERMANY WITHDRAWS ITS CANDIDATE FOR IMF MANAGER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Capitulating to demands from the United
States, Germany on Tuesday withdrew its candidate for managing
director of the International Monetary Fund but proposed someone
who may not be much more popular.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing diplomatic defeat, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder agreed not to push for Caio Koch-Weser, his deputy
finance minister and a former World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
   Koch-Weser took himself out of the running on Monday, more than
a week after the President Clinton essentially vetoed his candidacy
on the grounds that Koch-Weser lacked the stature to run the
international institution.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to regain some stature himself, as well as make sure that
a German obtains the job, Schroeder is now proposing Horst Koehler,
head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
   Though respected, Koehler is not a particularly well-known or
prestigious figure in international financial circles. It remains
unclear whether he has the support of other countries within the
European Union, and American officials remained aloof when his name
surfaced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over who will lead the International Monetary Fund,
which provides financing to countries in economic difficulties, has
become a prolonged squabble over political entitlements and
national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the IMF director has been a European _ a
Frenchman for 32 of the last 37 years _ while the top post at the
World Bank has been reserved for an American.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a broader effort to project a bolder German profile
on the world stage and move beyond Germany's chronic postwar
shyness, Schroeder has been determined to have a German succeed
Michel Camdessus of France, who retired last month.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Schroeder and other German officials had insisted
that they would not back down from their support for Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   But French leaders were hostile toward Koch-Weser from the start
and wrestled for months with German leaders before finally agreeing
to support him as a the consensus European candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of IMF members taken last week, Koch-Weser received
support from only 43 percent of IMF members, though he came in
ahead of the other two candidates: Stanley Fischer of the United
States and Eisuke Sakakibara of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Koehler oversees an institution that provides loans to
the formerly communist nations of central Europe. It is in some
ways a small version of the World Bank, devoted largely to lending
money for public projects.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be a problem: one of the American objections to
Koch-Weser was his background with the World Bank and a suspicion
that he would support development projects rather than
straightforward economic assistance.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA JUDGES TO GET THEIR VOTE IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservative Republicans failed in a last-ditch
attempt Tuesday to block a vote on federal judge Richard Paez, who
has waited a record four years for the Senate to decide on his
nomination to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Paez picked up support from a key Republican,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before debate on Paez's nomination began, Sen. Jeffrey
Sessions, R-Ala., urged Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to delay
the vote to allow an investigation into Paez's sentencing of former
Democratic fundraiser John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Huang pleaded guilty last May to raising $7,500 illegally from
U.S. employees of the Lippo Group, an Indonesian company owned by
Mochtar Riady, a friend of President Clinton. Federal law forbids
foreigners to donate money to U.S. political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, sentenced
Huang to one year of probation and allowed him to avoid answering
questions on the origins of more than $1 million in suspect
contributions he brought to the Democratic National Committee. The
DNC later returned the money to Huang.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Sessions' complaint about Huang's light sentence,
Lott refused to call off the Paez vote, saying that unless
``specific evidence'' showed Paez did something illegal, the judge
would get his chance before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Paez faces a close vote. Although he has won the support of all
45 Democratic senators, most of the 55 Republicans oppose him, and
he needs a majority to win. But in addition to Hatch, five other
GOP senators are said to be leaning toward his confirmation. They
are Robert Bennett of Utah, John Chafee of Rhode Island; James
Jeffords of Vermont; Gordon Smith of Oregon and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could come down to one or two votes,'' said David
Sandretti, spokesman for Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who fought
to bring Paez's nomination and that of his fellow Californian,
Marsha Berzon, to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer specializing in federal appeals
cases, is also up for a seat on the 9th circuit appeals court,
which covers California and eight other Western states. The vote on
both nominees is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republican senators have also objected to
Berzon, a member of the board of the American Civil Liberties
Union, saying she is too liberal. But she is said to have more
support among GOP senators than Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, said just before the Senate debate on the pair
that he thinks both ``are bad nominees.'' Lott added, ``The 9th
Circuit is badly out of touch with mainstream America (and) has
been overruled many times because of extremely liberal decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Senate floor, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said
appointing Paez and Berzon to that court would make a ``terrible
situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also contended that Paez is a judicial activist,
refusing to fully enforce laws that he disagrees with. ``When you
get a judge who tries to change the law because he doesn't like it,
that's when you have a rogue elephant who wreaks havoc on
society,'' Sessions said during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch said in a statement that ``Judge Paez has earned a
good deal of bipartisan support within his home state of California
and his native state of Utah and has given me his word that he will
abide by the rule of law and not engage in judicial activism.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees he
has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer agreed, saying, ``These are two exceptionally qualified
nominees who have had to wait far too long.'' Berzon was nominated
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Paez, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
said before the debate, ``It's a travesty of justice that someone
has been asked to put their life on hold for four years.''

 &HT;    New Delta ads highlight simple pleasures
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A passenger wanders into an airport ice cream shop and
idly enjoys a cone. He has the time for such pleasures because he
used an e-ticket and avoided airport lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check in at the curb and go straight to the plane,'' the ad
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the television spots in Delta Air Lines' new ad
campaign, which debuts this weekend. It's the first by the
Atlanta-based airline's new agency, Leo Burnett Co., which created
United Airlines' old ``Fly the Friendly Skies'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta ads eschew a single slogan or theme in favor of
airport vignettes and fill-in-the-blank bag tags that focus on
simple passenger needs.
</P>
<P>
   Many spots close with personalized bag tags in which passengers
have scribbled in their desires. The accompanying narration or copy
touts Delta's efforts to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly ... understood,'' reads the tag at the end of a TV spot
featuring a cluster of passengers around a baggage carousel, each
of whose priorities are described in a handwritten note
superimposed next to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly ... like an '80s bond trader,'' reads the tag in a print
ad for Delta's BusinessElite international service, with its cushy
seats and lavish legroom.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign debuts this weekend during the NCAA basketball
tournament on CBS, as well as in major magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to highlight the customer and the basic experiences
that affect them,'' said Martin White, vice president of consumer
marketing at Delta, whose ad account is valued at about $100
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see airplanes or seats or food,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a slogan, theme song or other easy-to-remember hook
is a departure for Delta, still known by many for its ``We Love to
Fly and It Shows'' campaign from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's last campaign was 1997's ``On Top of the World'' spots,
with new age theme music and narration by actress Christine Lahti.
It was created by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, of New York. Delta switched to
Leo Burnett last year.
</P>
<P>
   White said Delta and the agency have been in a ``listening
mode'' for several months, conducting thousands of passenger
interviews. He hopes the ads will convey Delta's eagerness to
respond to passengers' basic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brand-building, some spots tout specific
products, such as e-ticketing, the Delta Shuttle or BusinessElite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than just doing a soft brand campaign, we wanted some
to have a very strong tactical message about our products,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign kicks off a company-wide brand update that may even
entail changes to the paint scheme on Delta's planes, according to
a Leo Burnett briefing sheet. But a Delta spokesman said there are
no firm plans to alter the paint scheme. Delta is still at work on
a fleetwide re-painting launched in early 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the week since another child was shot to death
in an American school, there has been plenty of maneuvering on gun
control in Washington, but little movement.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more clear than Tuesday when President Clinton,
after meeting with lawmakers in a highly publicized Oval Office
session that was billed by the White House as an effort to break a
months-long impasse on gun legislation, met as well with the mother
of the slain 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Clinton urged Congress to shatter the
legislative stalemate and pass far-reaching gun-control laws before
the first anniversary next month of the shootings at Columbine High
School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past eight months, the leaders in Congress have done
virtually nothing to complete a final bill,'' Clinton said after
meeting with four key lawmakers, an event the White House labeled
an effort to broker a compromise. ``Congress has kept the American
people waiting long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the president met with Veronica McQueen, the
mother of Kayla Renee Rolland, the 6-year-old girl who was fatally
shot last week in her first-grade classroom in Michigan by another
6-year-old who had brought a pistol to class.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they invited McQueen on Monday when
they heard she would be in town for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, were steaming afterward, accusing Clinton
of wielding them as an election-year prop. ``We were there to be
used,'' fumed one senior House Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control promises to be a politically hot issue in both the
presidential and congressional campaigns this year, and both
opponents and supporters are blaming each other for the delay in
resolving the legislative logjam.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cited new Justice Department statistics Tuesday
showing that the number of youths killed with a firearm increased
sharply from 1987 to 1993, while other types of homicides remained
constant.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate approved different gun control bills after
rancorous debates last year. But legislators in the two chambers
are deeply divided on the restrictions, especially on regulating
gun shows, and have yet to reconcile them in conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton signaled a willingness to support a modified
version of a compromise proposed by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who
heads the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyde's plan, vendors at gun shows would have up to 24
hours to conduct mandatory background checks of prospective gun
buyers. If the check turned up a potentially disqualifying arrest
or felony conviction, the vendors would have three days to perform
the checks. The National Rifle Association opposes this plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hyde proposal is a substantial movement away from just the
total, what you might call the complete NRA position,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Senate Judiciary
Committee, has refused to convene the conference committee of House
and Senate negotiators until gun-control supporters relent on their
demand for a three-day waiting period on all sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put everybody together so people can shout
political epithets at each other,'' Hatch told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of caving in to NRA demands to
keep the conference bottled up. ``We want to lay our cards on the
table; they do not,'' said Julian Epstein, the Democratic staff
director of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hyde and Hatch, the two ranking Democrats on the
judiciary panels, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, attended the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he would
back a less sweeping bill that included provisions that enjoy broad
bipartisan support, like child-safety trigger locks and a ban on
imported large-capacity ammunition clips. ``There are some gun
provisions that make good common sense,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would oppose
legislation that failed to close what the president called ``the
gun show loophole.''

 &HT;    BellSouth a takeover target to some analysts
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The road to respectability may lead through the air.
</P>
<P>
   With increased pressure on BellSouth to do something, news of
talks between the company and SBC aimed at a combination of the
companies' wireless offerings have set the stage for what could be
a series of major announcements in a critical year.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on BellSouth does not come from losses or even slowing
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is additional scale, on one hand, and new
technologies on the other that are being rewarded by analysts and
investors. In a kind of tectonic shift, mergers are moving the
world of telecommunications from an archipelago of regional
companies toward a handful of super players spanning the globe.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, say voices from industry and Wall Street, must expand
to compete. The buzz from the company's Campanile building
headquarters in midtown Atlanta is that BellSouth will respond with
announcements in a range of businesses, from entertainment to
international units.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless might be a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Word that San Antonio-based SBC and BellSouth are talking leaked
out of a recent meeting between SBC and analysts. Together, their
wireless network would reach more than 175 million potential
customers in 31 states. They would be bigger than AT&AMP;T Wireless,
the second-largest network. For BellSouth, long the most
conservatively managed of the seven regional phone companies
created in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, the partnership could trigger
a flood of new capital, revamp its image and preserve its
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be the first step to being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will talk publicly about it, but industry
analysts find the notion appealing _ even compelling. Andrew Cole,
vice president at Renaissance Worldwide, is emphatic. ``SBC and
BellSouth have absolutely no choice. They should have done this a
year ago. They are at a significant disadvantage, and they must
also join with a significant ally which has a European wireless
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   One European power, Deutsche Telekom, has reportedly been
talking to Qwest Communications, a long-distance and high-speed
lines company in which BellSouth owns a stake. Qwest itself was
about to merge with local phone company U S West, and analysts
wonder whether Deutsche Telekom wants to buy both.
</P>
<P>
   They also assume that the German company will not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analysts predicted Tuesday in a report that
``BellSouth would probably become the next major U.S. acquisition
for DT after Qwest/U S West. DT will want to buy BellSouth before
SBC Communications, Bell Atlantic, AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom can get to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible suitors. For instance, Spain's
Telefonica is aggressive, and _ like BellSouth _ has ambitious
Latin America investments.
</P>
<P>
   A wireless deal with SBC might accelerate things, wrote
PaineWebber. ``We believe that a DT acquisition of Qwest/U S West
and the announcement of a domestic wireless merger between
BellSouth and SBC Communications would cause investors to look at
(BellSouth) as a takeover target, not as a buyer of Qwest.''
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber projects BellSouth reaching $60 a share within a
year and recommends buying the stock.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE IS IN THE AIR
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is already considering creation of tracking stocks,
nonvoting equities that would be sold separately from the company's
existing stock. The idea is that wireless and international are
valuable properties that would draw tremendous investment if they
were not weighed down by the currently sagging valuations given
local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has precedent _ along with financial allure.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint created a wireless ``tracker'' whose value was about $54
billion at the close of trading Tuesday. AT&AMP;T is about to launch a
wireless tracking stock that could become the biggest public
offering ever. Nextel, a purely wireless company, has a value of
$45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If other wireless companies are any guide, the market awards
anywhere from $7,000 to $11,000 in value for each subscriber a
company has. By that measure, BellSouth's 5.3 million wireless
customers _ more than Sprint _ should easily be worth more than $40
billion. An SBC-BellSouth wireless combination, with 15.4 million
subscribers, could be worth a staggering $125 billion. Currently,
BellSouth as a whole has a market value of about $82 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest potential for the alliance is among Latinos
_ both within the United States and outside, said Perry Walter,
analyst at Atlanta's Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has investments in nine Latin countries, including
Brazil, the region's largest economy. SBC has investments in the
second-biggest market: Mexico. In the United States, the most Latin
cities _ not counting New York _ are on SBC or BellSouth turf.
``SBC and BellSouth could combine their domestic and international
businesses,'' Walter said. ``Think of the power of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a marriage partner, BellSouth comes with an enticing dowry.
Within its nine-state region, BellSouth is pre-eminent as a
wireless provider. The company believes it has about a 40 percent
share in many of its major markets, despite the crowd of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's advantage has been twofold.
</P>
<P>
   First, it held one of the first two wireless licenses in most
markets. Second, its wireless business gets an incalculable boost
from BellSouth's long-time dominance in local service through most
of the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   But that still isn't enough by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least so say analysts who, with a steady drumbeat, pound
home the idea that regional players will be marginalized or
absorbed. Despite the current profitability of regional wireless
offerings, customers increasingly will demand far-reaching coverage
that can be provided only by global players, they say.
</P>
<P>
   National carriers will increasingly hurt BellSouth in several
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, they will steal some customers. Perhaps as bad,
national players are more likely to carry a call when their
customers roam into BellSouth turf, depriving it of even a piece of
the payoff. About three of every four wireless users are now on a
handful of national networks, said analyst Mark Lowenstein of the
Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   And while BellSouth may argue it can compete by forging
``roaming'' agreements across the nation, bigger players will need
BellSouth less for their own customers, he said. ``When you see a
BellSouth or SBC subscriber roaming onto other networks, the
national providers will be less willing to give them good roaming
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   An alliance holds out the hope of an attractive roaming deal, at
least on SBC turf.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agree. BellSouth stock has languished for a
year while companies that have launched a national wireless
strategy _ Nextel, Sprint _ have scored impressive valuations. News
that SBC and BellSouth might be cooking up a wireless alliance
quickly juiced BellSouth stock into a 25 percent increase.
BellSouth closed Tuesday at $43.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   With regional phone companies retaining near-monopolies, the
logic of globalism has not yet reached the bottom line. BellSouth
last year reported $25.2 billion in revenue and $3.4 billion in
profits. But the future seems to be rushing toward BellSouth _
ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sparked a thunderous series
of mergers and acquisitions, and the noise has yet to subside. A
few companies are emerging as behemoths in the game. In the United
States, it is AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, SBC and MCI WorldCom, which has
an agreement to buy Sprint. Each is working toward a national
wireless ``footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there is Nextel, strictly a national wireless
player. And there are independents like VoiceStream and Powertel,
which deploy a technology known as GSM for nearly 5 million
customers. In that group there has been consolidation, too, and
analysts expect eventually at least a loose national alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless is also becoming more than just calling home from the
traffic jam to check on the kids.
</P>
<P>
   New generations of phones can send and receive data, and link to
the Internet. Moreover, plenty of other devices _ from Palm Pilots
to refrigerators _ will soon be equipped with wireless links.
Information, more than conversation, could be the most common and
lucrative use of wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Any arrangement between BellSouth and SBC ought to take that
into account, said Joe Laszlo, analyst for Jupiter Communications.
``It would make a lot of sense to include not just roaming for
voice, but roaming for data services as well. First, you are going
to see this targeted at business travelers. Even the consumer
market, I think, can see data services as a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's not just about talk.
</P>
<P>
   The device in the consumer's and professional's hand will be a
portal to a host of uses, the way desktop computers are now, Cole
said. ``All the electronic-commerce and mobile data will be done
that way. The world is moving away from wireline toward wireless,
and you will see it in substantial numbers within 18 months or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing new entrants that focus on data, telecom players must
have a wireless gateway, he said. ``The war of the portals is
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Both SBC and BellSouth have kept mum. And certainly any
tentative deal could collapse. After all, the companies several
years ago danced to the edge of a merger only to back away. Yet
even a wireless pact may be just a step toward something more
definitive, said Elliott Hamilton, vice president of the Strategis
Group. ``Ultimately, an alliance won't get either company what it
will need.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see the talks with SBC as prelude to radical
shifts, perhaps even a trisection of the company into wireless,
international and Southeast units.
</P>
<P>
   Any grand deal would have to pass muster with the Justice
Department and FCC _ and regulators might balk, said analyst Marc
Bacurin of J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. SBC has already swallowed two former
Bells, as well as Southern New England Telephone. Regulators
accepted those mergers, as well other huge deals, but this one
might set off alarms by paring the number of regional Bells to
three. Combined, SBC and BellSouth have lines into customer homes _
and market dominance _ in nearly half the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are almost reconstructing AT&AMP;T,'' Bacurin said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive F. Duane Ackerman has
been assuring employees that he still believes BellSouth stock is a
great bargain. He is scheduled to speak Friday to the company's
96,000 workers via video hookups, although company officials say he
has no special news to announce.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman is slated to talk about BellSouth's strategy.

SCIOSCIA'S SIMPLE REQUEST: PLAY HARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; TEMPE, Ariz.  &UR; _ &LR;  He will not hug his players, as one of his old
managers used to do. He will not pick an argument with an umpire
just because the game is on national television. He will not
appoint himself third-base coach during an Angels slump in the
belief that more of Mike Scioscia will make everything better.
</P>
<P>
   He sure hopes the TV camera will never catch him cussing in the
dugout, but he's an emotional guy, and if it happens, it happens,
you know?
</P>
<P>
   He will not spit tobacco juice. Chewing tobacco is one baseball
tradition he has never revered. The occasional bubble gum will be
his only vice on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He will neither allow the computerized matchup statistics to
dictate his strategy nor scorn the benefits of technology for macho
effect. He'll look at the printouts when appropriate in the late
innings, but they won't stop him from calling for Troy Percival in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He will not rant and rave in clubhouse meetings  &UR; _ &LR;  though,
again, he's an emotional guy, so we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   He will figure out if he's a bunting, base-stealing, hit-and-run
type of manager or a wait-for-the-three-run-homer type of manager
only after the roster is set and he assesses his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, 41, the old Dodgers All-Star and playoff hero,
begins his rookie season as a major-league manager determined to be
himself, not to worry about matters of image or style or
personality any more than he did as a somewhat bottom-heavy
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the same manager as I am a person. I think
I'll be an easy read,'' Scioscia said in his spring-training office
at Tempe Diablo Stadium as his green digital-watch dial registered
9:00 Tuesday morning. ``I'm myself. I'm not going to change. I
don't have another side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real simple philosophy about this game, about having
guys show up on time, about practicing hard, about preparing
yourself to play the game and about playing the game hard. That was
my makeup as a player and in that essence I'm just being myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you learn from experience, but hopefully the
experience isn't going to change who you are. If it does change who
you are, you might not be as true to your philosophy as you thought
you were.
</P>
<P>
   ``!ital!That,'' he said sharply, summing up, ``is my style.''
</P>
<P>
   He is simple but not simplistic, a product of The Dodgers Way as
taught to him by Roy Campanella and Johnny Roseboro and Del
Crandall. His conversation is 90 percent baseball and 10 percent
food.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's experience with major-league managers consists of 13
years playing for and observing Tom Lasorda. His own experience is
a year in the Arizona Fall League and a year at Class-AAA
Albuquerque before seeing no future with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Lasorda, that's for sure. But he learned from Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was big on creating an atmosphere where you wanted to come
to the ballpark and work as opposed to him having to order you to
work,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   His own psychological ploys are elementary. Such as the way he
has found to inject some fun into the team meetings that are a
necessary evil in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called on guys to get up and talk about themselves, their
families, their hobbies,'' said Tom Candiotti, the knuckleball
pitcher who has worn the same uniform as Scioscia the Dodgers
player, Scioscia the Dodgers bench coach and now Scioscia the
Angels manager. ``One kid loves to cook; Mike had him make 30
enchiladas for the coaching staff. He had another kid paint new
name signs for the parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now (teammates) know more about each other than what's in the
media guide. We can say, `Hey, those enchiladas were lousy, go back
and try again.' It brings the club together.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team that finished 70-92 under Terry Collins and Joe
Maddon in 1999 amid much clubhouse turmoil, the lighter mood is a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that also has a new general manager and a For Sale
sign in the windshield, a steady personality is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a plus that, for the first time since the end of Buck
Rodgers' reign in 1994, the Angels' manager had a significant
major-league career, giving Scioscia instant credibility with the
players. He doesn't have to put on airs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always been the same, a solid baseball guy (with) no
ego,'' said Kevin Kennedy, the former Texas Rangers and Boston Red
Sox manager who has known Scioscia since 1982, when Kennedy was a
Dodgers farm instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Staying that way will be the key to happiness for Scioscia, win
or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with not being a manager right now because I stayed
true to myself,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose? Scioscia will have plenty of obstacles to think
about on the 70-mile commutes to Edison Field from his Thousand
Oaks home.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup with Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds will be hard
to blow out of any game. But the Angels pitching staff might be up
to the task. The starting rotation has almost as many 1999
victories as Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Staying true to yourself and your philosophy might be easier
when it's the first week of the Cactus League than when it's
August, you're 10 games out and the car radio is wondering why the
Angels didn't hire Don Baylor.

<P>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan _ At the end of a rutted dirt road and
through a metal gate lies the rundown local lair of an Islamic
fundamentalist group of holy warriors that the State Department has
classified as a terrorist outfit.
</P>
<P>
   From this grubby stucco house, young bearded men say they have
ventured into Kashmir to battle Indian rule of part of that
majority-Muslim territory.
</P>
<P>
   They boast that their volunteers have taken part in bold and
violent raids on Indian outposts in Kashmir. The raids are
contributing to the increasingly poisonous relations between India
and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 40 days' military training and three months of guerrilla
training, contact Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, Peshawar,'' said a banner
in Urdu that recently fluttered above a table loaded with the
group's literature on a street here.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials, citing intelligence reports, charge that
Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, or the Fighters Movement, does more than
wage jihad, or holy war, against India. They say it was behind the
kidnapping of Western tourists _ and the beheading of one _ in 1995
as well as the recent hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats have been urging the military government that
took control of Pakistan in a coup Oct. 12 to crack down on the
group. Pressure intensified after the hijackers of the Indian
Airlines plane demanded and won the release Dec. 31 of a Muslim
cleric who had been one of the group's spiritual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, Maulana Masood Azhar, returned to Pakistan after he
was freed from an Indian jail and immediately began speaking out
against India and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After Azhar appeared at rallies for several weeks surrounded by
heavily armed men, he was arrested by the Pakistani government. But
the government has taken no action against Harakat itself, saying
it has no evidence of the group's involvement in terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned when this fellow, Masood Azhar, made wild
statements calling for the destruction of India and the United
States, but this is not the policy of a group,'' said Pakistan's
foreign minister, Abdul Sattar. ``We don't have enough proof to ban
this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Islamabad say they doubt that a lack of
evidence is what is deterring Pakistan's military rulers from
clamping down. After all, for months now the same military
government has held several ministers from the elected government
that it deposed without charging them with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the diplomats assert, the government's reluctance stems
from the fact that these so-called jihad groups are the cat's paw
that the Pakistani military finances and uses to bleed India in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are instruments of Pakistan's foreign policy,'' said one
Western diplomat. ``They are the cards Pakistan brings to the table
with India. Without them the Pakistanis have no leverage. So they
see supporting these organizations as indispensable to the most
important foreign policy issue in Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether unable or unwilling to ban Harakat ul-Mujahedeen,
Pakistan's military rulers have apparently instructed those true
believers to cool their public statements and keep their talk of
holy war directed at India _ not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to calm down these groups within the limits of
the law,'' said Sattar.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The young men at the Harakat ul-Mujahedeen headquarters in
Peshawar hewed carefully to the group's line of thinking, which
echoes that of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler:
groups waging holy war are acceptable, but terrorism is not.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Mardan district, which borders Peshawar here in
North-West Frontier Province, who goes by the single name Abdullah,
insisted that Azhar was no longer a member of the group and that
the group had no interest in a jihad against the United States,
only against India.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no fight with Westerners,'' he said. ``There are so
many of them wandering around Pakistan. We never kidnap or kill
them. Our fight is with India.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, 28, a farmer's son, said his religious beliefs would
not allow him to speak directly to a female reporter, so the
interview was conducted through a male translator.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the bedroom where the interview took place were
illuminated by a single bare fluorescent bulb and decked with
posters of assault rifles and pointy-nosed fighter jets, as well as
a cracked, chipped full-length mirror that the young militants
presumably use to check the tilt of their woolen caps.
</P>
<P>
   The translator sat in the doorway, and Abdullah sat on a veranda
just outside the room, with the door pulled so he was out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   He distanced the group from Azhar and deferred to the government
on the question of why the cleric had been arrested. He denied that
the group received any material or operational support from
Inter-Services Intelligence, an arm of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know what ISI stands for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he was mystified as to why the Americans considered
Harakat ul-Mujahedeen a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes wonder why the United States has taken us as
their enemy,'' he said. ``We have no reach to do anything in the
United States. I see no reason why it should fear us.''

CLINTON URGES LAWMAKERS TO PASS TOUGHER GUN LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton urged lawmakers Tuesday to ``pass
the strongest possible'' gun-control legislation to help save the
lives of children, who he said are being killed by gun violence
around the country at the rate of 13 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled the federal statistic after meeting at the
White House with top-ranking Republicans and Democrats on the House
and Senate judiciary committees. He called on them to reach a
compromise on a gun-control bill that has been tied up on Capitol
Hill since last year and have it to him by April 20, the
anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more people have to get killed before we do
something?'' he asked later at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with the mother of a 6-year-old girl killed
last week in a Michigan classroom by a first-grader who brought a
handgun from home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the tragic death of Kayla Rolland to highlight a
Justice Department study showing that the number of minors killed
in firearm-related incidents increased sharply between 1987 and
1997, while the rate of other types of gun deaths remained
constant. More recent figures are not available. But Clinton said
the federal data, taken in part from a 1999 Justice Department
report on juvenile victims and offenders, indicates that 13 minors,
below the age of 18, are killed with guns every day in the United
States, either in accidents or crime-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he wanted Kayla's mother, Veronica McQueen,
to know that ``as a parent, my heart goes out to her and as
president, I'm going to do all that I can do to see that this
doesn't happen to other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped his meeting with Sens. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Patrick Leahy, D-Conn., and Reps. Henry Hyde. R-Ill, and
John Conyers, D-Mich., will help break the stalemate on Capitol
Hill over gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A bill requiring a three-day waiting period on firearms
purchases made at gun shows, mandatory trigger locks on handguns
and a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips passed the Senate last
year, but it was rejected in the House. Republican leaders opposed
to tougher gun laws have so far refused to allow a conference to go
forward between House and Senate members aimed at producing an
acceptable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the death of Kayla Rolland, Clinton said it was becoming
increasingly ``urgent'' that lawmakers do what they can to help
keep guns out of the hands of children, as well as criminals. He
said Congress ought to at least pass a law requiring trigger locks
on all handguns and a three-day background check at gun shows,
which would be in keeping with the current Brady Law that requires
a similar waiting period for firearms bought at commercial gun
stores and pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the gun lobby is cranking up pressure on Congress
again. But when first-graders shoot first-graders, it's time for
Congress to do what's right for America's families,'' Clinton told
reporters, complaining that lawmakers ``have done virtually nothing
to complete a final bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Washington are always talking about what we can't do
instead of what we can do. I'm not interested in talking about how
little we can do,'' Clinton said. ``I'm interested in how much we
can accomplish to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the White House meeting, Hatch, who chairs the
Senate Judiciary Committee, did not hold out much hope for a
compromise bill. He said lawmakers are divided over the issue of
tougher gun-control laws, especially when it comes to requiring a
three-day waiting period for purchases made at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're polls apart on what can or cannot be done. But we're
certainly going to continue talking,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the senator said in his view neither ``the tragedy in
Michigan'' nor the Columbine incident could have been avoided with
new gun-control laws. In the case of Kayla Rolland, he noted that
the gun used to kill her ``would have never had a trigger lock on
it anyway'' because it was kept in a ``crack house'' and
``improperly allowed to sit out where some kid 6 years old could
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of what we're talking about is going to solve that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disagreed, however. He said if guns can be kept out of
the wrong hands to begin with lives can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at gun shows, Clinton cited federal reports showing
that criminals are more likely to purchase weapons at gun shows,
where no background checks are required, than at commercial gun
stores where the waiting period covers three business days.

ICY, TART AND SUCH A NICE CRUNCH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started with a Champagne sorbet I had at Lutece a few
weeks ago. Compared with the complicated, swooping, architectural
desserts so much in vogue in top restaurants, the sorbet was
elegant and understated. It reminded me of a dessert I like to
order in Paris: a granite des pommes, with Calvados. It, too, is
simple and memorable: three scoops of apple granita flavored
(``baptized,'' some French waiters say) with an ounce or two of
apple brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Champagne sorbet actually a granita? I asked Lutece's
pastry chef, Eric Bedoucha. ``No,'' he said. ``It was sorbet.'' So
how, exactly, are they different?
</P>
<P>
   I asked some people I thought would know. A granita, one told
me, is ``some kind of iced coffee.'' Another said, ``You know, like
the lemon ice you get at the San Gennaro festival.'' In fact, it's
neither.
</P>
<P>
   Invented in Italy, granita is a coarse-textured ice dessert made
from fruit juice or espresso. The liquid is placed in a shallow pan
in a freezer and stirred every 30 minutes or so to prevent it from
becoming a solid block. The result is an ice with relatively large,
slow-melting crystals. (Sorbet, on the other hand, is usually
processed until the ice crystals are tiny and silken.) A granita's
flavor is fresh and long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, the locals prefer their espresso-flavored granita
layered with unsweetened whipped cream, and their fruit granita
tart. Other ways to enjoy it: drop lemon granita into iced tea, or,
after dinner, drizzle some grappa on top.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the granite des pommes with Calvados is a specialty of
the brasseries run by the Flo Group, which includes the famous
Brasserie Flo. For sentimental reasons, I like to order it at the
Terminus Nord, the company's brasserie near the Gare du Nord where
I first had it 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is intense and tart, and the color is pale green,
reminiscent of a ripe Granny Smith apple. The Calvados, or Calva as
everyone in Paris calls it, is good, solid apple brandy from
Normandy. It has an apple flavor and an ethereal apple bouquet that
blends beautifully with the crunchy apple ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Flo brasseries would not part with their recipe, but once
you understand what granita is, it's easy enough to replicate at
home. As for the Calvados, it is not hard to come by in this
country, but I am more than happy to use a good domestic apple
brandy like the one made by Laird &AMP; Co. Call it applejack, call it
Jersey lightning, it would be right at home in the Terminus Nord.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE GRANITA WITH CALVADOS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes' cooling, and 1 hour's
freezing and stirring
</P>
<P>
   4 large Granny Smith apples, cored, quartered and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 cups unsweetened clear apple juice
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   \ cup Calvados, or as desired
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a shallow metal pan in freezer. In a nonreactive
saucepan, combine apples, apple juice, sugar, lemon juice and salt.
Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered until apples are very
tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Strain mixture, pressing as much apple pulp as possible
through strainer. Cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour apple mixture into chilled pan; return to freezer. Stir
every 20 minutes until it thickens into coarse crystals, about 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   4. Stir granita and mound into small cups. Splash with Calvados.
Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 4 cups (4 to 6 servings).

INJURIES CLAIM DOCTOR ALLEGEDLY PUSHED DOWN STAIRS BY DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI AND JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREWSBURY, Mass. _ A distinguished forensic psychiatrist who
counseled prison inmates died at a hospital Tuesday, two days after
her 16-year-old daughter, whom friends described as emotionally
unstable, allegedly pushed her down a flight of stairs and beat her
with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Kathleen A. Thomsen-Hall, 44, was an assistant
professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School and an expert on criminal behavior, she was apparently
unable to protect herself from her own daughter's violent emotional
distress, according to her daughter's friends.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Valerie Hall, a junior at Shrewsbury High School, was
arraigned in juvenile court in Worcester on charges of assault with
intent to murder, use of a dangerous weapon, and drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester District Attorney John J. Conte said the case against
Hall would be presented to a grand jury next month, and the
teenager could be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear where Hall is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the teenager's friends noted the bizarre twist of fate
for Thomsen-Hall, who since August had worked as a clinician in the
women's prison at MCI-Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so ironic that Val's mom is a forensic psychiatrist,''
said Raymond DePalo, 18, a friend of Hall's. ``She worked with
murderers every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter had attempted suicide about a month ago by
overdosing on the medication she took to treat manic depression,
said DePalo and another friend of Hall's, 18-year-old Ryan Luby.
They said she had once before hit Thomsen-Hall, but that otherwise
mother and daughter appeared to have a loving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw this coming,'' Luby said. ``They had their good
moments and bad, like all families, but more good than bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's fights with her mother were typical adolescent dramas
that erupted over how late she could stay out or whether she could
have boys in her room, her friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Val loved her (mother), I know that,'' Luby said. ``That's why
this is the biggest shock in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Luby said he stopped by the family's house Sunday afternoon,
just hours before the alleged attack. Everything seemed fine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   `The only thing that was different was that Val was a little
mellow,'' Luby said. ``She told me she was on a new prescription
that was supposed to keep her calm and mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday about 8 p.m., police received a call from a distraught
female using a pay phone at a convenience store saying that a woman
had fallen down the stairs in a nearby home and needed an
ambulance. A spokeswoman for Conte said investigators later
determined that the caller was Valerie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police who responded to the call at the small blue wood-frame
home in a residential neighborhood found the doctor bleeding with a
weak pulse and took her to UMass Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, police in the nearby town of West Boylston
stopped a truck belonging to Hall's boyfriend, Joseph A. Fulginiti,
20, of Shrewsbury. Hall and Fulginiti were arrested and charged
with illegal possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Fulginiti is scheduled to make a court appearance on the drug
charges later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had been dating Fulginiti for about two months, according
to her friends, who added that her mother disapproved because he is
older and unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's father died when she was an infant, DePalo and Luby said.
She and her mother moved to Massachusetts from Little Rock so
Thomsen-Hall could accept a one-year fellowship in forensic
psychiatry at UMass Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   DePalo said that when Hall moved to town he and his friends
``took her under our wing, since she was the new girl.'' Though she
occasionally became depressed about boyfriend problems, she was not
violent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Luby added that police came to the house once a few years
ago when Hall hit her mother, and that the girl had been in trouble
with authorities in the past for marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Thomsen-Hall operated a private practice and
lobbied legislators to pass proposals on mental illness, said Paul
S. Appelbaum, chairman of the medical school's psychiatry
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathleen was a good person, and in many ways she was
remarkable,'' Appelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Thomsen-Hall, who had moved to the Bay State from
Arkansas the year before, was one of two Massachusetts
psychiatrists to receive the Exemplary Psychiatrists Award from the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unusually brave of her to make the decision to leave
private practice and become a student again,'' said Appelbaum,
referring to her fellowship. He said Thomsen-Hall had planned to
return to Little Rock after the fellowship, but decided to stay at
the medical school as a staff psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her death, she was working with Appelbaum on a
paper examining the treatment of substance abuse in the United
States in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged e-mails on Sunday, so you can imagine how shocked
I was to hear what had happened on Monday morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luby and DePalo said Thomsen-Hall was unusually relaxed and
friendly toward her daughter's friends. She listened to their
troubles and gave them odd jobs around the house so they could earn
spending money, Luby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like a mom to me. She always tried to help,'' Luby
said. ``We could tell her anything, and her daughter could always
talk to her.''

 &HT;    BellSouth to launch `repositioning' ad campaign
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth today is slated to announce a major
advertising campaign, a nine-month effort costing upwards of $50
million, to reshape the company's image among tech-savvy consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With ads that will run on television, as well as in newspapers,
magazines and on the Internet, BellSouth hopes to ``reposition''
itself for a world in which not only is there more competition, but
rivals from unexpected places, said F. Alan Blount, assistant vice
president for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is mostly limited to the Southeast, where BellSouth
does nearly all of its domestic business. But with the industry
moving toward consolidation and seemingly all business connecting
to the Internet, BellSouth is competing with everyone from AT&AMP;T to
America Online, from MCI WorldCom to Yahoo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the work of Merkley Newman Harty, a New York
City agency, whose clients include BMW Motorcycles, Forbes,
M&AMP;M/Mars and Pitney Bowes. Other parts of the campaign will be
produced by different companies but using similar themes and
presentation, Blount said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are a series of vignettes, snapshots and come-ons based
on a fictional town called ``Chatsford.'' All have a single
tagline: ``Connect and create something.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth considers Chatsford _ and its lead character Tyler
Webb _ tremendously successful in building its image in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chatsford was created in a very different environment,''
Blount said. ``This is really a repositioning campaign. What do you
want from your relationship with BellSouth? It's all about what do
you do when you connect.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, marked since its creation as a local phone company,
hopes to convince potential customers to think of it for all manner
of communications, from Web access and hosting to wireless service.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has typically been well-known and respected among
older consumers, who matured when there was but one phone company.
BellSouth feels it must shift its emphasis toward younger people
growing up as the Internet was sprouting and the marketplace was
becoming a loud and competitive free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign begins Thursday on NBC, continuing with ads that
run during the NCAA basketball playoffs. Each of the first four ads
are 30-second melodramas ending with a twist:
</P>
<P>
   _ ''Park Bench'' starts with a long shot of an apparently lonely
old man sitting on a bench.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Dinner Time'' catalogues one plugged-in family's many
devices and connections.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Store'' shows a nearly deserted urban outlet, its owner
sweeping an empty sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Skyscraper'' follows an apparently failed entrepreneur on
his way to the office.
</P>
<P>
   There will be ads in metropolitan newspapers, Rolling Stone,
Business Week and Martha Stewart Living. There also will be
billboards. All the ads will use the same kind of printing and the
same tag line. The company also means to revise many other things
that customers see _ packaging, in-store posters, sports marketing,
brochures and bills _ to convey the same feeling, Blount said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chatsford, the new campaign is understated despite its hope
of reaching younger customers. Blount said BellSouth believes the
relatively action-free ads are better than trying to copy the
frenetic ``dot-com'' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The company steers away from the explosive, in-your-face
approach of many new and hungry Internet players, Blount said.
``When you are shooting gerbils out of a cannon, you are going for
shock value. It's not a sustainable position, so it's not where we
want to be. There is confidence in the understatement.''

FEELING BURNED: FARMERS CONFRONT BIG TOBACCO, FRACTURING UNITED
FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Greg Hyman, a tobacco farmer from Conway, S.C.,
compares his dealings with cigarette manufacturers to a
relationship gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel used and abused,'' said Hyman, who recently joined
4,000 farmers and tobacco quota holders in a suit against the
companies. ``I feel like I've been misled and manipulated for the
past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The class action alleges that the nation's top four cigarette
manufacturers conspired to reduce farm income by manipulating the
quota system, which determines how much tobacco is grown and sold
in this country. The farmers also charge that the cigarette
manufacturers betrayed them in the $206 billion settlement the
industry reached with 46 states in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco executives for Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co.
deny the charges and promise to fight them vigorously in court.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its outcome, the lawsuit, filed last month,
highlights a growing fracture in what once was a solid alliance of
manufacturers and farmers battling tobacco foes. The lawsuit also
signals a shift in the political dynamics of the golden leaf. Both
tobacco foes and supporters say the lawsuit makes it harder for the
industry to defend its interests on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it desirable when the growers and the manufacturers are
pulling the plow in the same direction,'' said U.S. Rep. Howard
Coble, R-N.C., whose district includes both farmers and a Lorillard
plant. ``This certainly would make our position more awkward up
here if we had to choose between growers and manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco executives have long sought to align themselves with
farmers, knowing they remain a sympathetic political symbol on
Capitol Hill. Any time lawmakers talked about higher taxes for
cigarettes or further government regulation, tobacco executives
could be counted on to evoke the plight of the family farmers,
asserting that the hard-working men and women in the fields would
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, tobacco farmers like Hyman contend that the industry itself
is the source of much of their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to catching your spouse cheating on you,'' Hyman
said. ``That's how I feel.'' The farmers' lawsuit comes on top of
another lawsuit from a group of wholesalers who charge the
manufacturers with fixing prices, a claim the industry denies.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, president of the Coalition for Tobacco-Free Kids,
said the challenge from a cadre of angry farmers may be the most
significant the industry has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 4,000 farmers and quota holders who have signed onto
the lawsuit, however, are only a fraction of the farmers and quota
holders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The united front between tobacco growers and manufacturers is
crumbling,'' said Myers, who represents health advocates. ``There's
no way around it.'' Myers said the industry had used the farmers to
score political points on Capitol Hill while placing their
livelihood secondary to the industry's profits.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the coalition released a report that documented how
the large cigarette companies are increasingly using foreign
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit points to other disputes. Some farmers contend that
the tobacco corporations discouraged them from supporting
congressional legislation that would have tightened federal control
of tobacco and also established a $28 billion fund to help farmers
develop other crops. Under the subsequent settlement with the
states, farmers won a trust fund of $5.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As for the quota system, the farmers charge in the lawsuit that
the tobacco corporations acted as a ``cartel'' to control the
market and drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pires Jr., a Washington-based attorney for the
farmers, said the tobacco companies want to dismantle the
government quota system and exert direct control over the farmers,
a move that would decrease tobacco prices and increase profits. In
fact, Philip Morris is moving ahead to set up direct contracts with
some large tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guy has no friends anymore,'' Pires said, adding
that more tobacco farmers are joining the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pheil, director of communications for Philip Morris,
disputed that characterization. He said that his company remains
the largest purchaser of American-grown tobacco and continually
invests in research efforts to help farmers. ``We feel the lawsuit
is unfortunate,'' he said, dismissing it as the work of a
``relatively small group of farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of creating additional litigation and uncertainty in
the industry, we believe we should be working constructively to
find solutions to mutual concerns,'' Pheil said.
</P>
<P>
   For political leaders who have long supported the tobacco
industry, this latest lawsuit is troubling because there is no
obvious foe. North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said he believes tobacco
farmers and cigarette makers have been ``pretty good partners,''
and he said he doesn't believe the lawsuit reflects the thinking of
all farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that tobacco farmers remain the industry's
most powerful political weapon and a valued constituency on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important that the companies treat the farmers
right and treat them extra right,'' Hunt said. ``The American
tobacco farmers are basically the ones who keep them viable in this
American market. And they should always remember that. And they
should always go the extra mile to treat the farmers right and to
give them a little help whenever they can.''

 &HT;    Ansley Park mourns burned historic home
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis and S.A. Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chunks of Atlanta's past went up in smoke Tuesday in a
pre-dawn fire that destroyed one historic home and damaged two
others in Ansley Park, one of the city's oldest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The home at 34 Peachtree Circle was once owned by noted author
Pat Conroy, who lived there for about two years while penning ``The
Prince of Tides.'' Now a South Carolina resident, Conroy wrote the
novel in a garage apartment behind the two-story frame house, built
just six years after Ansley Park's founding in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   From his studio windows, Conroy could have seen the high-rise
buildings of Colony Square and the secret garden of his neighbor's
back yard, said Ginny Bales, who sold Conroy the home in 1983 after
she and her former husband spent seven years renovating the place.
The house is currently owned by Kay and Woodrow Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful house,'' said Bales. ``I always thought of
it as a grandmother-style house with that big front porch and just
the prettiest windows you've ever seen, with a star pattern above
them. It's a shame to see a house like that go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ansley Park began at a time when a new invention was beginning
to stretch the boundaries of Atlanta, said resident Eleanor
Edmondson, who edited ``Historic Living in Ansley Park,'' published
by the neighborhood's civic association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with Druid Hills, Ansley Park was one of the first
automobile suburbs of Atlanta,'' she said. Edwin Ansley, one of the
park's developers, built the Westminster Drive home that later
became the governor's mansion. The owners of the ill-fated Winecoff
Hotel were Ansley Park residents, as were the owners of Muse's
Department Store and the Inmans of Inman Park fame.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wells was clearly upset as he worked Tuesday to salvage
what was left from the piles of charred beams, flooring and
furniture on his muddy lawn.

 &HT;    Gap between blue-chip and `new economy' stocks continues to
widen
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investors have chosen sides in the last four and a
half months, during which so-called ``new economy'' technology
stocks have soared in price while ``old economy'' smokestack stocks
have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   This is reflected in the widening gap between the Dow Jones
industrial average, the blue-chip index that is down 15 percent so
far this year, and the technology-loaded Nasdaq composite index,
which is up 19 percent. Stocks have been divided before, but
analysts say they don't recall a bigger division. Years of concern
about the length of the bull market and warnings of excessive
valuation have made investors nervous and the market volatile.
</P>
<P>
   All it took to send stocks tumbling Tuesday was Procter &AMP;
Gamble's warning that its third quarter profits will fall because
of rising raw material prices. As the biggest U.S. maker of
household goods and a member of the Dow, the 31 percent drop in its
shares gave the index its fourth-worst one-day point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   Selling also prevented the Nasdaq from closing above 5,000,
where it had traded momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   Two explanations are usually offered for the current split in
stock market sectors.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Federal Reserve's policy of raising interest rates to
slow the pace of an economy it perceives to be growing at an
inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rates hurt old economy stocks such as banks and other
financial institutions, retailers, producers of consumer products
and growth-related cyclical companies.
</P>
<P>
   But computer, technology and other Internet-related stocks rely
less on debt for financing. Their profits have not suffered as much
from the rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Also, investors are not convinced that the economy is moving in
a direction that will boost the future profits of blue-chip
companies. Slower economic growth means slower profit growth, and
profits drive the market.
</P>
<P>
   A third explanation for the market's behavior is that investors
tend to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``As often happens, fear has gone to an extreme,'' said Alfred
Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to investors is to become more greedy ``and buy some
growth stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also contends that the market's recent sell-off makes it
less likely that the Fed will raise interest rates again when it
meets March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts aren't so sure in light of Chairman Alan
Greenspan's's recent remarks that the economy is still expanding
too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, analysts regard the Fed's interest rate policy
as the key to the market for the rest of the year, since higher
rates _ or a change in rate policy _ will influence the outlook for
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Goldman and other strategists recommend that
investors continue to put money in stocks, but to be highly
selective in what they buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stock picker's market,'' he said.

MARKET PLACE: HIGH STAKES FOR A SPORTS BOND OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Would you lend money to a sports conglomerate whose
current operations do not generate enough profits to pay interest
on the loans, let alone repay the money being borrowed?
</P>
<P>
   That is the issue buyers of junk bonds are facing as the
YankeeNets LLC _ the new company that controls a winning baseball
team and a losing basketball team _ tries to borrow $250 million.
It is expected that the borrowing will go through Thursday, but at
a very high interest rate of about 12.25 percent. That is half a
percentage point higher than the rate the company had hoped to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The private offering will finance payouts to the owners of the
two teams, enabling the former New Jersey Nets owners to pay back
money they borrowed to finance the payments that enabled them to
become equal owners of YankeeNets with the former owners of the New
York Yankees baseball team. For the owners of the Yankees, led by
George Steinbrenner, the payments will simply add to their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner realized about $135 million in cash when the
Yankees and Nets combined business operations, and he is likely to
collect $40 million more if the bond offering is completed and a
related plan to sell a minority interest in the company also goes
as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The bond offering is being sold in a private placement open only
to institutional investors, including high-yield mutual funds.
While the offering memorandum is not public, a copy of it was
provided to The New York Times. It gives a detailed look at the
finances of the two teams and the unusual operating arrangement
that will preserve Steinbrenner's ability to run the Yankees as he
sees fit, notwithstanding the fact that he will no longer own a
majority stake in the team.
</P>
<P>
   The offering memorandum warns, in boldface type: ``We may not be
able to service our debt obligations if we do not increase cash
flow.'' Indeed, on a consolidated basis, the two teams showed a net
loss of $98.2 million on revenue of $241 million in the 12 months
ended Sept. 30, 1999. While some of that loss represented noncash
expenses, the combined company would have had a negative cash flow
of $4.2 million even before paying interest on its existing debts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the losses have come from the Nets. The financial
statements in the offering memorandum show that the Yankees are
marginally profitable before post-season revenue is counted _
revenue that would vanish if the team failed to make the playoffs.
For the first nine months of last year _ a period that does not
include the playoffs _ the team reported operating income of just
$556,000, and a net loss, after considering interest expense on its
current debt, of $4.4 million. Figures for the fourth quarter of
1999, including the playoffs and World Series, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, when the team had post-season revenue of $11.5
million, it reported operating income of $20.1 million and net
income of $12.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   This borrowing, if the interest rate is 12.25 percent, will
require annual interest payments of $30.6 million, well above
previous cash flows for the teams. The $250 million would be due in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   The offering memorandum holds out two principal hopes for the
teams' coming up with the money to meet their obligations. The
first is a better local television contract for the two teams. The
Yankees contract with the Madison Square Garden Network expires
after this season, and the Nets have the right to terminate their
contract with Fox Sports New York at the end of the 2000-2001
season. The second is a sale of stock in one or both teams to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations for that contract should be interesting. Both
MSG and Fox Sports New York are now controlled by Cablevision _
which tried to buy control of the Yankees before the deal with the
Nets was made _ and competition between the two has diminished. But
the Yankees and Nets could conceivably put together their own
television operation if MSG and Fox Sports New York do not agree to
pay enough.
</P>
<P>
   The bond offering memorandum mentions the possibility of selling
shares in one or both teams to the public by 2003 but does not
commit itself to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bond offering nor the planned sale of $75 million in
ownership interests in YankeeNets will do much to provide cash to
operate the teams. Only $15 million of the $325 million being
raised will go to operations. Another $15.7 million will go to pay
expenses connected to the offerings, and about $80 million will be
put into escrow to assure that the company will have the money to
make interest payments for the first three years that the bonds are
outstanding. That leaves about $214.3 million to be distributed to
the owners of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal company, the board has complete control over the
company's operations, although it delegates much of that control to
management. But the YankeeNets company is different. The board of
the Nets will have control over most aspects of that team,
including the right to set the team's budget within certain
parameters. Steinbrenner, as managing general partner of the
Yankees, will have the right to set that team's budget and to make
all major decisions on issues like personnel and player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is, to be sure, a board for the company. But its powers
are limited to certain decisions, including areas like real estate
investments. There is also a board for the Yankees, but the
agreement specifies that if the board and Steinbrenner disagree,
Steinbrenner's opinion will prevail.

COMMENTARY: ERRORS OF COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's perfectly OK to bash the International Monetary Fund _ some
of the best people do it. But it's important to bash it for the
right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few of the IMF's most vociferous critics attack it
because they believe it is in the business of rescuing financial
fat cats. The idea that the IMF creates ``moral hazard'' _ that
international lenders are careless because they count on the IMF to
bail them out if something goes wrong _ has become virtual dogma
among right-wingers, many of whom seem to think that if we
abolished the IMF we would also abolish financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a fantasy. There is not a shred of evidence, for
example, that the investors who poured money into Asia before its
recent crisis thought at all about the possibility of future IMF
bailouts. They simply suffered from irrational exuberance _ and
would have done the same regardless. (The exception that proves the
rule is Russia, which investors thought of _ wrongly, as it happens
_ as ``too nuclear to fail.'')
</P>
<P>
   A more cogent line of criticism, associated in particular with
Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs, attacks the IMF for overplaying its hand.
Sachs and others complain that when countries go to the fund for
help, it demands drastic and often inappropriate changes in their
economic policies, undermining investor confidence and actually
worsening the situation. This view doesn't suggest that the IMF
should go away; it suggests instead that it should lend faster,
with fewer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This critique, unlike the moral-hazard view, has quite a lot
going for it. In Asia, in particular, the IMF seemed to want to
restructure whole societies from the ground up, in the process
feeding rather than countering the ongoing crisis of confidence.
While some say that the region's rapid recovery vindicates that
policy, others more plausibly argue that the rebound mainly
suggests just how excessive the IMF's demands were and how
gratuitous the crisis was in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But granted that the IMF's performance has been unsatisfactory,
what do you do about it? That was one of the questions addressed by
the International Financial Institutions Advisory Commission, a
congressionally appointed panel whose much-awaited report will be
released Wednesday. (The other was what to do about the World Bank
_ but let me leave that for some other day.)
</P>
<P>
   All members of the commission agreed that the IMF needed to
return to its original, narrow mission of providing emergency
lending. But only 8 of the 11 were willing to sign the full report,
and even this majority vote hides a deep divergence of views.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: The Republican-appointed members of the
commission, including its chairman, Allan Meltzer, are still
committed to the moral-hazard argument. The draft of the report
that came into my hands declares that ``The importance of the moral
hazard problem cannot be overstated.'' (Oh, yes it can.) And while
the report did not in so many words call for abolition of the IMF,
it suggested restrictions that would in effect make even emergency
lending impossible. For example, the report wants IMF loans to be
repaid after only 120 days, with at most one rollover. To get a
sense of what that means: Thailand, which only started to emerge
from its crisis late last year, would have had to repay its loans
in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sachs, who was one of the Democratic appointees,
signed the report, giving it at least an appearance of
bipartisanship. Why?
</P>
<P>
   My understanding, after communicating with Sachs, is that he
believes that you need to hit the IMF with a two-by-four just to
get its attention, and that the specifics can be fixed later. And
anyone who has listened to smug IMF officials (not all of them, but
too many) rationalize their decisions can see his point.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission members who refused to sign the report had a
different view: They regarded the report as an attempt not to fix
the IMF, but to gut it _ which for all the fund's flaws would make
the world a considerably more dangerous place. And anyone who has
read the anti-IMF literature of the right-wing think tanks that
support several of the commission's members can see their point,
too.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to a question of who's using whom. And the
truth is that I don't know.

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush effectively silenced the challenge of
Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination
Tuesday, setting the stage for Bush to court McCain and his
supporters to join in a GOP crusade in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush harnessed hard-hitting campaign ads and a lavishly financed
nationwide campaign organization to roll up victories in at least
eight of the 13 states with GOP contests, according to Voter News
Service exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls showed Bush beating McCain in New York, Ohio,
Georgia, Maryland and Missouri, as well as in two New England
states that McCain had counted upon _ Rhode Island and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was running ahead of McCain, as well, in the popular vote
contest in California in which non-Republicans cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also swept key winner-take-all delegate contests, including
California, as well as the majority of the GOP delegates in New
York and Ohio, the exit polls showed. The results will give Bush
most of the 613 delegates chosen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose fiery populism sustained an uphill challenge for
the last six weeks, captured only Vermont, Connecticut and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the 63-year-old former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of
war failed to make inroads among the bedrock Republican voters that
he needed in order to capture a large numbers of delegates in the
district-by-district duels, particularly in New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The successful Republican candidate needs 1,034 delegates to
secure the GOP nomination at the national convention in
Philadelphia in late July.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said last weekend that he would withdraw from a failing
race rather than have his ``megaphone turn into a kazoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, made it clear
that his most pressing task in the days ahead will be to court
McCain as well as the centrist Republicans, independents and
Democrats who rallied to McCain in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush extended an olive branch to McCain even before the results
were in, keenly aware that continued campaign attacks by McCain
would only jeopardize Bush's campaign against Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if there's any personal issues between me and my
opponents, we'll sit down and talk,'' Bush said. ``But there's
going to be ample time to heal any wounds and I'm confident we can
heal any wounds that may exist between us.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary schedule moves into Bush territory next Tuesday,
with contests in six key southern and southwestern states,
including Texas, where Bush is governor, and Florida where his
brother, Jeb Bush, is chief executive. The six states offer 341
delegates _ enough to give Bush a mathematical lock on the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would stay in the race only if he believed he
still had a chance to turn things around and win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked this kind of
prairie fire out there that got people involved,'' McCain said told
a radio call-in program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hard-hitting populist bid, featuring attacks on Bush,
``the establishment,'' the White House, Congress and special
interests, attracted legions of first-time voters, once-alienated
young voters, independents and Democrats to the GOP banner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy ignited historic turnouts in New Hampshire
and Michigan, where he won early momentum, as well as in South
Carolina where he lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said excitement does not translate into nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a credible early favorite _ and you have the
fortitude to stay on in the face of early disappointments _ you're
going to win the nomination,'' Baker said. ``Ultimately the
favorites designated by the party gray beards walk away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta who is not
working for any presidential campaign, said McCain could not hope
to win the GOP nomination ``without Republican votes,''' adding:
``Establishment matters, and money matters _ especially in a war of
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which had the support of Republican leaders _
including 29 governors, 38 senators and 175 House members _ carried
out 2 million get-out-the-vote telephone calls in nine states in
the final two days of the Super Tuesday campaign, mailed 2 million
pieces of campaign literature and distributed 69,000 yard signs,
according to Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Ayres said Bush had been strengthened for the
fall campaign by being forced to grapple with McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become ``a far superior candidate, far more aggressive,
far more unscripted, far more willing to take chances,'' Ayres
said.

PUTIN'S CAMPAIGN STRATEGY: ACT LIKE A PRESIDENT, NOT A CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a hefty lead in the polls, Vladimir Putin has
perfected his campaign strategy _ act presidential, shun televised
debates and mock some of the other rituals of electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics of the acting, and almost certainly future,
president were on display Tuesday on a visit to Ivanovo, a
down-at-the-heels textile factory town 180 miles northeast of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a sympathetic audience, Putin boasted that he would
neither participate in televised debates nor debase himself by
preparing campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The next president, he insisted, should be involved in the work
of building a strong state, not an official caught up in the world
of image makers, focus groups, pollsters and political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These videos, their advertising,'' Putin said. ``I will not be
trying to find out in the course of my election campaign which is
more important, Tampax or Snickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's calculated indifference to the process appears to be
paying off. Putin does not need campaign commercials, and he can
afford to forego the free television time to which he and other
candidates are entitled on state television. Every move he makes is
extensively reported and broadcast nationwide on the state-owned
channels. In effect, his weeks as acting president are an
unofficial campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls put his approval rating at more than 50 percent of
the vote, 10 percent to 30 percent ahead of his nearest challenger,
Gennadi Zyuganov, the communist candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is whether Putin's actions are simply those
of a cautious politician who is trying to protect his lead or a
quasi-authoritarian leader disdainful of the democratic process of
appealing for votes. At this stage, the answer is unclear, in view
of the fact that Putin has never run for office, and is a former
intelligence official elevated to national office by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Piontkovsky, a leading leading Russian political analyst
and no friend of Putin, said both factors were at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He despises open politics and prefers intrigues in the
corridors of power,'' Piontkovsky said. ``He is afraid to debate.
So his team is creating the image that he is the father of the
nation who is too busy protecting us from terrorism to debate his
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his austere approach, Putin has found many
opportunities to project a softer side, all the more important for
a man whose career was forged in the KGB and who is best known for
presiding over the increasingly bloody war in Chechnya. Putin has
talked in a Russian television interview about his buying his
daughters a small white poodle _ a difficult, emotional decision,
he said, after his first dog had died. The new poodle made a cameo
appearance in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   And he has allowed himself to be filmed skiing in Sochi and
displaying his common touch at the blini counter there.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Putin began his day in Moscow handing out awards in
honor of International Women's Day, a Russian holiday that has
acquired the status of Mother's Day, St. Valentine's Day and
Secretary's Day all rolled into one. Putin declared that the most
sacred qualities of Russian life were always connected with the
image of a woman. Lidiya Smirnova, 85, an actress who received an
award, decided to return the favor, proclaiming that Putin's style
of walking demonstrated that he was a man of strong character.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Putin headed to Ivanovo. Officially, his aides maintained
that the visit was not a campaign trip, that the acting president
merely wanted to be at an important conference about the
economically depressed town, they said. Putin told the workers that
high taxes had contributed to industrial decline and that the
government needed to stimulate business. ``The higher the degree of
economic freedom of economic entities,'' he said, ``the higher the
level of development of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin also engaged in some damage control. He created a stir
Sunday by telling the BBC on the eve of a visit by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair that he could not exclude the possibility that
Russia might one day join NATO.

<P>
   The remark was intended more as a gesture of Putin's intention
to establish friendly ties with the West than a concrete proposal,
especially because the alliance has never considered inviting
Russia to join, and some NATO countries are dead set against that.
</P>
<P>
   Although the comments were warmly received in Western capitals,
they raised potential political problems at home, as many Russians
view NATO as the enemy. Zyuganov denounced the comments as ``naive
and unforgivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Putin did some backtracking, saying: ''Nobody is going
to admit Russia into NATO.We have never thought this could
happen.''

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF

THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

`GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB' IS IN THE DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Thursday, March 9; tonight is THURSDAY in
this story. Fact box below.) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Old Testament book of Job, God and the Devil make a
friendly wager over the fate of a good and pious man. God strips
His poor guinea pig of his belongings, offs his sons and covers his
body with boils and sores, just to see if he will still love and
praise God. Job prevails, of course (otherwise, the story probably
wouldn't have made it into the Bible), but you have to wonder how
Job's dead family felt about being treated like mere chattel for
God and Satan's amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through their respective Old Testament
fire-and-brimstone phases, God and the devil have mellowed a bit,
but they're still placing bets with one another. In ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' God (who looks like Jerry Garcia but is voiced by
James Garner) and the devil (Alan Cumming) meet at an auto show to
stroll around and admire the new models, and get into their usual
theological bickering. The devil picks out Bob (French Stewart), an
underachieving auto worker trying to pick up some free beer in a
seamy pub, and the game is on: Can Bob (``Not my best work,'' God
sighs) redeem the world, or even himself? At stake: our entire
planet.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not a new premise _ the Bible can't exactly sue for
plagiarism. ``God, the Devil and Bob'' is an often highly amusing
lark that sugar-coats its parody of religious beliefs with some
feel-good secular humanism and an occasional dollop of sentiment.
Visuals are whimsically modest, and the animation is pretty much
what we've come to expect from network TV. Though series creator
Matthew Carlson, himself a former seminary student, treads upon
hallowed ground with a light, and lighthearted, foot, a couple of
TV stations _ including one in Salt Lake City _ have already,
predictably, declared they won't air the series.
</P>
<P>
   God is in the details in this series _ in order to prove to Bob
they are who they say they are, God pulls the old magic trick where
he pulls egg after egg from the mouth of his unamused assistant
Satan. ``Hmmm! How many are in there?'' He marvels to Himself. This
is also a world where UPN has been reconfigured into a cynical
religious network (which couldn't be any worse than it is now), and
in the underworld, Guy Lombardo and his orchestra perpetually
serenade the bummed-out guests with ``Auld Lang Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob's family disregards his portentous announcement as just more
random confused babbling; only his son believes him, since he, too,
can see God. That's part of a deal he cut with the devil, the
Almighty explains _ God has relative control over them until
they're 12, and Satan takes over during the teen years. Turns out
the devil is too successful at corrupting the minds of our youth _
in episode two, the devil dates Bob's daughter to get the poor
guy's goat, but even he finds her callow nattering too repellent to
endure. God observes, ``That's why I never had any girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's pseudo-theological musings are amusing, as well, and
not afraid to address the Big Questions (the Big Answers, on the
other hand, are another matter). Of a rainbow God creates in
episode two, He explains, ``The trick is to inspire wonder without
being heavy-handed, so the atheists won't feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   That line is indicative of ``God, the Devil and Bob's'' deadpan
fun. Its cleverness may be a little too nuanced and low-key for
mainstream audiences _ the show probably belongs on a cable
network, where it would be a programming highlight _ instead of a
broadcaster like NBC. But it's good fun to see our deity and demon
bicker over minutiae while Bob looks on without comprehension. At
one point, Bob grouses to God, ``You're so inscrutable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Creator shrugs. ``I get that a lot.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``God, the Devil and Bob.'' &QL; 
What: Animated series about a deity, a demon and the regular guy in
whose hands they place the fate of our planet. &QL; 
Who: Voices of James Garner, Alan Cumming, French Stewart. &QL; 
Where: NBC (Channel 4). &QL; 
When: 8:30 tonight; then moving to its regular slot, 8:30 p.m.
Tuesdays. &QL;

A $16-BILLION SURPLUS AT FHA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said Tuesday that the Federal Housing
Administration generated a surplus of $16 billion in the fiscal
year that ended Sept. 30. That is $5 billion more than in the year
before, a gain that could make thousands more low-interest
mortgages and rental units available to low- and moderate-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   In a congratulatory memorandum, President Clinton directed
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Jack Lew, the White House budget
director, to develop a proposal for the newly available money and
report back in 160 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo may get a less glowing reception Wednesday at a
hearing of the House Appropriations subcommittee on housing, where
lawmakers will ask him to explain several enduring problems in his
department. Among other things, the subcommittee wants to know why
he believes the supply of affordable housing fell last year when a
General Accounting Office report says the supply has increased in
each of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. James T. Walsh, R-N.Y., says he
generally agrees with Clinton that the Department of Housing and
Urban Development has made great strides under Cuomo, improving
programs and effectiveness. But Walsh says he still had concerns
over apparent discrepancies like those in the tally of affordable
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict coincides with the Clinton administration's effort
to make a case for a budget request of $32 billion for the housing
department in the 2001 fiscal year, $6 billion more than its budget
this year. But Cuomo said the FHA surplus, which could help as many
as 750,000 families, was ample evidence that the department had
made reforms and deserved the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come full circle with this,'' he said, recalling a
period five years ago when some Republican lawmakers wanted to
eliminate the housing department. ``We had to make changes, and
this is vindication of the entire effort.''

``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;

   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 RETRANSMITTING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 and INHERITING-3 FOR
THOSE WHO MIGHT
 HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE BY NORMAN LEVINE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

CONSERVATIVE VERMONT HAMLET DEBATES SAME-SEX MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Vt. _ After the crock-potted beans and homemade
doughnuts, after the quick votes on culvert repair and the cemetery
committee, the 60-odd souls gathered Tuesday at the annual town
meeting of this Vermont hamlet turned to the tough, heated part.
</P>
<P>
   Did the town's residents support holding a referendum on
same-sex marriage? Yes, by acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Did they support or oppose same-sex marriage itself?
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief, troubled pause. Then they waded in.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in December that committed
gay couples should receive the same rights and benefits as straight
spouses, there have been surveys and legislative hearings and
endless radio and general store discussions on how to respond to
the ruling. But Tuesday, in more than 30 spots around Vermont, the
ultrademocratic forum of the traditional New England town meeting
offered citizens a chance to weigh in on an issue that has so far
been controlled by the court and the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, a relatively conservative and poor town of about 313
in southern Vermont, the heat of the discussion seemed to indicate
that while the Legislature has agreed to concentrate on a ``civil
union'' bill that stops just short of marriage for gay couples, a
bill that is working its way efficiently through the House of
Representatives, there is no such agreement among many Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the question was put, Wayne Ryan, a mechanic in black
garb and cowboy hat, rose and said: ``I believe it's against our
constitutional rights to have government and legislation change the
word `marriage' to mean something as ill and as foul as same-sex
partners. I believe anybody that does so cannot do it in clear
conscience, because it is against our constitutional rights to
change such a sacred word as `marriage.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Perry, a dairy farmer, spoke next. ``I'd like to know our
representatives' opinion on this, and if it comes up, how you
intend on voting,'' because, he said, ``that makes a difference how
we vote in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David L. Deen, a Democrat who represents Athens and
three other towns, promptly obliged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, in fact, abhor discrimination,'' Deen told the townspeople.
``It is just antithetical to everything I am or have been.''
</P>
<P>
   He therefore supports the civil union bill, he said. He also
reminded those at the meeting that despite dire warnings before the
state passed a law banning discrimination based on sexual
orientation back in 1992, ``the world as we know it hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives haven't changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Deen said, if he loses his seat over this issue,
``the world as I know it does not end,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy questions came from the crowd. Harold Noyes, the local
minister who had pushed to put the marriage questions onto the town
meeting agenda, argued that if, under the bill, same-sex partners
would go before an ``oath-giver'' and get a certificate, that would
be virtually no different from marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes and the town clerk, Darlene Wyman, also expressed concern
about whether they would be forced to participate in a same-sex
union procedure to which their consciences objected.
</P>
<P>
   Deen said that he had ``no problem with people opting out if
they chose,'' but that he believed town clerks would be required to
provide couples with the certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have the right to refuse that document?'' Wyman asked.
</P>
<P>
   Told she likely did not, she responded, ``Then they'll have to
find another town clerk because I will not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When other townspeople pressured Deen to vote in accordance with
their majority's wishes and against the bill, he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of conscience for me,'' he said. ``I get to
exercise my conscience, and you all get to vote the first Tuesday
in November every other year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will,'' inserted Walter Ryan, Wayne's father. ``You'll be
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Deen commented that Athens was by far the
most conservative town he represented, and that voters in the
other, bigger and more liberal towns viewed domestic partnership
and gay marriage more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the town's opinions seemed to reflect the significant
depth and breadth of such opposition in Vermont _ in particular,
because it spoke as a whole town and not merely as a motivated few
who ventured to a Statehouse hearing to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, 35 townspeople voted to express opposition to gay
marriage _ a nonbinding vote that did little more than put their
opinions on record _ and 17 people dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In a second vote, on domestic partnership, 13 said they
supported the idea and 39 opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who supported domestic partnership, Tim Stevenson,
said he was not surprised at how the vote broke down, given the
conservative nature of Athens and its many longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was, however, struck that ``this was obviously the
flash point issue of the meeting, even more than the school issue,
which is really one that affects people much more personally, or
seemingly so, than the issue of gay and lesbian partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he was in the minority, he said, ``I feel like, yeah,
the people of this state should express themselves, whether they're
for it or against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Fine, the town moderator, remained skeptical,
however, about whether the town's opinion would be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Legislature cares what Athens thinks,'' he
said.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY, THE DEMOCRATIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (LAST IN A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES. ALSO MOVED EARLIER IN THE
``A''
 &UR; CATEGORY  &UR; - RESENDING INHERITING-1, INHERITING-2 AND INHERITING-3
FOR THOSE WHO
 &UR; MAY HAVE MISSED THIS SPECIAL PACKAGE. The author examines the
Democratic
 &UR; ``Liberal Moralist'' and ``Liberal Realist'' positions in the
debate over the
 &UR; direction of American foreign policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The American people are undergoing an out-of-body experience:
History is repeating itself, and they have been transferred back to
1920 and the battle waged by Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge
over America's entry into the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wanted both to make the world ``safe for democracy'' and
for the United States to obey the covenant of the League of
Nations, irrespective of national self-interest. His opponent was
Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
although Lodge favored America's entry into the League, he wished
to modify certain articles as a means of preserving U.S. national
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson refused to make any concessions and, in 1920, the League
went down to defeat. The conservatives of 2000 are the spiritual
descendants of Lodge, while present-day liberals inherit the legacy
of Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a liberal moralist, Clintonian foreign policy is an amalgam
of Wilson, Jimmy Carter's ``universal human rights'' and reaction
against the Vietnam War with its rejection of unilateral action by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After initial hesitation in 1993, Clintonian diplomacy shattered
the boundaries of the containment of Communism theory articulated
by George F. Kennan, a foreign-policy expert and diplomat, at the
beginning of the Cold War. Essentially a strategy to halt further
imperialism of the Stalinist empire, containment theory limited the
extension of American power to the Elbe, which, from 1947 to 1990,
was the eastern border of Germany. &QL; 
NATO EXPANSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy committed itself to the enlargement of
the horizon of democracy, and Clinton pursued this goal on two
fronts: expansion of NATO in Europe and support of Boris Yeltsin in
Russia. When Clinton embarked on the jihad of making the world safe
for democracy, he not only embraced this aspect of Wilsonism but
capitulated to the arguments of Anthony Lake, his first national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine brought Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary into NATO. By including these three countries under the
NATO umbrella, the United States committed itself to the defense of
countries it never previously considered within its own sphere of
national self-interest. This enormous broadening of American
guarantees was justified under the principle of missionary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding NATO, Clinton broke American implied agreements
with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``A World Transformed,'' written by George
Bush, who was president at the time of the disintegration of the
Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's
national security adviser, is unequivocal on this point: At no time
did Bush, Scowcroft, or Secretary of State James Baker indicate to
Gorbachev that NATO would be extended eastward to Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary after the Soviets voluntarily renounced their
title to these tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward Yeltsin was another case of missionary
democracy. The Clinton administration adamantly supported Yeltsin
on the grounds that he was leading the democratic capitalist
transformation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeltsin's resignation from office and the crowning of
Vladimir Putin as his successor is a serious setback for the
Clinton doctrine. Putin's recent alliance with the Communists
belies the assertion that democracy is functioning in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Hamilton, Democratic loyalist, respected former
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and current
director of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Putin's recent coalition
with the Communists ``amounts to a defeat for Clinton, for it
strengthens the power of the Communists in the Duma.'' &QL; 
PUSHING MULTILATERALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Wilson ideal that the Clinton doctrine continues is that
American diplomacy should unfold within multilateral institutions.
Liberal moralists are suspicious of unilateral actions because they
fear it will give rise to worldwide anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the fact that recent ventures in which America
acted under the aegis of the United Nations _ such as in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo _ all appear to be failures, the
White House still upholds the usefulness of multilateralism. The
Oval Office fears the bully backlash _ that other nations will
express their resentment against the paramountcy of the United
States by opposing American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of liberal moralism to which the Clinton
doctrine abides is free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal moralism wishes to turn the movement toward economic
globalization to an advantage for the United States, and so Clinton
has devoted much effort to the reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wishes to use trade as a form of social engineering,
because he hopes that free trade will encourage the growth of a
capitalist entrepreneurial class in countries making the transition
out of communism, like China. Borrowing a phrase from his former
economic adviser, Andrea Tyson, Clinton thinks in terms of
``strategic trade,'' or trade with a deeper purpose than just
making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to China, the Clinton doctrine combines the
strategic trade and the ``strategic partner'' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the strategic partner is to detach China from any
``anti-hegemonist'' bloc alliance. Primarily, this means preventing
the re-creation of the Cold War Sino-Soviet coalition. &QL; 
OVAL OFFICE'S PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hook of strategic trade is associated with the universal
human-rights theory of Carter. By its use of strategic trade, the
Oval Office hopes to ensnare President Jiang Zemin into granting
more ``human rights'' to Chinese citizens. The ultimate aim of
trans-Pacific social engineering is to both speed the development
of a commercial middle class in China and to provide these
entrepreneurs with the protective shield of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives of all camps attack the Clinton doctrine on China
as a contradiction between rewards and punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting upon the differences that separate Republicans and
Democrats, Democratic loyalist Hamilton told ``The Arizona
Republic,'' ``Republicans are very skeptical of international
organizations, such as the U.N., the World Trade Organization and
the like. Democrats generally support these multilateral
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a monopolar world in the social and economic
sense. Even though the U.S. is the only superpower in the military
or `hard' sense, it cannot dictate to all nations of the globe in
matters of gender, children, values or culture. In terms of `soft'
power _ education, information and trade, this is a multipolar
world and the U.S. must learn to act in conjunction with
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to recognize that the most important lever of
diplomatic power has changed from `hard' to `soft' power. To me,
trade is the crucial issue.'' &QL; 
PARTY SPLIT ON POLICIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tend to stress military power,'' Hamilton
added. ``I am an unrepentant free-trader because I believe that
unrestricted trade, from which all sides benefit, is the best way
to export the democratic order.''
</P>
<P>
   But policies are divisive ones within the Democratic Party. To
hold the presidency again in November, Democrats desperately need
the support of American labor, and the AFL-CIO has already endorsed
Vice President Al Gore. Nevertheless, a divorce has taken place
between the corporatist and labor wings of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatists favor strategic trade and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, because they will be the ``winners''
from the globalization of trade, while Big Labor is opposed to
these policies, because they will be the ``losers'' when domestic
wages are repressed. The Seattle meeting of the World Trade
Organization ended in chaos when Big Labor and environmentalists
led street demonstrations demanding environmental protections, an
end to child labor in China and other Asian countries and
improvement of working conditions before any further reduction of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of China and world trade will be hotly debated along
partisan lines when Congress is called on to approve China's entry
into the World Trade Organization in the fall, and they will play a
major role in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already become a victim of the Democratic dependency on
Big Labor. Gore suffers from a split personality: one face as vice
president and the other as party candidate. As vice president, he
speaks in favor of the Clinton doctrine, but as candidate he must
massage the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Gore's divided personality made the front pages
when the AFL-CIO criticized him for placing the reduction of
tariffs before the increase of wages, the growth of labor unions
and the end of sweat shops in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Gore's problems with the labor unions, he is also a
Liberal Moralist. In the war of words currently waged in opinion
journals, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international relations
at Harvard University, has acted as the vice president's script
writer. In an article in the March/April issue of ``Foreign
Affairs,'' Walt has written a Democratic response to the Republican
broadsides that were published by ``Foreign Affairs'' in the
previous issue. The vice president's proxy only proved that on
foreign affairs, Gore is a clone of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is also a Liberal Moralist and although there are
no significant differences between Gore and Clinton, there are
important divisions between Gore-Clinton and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Clinton favor an increase in the defense budget, but
Bradley advocates a cut in appropriations for the Defense
Department. Bradley would use the money saved from the military
spending for his domestic agenda such as his health and
anti-poverty programs. Bradley is also far more attuned to the
growing gulf between the cyberspace Atlantic world and the
spinning-wheel Third World.  &QL; 
`BULLY BACKLASH' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberal realists, particularly professor Michael Mandelbaum of
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, agrees
with Clinton-Gore that it is vital to work within multinational
organizations, but he dissents from the Clinton doctrine on the
issue that America should become a global proselytizer for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum led the charge against the expansion of NATO because
he feared the ``bully backlash.'' Mandelbaum's essay, ``Foreign
Policy as Social Work,'' appeared in the January/February 1996
issue of ``Foreign Affairs.'' In the essay, he criticized Clinton
for seeking to turn the United States into the messiah of
constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum wrote of Clinton and Lake, his first national
security adviser: ``They tried and failed to turn American foreign
policy into a branch of social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy, Mandelbaum and the entire liberal
realist camp argues, has overextended and overtaxed U.S. resources
around the world. The liberal realists oppose intervention in the
internal affairs of other sovereign states, and they reject the
notion that America can play the world's shrink, using the methods
of a social worker to aid the dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican or Democratic candidate in the current campaign
embraces isolationist or protectionist positions. As the new
century dawns, the United States is experiencing instant historical
replay. The First World War is over, the Treaty of Versailles is
written, and America in 2000 must decide whether it will sign the
League of Nations in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   All those who favor close collaboration with international
organizations, forgoing all instances of unilateral intervention,
will vote for Woodrow Wilson. All those who favor the retention of
full American self-interest, the need for unilateral intervention
to further national security, will vote for Lodge. But whatever
your vote, you must face the consequences: If Americans can put
aside their obsession with the marrying-a- multimillionaire
melodrama, they will bear in mind that history is a life-and-death
sentence, that it repeats itself, and the Second World War followed
the First.  &QL;

BRADLEY TOO PASSIVE IN PITCHING HIS VIEWS TO PUBLIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ True, a few things that led to Bill Bradley's undoing
in the Democratic presidential race were beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent Al Gore &UR;  &LR; evolved into a better campaigner. Republican
John McCain sopped up independent voters and media attention.
Bradley's episodes of an irregular heart beat put him on the front
page when hardly anything else could.
</P>
<P>
   But at the core, Bradley's demise can be called the death of a
non-salesman. His inability or reluctance to be a gut-level
pitchman for his own lofty message prevented him from overriding
the outside factors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the viewpoint of two political experts who follow
Bradley's career.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign ``is not a civil service exam where
you just have to get over the threshold and you get the job,'' said
Gerald Pomper, a political science professor at Rutgers University
in Bradley's home state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is a very competent and smart person, but he is not
the kind of person that arouses passion on the part of the
people,'' Pomper added. ``When you are running an insurgent
movement, especially on the left, you have to engender some
personal passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Walters, a University of Maryland political scientist who
wrote a book called ``Black Presidential Politics in America,''
said Bradley failed to translate his ideas from the language of the
lecture room to the language of the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last debates,'' Walters said, ``it looked like he was
`conceptualizing.'``
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, the actor and pugnacious personality, unwittingly
distilled these ideas at a rally for Bradley last week in New York
City's Greenwich Village. After urging the crowd to vote for
Bradley, the movie star and ex-Marine told Bradley for all to hear
that he should fire his political advisers and read the Marines'
training manual for a dose of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, Bradley allowed himself a brief but sharp
self-examination when asked by the hosts of ABC's ``This Week'' why
his campaign theme of racial unity had not won the support of the
majority of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that was my own fault in not communicating who I was or
what I believe,'' said the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the intellectual, was personally remote as a
professional basketball player and later as a U.S. senator. As the
campaign got off the ground last fall, his high-brow detachment
appeared to help him with some Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dull was cool. He was seen as a refreshing departure from Gore
and President Clinton, the national emoter and confessed liar.
Bradley ran ahead of Gore in New York and New Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore seemed weighed down by his association with
Clinton and his connections to Democratic campaign fund-raising
scandals. But early on, Bradley never made any direct statements
designed to exploit this.
</P>
<P>
   When the calendar turned to 2000 and Gore started attacking
Bradley's record and policy proposals, Bradley first declined to
engage the battle. He had already set himself up as the knight of
``a new politics'' that shuns attacks and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Then, heeding the lesson of modern campaigning that no
allegation should go unanswered or unpunished, Bradley changed
gears and got into a tong war with Gore. He portrayed the vice
president as untrustworthy and a closet conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it was too late for Bradley to defend himself and
his complex health insurance proposals, the switch made him look
awkward, if not hypocritical. He was no longer able to claim that
he was running the righteous campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's bid was also flawed because it started without a
built-in base of voters, Pomper said. Bradley ran as a more liberal
alternative to Gore but had not amassed a liberal following during
his Senate years because he was a moderate there, more concerned
with legislative details than broad political strokes, the
professor explained.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Bradley also was up against the political
ties Gore has forged with Democrat-friendly interest groups, such
as the AFL-CIO, during his seven years as vice president. Bradley
disdainfully called this ``entrenched power.'' And the Gore
campaign wielded the power with devastating timing.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley questioned Gore's commitment to abortion rights,
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
endorsed the vice president. When Bradley went further than Gore in
pushing new rules for gun control and questioned Gore's record on
the issue, Gore ran a commercial featuring praise from gun-control
advocate James Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by Bradley's surge late last year, Gore moved his
campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tenn., from Washington, D.C.,
sharpened his stage skills and even changed his wardrobe. He was
``a fighter.'' Bradley was the dreamer. And voters in the early
primary states chose active over passive.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who proposed extensive campaign-finance reform, ran
against Gore to change the system. In the end, he ran
unsuccessfully against the system and changed Gore.

 &HT;    Bush to set sights on Gore
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A year into the quest, and after a few round
trips between inevitable and in trouble, Gov. George W. Bush has
cleared the first hurdle in an effort to accomplish something he
insists is not the goal.
</P>
<P>
   A November win for Bush would complete the bookends around what
his family believes has been a sorry volume in American history:
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Bush has always insisted there is nothing personal
involved in trying to replace the man who ousted his dad.
Privately, he has has made it clear he doesn't think much of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-President George Bush also has steered clear of public
criticism of his successor. But by lunchtime Tuesday, he was on the
phone to his son's campaign to get word of the early exit poll
numbers. On Tuesday, as the voting began, Bush made it clear that
he plans to run a character-counts campaign against an
administration the Bush family believes is sorely lacking in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change my message,'' he said when asked for
his fall strategy. ``Maybe Al Gore feels . . . that he has got to
keep changing message or changing headquarters or changing suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes referred to electing Gore as ``the
equivalent of a third Clinton term.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a riff that began in Fresno, California on Sunday night
after Gore accused Bush of being in the ``pocket'' of special
interests, Bush on Tuesday said he intends to make the ethics of
the Clinton White House a November issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how somebody's memory all of a sudden has
lapses,'' Bush said. ``One of the things I'll do in the course of
the campaign is remind people what's gone on in the administration
for the last seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to end the Clinton-Gore era began quietly, if not
secretly, long before Bush won re-election in November 1998. It was
exactly one year ago yesterday that Bush announced the formation of
the exploratory committee that put the campaign in motion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a candidacy born fully formed with a candidate who
fund-raised his way to prohibitive favorite status. A solid win at
last August's Iowa Straw Poll confirmed his frontrunner status.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain skipped the straw poll and the January Iowa
caucuses won by Bush. As other candidates dropped out, McCain
gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, in an outcome that shook the Bush camp to its core,
the Texas governor was run over in New Hampshire by McCain's
Straight Talk Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test of character,'' Bush said as he flew out of New
Hampshire, angered by the outcome but convinced better days were
ahead. ``We'll just see. Different people, different part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Bush began his first comeback with a speech that
served both as short-term boost and long-term hurdle. Bush steered
hard right by giving a speech at Bob Jones University, a South
Carolina school whose anti-Catholic views became fodder for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won South Carolina big. But the following week, McCain took
Michigan and Arizona. Last week, Bush got it moving in his
direction by winning in North Dakota, Virginia and Washington
(though mail-in absentee votes are still being counted in
Washington).
</P>
<P>
   Bush's bumpy ride included criticism from skeptics who painted
him as a done-nothing lightweight. His stump speeches almost always
included mangled language and the syntax of his father.
</P>
<P>
   (Tuesday, botching a line he has repeated many times in recent
weeks, Bush said, ``If Senator McCain says one thing he ought to do
another.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bush also got branded as a tool of the Christian right and a
too-close buddy of big business. The latter image was hard to
ignore every time Bush came on stage to what might be the
worst-ever entry music chosen for a GOP candidate: ``Taking Care of
Business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush slalomed through the criticism and, almost $60 million
into the effort, now has clinched the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A November loss would be hard for Bush to take, but, at least
for now, he has avoided joining his dad as personification of the
squandered lead.

COMPANY ASKED TO PRODUCE HERD OF COWS FOR URBAN SITES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Hawaii, Kans., Fla., Ill., Switzerland, Britain)   By JASON HALL   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Entrepreneur Scott Hamblin may have latched
onto a real cash cow. Hamblin's Resource Factory, a statuary
manufacturer, has received an order to construct 200 fiberglass
cows by April 1 that will eventually be shipped to cities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The cows are being produced for Cow Parade Holding Corp., a
for-profit company that sponsors art exhibits aimed at making the
cow a vital part of city culture in America.
</P>
<P>
   Hamblin said he may eventually produce up to 900 cows. The first
40 cows were shipped Monday. ``These cows in particular are going
to Manhattan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Resource Factory is one of two companies in the nation
making the cows; the other is in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hamblin declined to say how much he's paid per bovine. Similar
sculptures cost $2,500 a piece unpainted when they were installed
in Chicago last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hamblin landed the account by word of mouth, through regular
customers at Warner Bros., Six Flags and Disney. Hamblin's company
makes fiberglass sculptures of almost anything, but his biggest
client is the creator of such characters as Bugs Bunny and Daffy
Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Cows on Parade started as an art exhibit in Zurich, Switzerland,
in 1997, and made its big splash last year in Chicago. Coverage of
the cows, displayed all over the city, appeared in newspapers, in
magazines and on television all over the world. Hamblin's cows are
based on molds he made from some of the Chicago cows.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cows Hamblin's team has crafted will be displayed
locally, other than at his shop. They're all being shipped by
tractor-trailer to New York.
</P>
<P>
   There, they will be handed over to artists who will take
liberties with the cows, painting or decorating them as wildly or
conservatively as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   The cows are then sponsored by corporations, with prices of
$7,500 to $350,000, said Daniel Blume, vice president of
Connecticut-based Cow Parade Holding Corp. After expenses, Cow
Parade Holding earns profits from the sponsorships. When the cows
are later auctioned, local charities will receive up to 80 percent
of the proceeds, Blume said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's affair in Chicago generated worldwide buzz,
New York City is following with similar efforts this year. Blume
said the cows will be on display in 59 parks in New York from June
15 to July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities are lining up to have cow parades. The list
includes Honolulu, Kansas City and London.
</P>
<P>
   After the cows are paraded, they will be auctioned off in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's auction of about 300 cows in Chicago made about $4
million, said Lorene Barrow, a spokeswoman for Cow Parade Holding
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   New York's parade should generate even more money, because more
cows are being produced _ 500 to 600, Barrow said _ and because
they're being painted by more high-profile artists.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees and the New York Mets will sponsor cows and
have players sign them, and artist Peter Maxx is painting a cow a
day this week, live on NBC's ``Today Show.''

REPUBLICAN FOREIGN-POLICY PERSPECTIVES: MORALISTS VS. REALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (ALSO MOVING EARLIER IN ``A'' CATEGORY. / SECOND IN A SERIES OF
THREE) The
 &UR; author examines the Republican ``Conservative Moralist'' and
``Conservative
 &UR; Realist'' positions in the debate over the direction of American
foreign
 &UR; policy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Great Foreign Policy Debate of 2000 is a cascade of ink not
limited to the battle of the journals. It has become a bonanza as
well for the publishing industry as authors from different research
institutes flood bookstores and libraries with their tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious outlet for discussions of international
affairs is the bimonthly magazine ``Foreign Affairs,'' which
specializes in the disputations of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace, and his intellectual soul mate, Bill Kristol, editor of
the ``Weekly Standard'' journal, co-wrote an article in ``Foreign
Affairs''called ``Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy,'' in which
they wrote: ``Finally, American foreign policy should be informed
with a clear moral purpose, based on the understanding that its
moral goals and its fundamental national interest are almost in
harmony . . . The remoralization of America at home ultimately
requires the remoralization of American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   `GREAT FATHER FIGURE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows that democracies do not fight each other,''
writes Robert Kagan, who may be considered the leading advocate of
the Conservative Moralist congregation. ``American democracy should
be expansionary, and the U.S. should be more assertive and activist
in enlarging the frontiers of democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Ronald Reagan as the great father figure of American
foreign policy. Not only was Reagan skeptical of international
organizations, but he also understood the necessity for the U.S. to
act unilaterally and to intervene into the affairs of another
country on the grounds of American national interest. Reagan had an
intuitive grasp of hard power, or military force.''
</P>
<P>
   REALISM AND MORALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kagan traces his intellectual ancestry to Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join realism and moralism,'' Kagan said, ``and so did Teddy
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson, for all his genius, even though he
desired to make the `world safe for democracy,' was willing to
sacrifice American sovereignty to a world government.
</P>
<P>
   ``TR (Teddy Roosevelt) would not have done that, but recognized
the need to use U.S. power unilaterally to spread American ideas
and values. Reagan was part of the TR (Roosevelt) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ledeen, research fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, has published a book, ``Freedom Betrayed,'' that reads
like a hymn to the American system.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ledeen, the democratic revolution has passed
through two periods: The first was the American Revolution of 1776,
and the second is America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A proselytizing Democrat, Ledeen attaches himself to the Wilson
who sought to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' and ``Freedom
Betrayed'' presents the United States as a revolutionary power, a
``chosen nation'' for converting the world to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC IMPERIALISM? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of Conservative Moralists is open to theological
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan, Kristol and Ledeen abandon the principles of George
Kennan's ``containment policy'' through which America won the Cold
War. The containment policy was essentially a static program, for
it conformed to a bipolar world, and it assumed that both the
Soviet Union and the United States would remain on their sides of
the Iron Curtain, while Washington waited for the decay of
Stalinist Communist imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood of Conservative Moralism wants to replace the
static nature of the containment policy with a form of democratic
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the post-Cold War world is a monopolar one in which
the United State is preeminent, that limits to American
expansionism no longer exist, this College of Cardinals seeks to
root the democratic flag in such far-away places as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (countries that few Americans even know
are on the map) _ all of which, not incidentally, are enormously
rich in oil and natural-gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
   These foreign-policy gurus have not proved their claim that
unilateral intervention into the affairs of a sovereign country is
an effective means of installing democracy in a nation. Government
through the consent of the people arises only when other supportive
institutions exist, such as a free press, an independent judiciary
and a population committed to the principles of civil rights, and
these cannot be imposed by paratroopers descending from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRACY OR CAPITALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the prophets of Conservative Moralism do not clearly
indicate which they wish to export _ democracy or capitalism.
Michael Ledeen, however, does have the courage of his faith, for he
wishes to export the Reagan Republican Platform of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Freedom Betrayed,''Ledeen defines the democratic
revolution: ``Today it means waging war against the growing power
of the preeminent modern institution: state bureaucracy . . That is
why the call to slash the size of government is such an integral
part of the democratic revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between the American Constitution and
the Republican platform of 1980: Although it is patriotism to ask
American soldiers to fight for the Constitution, it is bottomless
greed to ask them to fight to imperialize the Reagan 1980 campaign
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to position itself as the final arbiter of the Great
Debate, ``Foreign Affairs'' has devoted its January-February 2000
issue to the Republican side of this argument. In this issue,
Condoleezza Rice wrote the lead article, ``Promoting the National
Interest,'' an exposition of the Conservative Realist position. In
the March/April 2000 issue, ``Foreign Affairs''will follow up with
the Democratic response.
</P>
<P>
   NATION COMES FIRST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice has deep roots in the Bush dynasty because she worked as a
Russian specialist on the National Security Council under President
Bush and presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft. A book by Bush and
Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed,'' refers to her as extremely
competent and knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Re-emphasizing one of the major principles of Conservative
Realism, Rice upholds the primacy of national interest over
international organizations and norms. The theory of ``universal
human rights'' is a wonderful ideal, but here also national
interest takes priority over the banner of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russia, Rice supports the expansion of NATO to
include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The United States
should not be deterred by Russian anger because of the ballooning
of NATO into real estate once controlled by Soviet armies.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet specialist to Bush favors U.S. support for the
continued independence of the Ukraine and other countries in
Central Asia that seek to protect their sovereignty from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   REBUILD MILITARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea region is of vital importance for U.S. interests
because of its huge oil and natural-gas reserves. In this region of
the globe, the policy of containing the Soviet Union is replaced by
the policy of dismembering Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing President Clinton for cutting the defense budget,
Rice wants to rebuild the military to throw out the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians and construct a
national missile-defense system. The defeat of the renewal of the
1992 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was correct. In the last
analysis, it is ``hard power,'' the persuasiveness of the bullet,
that determines the fate of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rice favors U.S. participation in all international
organizations because such collaboration is an advantage to the
national interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she favors continued U.S. participation in the
World Trade Organization, because she favors opening markets for
U.S. exports. Trade is an important instrument of U.S. foreign
policy, and the international reduction of tariffs and other trade
barriers represents a gain to the United States because it helps
create an entrepreneurial capitalist class in whatever nation
becomes a partner in these commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding trade with China, the former national security adviser
believes, is in American national self-interest because it will
speed economic liberalization, and the emergence of an aggressive
capitalist phalanx could act as the springboard for the sprouting
of political democracy. Unlike Clinton, however, Rice does not view
China as a ``strategic partner'' but as a ``strategic competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Realists want to maintain Taiwanese
independence, and they image themselves as the party of the right
on the China issue. In essence, they want to create an East Asian
``rollback theory'' in the style of John Foster Dulles, keeping
China out of Taiwan and forcing China out of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   CEASE BEING WORLD'S POLICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her new position at Stanford University, Rice launched has
her most spirited diatribes against the Clinton administration on
the question of humanitarian intervention. She points to the
failure of such action in Haiti and to the ineffectiveness of
multilateral humanitarian intervention in Somalia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States exerts hard hegemonic power in the
world, it should not act as the earth's ``globocop.'' Rice does not
believe that it is within the national interest of the United
States to play the universal gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Rice an authoritative voice from the Conservative
Realist pew, but the probable ghostwriter on foreign policy for
Gov. George W. Bush. There is no difference in substance between
the Rice essay and a speech on America's position in the world that
Bush gave to kick off his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under
Reagan, agrees with Rice, particularly on the need to protect U.S.
sovereignty and to build an anti-ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was defeated,''
Kirkpatrick confessed. ``I worked for five years at the U.N., and I
can tell you that votes in the General Assembly are often stampeded
and ill-informed. There are over 150 members in the General
Assembly, and the vast majority have no experience with nuclear
weapons, and so their votes are not based on fact or experience. It
is wrong to give such a body a literal veto over American
armaments, defense and national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall discussing the issue of the anti-ballistic missile
defense system with Ronald Reagan. The president looked upon a
system which could prevent an attack as a moral imperative because
it would prevent incalculable carnage. He believed that the policy
of MAD _ mutually assured destruction _ was immoral because it left
open the possibility of attack and cataclysmic bloodshed. To be
able to deter such an attack was equal to defending against
unprecedented inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN BEEFS UP HIS TEAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also a member of the Conservative Realist
choir.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has added some illustrious names to his
foreign-policy team. Other notable foreign-policy sages now stand
alongside Henry Kissinger in the ex-Navy pilot's camp, and they
include Zbigniew Brzezinski, Larry Eagleberger, Kirkpatrick and R.
James Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-prisoner of war also looks suspiciously upon mainland
China. Although McCain supports the maintainence of normal trade
relations with China, he looks upon that country of 1.2 billion
people as a rival to the United State in the Pacific Rim, and he
stands firmly for continued independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The November election will undoubtedly witness impassioned
disagreements over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China already enjoys most-favored-nation trading rights with the
United States and a mushrooming trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA AT CENTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging China as a potential adversary, McCain wants to link
membership in the World Trade Organization with domestic
liberalization in China. Rather than remain in a state of Clinton
self-denial, Conservative Realists want China to broaden universal
rights, grant religious freedom and cease political repression
before granting it equal representation in the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Bush or McCain becomes the GOP
presidential contender, China will become the center of gravity of
the foreign-policy debates. For most of the 12 years that
Republicans held the White House, from 1980 to 1992 under Reagan
and George Bush, the Cold War raged and Republicans looked tougher
on the Soviet Union than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evil Empire'' has disappeared, the bipolar world is a
theme of the past, but the Republicans have also suffered their
losses: They can no longer appear as the knights of anti-communism.
To reinvent their image as Sir Lancelot slaying the Red Dragon,
they are trying to paint Beijing as the Second KGB. Abiding by the
philosophy of ``Wag the Dog,'' if a war does not exist, then it is
necessary to invent one.

<P>
   &QL; 
``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

EDWARD H. LEVI, 88, ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER GERALD FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward H. Levi, who began his association with the University of
Chicago as a 5-year-old in a special kindergarten there and became
the university's president before going on to be a widely admired
attorney general of the United States, died Tuesday at his home in
Chicago. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A distinguished legal educator, he was called upon to restore
the credibility of the job of attorney general after the turmoil of
the Nixon era.
</P>
<P>
   No one was more a product of the University of Chicago than
Levi. He remained at the university's laboratory school through
grade school and high school, then attended college, graduate
school and law school at the university. He was at various times, a
law professor, dean of the law school, university provost, and
finally the university's president.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who spent most of his life in the shadow of the
University of Chicago, Levi had enormous impact on the university,
the study of law and even the surrounding Hyde Park neighborhood in
which he grew up and which he later helped revitalize. He thrilled
at teaching Chicago's renowned ``great books'' curriculum to
undergraduates, pioneered the pairing of law with other disciplines
like economics and statistics at the law school and was a fierce
recruiter of leading intellectuals in order to maintain the
university as a vibrant agora of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But he secured a wider place in history for his role in
Washington where he demonstrated that the skills he honed and
deployed in academic circles were equally useful at the highest
levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   As the 71st attorney general of the United States, Levi won wide
acclaim for his stewardship of the Justice Department in the
post-Watergate era. He has regularly been cited by political
scientists and lawyers as the model of a modern attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named to the post in 1975 by President Gerald Ford,
there was confusion about his political affiliations and
philosophy. Some news accounts questioned whether he was best
described as a conservative, liberal, or libertarian. When he left
office two years later, the answer was was no clearer, but the
question seemed mostly irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, who was a senior
official under Levi in the Justice Department, said in an interview
that ``there couldn't have been a tougher job in Washington where
the whole executive branch was in disarray after Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said that as attorney general, Levi ``brought the
department through its worst years,'' adding ``It was a bad time
not only because of the disgrace of Watergate which had affected
the department most deeply but there were also problems at the
FBI.'' The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been conducting
domestic surveillance operations that were likely unconstitutional
under the code name Cointelpro. Levi forced through regulations
setting limits on what the bureau and the Central Intelligence
Agency could undertake in investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought two qualities to the job,'' Scalia said, ``a rare
intellectuality and a level of integrity such as there could never
be any doubt about his honesty, forthrightness or truthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Department to return to the University of
Chicago, his performance was considered so nonpartisan that he was
warmly praised by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In a January, 25, 1977, speech in the Senate, Kennedy said,
``Mr. Levi entered office under the most difficult and trying
circumstances, yet he leaves a Department once again characterized
by integrity, intellectual honesty and commitment to equal
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Hirsch Levi born in Chicago on June 26, 1911, to Gerson
B. Levi, a rabbi who came to the United States from Scotland and
Elsa Hirsch Gerson. His maternal grandfather, Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch,
was an early member of the University of Chicago faculty and a
leading architect of the Reform branch of Judaism in America.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, Levi began studying for a
doctorate in literature at the University of Chicago but dropped
out of the program. Years later he explained that he had been told
in a friendly manner by a professor who admired his family that he
would never be given a position in the humanities department at
Chicago or any leading institution because he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that incident not ruefully but joyfully, in an essay
written for Newsweek magazine during the nation's bicentennial
celebrations of 1976 to demonstrate how much the country had
changed. He had, after all, become the first dean of a major law
school who was Jewish. When he became the president of the
University of Chicago in 1968, he said he believed he was the first
Jewish president of a major private university that did not, like
Brandeis, have a clear Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Casper, the president of Stanford University and a
former colleague of Levi's at the University of Chicago law school,
said that it was Levi who came up with the idea of teaming up with
an economist to teach his course in antitrust law. It was from that
innovation, Casper said, that the notion of tying law to other
forms of study was born. ``This was the beginning of the `law and
economics school' of thought for which Chicago would become
famous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Levi founded the school's Journal of Law and Economics,
which became a vehicle that helped the University of Chicago to
remain pre-eminent in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, who is a former
student of Levi's, said that he was also a model in furthering the
notion that intellectual arguments should be about ideas, not about
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He resented the personalizing of arguments,'' Botstein said.
``I remember he was asked if he was going to write his memoirs, and
he replied, `if I were to write a book, it would be about ideas,
not about myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was also renowned among college and university administrators
for his deft handling of civil disturbances on the Chicago campus
in 1968. Unlike administrators at some other major universities, he
did not call in the police or outside authorities when more than
400 students occupied his office for more than two weeks. He waited
them out and after they were gone, he suspended and dismissed many
of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   His slim volume, ``An Introduction to Legal Reasoning''
(University of Chicago Press, 1949), has been a perennially
assigned book in courses of jurisprudence at many of the nation's
law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Levi retired from the university in 1984; his wife, Kate
Sulzberger Hecht Levi, said he had suffered from Alzheimer's
disease for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, John G.,
a lawyer in Chicago, David F., a federal trial judge in Sacramento,
Calif., and Michael E., a particle physicist in Berkeley, Calif.

 &HT;    Thousands protest Bush's `One Florida' plan
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ They were grandmothers, roofers, bus drivers,
teachers, students, labor union members. All of them said the door
of opportunity was closing on them with Gov. Jeb Bush's push to end
racial and gender set-asides in state contracting and university
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 11,000 of them _ as estimated by state and local law
enforcement officials _ joined civil rights heavyweights Jesse
Jackson, NAACP president Kwesi Mfume and others in a 1-mile march
Tuesday up a hill on Apalachee Parkway to the Capitol in protest of
Bush's ``One Florida'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on you!'' they shouted in unison outside the Capitol,
about the same time Bush delivered his State of the State address
to lawmakers on the first day of Florida's legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of the 20-member Legislative Black Caucus skipped
the speech and marched.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, nearly 600 school bus drivers marked the protest by
taking the day off, leaving thousands of students without
transportation Tuesday. A school official told the Associated Press
that most of the drivers planned to attend the protest.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush argued in his address that the protests were ignoring
the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Floridians favor the elimination of
affirmative action programs,'' Bush said in his speech. ``It would
have been politically expedient to simply let these programs be
dismantled, with nothing to replace them.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said now that he's put a plan on the table, he is
``being reminded of the public and private price of taking a stand
on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 689 registered voters sponsored by the by the New
York Times, 44 percent said they support Bush's effort to end some
affirmative action policies through One Florida. Another 40 percent
said they wanted affirmative action policies to remain. The poll
had a margin of error of 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Florida, One Term,'' read Jacqueline Brown's homemade
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' said the retired educator, who drove to
Tallahassee from near Daytona Beach with her husband and a friend
early Tuesday morning to protest. ``The nerve of them, trying to do
away with affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying,'' Brown's husband, Harold, said, ``to take us
back to 1963. If those white, conservative Republicans keep it up,
we'd be back to slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has put some of his ideas into action through executive
order. Other parts need legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says the application for minority and female contractors
will be streamlined and outreach programs for minorities enacted.
As for college admissions, One Florida guarantees admission to a
state university of the top 20 percent of each high school
graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Leon County schools were granted permission to
attend the march, and some took the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's racism and sexism in this society,'' said high school
senior Beth Prentiss. ``It's blatant, it's obvious. If Bush doesn't
get the message we're going to make him listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 buses stretched from the Old Capitol back up
Apalachee Parkway as marchers listened to speakers, who spoke on a
podium framed by 2-story palm trees. Spanish moss swayed from oak
branches overhead.
</P>
<P>
   After waving to the crowd and shaking hands through the windows,
Jackson, Mfume and Martin Luther King III, president of the
Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, along with
other VIPs walked off Old Town Trolley bus No. 983 and strode to
the head of the march on Apalachee Parkway, closed most of the day
to accommodate protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Atlanta activists attending was the Rev. Timothy
McDonald, head of Concerned Black Clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to overcome a lot of things and we will be
able to overcome this,'' McDonald said. ``This (Bush proposal) is
the first step towards resegregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a late winter sun that warmed the day to 80 degrees _ so
hot that some participants were escorted to Red Cross booths
because of dehydration _ Jackson wore a short-sleeve black shirt
and black pants. During his speech on the Capitol grounds, Jackson
started calmly, his voice slowly crescendoing with each passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fighting for privileges, we're fighting for access
to the American Dream for all Americans and leave nobody _ black or
white _ behind,'' Jackson said. ``Affirmative action is based on
need. Say, `Based on need,''' he urged the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on need! Based on need! Based on need!'' the crowd
repeated after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's denial,'' Jackson continued, ``or persistent
discrimination to capital, contracts or health care, gender and
race matters. It affects women's incomes, therefore households'
access to capital. Most poor folks are not black. Most poor folks
are not brown. They're white. They're female, and they're young...
</P>
<P>
   ``Most poor folks are not on welfare, Jeb. They work every day.
They raise other people's children. They work every day. They pick
tomatoes and lettuce. They work every day. They change beds at
hotels. They work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the march, signs in the crowd mocked all Bushes _ the
Florida governor, his Texas governor brother, George W., the GOP
presidential front-runner, and their father, former President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Read My Lips. Damn You!
</P>
<P>
   Another: One term Jeb, No term George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it may be Super Tuesday in the nation, it is
super-duper Tuesday in the state of Florida,'' Mfume said, taking
note that the march coincided with presidential primaries and
caucuses in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Bushes as men of privilege, Jackson declared,
``When you inherit the name, when you inherit legal protection,
when you inherit the wealth, when you inherit skin color, when you
inherit your parents' friends for advantage, you just don't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami roofing company owner Patrick Burke and his secretary
Carolyn Calhoun drove from South Florida all night to join the
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like for him to leave affirmative action alone,'' Burke
said. ``With affirmative action, there's at least a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Calhoun, ``This could be the beginning of something
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of protesters marched on the Capitol Tuesday, March 7,
2000, against Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to eliminate racial and gender
preferences in university admissions and state contracting
Protesters from around the country chanted 'Shame on Bush' just
before the march, which began as Bush started his State of the
State address to the Florida Legislature and its guests..(AP

TOP GERMAN BANK IN TALKS TO BUY RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a move that could lead to one of the
biggest job reductions yet in Europe, Deutsche Bank AG plans to
acquire a big German domestic rival, Dresdner Bank AG, in a deal
potentially worth more than $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is already the largest bank in Europe in terms of
assets and the world's second largest behind the pending
combination of three big Japanese banks. If a deal to purchase
Dresdner Bank goes through, Deutsche Bank would become a far bigger
No. 2, with more than $1.2 trillion in assets, about twice the size
of Citigroup, the largest bank in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Tuesday that if the deal is completed, the two
German banks would eventually eliminate 1,000 to 2,000 branches in
Germany and, over time, cut tens of thousands of jobs. The two
banks have combined work forces of 120,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said the ultimate goal is a fundamental
overhaul of the banks that have been the hub of this country's
postwar economy.
</P>
<P>
   A ``new Deutsche Bank,'' they said, would largely retreat from
the basic business of serving retail customers at local branches.
The combined branch network of both banks would be spun off as a
separate company. Though Deutsche Bank might still own a majority
stake, it would concentrate on serving wealthy individuals and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Dresdner and Deutsche would only say on Tuesday that
they are in ``advanced'' talks about a collaboration and would hold
a news conference on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said it is to be structured as a
three-way agreement between the two banks and the biggest European
insurer, Allianz of Munich.
</P>
<P>
   All three institutions hold stakes in each other, as well as
many other German companies, and have been at the center of a web
of cross-holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the talks said that under a proposed
agreement, Allianz would take a significant stake in the new branch
network.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of the deal would be to guarantee Allianz a
distribution channel for its insurance and investment products. At
the moment, Allianz distributes many of its products through
Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz would also like to acquire Deutsche Bank's huge mutual
fund business, known as DWS. People close the talks said this may
also become part of the agreement, because Dresdner Bank has its
own mutual fund business and antitrust regulators in Germany or at
the European Commission in Brussels may demand that one of the two
businesses be sold.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, according to one executive, a combined company would
become what Deutsche Bank's top executives have long wanted: a bank
focused on serving the wealthy and the corporate.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted jubilantly to the prospect of a merger. Shares
of Deutsche Bank rose nearly 8 percent on Tuesday to 94 euros, or
$90.01. Dresdner soared 21 percent, to 57.20 euros, or $54.77.
Allianz shares gained 12.9 percent, to 383.30 euros, or $367.05.
</P>
<P>
   Though German banking executives have speculated about mergers
for years, the prospect of a deal between Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank caught many analysts by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The two held extensive negotiations last year about merging
their retail networks, but Dresdner Bank's chief executive, Bernard
Walter, broke off the talks in September.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, has been
restlessly restructuring his company from the time he took over the
top post three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer engineered Deutsche Bank's $10 billion acquisition of the
Bankers Trust Corp. last year, a move that gave Deutsche Bank a
much bigger presence in the United States and strengthened its
position in investment banking and transaction services.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breuer, Deutsche Bank has realized its biggest profits
from trading in bonds and derivative securities like options and
futures.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to those businesses, Deutsche Bank's net
income rose 50 percent in 1999, to 2.6 billion euros. Dresdner's
profit rose 13 percent, to 1.1 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   But their retail banking businesses have consistently kept
overall profitability below those of American and British financial
institution. Deutsche Bank's return on equity, a commonly used
measure of bank performance, was roughly 9.9 percent last year, and
Dresdner Bank's even lower. By comparison, Citigroup's return on
equity was around 14 percent.

 &HT;    Coke signals a desire to settle lawsuit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Chairman Doug Daft appears intent on trying
to settle the racial discrimination lawsuit against the company as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail Tuesday to all employees, Daft said he knows the
suit is on the minds of many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in mediation and are working toward an expedient
and equitable resolution,'' Daft told employees.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Richard Story ordered both sides
to try to settle the case by holding talks with a mediator, who is
supposed to facilitate the discussions. No talks have yet been
held.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri said he was glad to hear about
Daft's memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to learn about the company's good-faith
interest in settlement,'' Mehri said. ``Daft has an opportunity to
make full amends for the past and set the gold standard for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft's memo to employees came only three days after a meeting
and rally about the suit by about 500 current and former
African-American employees and their supporters. They vowed to keep
pressuring the company to treat black employees better.
</P>
<P>
   Daft said Tuesday that ``diversity is one of the fundamental
values'' of the company. He also said the company's Diversity
Advisory Council, which was formed after the suit was filed last
April, has come up with recommendations that will be announced in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by eight current and former employees, claims
the company has discriminated against African-Americans in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can
represent about 2,000 black salaried employees in the United
States. A decision on class certification is at least several
months away.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said most class-action cases are settled prior to
trial. Some said a settlement in this case could be a wise move for
the company because its reputation as a progressive employer has
been called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the settlement discussions are likely to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For example, will the company come up with enough money to
compensate a proposed class of employees?
</P>
<P>
   Another important issue is the company's employment practices.
The plaintiffs have said they want to make them fairer, while the
company has defended them as being equitable.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is reached in mediation, the judge would still
have to approve it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia _ To Eastern Europe experts who never
confuse this country with Slovakia or Slavonia, it is, in their
words, ``a jewel,'' ``a chocolate box,'' ``Eastern Europe's
best-kept secret,'' or even _ wait for it _ ``the Switzerland of
the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who stopped here overnight last June to thank
Slovenia for letting NATO jets fly over on their way to bomb Kosovo
and other parts of Yugoslavia, said at the time that he foresaw ``a
Europe undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in its
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Slovenia can lead the way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But as devotees struggle for the words to praise without
condescending to a country of two million people, economic
statistics tell the story more plainly: on the lists of Eastern
European countries ready to join the European Union, tiny Slovenia
is in the first wave, sometimes ranked at No. 2, behind Hungary but
ahead of the Czech Republic and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Since it broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991, its gross domestic
product per person has doubled to $10,000, outstripping that of
Hungary and rivaling those of the poorest European Union members,
Greece and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among Eastern Europeans, Slovenes do not need tourist
visas to visit the United States. The standard of living is so high
and unemployment so low that it is assumed that they will go home.
``It's the highest form of compliment the U.S. pays,'' a diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never hear of real poverty here,'' he said. ``There were
people laid off when they did economic shock treatment, but the
growing service industry absorbed them. There are retired people
getting by on pensions, but it's a living wage. There are
subsistence farmers, but they're in valleys where Heidi might have
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Slovenes quickly rebuff comparisons with rivals like
impoverished Romania or even the rest of the former Yugoslavia.
They were at the core of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it was
broken up after World War I, they say, and generations of their
artists and intellectuals went to the Vienna court, so they judge
themselves by the standards of Austria and northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our misfortune was that we were divorced in 1918,'' said Karl
Lavencic, a Slovenian journalist working in Britain. ``We joined
Yugoslavia, and standards began to deteriorate under communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, under Tito's ``self-management'' brand of
communism, Slovenia was allowed to lead the way in running
industries that traded with the West.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eastern bloc fell apart, 80 percent of Slovenia's
export market disappeared, but it recovered, and the country now
does 66 percent of its trade with the European Union. It exports
Renaults, parts for BMW and Ford, pharmaceuticals, furniture,
clothing and tires.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches on the Adriatic, ski runs in the Alps and lots of German
Baroque spires in tidy villages make tourism a growth industry, and
Ljubljana itself has a strange medieval exoticism. Dominated by a
hilltop fortress, it must have more dragons per capita than any
city west of Beijing _ as the city's symbol, there are dragons
guarding bridges, dragons climbing light poles, even dragons on the
manhole covers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the name of its oldest hotel, the Slon, which
claims to date from an inn founded in 1552, means the Elephant. A
government spokesman said it was named for Hannibal's big-guy
cavalry passing through to attack Rome, but that seems doubtful,
since the Carthaginians took the Spanish route. More likely is the
hotel's version: a circus working the Austro-Hungarian gig used to
tether its elephants nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike every other piece of the former Yugoslavia, the country
has no ethnic tensions. The population is 90 percent Slovene, and
the Italian and Hungarian minorities in border areas have their own
seats in Parliament and the right to bilingual education and the
use of their own languages in dealings with government.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenes joke that the shape of the country looks like a chicken
fleeing east, but they actually stood their ground and won a 10-day
war for independence in 1991 against demoralized troops from the
Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought Slovenians would just raise their hands and give
up,'' said Miha Rott, a government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia declared its independence on June 25 that year,
depriving the old Yugoslavia of what had been its borders with
Austria and Italy, and the Yugoslav army attacked on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone who describes the war acknowledges that Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian leader, had little interest in the fight
because there were almost no Serbs in Slovenia, and he was
husbanding resources for his plans to seize Serbian-inhabited
portions of Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs never regarded Slovenia as a part of the world they
would die for,'' Lavrencic said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Slovenia has aggressively pursued entry to NATO and
was almost included in the round of expansion that has already
brought in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. One reason that
Slovenia did not make that cut, say diplomats from many NATO
countries, is that NATO was wary of embracing any former Yugoslav
republic while war still raged farther south.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the European Union requires extensive overhauls
of the legal system and economy, especially in a formerly communist
country, and Slovenia still has changes to make, said Vincent
Piket, counsellor of the organization's delegation here.
</P>
<P>
   The country's banking and insurance are dominated by
government-owned companies that must be merged and sold. The
telephone monopoly must be ended and electricity privatized.
Antitrust laws need strengthening; laws favoring local bids for
government contracts need weakening.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 laws and bylaws matching those of other European
countries must still be passed and legislators taught their
meaning. Some sectors are resisting change: farmers fear
competition and judges resent being given a new body of laws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``from the point of view of the European Union we're not
a problematic country,'' said Janez Potocnik, head of the country's
negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   In the toughest areas for other would-be members _ inefficient
small farmers, pollution and corruption _ Slovenia does relatively
well. Though vocal, farmers are only 4 percent of the economy, and
many have second incomes from factory work, guesthouses or hunting.
There is little heavy industry. The justice system is slow but
honest.
</P>
<P>
   And, to the delight of the European Union, nervous about porous
borders even before Joerg Haider's party in Austria made much of
the issue, Slovenia is buying passport scanners, fingerprint
scanners, X-ray machines, night vision goggles and other hardware
needed to tighten its frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   Piket agreed with his counterpart, Potocnik.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental assessment is that they can join the union in
two or three years,'' he said. ``It depends on how fast they do
their homework. If they work as hard as they did last year, they
can do it.''

airport authorities increase departure taxes to pay for additional

REFURBISHED HOGAN ROOM PROMISES TO BE TREAT FOR FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Construction crews have completed their task outdoors, where an
off-season refurbishment of Colonial Country Club's greens and
bunkers will create subtle differences on selected shots for PGA
Tour participants at the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   But to the average golf fan, a more eye-catching change is
taking place indoors. Construction is ongoing on the club's
revamped Ben Hogan Room, with a target completion date of April 1.
</P>
<P>
   A popular stop for tournament visitors, the room has been in
transition since the majority of Hogan's mementos were shipped to
the U.S. Golf Association museum in 1998. It was Hogan's desire for
the items, valued in excess of $1 million, to be placed in a museum
setting upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   The decision left Colonial officials in a quandary about the
best way to continue honoring the only five-time champion in
tournament history. They decided to spend roughly $200,000 updating
the room and replicating Hogan's major-championship and Colonial
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The new display will feature an audio/visual monitor, with a
12-minute highlight clip of Hogan's career. Wood-and-glass cabinets
will hold tributes to Hogan's contributions as a player, club
manufacturer and author of instructional books. Separate displays
will house mementos from his nine major championships and five
Colonial titles.
</P>
<P>
   A locker will be built to replicate the one Hogan kept at Shady
Oaks Country Club until his death in 1997. It will be filled with
clothes Hogan wore in his later years, as well as a set of clubs
manufactured by the Hogan Co. in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include a granite floor with Hogan's signature
inlaid in gold leaf. A miniature of the bronze statue that
overlooks Colonial's 18th green will sit atop a pedestal listing
his professional golf victories and other major awards.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section will be devoted to Hogan's near-fatal auto
wreck in 1949, as well as his recovery after being told by doctors
that he would never walk again. Hogan went on to add six of his
nine major championships after the wreck, including a stirring
comeback to win the 1950 U.S. Open. A wicker-basket flagstick from
Merion (Pa.) Golf Club, site of the 1950 Open, will be part of the
display.
</P>
<P>
   So will photos donated by Dan Jenkins, the renowned author and
golf writer from Fort Worth. Another Fort Worth resident, Conrad
Bennett, has donated scorecards signed by Hogan from each of the
courses where he won major championships. Family members donated a
silk robe, signed by several prominent actors of the 1950s, that
Hogan received during the filming of ``Follow the Sun'', the 1951
movie based on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Schmuck, former club president and chairman of the Hogan
Room committee, said members are eager to see the finished product.
Currently, the room sits behind locked doors, with an artist's
rendering displayed in the main lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something Colonial needs to have,'' Schmuck said. ``The
golf course is what drives the train at our club. But Ben Hogan was
the engineer who drove the train and put Colonial on the map. His
wins here brought a lot of history and attention to Colonial that
we probably would not have gotten otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Corpening, a longtime Colonial member, said the finished
room will fill a void for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been walking past that room for 40 years and was used to
seeing Ben Hogan's trophies in there,'' Corpening said. ``To see
something else ... seemed wrong. That room is such an integral part
of Colonial. We want to make sure we recreate what we had the best
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   By tournament week, it should qualify as the off-season
renovation project that draws the most ooohs and aaahs from
visitors.
\Nsubheds:CHIP SHOTS \Nsubheds:Investing in the future During the
tournament's annual kickoff dinner, MasterCard Colonial officials
donated $60,000 to the Lindy Miller Foundation for Junior Golf.
Miller, golf director at Mira Vista Country Club, is organizing the
Fort Worth chapter of the First Tee project, an outreach program
founded by the PGA Tour to introduce disadvantaged youngsters to
the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hopes to begin construction within the next year on a
nine-hole course and golf academy, specifically tailored to junior
players, at Interstate 30 and Oakland Boulevard. Land for the
project was donated by the city of Fort Worth. Miller plans to
raise the $4 million necessary to fund the project before breaking
ground. Colonial officials also donated $100,000 to the project in
May. \Nsubheds:Early commitments Among the first players to commit
to compete in the 2000 Colonial (May 18-21) was Tom Kite, an Austin
resident in his rookie season on the Senior PGA Tour. Kite, 50,
opted to play in his 27th Colonial rather than take part in the
senior event that week in Kansas City, Mo. Other early commitments
include Mark Calcavecchia, defending champion Olin Browne and past
champions Peter Jacobsen, Keith Clearwater and Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Thomas, Colonial tournament chairman, said officials have
heard from 54 players with plans to compete in the event. Officials
anticipate about 110 participants. \Nsubheds:Furyk moves up David
Duval continues to be Tiger Woods' closest pursuer in the world
golf rankings. But with Sunday's comeback victory at the
Doral-Ryder Open, Jim Furyk has taken over the No. 2 spot in the
``Golfweek''/Sagarin Performance Index.
</P>
<P>
   The world rankings factor players' performances over a two-year
stretch, while the performance index considers only the past 52
weeks. Furyk has moved from No. 5 to No. 2 in the performance index
since Feb. 21, passing Duval (68.38), Davis Love III (68.36) and
Colin Montgomerie (68.45). In a system where the lower score is
better, Furyk (68.28) trails Woods (67.17) by a large margin.
\Nsubheds:INSIDE THE NUMBERS \Nsubheds:Major Milestones Although he
made headlines with his recent six-event winning streak at PGA Tour
events, Tiger Woods said the ``greatest record'' in professional
golf remains Jack Nicklaus' 18 victories in major championships.
Woods, by comparison, has two. The top six players on the list:
Name Major titles Jack Nicklaus 18 Walter Hagen 11 Ben Hogan 9 Gary
Player 9 Sam Snead 8 Tom Watson 8
LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the
Star-Telegram will feature a significant moment in tour history
history each week during the 2000 season. \Nsubheds:Feb. 26, 1978
Nancy Lopez, a 21-year-old rookie, provided a foreshadowing of
things to come by holding off Jo Ann Washam to win the Bent Tree
Classic in Sarasota, Fla. It marked the first of 48 triumphs in a
Hall of Fame career and was the first of Lopez's nine victories in
her rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez ended the 1978 season with a Triple Crown of awards _
Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year and Vare Trophy winner. But
her crowning achievement was a string of five consecutive victories
at midseason, which remains a tour record. That streak could not
have happened, Lopez said, without the confidence gained from
victory No. 1 on a windy day in Florida.

   &QL; 
``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

 &HT;    Ligtenberg has a good day
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ It might have looked and felt like any other
spring-training day to the mostly 60-something 6,524 Tiger faithful
relaxing in the sun on a breezy afternoon at Marchant Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But to Kerry Ligtenberg, Tuesday was critical. For the first
time in 362 days, Ligtenberg pitched in a baseball game. The result
was one scoreless inning.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreless part was a bonus. The Braves and Ligtenberg's
wife, Sara, breathed a collective sigh of relief when he skipped
off the mound, happy and, more importantly, healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In a spring-training game on March 10 of last year, Ligtenburg
hurt his elbow and ended his season. He had surgery on his elbow in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it,'' Ligtenberg said afterward. ``(It) didn't hurt, so
... .''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg said he got a good night's sleep Monday and wasn't as
nervous as he thought he would be before Tuesday's game. But
listened to some advice from Rudy Seanez, who on Monday
successfully threw his first inning since surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy told me, `The doctors fixed it. You know that the elbow
strong, so don't worry about something happening.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bigger chance of somebody like (Greg) Maddux or
(John) Smoltz or somebody else who hasn't had the surgery but has
pitched a lot more of their elbow blowing out than (mine)
re-blowing out,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out there, I calmed down a little bit,'' he said.
``It was kind of strange getting back into a game. Now that the
first one is out of the way, I can go have fun the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg threw a dozen pitches _ six balls and six strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me not to try to push it today, just to throw
like I was throwing batting practice,'' Ligtenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The third hitter he faced was Juan Gonzalez, the Tigers' new
cleanup hitter who is seeking $148 million to become the
highest-paid player in baseball. Gonzalez came to the plate with a
runner at third and one out, after hitting a two-run homer off
Terry Mulholland his previous time up.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg had been off target with his first two pitches and
gave up a single to Brad Ausmus on his first pitch over the plate.
Ausmus stole second while Ligtenberg dealt with Damion Easley.
Easley flew out to center for Ligtenberg's first out in almost a
year, and Ausmus took third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a whole lot on his fastball,'' said Easley, who
saw five Ligtenberg pitches and thought they looked about like any
other pitcher in camp. ``Even if I didn't know who it was or what
happened to him, I'd think, 'Spring training. He's just trying to
get in shape.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg's first pitch to Gonzalez was a ball. His second
Gonzalez was a good one. The Tigers new cleanup hitter swung
tentatively and sent a popup foul down the first base side where
Andres Galarraga was camped.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg then coaxed non-roster player Tilson Brito to hit
another popup in foul territory to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good first time out,'' Bobby Cox said. ``(His
pitches) had a little life on them, but he didn't overdo things.
We're delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg is scheduled to take today off, throw on the side
Thursday and then throw again in a game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to be back,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I'm excited to
get ready for the season. I think this was the first big step, and
we'll see how it goes tomorrow. And the next big step will be
throwing the splitter and trying to come back on shorter days'
rest. I still have a ways to go, but I feel pretty positive about
it.''

 &HT;    Hawks' Glover, 76ers' Jones, getting paid but rarely played
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back when they were high-school stars, which now seems so long
ago, Dion Glover and Jumaine Jones talked a lot about their
promising basketball futures.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it was about the glamour and glitz, the travel and
excitement of the Final Four and later the NBA. And, of course,
they saw themselves rippin' things up, just as they did as
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Never once did they entertain the reality that has been this
season: Seldom-used NBA rookies who look on painfully as their
former college teams struggle without them.
</P>
<P>
   And as March Madness rises toward its climax, it's difficult to
ignore the impact that deciding to leave early for the NBA has had
on both their careers and their respective colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech and Georgia both suffered their worst regular
seasons in years. Barring a stunning reversal in conference
tournaments that begin Thursday, each school's season will be over
that night or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones, a talented, hard-working forward, had stayed beyond
his sophomore year, and scoring guard Glover for his junior season
after missing a year with a major knee injury, the Bulldogs and
Yellow Jackets undoubtedly would have had better seasons and
brighter prospects in the conference tourneys.
</P>
<P>
   It also is possible that Glover's and Jones' NBA values would
have increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about that,'' Jones said recently. ``I do want
Georgia to do well, no question about that. Like everybody else, I
feel tournament time is a great time of year for college
basketball. I mean, I miss it, in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers' Jones and the Hawks' Glover find themselves in
similar positions. But instead of being stars, they are rookies who
are financially secure but whose status is far from stable. Neither
has garnered any meaningful moments _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   And so, were they wrong in going to the NBA so early? The
answers vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left college early, so I find it hard to criticize someone
else for leaving early,'' Washington Wizards guard Rod Strickland
said. ``You don't know people's circumstances. It could be a need
for the money to help out the family. People can say what they
want, but when you have a chance to make the kind of money they pay
in the NBA _ and your family needs it _ how can you tell him to
stay in school?''
</P>
<P>
   Although an outsider would look at his limited playing time on a
bad team as a source of regret, the The Glovers say they are
ecstatic about the son's decision, despite his limited playing time
on a poor team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has gone smoothly, to me,'' Glover's father, the
Rev. Franklin Glover, said. ``Dion's been a little anxious, because
he's ready to play. But he's grown to know that it's not about
playing. It's a job. You have to get up everyday, get yourself in
shape, work on the things you need to, watch what you eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father, when he was making his decision last year, I
always said we had to pray hard about it,'' the Rev. Glover said.
``Schooling is the best thing since water. The money is good, but
an education is best.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Glover decided to leave. ``Sometimes, being young,
you think you can conquer the world,'' Franklin Glover said. ``He
wanted to reach one of his goals and felt he was ready to, and did.
And the way we see it, it's been beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion Glover, 21, would not go that far. He's working hard on his
shooting and ballhandling to earn an opportunity from coach Lenny
Wilkens. Going into Tuesday's game at Chicago, Glover had played a
total of 50 minutes in 10 games. He said he would make the same
decision if he had to do it over again, but he's not happy on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting the whole year to show what I can do, that
I'm healthy and that I should be here,'' Glover said Tuesday.
``It's frustrating but very humbling, too. It makes me realize that
I have to work harder and make the coach play me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has played 89 minutes in 19 games, has the same
sentiments in Philadelphia. Coach Larry Brown has praised Jones'
athleticism, fearlessness and commitment to hard work, but it has
been difficult for Jones to find playing time on a team that has
aspirations for the Eastern Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different from what I expected, because I'm not
playing,'' Jones said. ``So, I have to control the things I can
control. I show up for practice early, work on the things that are
going to make me a better player.'' The 6-foot-7 Jones, also 21,
said he knows that as he sits the bench there's talk that he would
have been better off at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of my coaches said I was making a mistake leaving,
so I know people are saying it now,'' Jones said. ``But I
definitely disagree. It's one of the best jobs in America. I have
no regrets. The college game is weaker. Here, you're playing
against the best players in the world, even in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken care of my family,'' he said, ``and I have the
right frame of mind, which is to work hard to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with the money that accompanied going pro. As
the 20th pick in the draft, Glover earns $893,400 this season. Over
three years, he will make more than $3 million. Jones, the 27th
pick of the Hawks who was traded to the Sixers, makes $684,000; he
will earn $2.4 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the money, I've taken care of my mom and family,'' said
Jones, who is from Camilla. ``It's the one thing in going to the
NBA that I felt I had to take advantage of. If someone thinks
taking care of his family and playing in the NBA is a mistake, then
that's his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Jones have been important in each other's lives. As
two of Georgia's top high school players, they became good friends.
They talk regularly on the telephone and have served as sounding
boards for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Dion everyday,'' Jones said. ``He feels he should be
playing more. But he's going to do like I'm doing -- keep working
hard to help make his time come. He's been my best friend all this
time, and we're kind of keeping each other's spirits up right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said: ``Jumaine and I have been talking each other
through this. Like me, he's trying to be patient while at the same
time working hard to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Each plans to play in his team's summer league. Jones also plans
to go back to Georgia to work on his degree in sports management.
``No matter what anyone says, my future is bright,'' Jones said.
``I'm going to do what's necessary to get on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows the reason why I haven't played much?'' Glover said.
``Maybe it's not in God's plan. But I know that I'm healthy and,
when it's all said and done, I'll be one of the best to ever play
this game.''

 &HT;    Labonte finding winning forecasts
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte loves to travel to Atlanta, and it's not only
because of his recent domination in the Winston Cup races at
Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is a dedicated fan of the Weather Channel, headquartered
in Atlanta. Labonte watches the cable station every day, for racing
forecasts and just plain relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Weather Channel, who heard about Labonte's
fascination with weather maps and radar screens, have developed a
friendship with the No. 18 Pontiac driver.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte will be glued to the Weather Channel on the tube this
week, while he also tries to bring the thunder again at Atlanta
Motor Speedway in Sunday's race. He has won three of the past five
events at the 1.54-mile quad-oval, including November's race.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who leads the Winston Cup point standings for the first
time in his career, is considered a favorite in the Cracker Barrel
500 at 1 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rhyme or reason for my (recent success) at Atlanta
_ I have no idea why,'' Labonte said. ``I'm not sure I want to find
out why, because it might be something that might scare me away
from (doing so well).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked AMS, and that's something I got going for
me,'' he said. ``Another thing is (that crew chief Jimmy Makar)
always comes up with a good setup for the car. Plus, we keep good
notes and fall back on them every time we're at Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather has been a major factor in the last two spring races at
AMS. The No. 18 team, partially due to Labonte's passion for the
Weather Channel, is one of the best on the circuit in being
prepared for weather changes.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Cantore, an on-air meteorologist for the Weather
Channel, read in a magazine that it was Labonte's favorite
television channel, he contacted the driver's representatives. It
led to an invitation for a special tour of the studios several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so cool and neat to me,'' Labonte said. ``One thing
about it: I realized that we can all stand still for a little bit,
but the weather is always changing. It was exciting to talk to Jim
and the others. Their lives revolve around the weather, like mine
does with racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Labonte left the building, he was given Weather Channel
clothes and souvenirs. As one of the top Winston Cup drivers,
Labonte rarely walks in public without being recognized. On the way
to the New Hampshire race last year, Labonte and a team member
strolled through the Baltimore airport to change planes. Both were
wearing The Weather Channel shirts and hats.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, rain was pouring, and hurricane warnings had been
posted for much of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy stopped me and said, `Do you guys work for The
Weather Channel?' '' Labonte said with a laugh. ``I said, `Yeah,
we're hurricane hunters,' and left it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   During races, Labonte still gets the latest weather information.
Mark Cronquist, the head engine-builder for Joe Gibbs Racing, is
stationed at the radar screen located on the side of the NASCAR
trailer. It paid off for the team at Rockingham two weeks ago. The
forecast was for heavy showers, which meant most drivers ran theirs
cars as hard as they could the first half of the race because of
the possible rain.
</P>
<P>
   But Cronquist studied the radar screen and determined that the
rain would hold off for another hour or so. With Cronquist's
opinion, Labonte and Makar decided to save the car for the end of
the race. The strategy worked perfectly, and Labonte had the
strongest car over the final 40 laps to win the Dura-Lube/Kmart
400.
</P>
<P>
   It is why Labonte leads the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to make it through (the season),'' Labonte
said. ``There are still 31 races to go that make up this
championship. If we can just keep digging, then, hopefully, it will
pay off.''

ROLSTON GLAD TO BE WITH BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Brian Rolston has been traded twice this season,
and the second time _ when he was included in the package for Ray
Bourque Monday _ came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was traded for Ray Bourque,'' said Rolston, a
27-year-old left winger who comes over to the Bruins from the
Colorado Avalanche. ``There are a lot of things going on here, and,
obviously, he's a Hall of Fame player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray's going to a team that can win the Stanley Cup. If any
player deserves that, it's him. They're a good team. They're going
to have a chance to win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston came to Colorado last Nov. 3 in a trade with the New
Jersey Devils, who had selected him in the first round of the 1991
NHL draft (11th overall). He isn't familiar with the other players
the Bruins obtained _ defenseman Martin Grenier, who is playing in
the Quebec League, and center Sami Pahlsson, who is in the Swedish
Elite League _ so he can't really assess the trade, which also sent
Dave Andreychuk to Colorado and a first-round pick to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know them at all, they're young prospects,'' said
Rolston, who joins his new teammates here for a game against the
Sabres Wednesday night. ``I haven't been in training camp with
them, but seeing that Bourque and Andreychuk were involved in the
trade, they've got to be good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the speculation about a Bourque trade the past week
in Boston, Rolston and the Avalanche weren't mentioned, which is
why the deal caught him off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it happens _ if you hear the rumor, it
usually doesn't happen,'' said Rolston, who has 22 points this
season (11 goals, 11 assists), his sixth in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rolston had a career-high 24 goals for the Devils,
but his production fell off after the first trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a tough transition for me,'' he said. ``I
haven't put up the points this year that I did last year, although
I just started playing better the last 20 games and feeling a lot
more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to believe I can do that consistently. I had problems
adjusting to Colorado. I didn't have as strong a year as I wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns remembers Rolston from his Devils days
and likes what the Bruins are getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a feisty little guy, I know that,'' Burns said. ``He'll
fit in well with this group of players. He's a hard worker. He had
some good times in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, who is signed through next season, is delighted to be
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be here, first and foremost,'' he said. ``This
organization has done nice things in the past few years. I'm
looking forward to playing with them. It's a young team, it's a
very talented hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, who has outstanding speed, is aware of the defensive
style that Burns loves to play. He saw something like it with the
Devils, who won the Stanley Cup in 1994-95, his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a defensive hockey team, the Devils, that's
something that was always stressed, something I'm familiar with,''
said Rolston, ``and if that's the style of play, it should be good.
I play both ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a Stanley Cup my first year was, obviously, huge. It
was a great experience for me and, hopefully, that experience will
help me down the road.''

FOR SENIOR AND JUNIOR, EVERY DAY IS FATHER'S DAY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ The obviously close relationship between Ken
Griffey Sr. and Jr. had its origin in the relationship between
Senior and his father. Actually, there was no relationship, which
is why there is such a strong bond between the coach and the player
in the Cincinnati Reds clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to make sure he knew who his dad was,'' Senior
said.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Griffeys are together again. They were the first
father-and-son teammates in 1990 and '91, and they were coach and
player in '93, both in Seattle. Now they are coach and player in
Cincinnati, their reunion courtesy of the trade the Mariners didn't
want to make.
</P>
<P>
   Senior never had a chance to play with or associate with his
father in baseball. Joe Griffey played baseball, apparently well
enough to attract the attention of a scout, but the scout saw too
much of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two players scouts came to see in Donora, Pa.,''
Senior said, ``were Stan Musial and my father. But when the scout
got there and saw my father was black, he left.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Griffey left, too. Ken, one of his three sons, was 2 when
his father bolted the family. He did not see him again until he was
9, then not again until he was 25, Senior said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 17 years of my life I spent on welfare,'' he said,
sitting in the visiting dugout at McKechnie Field before an
exhibition game with Pittsburgh. Junior was standing out at
shortstop during the waning swings of batting practice, the bill of
his cap facing the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Griffey's son and grandson do not have to worry about
welfare. Senior was traded to the Yankees in 1981, just before he
could have become a free agent, and signed a six-year contract
worth $6.25 million, a hefty package at the time. Junior was traded
to the Reds last month because he would have been a free agent next
November, and he signed a nine-year contract worth $116.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son are closer in age than most players and their
fathers because Ken became a Senior when he was only 19 years old.
At times, then, the Griffeys seem to be more like friends than
father and son. One of those times is not when they go out for
dinner together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes me to dinner,'' Junior said. ``He pays.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is that? ``He's the provider.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he was asked, doesn't the time come when the provider
becomes provided for? ``He hasn't reached that point,'' Junior
said. ``He ain't 50.''
</P>
<P>
   When will Senior be 50? ``In April,'' Junior said and then
laughed, demonstrating his ability to react as if he were much
younger than his 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Junior to the Reds because that was the team
he said he wanted to go to, and he had the collective bargaining
right to enforce his position. Senior said he had been confident
that Junior would be traded to the Reds. ``I knew he wanted to come
here,'' Senior said. ``He was going to be happier here than
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular view was that Junior wanted to go to Cincinnati,
where he grew up while his father was playing for the Reds, and
where one day soon he could play for his father.
</P>
<P>
   That view has helped fuel speculation that Senior is the Reds'
manager-in-waiting. The Griffeys scoff at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's you guys talking about it, not us,'' Junior said,
meaning reporters. ``He has had other job offers. He could have
been somewhere else, but they didn't work out. With the contract I
signed here and the contract Seattle offered me, do you think if he
was somewhere else he would say come here for me? He wouldn't do
it. It was all my decision to come here. It had nothing to do with
him as far as him getting a manager's job. For people to think
anything else is not right. They don't know our family. Even if he
wasn't here, it still would have been one of the places where I
wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``If I wanted to force the issue, I could have
made him a coach in Seattle. But I didn't. That's just the way it
is. We're two separate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior was asked if he ever thought he would manage Junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I can't force-feed the future. I
mean, I'd like to. We'll just wait and see. But at this point Jack
McKeon is the manager. That's who's going to be managing this
club.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, fathers have not had much success with their
sons on their teams. When Hal McRae managed the Kansas City Royals,
his son Brian was his center fielder, and they had a rugged
relationship. When Dale Berra joined his father, Yogi, who was
managing the Yankees, they looked forward to a fun-filled
professional relationship. But Yogi was fired 16 games into the
season. Cal Ripken Sr. and Jr. had a similarly distasteful
experience that resulted in Senior's dismissal as manager of the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the elder Griffey will scrutinize his son from the
vantage point of hitting coach. Based on Junior's first 11 seasons
in the major leagues, Senior won't have much coaching to do. Junior
took his 398 home runs to the Reds, including 160 in the last three
seasons, and a .299 batting average built on seven .300 seasons.
Junior has been singled out generally as the player with the best
chance to break Hank Aaron's career record of 755 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not thinking that way right now,'' Senior said. ``The
only thing he's got on his mind is that ring. That's the only thing
he thinks about. That one ring. He says if he gets one, I can't rub
it in on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior's World Series rings, from 1975 and '76, don't give him
immunity from Junior's taunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets on me all the time,'' Senior said. ``He says all sorts
of stuff. But I get the last laugh. After every workout they have
to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior, who supervises the running around the bases, laughed an
evil laugh. ``He was a little upset at me the other day because I
ran him,'' Senior said. ``They had to run two triples instead of
one. He said, `I'm going to tell my grandmother.''' &QL;

MOODY'S RAISES MEXICO'S CREDIT RATING TO INVESTMENT GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprisingly broad endorsement of Mexico's economic
strength and financial management, Moody's Investors Service on
Tuesday raised the country's credit rating to investment grade for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a powerful vindication of President Ernesto
Zedillo's efforts to convince investors that Mexico will make it
through national elections this year without the kind of economic
disaster that has marred every presidential turnover for the last
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a signal that allows the investor to say, `I can assume
that the overall economic context is a sound one,''' said Finance
Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino.
</P>
<P>
   With the upgrading from the junk-bond category, Moody's moved
Mexico into the league of countries that present a very low risk of
failing to pay their debts. Now the government and many private
Mexican corporations will have access to a wider range of financing
at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The new rating clears the way for many large institutions in the
United States to buy Mexican bonds, which they were barred from
doing without the investment grade status.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's pointed to Mexico's ``dynamic export sector'' and
successful integration with the U.S. economy since the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement. Because Mexico's foreign debt is
clearly manageable, Moody's said, ``a slowdown in the U.S. economy
should not be seriously disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency was also unusually optimistic about the prospects for
stability through the balloting on July 2 and the handing over of
power Dec. 1. ``The widespread consensus on the importance of sound
financial policies combined with a vibrant multiparty democracy
provides additional support to continued fiscal discipline,''
Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist, has focused economic policy
for the last year on taking Mexico through the end of his term
without a devastating peso crash like the one that he faced in his
first days in office. While foreign reserves stand at $31 billion,
the country has already refinanced the foreign debt scheduled to
come due this year, and faces ``very comfortable'' repayments next
year, Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's decision immediately began to push interest rates down.
The rate on the benchmark 28-day Mexican treasury bonds dropped to
13.95 percent, the lowest since the period before the crisis began
in December 1994. As recently as September 1998, in the middle of a
crisis created by turmoil in Russia and Brazil, the rate had soared
to 41.33 percent. &QL;

ANXIOUS INVESTORS DRIVE DOWN THE DOW MORE THAN 374 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Graphic being sent with PROCTER-WARNING may also be used with
this story.) 
(mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 374.47
points Tuesday on investors' fears that rising oil prices combined
with higher interest rates may do significant damage to corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The fall began when Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the nation's
biggest and best-known companies and one of the 30 stocks in the
Dow, said early Tuesday that its earnings in the current quarter
would come in well below the levels expected by Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, which came just a week after the company had
assured investors that its sales and earnings were on track,
shocked investors. They dumped P&AMP;G shares, wiping out $36 billion,
or 29 percent, of the company's value.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investors' anxiety, oil prices soared to $34.10 a
barrel, a price not seen since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, already troubled by the pinch on corporate profits
that will result from rising interest rates, now have to worry
about the ill effects of the higher costs of materials on company
earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average took the biggest hit, falling
374.47 points, or 3.7 percent, to 9,796.03. Broader market averages
fared a bit better; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.6
percent of its value, while the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index
declined 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, the focus of
investor ardor in recent months because of its collection of
hot-growing technology stocks, lost only 1.2 percent of its value.
It closed at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been walking on eggshells because of the Fed,
but that was in an environment where they felt confident about
earnings,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``That has now been brought into
question because of P&AMP;G. Earnings worries, interest rates and oil
prices are often enough to unglue even the calmest investor.''
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in P&AMP;G was responsible for just under a third of the
Dow's decline, the fourth-largest drop in points ever registered in
the average. In percentage terms, Tuesday's decline was not
historic. For the year, the Dow is down 14.8 percent while the
Nasdaq has gained 19.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of rival consumer goods companies fell on Procter &AMP;
Gamble's news that its earnings would decline as much as 11 percent
in the quarter rather than gain the roughly 9 percent forecast by
the company previously. Drug companies also fell, as did the shares
of banks and financial services concerns. Shares of larger
technology companies favored by investors like Cisco Systems,
General Electric and Nortel Networks also sank.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 30 companies in the Dow average rose. Exxon
Mobil, a beneficiary of rising oil prices, closed at $81, up more
than $8, and Microsoft jumped 2.5 percent, to close at $92.875.
</P>
<P>
   While few investors own the Dow Jones industrial average, many
investors do hold mutual funds that mirror the performance of the
S&AMP;P index. After five years of double-digit gains, it is down 7.73
percent this year. It fell 35.66 points Tuesday, to 1,355.62.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in oil prices, which are at levels not seen since 1991,
put significant pressure on stocks Tuesday. ``Oil is responsible
for about two-thirds of the decline in the Dow,'' said Christine A.
Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``The perceptions on inflation are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the reasons why Procter &AMP; Gamble's earnings in
the current quarter will be so grim is that its materials costs are
rising. The company said the creeping costs of plastics, many of
which are oil-based, and paper, to a lesser degree, have cut into
profit margins. Investors are clearly worried that these problems
are not limited to P&AMP;G and may be a harbinger of earnings
shortfalls at other old-stock-market reliables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors continue to pour money into shares of
fledgling technology companies whose growth seems more promising.
Reversing what had been a longstanding trend in the stock market,
small companies' stocks are now vastly outperforming those of large
companies. According to Salomon Smith Barney, as of the end of last
week, shares of the smallest companies _ those with market values
of $250 million or less _ were up 18 percent for the year. Stocks
of the biggest companies, those with market values in excess of $20
billion, were down 2 percent for the year as of Friday. That trend
continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists viewed the blue-chip selloff warily. ``This is
truly causing us to question the viability of the big bull market
that began in 1982,'' said Alan R. Shaw, head of technical research
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``There are still people funneling money
into Nasdaq stocks but common sense and history suggest that
eventually these stocks as well will suffer corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors clearly see fast-growing technology companies as a
safe haven. But some strategists question whether these so-called
new-economy stocks will be impervious to a slowdown in the
old-world companies. ``It's as though you have one economy on earth
and the other on Mars,'' said David Dreman, head of Dreman Value
Management. ``Roughly 50 percent of capital expenditures goes to
technology spending on one form or another. If the old economy
turns down I don't think it's good for the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global
Investors, agreed. ``If there is a change in employment trends and
a slowing in income growth as a result of interest rates, the
demand for this new economy is going to slow down,'' he said. ``If
that happens, their growth rates will decelerate and these
companies will experience a closing of the gap between the old and
the new.''
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks are already in a bear market. According to Salomon
Smith Barney, 77.8 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks are down 20
percent or more. And even though the Nasdaq is up, 62.1 percent of
its stocks have declined 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the slide in stock prices coupled with higher
oil prices may slow the economy and reduce pressure on the Federal
Reserve to push interest rates sharply higher in coming months.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has clearly
warned investors that policy-makers will raise rates by one-quarter
of a point at their next meeting on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Callies said that while stock prices might soften a bit further,
underlying fundamentals remain positive. ``As far as I can tell,
commodity prices increases will be temporary, and the structure of
corporate profits is still quite strong,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the week since another child was shot to death
in an American school, there has been plenty of maneuvering on gun
control in Washington, but little movement.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more clear than Tuesday when President Clinton,
after meeting with lawmakers in a highly publicized Oval Office
session that was billed by the White House as an effort to break a
months-long impasse on gun legislation, met as well with the mother
of the slain 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Clinton urged Congress to shatter the
legislative stalemate and pass far-reaching gun-control provisions
before the first anniversary next month of the shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past eight months, the leaders in Congress have done
virtually nothing to complete a final bill,'' Clinton said after
meeting with four key lawmakers, an event the White House labeled
an effort to broker a compromise. ``Congress has kept the American
people waiting long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the president met with Veronica McQueen, the
mother of Kayla Renee Rolland, the girl shot last week in her
first-grade classroom in Michigan by another 6-year-old who had
brought a pistol to school.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they invited McQueen on Monday when
they heard she would be in town for a day or two to do a television
interview. ``She was in D.C., and we reached out to her for a
private meeting,'' said Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time their own, largely futile session with the
president was over, the Republicans had learned he would soon be
meeting with McQueen, and they accused the president of wielding
them as an election-year prop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there to be used,'' fumed one senior House Republican
aide.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control promises to be a hot issue in the campaigns for
president and congress alike, and each party is blaming the other
for the delay in resolving the logjam.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation at issue now was passed in differing bills by
the House and the Senate last year, after rancorous debates. But
within each chamber, legislators remain deeply divided on the
provisions, especially those dealing with the regulating of gun
shows, and they have yet to reconcile those differences in
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton signaled a willingness to support some
unspecified version of a compromise proposed by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyde's plan, vendors at gun shows would have up to 24
hours to conduct mandatory background checks of prospective gun
buyers. If the check turned up the possibility of a disqualifying
arrest or felony conviction, the vendors would have two additional
days to perform the checks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association opposes even this compromise,
because gun shows are typically held on weekends only, and many
visitors travel some distance to get there. So the restriction, the
NRA argues, would all but kill the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Senate Judiciary
Committee, has refused to convene the conference committee of House
and Senate negotiators until gun-control supporters relent on their
demand for a three-day waiting period on all sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put everybody together so people can shout
political epithets at each other,'' Hatch told reporters after the
meeting at the White House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of caving in to NRA demands to
keep the conference bottled up. ``We want to lay our cards on the
table; they do not,'' said Julian Epstein, the Democratic staff
director of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hyde and Hatch, the two ranking Democrats on the
judiciary panels, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, attended the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he would
back a less sweeping bill that included provisions that enjoyed
broad bipartisan support, like mandatory child-safety trigger locks
on gun sales and a ban on imported large-capacity ammunition clips.
``There are some gun provisions that make good common sense,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would oppose
legislation that failed to close what the president called ``the
gun show loophole.''

GORE METHODICALLY PICKED BRADLEY APART 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note that this is an analysis) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Last September Al Gore's campaign was on the
verge of a nervous breakdown as the candidate suffered from a
series of stumbles on the stump and an inability to escape
President Clinton's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his political dreams slip away, Gore took some drastic
action that included slashing a payroll bloated with high-paid
consultants and moving his headquarters from Washington's lobbyists
row to his native Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to get out of the nation's capital and mingle
more with primary voters, who at that time were increasingly
intrigued by the reformist message of ex-basketball star and former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few question the health of Gore's presidential bid, which
was bolstered by Tuesday's results that virtually ensured his lock
on the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And looking ahead to the November general election, a new NBC/
Wall Street Journal poll shows that Gore has pulled even with
Republican George W. Bush in a general election matchup, wiping out
a double-digit lead the Texas governor once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's markedly improved situation can be attributed to his own
efforts and to events out of his control, including the campaign of
GOP insurgent John McCain who drew attention away from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it was not just superficial changes, such as moving
his headquarters to Nashville or swapping business suits for
earth-toned casual wear, that saved Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They say that during the past six months Gore, who is capable of
boring an audience with his wooden style and technical-talk, has
become a smoother speaker and more adept campaigner, who now makes
an effort to shake hands and kiss babies.
</P>
<P>
   He also revealed a ruthless streak by savaging Bradley's marquee
proposal to provide universal health care coverage, a goal embraced
by many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore methodically picked apart the plan, insisting it was so
expensive that it would crowd out spending on other priorities dear
to Democrats such as education, AIDS funding, Medicare and health
care for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sullivan, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic
Party, credited Gore's tougher style for helping him rebound to
narrowly win the state's first-in-the-nation primary. Bradley never
recovered from that loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People liked the fact that he said `I've got to change. I've
got to be tougher and I've got to be more like the candidate I was
when I ran for Congress from Tennessee and less like the vice
president,''' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive debater, Gore used a series of face-offs with
Bradley to poke holes into his opponent's record and proposals. At
times Gore came across as too slick and prone to relying on
gimmicks, such as when he extended his hand and challenged Bradley
to pull his advertising and to debate him twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   But a key turning point in the race occurred during an Iowa
debate in January when Gore introduced a farmer in the audience and
pointed out that Bradley had voted against flood aid to the state
when he was in the Senate. Bradley did not explain his vote, which
contributed to his big loss to Gore in the state's crucial
caucuses, that kicked off the first test of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said that one of the
messages of the revitalized Gore campaign was that the candidate
``will do what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the analyst said such a combative style worked in a
Democratic primary, it might hurt in a general election by
alienating independent voters who are already turned off by
political posturing and bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks very much like the typical politician who will do
anything and say anything to win,'' said Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   To beat Bradley the vice president also scrapped his original
plan to concentrate on Bush and spent much of the fall and early
winter stroking key Democratic constituencies _ organized labor,
minorities, abortion rights and gay rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also benefited from the surprisingly competitive
Republican race and the media's fascination with McCain, who
competed with Bradley for independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more difficult balancing acts for Gore has been his
relationship with President Clinton, who is both an asset and a
liability for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has tried to distance himself from Clinton's
personal scandals by condemning the president's relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and stressing his solid
30-year marriage with his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Gore takes some credit for the booming economy
of the Clinton years and never fails to mention that he wants to
continue the administration's domestic and foreign policy
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore is more likely to be haunted by some of his own
questionable campaign finance activities, particularly his visit to
an illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple during the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have vowed to keep that controversy alive with
political ads that contain video of Gore at the temple.

<P>
   CAMP SHAMROCK, Lebanon _ A signpost mounted by Irish troops at
the heart of this U.N. military encampment just outside the Israeli
occupation zone in southern Lebanon brings home one of the
ineluctable facts that makes peace in this region so elusive.
``Dublin 3,930 kilometers,'' one of the hand-lettered arrowheads
reads, about 2,435 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing it, pointing due south, is another arrowhead. ``Tel
Aviv 135 kilometers,'' about 84 miles, it says.
</P>
<P>
   The sign is a measure of the compact scale on which conflicts
between Israel and its neighbors have played out.
</P>
<P>
   From U.N. outposts near here, the Ramin kibbutz in northern
Israel is visible on a thickly wooded hillside less than 10 miles
east. With powerful field glasses, a visitor can see people in
shorts moving about among the kibbutz's neatly arrayed apartment
blocks. The pilots of the Israeli F-16 fighter-bombers that fly
high overhead, dropping ``smart bombs'' with deadly accuracy, are
only minutes away from bases in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only a small leap of the imagination to believe that if
relations between Lebanon and Israel were normalized, the wealthier
among the Shiite Muslim population that predominates here could
drive to Tel Aviv in midmorning to shop or have lunch, and be back
for tea. Israel's largest city would then be only a little bit
farther from this biblical landscape of rocky hillsides above
groves of olive, orange and lemon trees than Beirut, Lebanon's
capital, an hour's drive to the north.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, this remains a dream, albeit one that seems
closer to realization. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel promised
during the election campaign that brought him to power last year
that he would withdraw the Israeli troops that have held an
occupation zone in southern Lebanon since 1985. The fulfillment of
the promise would be a first, essential toward ending the enmity
that Israel's occupation, and the guerrilla war it ignited, has
sown between Israel and Lebanon, a country that is by tradition
perhaps the most cosmopolitan of all Israel's Arab neighbors. [On
March 5, Israel's cabinet unanimously endorsed a commitment to a
July withdrawal.)
</P>
<P>
   What a full and lasting peace might mean is already apparent in
the routines of at least one man. Timur Goksel, a 56-year-old
Turkish citizen, who has been a U.N. political adviser in Lebanon
since 1978, when Israel's initial invasion prompted deployment of a
U.N. force that now has 4,500 men.
</P>
<P>
   Goksel recently met with a high-ranking Israeli military
official in Tel Aviv in the morning, then drove to Tyre on
Lebanon's coast for a lunch-time meeting with a local commander of
Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla force confronting the Israelis.
He drove home to Haifa, the Israeli coastal city where he makes his
home, in time to collect his children from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing to it,'' Goksel said during a stopover in Tyre one
morning recently, before heading back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of what peace might bring have begun to entrance people
here since Barak made his pledge last year to withdraw Israel's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the deadline, U.N. officials say, Israel's 1,000-member
force has become more wary in the occupation zone, and Israeli
newspapers have quoted young conscripts as saying they pray not to
be ``the last Israeli soldier to die in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the hills and gullies around Tibnin, the
Lebanese village where Camp Shamrock is situated, echo almost every
day to the boom and rattle of rocket, artillery and machine-gun
fire. That is the currency of exchange between Israeli forces and
their allies in a Christian-led militia force, the South Lebanon
Army, and their antagonists in Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
Lebanese force that draws its inspiration from the militantly
Islamic ideals of the pro-Iranian Shiite clerics who lead it.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than two decades of warfare, the fighting here has
become such a fixture in the consciousness that people on both
sides have built entire lives around it. In northern Israel, the
populations of whole towns and kibbutzim disappear into bunkers
within minutes of sirens signifying the risk of Hezbollah firing a
volley of the Russian-made Katyusha rockets that have been the most
terrifying, because they are the least accurate, of the weapons in
the guerrillas' armory.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where shelters are rare, people hunker down behind
stone walls along the roads, or hasten into basements, when Israeli
forces open up with 155mm artillery or launch F-16 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Other local residents long since migrated north, to Beirut or
other Lebanese cities _ or abroad, to Africa, Europe or the United
States. Some made fortunes and returned to build huge, pretentious,
pillared-and-towered mansions that are the most prominent feature
along roads that wind through the hills. One of the few things
about the war that local residents find even vaguely amusing is
when Israeli aircraft flatten one of these monstrous houses,
suspecting it of being a Hezbollah stronghold, as they did in
January.
</P>
<P>
   How the Israeli withdrawal will occur will depend on complex
maneuvering between Israel, Syria and Lebanon. At the moment, with
no formal negotiations, all manner of speculation is running. Will
Syria and Israel resume their suspended talks, settle differences
over the Golan Heights, and make a deal in which Syria, through its
overlordship in Lebanon, guarantees that Israeli forces can
withdraw in peace?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it be a withdrawal under fire, raising the risk of harsh
Israeli retaliation, possibly more bombing raids of the kind that
destroyed three Lebanese power plants on Feb. 8?
</P>
<P>
   While tacticians on all sides puzzle out the combinations, the
result in the war zone has been heightened uncertainty. Israel's
forces take the initiative less and less, but still respond
fiercely when attacked.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say they have picked up signs that the 2,000-man
South Lebanon Army, about to be orphaned by the Israeli pullout, is
beginning to disintegrate. Many of its fighters are Shiite Muslims,
apparently press-ganged into service with threats against their
homes and families by the force's Maronite Christian commanders.
There is concern that they might defect to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   A demoralizing final straw for the South Lebanon Army came on
Jan. 30 when its field commander, Col. Akl Hashem, was assassinated
by Hezbollah with a roadside bomb as he walked his dog outside his
heavily guarded compound in a village just south of here. The
attack was videotaped by Hezbollah for showing on its Beirut-based
television channel, complete with a blinding flash and mushroom
cloud of dust and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The attack touched off intensified fighting, which culminated in
the deaths of seven Israeli soldiers and the Israeli raids on the
Lebanese power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.N. force _ formally the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon _ feels the uncertainty. Some men in the Irish
battalion, one of nine national contingents in the force, have done
as many as 14 six-month tours here since 1978. The U.N. Security
Council resolution that demanded Israel's ``unconditional''
withdrawal from Lebanon, also in 1978, gave the force the task of
``verifying'' the pullout, but officers have little idea of how the
task will be carried out, or whether there will be a role for the
United Nations force afterward.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the fighting goes on, and U.N. troops do what
little they can to restrain it. How difficult that can be was
demonstrated by a tour of the Irish battalion's outposts near
Tibnin.
</P>
<P>
   Above the the village of Baraachit, Lt. Enda McGuane, commander
of an outpost with six officers and men, mounted a lookout tower
buffeted by a chilly wind to show how close-quarters the fighting
can be _ and how difficult, or impossible, it is to exact
compliance with a 1996 agreement that declared a radius of about
550 yards around any civilian area a ``no fire zone.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 yards to one side of the post, close to the village,
McGuane pointed to an intersection of low stone walls used as a
mortar firing point by Hezbollah. About 500 yards in the other
direction, he noted an unoccupied house, also close to the village,
that he said was another Hezbollah firing point.
</P>
<P>
   A stop at another U.N. outpost in the village of Haddata made
the point more vividly. As the Irish troops prepared to drive
visitors into the occupation zone, Hezbollah fighters began firing
mortars from points near the village at another fort, like the one
at Baraachit occupied by the South Lebanon Army. Almost
immediately, the men in the fort responded. A dozen or more times,
mortars impacted with a loud crump among the blossoming apple and
cherry trees on the hillside, some not more than 500 yards from the
U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. lookouts waited for artillery fire on Hezbollah
positions from an Israeli position about 9 miles away, near the
Ramin kibbutz, but none came.
</P>
<P>
   The post commander, Commandant Peter Marron _ the rank is
equivalent to major _ ushered his visitors into the shelter of the
outpost, where soldiers served coffee. ``It's just harassment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah reminds the Israelis that they're here, and a force
to be reckoned with, and the SLA fire back, just to let Hezbollah
know they're ready for a fight,'' he said. The real risk to the
Israeli troops and their allies, the Irish officers said, comes
when they rotate men out of the forts, exposing their convoys to
the roadside bombs and ambushes that have been one of Hezbollah's
deadliest tactics.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to Beirut, the road passed through a village,
Qana, that history may mark as the turning point in the Israeli
occupation. It is the site of a U.N. compound. On April 18, 1996,
Israeli artillery hit a building where local civilians were taking
refuge from earlier Israeli barrages, killing 106 men, women and
children. Israeli commanders said the strike resulted from
targeting errors after Hezbollah fighters fired from a point close
to the U.N. compound, but U.N. and Hezbollah representatives have
maintained that there was no outgoing fire from close by at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The site is marked now by the embers of the burned shelter, and,
nearby, a desolate cemetery where the victims are buried in crowded
rows of gray marble tombs, each 60 to 70 feet long. Each tomb
contains the remains of a single family _ 16 people, in one case,
their crumpling photographs posted in a misted glass case above the
tomb.
</P>
<P>
   A sign nearby, in English and Arabic, carried a single, angry
message that suggested that it could be years after the Israeli
withdrawal before some people in the region accept Israel's
explanations for the strike and reconcile themselves to peace.
``The New Holocaust,'' the sign said.

SPORTS COLUMN: SOUND ADVICE FOR JETS FANS _ GET USED TO IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only can management threaten to trade Keyshawn Johnson for a
draft choice, it can also actually do it. There might even be some
football justification for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bill Parcells is just playing with Keyshawn's fertile
mind, trying to make him appreciative of all the good things about
playing for the Jets, whatever they happen to be. However,
contemporary sports economics says Parcells just might deal Johnson
to Baltimore because of the way Keyshawn could clog up the salary
cap if he gets what he thinks he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Keyshawn looks like a franchise player, tall and tough and
resourceful. But he is also a wide receiver, a category of player
often only as good as the man lining up behind the center.
</P>
<P>
   Star receivers are not any more valuable than dominant running
backs or linebackers. This may sound like heresy, but you can bet
this thought has crossed the mind of Parcells. Still, Keyshawn is
the most magnetic player the Jets have.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of worlds, he would remain a target for Jets
quarterbacks for the next decade, a familiar and beloved icon. The
trouble is, Keyshawn has already advertised that he will be
expensive the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   This is the other side of modern free agency. Players leave
teams. Teams leave players. It's a two-way street. In these days of
the pre-emptive strike by management _ get rid of the guy before he
gets too expensive _ there are not going to be very many venerated
locals like Ray Bourque or Dan Marino in the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was traded to Colorado on Monday night after playing 21
years of hockey with the same team. The Boston Ruins, who are not
going anywhere, made it sound as if they did Bourque a huge favor
by dealing him to a team with Stanley Cup pretensions, which, in
hockey, means about two-thirds of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Marino may go to Minnesota, where he could play first-string
quarterback, apparently no longer an option for him after 17 years
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. is the face of the future. Junior had no desire
to be the Tony Gwynn of Seattle: a lovable ancient staying put so
he would not have to go through the trouble of redecorating another
house in another baseball town.
</P>
<P>
   Junior wanted to go home to Cincinnati _ for a while, anyway _
so he forced his way out with a year left in his contract. His old
pal, Alex Rodriguez, might do the same by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?'' as Carole King
once asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, 19 years in Baltimore and counting, is a throwback,
and Patrick Ewing, in his own weird way, is a throwback in New
York, even though he has the most tepid relationship with his
franchise city that you are ever likely to see.
</P>
<P>
   Today's players are mobile, which forces franchises to be
coldblooded in new and creative ways. The housecleaning in Buffalo
at the end of the season was fascinating: Thurman Thomas, Bruce
Smith, Andre Reed, gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a team like the Mets could trade a young Nolan
Ryan for baseball reasons, as ghastly as those reasons turned out
to be. Nowadays, franchises move a player when he even sends out
brain waves that he is speculating about revising his contract.
</P>
<P>
   What can the fans do if the new ownership of the Jets decides to
get Keyshawn before Keyshawn gets it? The fans can look at it this
way: There is no law against wearing their green No. 19 Johnson
jerseys to the games. That still falls under the framework of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Modern sports creates an almost sense of nostalgia. The
stalwarts who thrilled you last season turn out to have just been
passing through. The last 250 Islanders fans in the Nassau Coliseum
still wear their Palffy jerseys. There will be some Olerud jerseys
in Shea this season. There are Messier jerseys in Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson could be next. Why not? He has been the obvious
star of the Jets since he arrived. When they were losing, it was
easy for fans and coaches to dismiss him as a ball hog with a high
opinion of himself, but he has demonstrated his nerve as well as
his touch, and the Jets have built around him.
</P>
<P>
   He has been everything a franchise could want, but now he is
becoming expensive, and maybe even expendable. The fans can only
stop sniveling and pull out that little rectangular piece of
plastic for the season tickets. That is their job.
</P>

CONGRESSIONAL REPORT SEEKS BIG CHANGES IN IMF, WORLD BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
should be radically shrunken and overhauled because they often do
more harm than good in the developing world, a congressional
commission will recommend.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which plans to release its report Wednesday,
also asserts that both the IMF and the World Bank waste billions of
dollars making loans to middle-income countries that could rely on
private capital instead.
</P>
<P>
   Among its other findings, the commission said that the
institutions should sharply curtail their lending programs, that
they often interfere too much in domestic policy and even politics
of countries they seek to help and that they had generally failed
to lead nations out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The report, more than a year in the making, is highly political.
The Republican-led Congress ordered the 11-member panel of scholars
to study how to remake the Washington-based sister institutions
after agreeing to provide $18 billion for the IMF during the
financial crisis that began in Asia. The panel's conclusions seem
certain to fuel a partisan effort by some members of Congress to
reduce or even eliminate U.S. contributions to the two agencies,
though officials consider the chance of that happening as small.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, anticipating the main
thrust of the report's conclusions, late last year proposed a plan
to streamline the monetary fund that embraces several of the
report's recommendations. Summers is also conducting a study of the
World Bank that aims to reflect some common criticisms of the way
the bank works. But it will also defend its mission against people
who argue that it has outlived its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional commission, headed by Professor Allan H.
Meltzer, an expert on monetary policy at Carnegie Mellon
University, split along political lines before drafting its final
report, which had been debated openly in Washington for weeks. Four
of the five commission members appointed by Democrats dissented.
They then issued their own report that recommends more modest
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The report touches on a central issue in this time of
globalization: What is the role of World War II-era international
institutions set up to help relieve poverty and provide a stable
financial environment now that private capital flows have become
the overwhelmingly dominant influence on the world's economic
health? The report reflects an often-heard criticism that the IMF
and World Bank have become ever larger even though they are no
longer needed to do the jobs they originally did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that something had gone awry at both
institutions,'' said Jerome I. Levinson, a professor at American
University and a member of the Meltzer Commission. But Levinson,
along with the other dissident Democratic appointees, said he
believed the commission was motivated by a preconceived notion that
the IMF and World Bank should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were real differences between those who want to fix
things and those who think they do such harm that we're better off
getting rid of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report seems unlikely to lead to a revamp of the World Bank
and the IMF during the Clinton administration. But it could serve
as the blueprint for an overhaul if a Republican president is
elected. Even then, however, other wealthy countries that along
with the United States provide most of the funding for the bank and
fund would have to agree to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when Congress has proved stingy in funding world
agencies, including the United Nations, it seems likely that the
next U.S. president will find the IMF and the World Bank
indispensable, as has President Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The World Bank alone makes $50 billion in development loans each
year, more than three times the entire foreign aid budget of the
United States. The IMF played what some supporters argued was a
crucial role defending against the spread of financial malaise in
recent years, committing tens of billions of dollars that might
have been difficult to appropriate from national legislatures on
short notice.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the IMF mainly help nations cope with
temporary problems that arise when capital leaves faster than it
enters, by making only short-term ``liquidity'' loans at high
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The report goes on say that the IMF should stop trying to
relieve poverty, calling that a task better left to other agencies.
Moreover, the monetary fund should stop offering long-term,
low-cost loans with conditions that countries like Russia or Turkey
must meet IMF goals for managing their finances and economies.
Instead, the fund should refuse to make loans of any kind to
nations that do not meet certain rigid criteria.
</P>
<P>
   For the World Bank, the prescription is draconian. The report
recommends that the bank be renamed the World Development Agency
and basically get out of the business of making loans. Such loans,
the report says, should be the preserve of private banks and
brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bank should focus on providing grants to people who
need them in the poorest countries, it says.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that as a first step the bank should phase
out all loans to nations where per capita income is $4,000 or more,
which is the bulk of its lending today. Moreover, it should allow
regional development banks, which have much less capital, to take
the lead in Asia and Latin America, where there are many such
middle-income countries.

<SLUG> BC-CLINTON-PAKISTAN-2NDTAKE-NYT </SLUG>
 
WASHINGTON: official said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House statement further argued that if Clinton had
rebuffed Pakistan, he would strengthen the militant groups that
threaten to send the country into a political and economic collapse
and dishearten advocates of a secular democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Events on the subcontinent _ including the testing of nuclear
weapons by India and Pakistan in 1998 and the sharp deterioration
in their relations _ have made the nature of Clinton's trip more
difficult than when it was first contemplated some years ago as the
celebration of a new American relationship with India.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the White House stressed that the focus of Clinton's
trip, which will start in Bangladesh on March 20, remained on
India, where he will spend five days and visit five cities. The
itinerary in India is geared to spectacular backdrops _ the Taj
Mahal and possibly an elephant ride _ and to emphasizing the new
India of technology and trade.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton may not venture outside the Islamabad
airport, although senior administration officials said arrangements
for the Pakistani visit were only now getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a State Department official described the tussle over
the visit as a ``fight to the finish'' between security and
anti-terrorist officials, who did not want Clinton to go, and those
who believed it was essential not to write off Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who could see the benefit of Clinton's going to
Islamabad acknowledged there were problems in justifying the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles the administration had to address was the
unwillingness of the Pakistani government to outlaw Harakat
ul-Mujahedeen, a group the administration accuses of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The severest action Pakistan has taken against the group is to
place under ``house arrest'' one of its leaders, Maulana Masood
Azhar, whom India had released from jail in December as a condition
to end the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can spin it so we appear to have passed the test,'' an
administration official said several weeks ago, as talking points
were being composed in favor of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But on the details of Pakistan's progress toward the
administration's goals, a senior administration official who
briefed reporters Tuesday offered a poor scorecard. On democracy,
the official noted that the Constitution and provincial assemblies
remained suspended, politicians remained detained, judges had to
take loyalty oaths, and a ``road map'' to democratic rule was yet
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the official noted a ``commitment'' by
Musharref to local elections, a lively press, some action against
corruption and the trial of the former prime minister, Sharif,
being conducted with ``due process.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go ahead with the Pakistan visit received a
mixed reaction here.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview initiated by Lanny Davis, a lobbyist for
Pakistan and formerly a White House special counsel for Clinton,
the Pakistani ambassador, Maleeha Lodhi, said that Clinton's visit
could help ease the Kashmir dispute and slow the arms race between
India and Pakistan. ``He will be received very warmly,'' Lodhi
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a former American ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley,
said that too much energy had been spent on the question of whether
Clinton should go to Pakistan rather than on what would be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Musharref is not one to back down in the face of United States
pressure,'' Oakley said. ``If he's prepared to send a message to
the Indian prime minister through Clinton privately that he's
willing to take credible steps on Kashmir,'' then the visit might
be worthwhile, he said.

ADVERTISING: RECASTING BELLSOUTH AS HIGH-TECH COMMUNICATIONS
PROVIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. is introducing a campaign Thursday meant to
recast the company as a high-technology leader in an effort to
become more competitive against telecommunications and online
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications industry analysts say this is the first time
a regional Bell company has tried to turn its image into that of a
data and digital service provider. The campaign, with a budget
estimated at $35 million to $50 million, is being created by the
BellSouth corporate agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, a
unit of Omnicom Group. Merkley Newman won that assignment in
November after a review; previously, BellSouth divided the account
between that agency and the Atlanta office of West Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, which will extend beyond traditional
advertising to all communications, carries the theme ``connect and
create something.'' ``The tag line is meant to convey that we can
connect people to people, and people to the information they want
when they want it, through e-mail, personal Web pages,
e-business,'' said Alan Blount, assistant vice president for
advertising at BellSouth in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a print ad promoting the service for operating a Web site
shows a fictional Web address, www.prawntoshrimp.com, superimposed
on a catch of shrimp. The text reads, ``Since 1932, gulf prawns,
4th generation shrimper, 1st generation Web business, overnight
shipping, secure transactions, 2nd boat ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   Humorous television commercials also focus on what are portrayed
as the different ways the BellSouth online services improve
customers' lives. One spot shows a 79-year-old man sitting alone on
a bench; the voice-over explains that his wife died in 1993, but
then says he remarried last year after getting e-mail and meeting a
new mate online. Another spot shows a family with three children
gathered for dinner; the father restrains one of them from
answering her telephone as the voice-over says, ``Three pagers,
five e-mail addresses, two Web sites, 160 TV channels, four cell
phones, and just one rule _ not at the dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor advertising conveys the same theme more simply: one
billboard, showing two smiling boys whispering to each other, says
``Chat,'' while ads created for phone kiosks merely say ``Check
voice mail'' or ``Whassssssss uuuuuppp!?''
</P>
<P>
   All ads are a radical departure from BellSouth's previous
corporate campaign, which ran from 1997 to 1999 and featured folksy
ads depicting the town of Chatsford and a BellSouth employee named
Tyler, both fictional.
</P>
<P>
   According to Blount, the new campaign is primarily directed at
adults age 18 to 49. However, William Pate, BellSouth's vice
president for advertising, marketing and public relations, said
some ads, like those created for phone kiosks, are meant for
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That group is the largest cluster since the baby boomers; they
can start and stop trends on a dime,'' he said. ``We've got to
speak to them, build their brand loyalty. We want to make the
connection as early as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new campaign is a recognition of what's going on in the
marketplace,'' Pate added. ``Our competition is no longer AT&AMP;T,
MCI, Sprint. We now compete with Yahoo, Mindspring, AOL. We knew we
were not getting as much credit as we should for the business
applications we have in e-space. We felt our new brand effort
should be totally focused on these applications, because we were
already known for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, BellSouth's digital and data revenues jumped 33.1
percent, to $2.8 billion, out of a total of $25.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising will appear during NCAA college basketball games and
on cable networks like CNN, E and Oxygen; in daily newspapers in
the Southeast, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal; and in
magazines like Time, Vanity Fair, Inc. and Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   People involved with telecommunications generally applauded
BellSouth's new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kagan, a consultant in Atlanta who advises BellSouth and
other companies, said the branding effort ``makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional phone companies are perceived as stodgy, and
perception is just as important as reality,'' he added. ``The new
strategy lets them compete and thrive in a marketplace that's
become very noisy and confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Asmundson, national communications practice director for
Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP, said it was ``about time'' a regional Bell
company ran a campaign like BellSouth's, because ``they have been
letting newcomers get too much press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And BellSouth has a name that connotes trust, which is crucial
as the world becomes more connected in general'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson said all Bell companies, including BellSouth, would
have to reposition themselves, a task he predicted would be quite
difficult: ``BellSouth's problem is that it is trying to go from
being your father's telephone company to a company that connects
voice and data. Standard budgets won't do it. They'll have to look
at spending more money, because it's harder for them to change the
perception of who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue for BellSouth, said Brian Adamik, chief operating
officer of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and
consulting company in Boston, is whether ``consumers will believe
the brand can be extended, whether it's credible in the Internet
economy.'' &QL;

THE PRECIOUS AND POWERFUL ART OF THE AFRICAN COIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They look like swords, hoes, horns and armlets. But
the swords do not cut, the hoes do not weed, the horns do not sound
and the armlets _ some weighing as much as 30 pounds _ must be
unwearable. These copper, iron and gold artifacts are too dull, too
long, too short, too thin or too weighty to function the way they
look as if they should.
</P>
<P>
   But each piece has served its purpose superbly for decades, even
centuries. And today these remarkable, if mystifying, creations
tell us something about how things were bought and sold in Africa,
and probably elsewhere in the world, long before credit cards came
along.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these objects is, in fact, an example of African money.
Each is either a weapon, a farm tool, a musical instrument or a
piece of jewelry _ the things that Africans used for centuries as
barter _ or a symbol created to look like one of these artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even though historians have not yet resolved all the
questions about where and when this money was made and used, these
powerful forms appeal increasingly to collectors. They buy them as
modernist sculpture and as symbols of life in Africa during the
last millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, spurred by exhibitions of African masks
and ceremonial sculpture in galleries and museums, collectors have
been acquiring African money. A pioneer collector, William
Greenspon, a New York psychiatrist who became an art dealer and
painter, assembled a large holding of African and other tribal
money and sold it in 1986 to the Chase Manhattan Bank. These
sculptural pieces were then displayed as art in the bank's
executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now both kinds of African money, mostly owned by collectors, are
going public in two exhibitions. The smaller but more important
show, ``The Artistry of African Currency,'' opens here Sunday at
the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art and remains
through July 23. The show, the first of African money in an
American museum, includes 50 artifacts in a variety of metals and
humbler materials: cowrie shells, beads and cloth. They were
produced over the last 200 years in central, western and southern
Africa and used to buy food, medicines, goats or brides.
</P>
<P>
   The larger exhibition, ``Africa's Iron and Copper Currencies,''
is on view in Manhattan this month in the Low Memorial Library at
Columbia University. The 200 items are from the collection of
Philip Gould, an emeritus professor of art history at Sarah
Lawrence College and the show's curator. The people who made the
pieces are identified, but the works are not explained.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, as the brochure for the show in Washington points
out, African metal money was modeled on bartered objects and
retained its intrinsic worth because the metal could be melted down
or recycled into other forms. Gold was reserved for precious
objects, like the show's fifth- and sixth-century coins from the
Aksumite Kingdom in present-day Ethiopia and the huge
crescent-shaped earrings made in the mid-20th century by the Fulani
people of Mali. Dauntingly large as jewelry, the earrings remain
worth their weight in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scarcity of copper in Africa might have made the raw metal
a medium of exchange on that basis alone,'' said Lydia Puccinelli,
the curator of the show. But the metal's value was increased when
it was transformed into objects like the giant-size anklets made by
the Mbole people of the country now known as Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Other copper works worn as jewelry include the hefty bracelets
cast by the Igbo people of Nigeria to look like twisted rope and
the lethal-looking spherical neck rings made by the Yoruba.
Nigerians also produced the more delicate copper-wire bundles that
look like hanks of hay. From Congo come the arresting X-shaped
ingots called Katanga crosses, named after the place where they
have been made since at least 1400.
</P>
<P>
   Iron, found almost everywhere in Africa, was considered more
valuable if it was refined and forged into distinct shapes. The
most impressive iron pieces are the currency blades _ leaflike
forms, as tall as six feet_ that the Turumbu people of central
Africa modeled after medieval swords.
</P>
<P>
   The Kuba people of Congo continue to use these blades as
symbolic currency in dowries, but in a reverse of practice in the
West, the groom or his family compensates the bride's family for
the loss of her services. The most striking gift of all would have
been a field filled with enormous iron staves.
</P>
<P>
   Kissi pennies, one of the least valuable of African currencies,
are the loveliest of all. The twisted iron rods, 12 to 15 inches in
length, look like long-stemmed anemones by Giacometti.
</P>
<P>
   The Kissi artisans in Liberia called the rods coins with soul:
if a penny was broken, the Kissi people insisted that it not be
circulated again until it was repaired by a blacksmith, who would
restore its soul. These pennies continued to be used throughout
Liberia and Sierra Leone into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   African money was always an extremely valuable commodity, which
the colonial powers sought to make profitable for themselves. In
the 15th century, the Portuguese took examples of the copper-rod
money used in Angola to Europe to be duplicated. Then, when they
returned to Africa, they used the copies in trading with the
Angolans.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, the British followed suit, copying the Nigerian
iron money that took the form of open ringlets called manillas. The
copies were used in trade in Nigeria well into the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade or so, we've come to know an enormous
amount about African money,'' Puccinelli said. ``The interest is
there for all of us to find out a great deal more.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Milton Academy, a boarding school near Boston
where he was a scholarship student, David Lindsay-Abaire got
heavily involved in one of those super-geeky extracurricular
activities that one is apt to look back on later with a mix of
pride and red-faced horror.
</P>
<P>
   It was called ``speech team.'' It required the young man _ known
simply as David Abaire then _ to travel to other high schools and
do combat in such exotic competitions as ``humorous interp,'' in
which the contestants had to memorize every part in a 10-minute
excerpt of a play and perform them all in character before a panel
of judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go into a classroom, you'd explain what the synopsis was
and then you'd do your piece,'' Lindsay-Abaire recalled recently,
sitting in a Starbucks in Brooklyn Heights and looking suddenly
aghast at having volunteered this biographical tidbit. Scores were
awarded, and the teenager from working-class South Boston did well
enough to enter the nationals in Nashville. ``I think I finished
fourth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who has seen his verbally acrobatic new
comedy, ``Fuddy Meers,'' at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich
Village would understand why the judges might have rewarded him. As
the seemingly nonsensical title suggests, the play is filled with
shards of broken speech uttered by fractured characters who would
have served the author well in the days of humorous interp.
</P>
<P>
   And he is doing well by them these days. Writing in The New York
Times, Ben Brantley called the play ``dark, sweet and thoroughly
engaging'' and likened the playwright to ``a resourceful chef who
turns leftovers into haute cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when ``Fuddy Meers'' opened in November at the Manhattan
Theater Club, before its recent transfer to a commercial Off
Broadway theater, Lindsay-Abaire earned the kind of freshman
notices that might have turned a young writer's head, were he not
so awestruck by the experience. ``I was out of my mind petrified,''
said the 30-year-old playwright, who lives in Brooklyn with his
wife, Chris Lindsay, an actress (and thus the hyphenated last
name). ``Getting a play produced at all was such a huge mountain.
It feels like it has nothing to do with me. It's like winning the
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The luck of the draw, though, it really wasn't. Having secured a
spot in a highly selective playwriting program at the Juilliard
School, where he wrote under the tutelage of Marsha Norman and
Christopher Durang from 1996 to 1998, Lindsay-Abaire has been given
every opportunity to succeed at a profession with a terrifying
casualty rate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he become an overnight member of the nonprofit
arena _ the Manhattan Theater Club is considering his next play,
``Wonder of the World,'' for its main stage next season _ but he is
also under contract to a major film company, Fox 2000, to come up
with scripts, including one for the actor Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supporting myself, for the first time, as a playwright,''
Lindsay-Abaire said. ``It's too bad that you have to get a
commercial run for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuddy Meers'' owes a debt to the screwball tradition of
American comedy and to some modern comic writers, like Durang, who
have stretched the form to contemporary contours. The play revolves
around an amnesiac, Claire (J. Smith-Cameron), whose memory is
erased each time she sleeps, and the wild shenanigans of the people
in her life, among them a profane, aphasic mother (Marylouise
Burke), a sullen son (Keith Nobbs) and an ex-convict (John
Christopher Jones) who expresses himself through a sock puppet,
Hinky Binky.
</P>
<P>
   Many silly things happen in the course of ``Fuddy Meers'' _ the
words, significantly, are two of the many that the mother, a stroke
victim, distorts (``funny mirrors''). But at the heart of the play
is a rather poignant examination of Claire's predicament, and the
idea that in the endless cycle of her learning and forgetting,
hope, for those who love her, is a renewable resource.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his own discovery of the romance of amnesia, if you
will, that Lindsay-Abaire first thought he might have a play. ``It
started with this amnesia case I heard of on a news program,'' he
said. ``About a woman who, as soon as she fell asleep, her memory
was gone.'' After scouring books about neurological disorders, he
had what might be called a playwright's epiphany: ``I thought,
`What a convenient device to get out exposition.'''
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear family of ``Fuddy Meers'' is typically
American-neurotic; crazy and yet crazily devoted to one another.
But Lindsay-Abaire insists that in its particulars it is nothing
like the one in which he grew up, a family of five he describes as
``very blue collar.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother is a factory worker and his father, now retired, sold
fruit out of the back of a truck. Both of his parents, he said,
were supportive of his attempts to write, which began at Milton
with some ``terrible, terrible plays'' that he composed as a result
of a school tradition of putting on original shows.
</P>
<P>
   At Sarah Lawrence College, where he majored in theater, he
continued to churn them out, and though his work was produced
there, ``nobody said, `Yes! You're a writer. Come with me.''' After
graduation he moved to New York, where he landed a job in arts
administration at Dance Theater Workshop, continued writing and had
some of his plays produced in Off Off Broadway theaters like the
SoHo Rep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really write plays to entertain myself,'' he said. But he is
also entertained by audacity. When people said they were made
uncomfortable by a stroke victim as a comic figure, he felt
compelled to forge ahead. ``I didn't think, `I want someone to talk
funny,''' he said. ``I wanted characters who were damaged and
viewed the world in skewed, warped ways.''

 &HT;    GORE GREETS VICTORY IN THE TOWN THAT TURNED HIS CAMPAIGN AROUND
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore, in a triumphant
return Tuesday to his campaign headquarters in the shadow of Music
City's gleaming skyline, couldn't resist a dig at the critics who
had dismissed his move here as a crass political stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that idea to move to Nashville was a gimmick,'' Gore
quipped sarcastically as hundreds of volunteers welcomed him home
to celebrate one of the biggest political triumphs in a career that
began in 1976 with his election to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision last October to move his presidential campaign
headquarters from Washington's lobbyist-infested K Street to the
capital of his home state of Tennessee marked the turning point in
a White House bid that had stumbled through most of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to Nashville, Gore was able to streamline an
organization that had grown top-heavy with high-priced consultants
and to energize his campaign with only the most committed workers
and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process of moving ``from K Street to the K Mart,'' as
he phrased it, he remade himself as a candidate, shedding the
trappings of the vice presidency and his trademark blue suits,
reaching out to voters in open meetings in a casual, more personal
way.
</P>
<P>
   He also trained his political sights on his challenger, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and picked apart the Bradley
candidacy with precision. He prevented him from wooing away any of
the core Democratic constituencies _ blacks, Jews, union members
and gays _ while holding together the more conservative ``New
Democratic'' coalition built by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two days of campaigning before the Super Tuesday
primaries, Gore appeared before some of the most loyal Democratic
voters. He met with Jewish leaders and gay activists in New York on
Monday and dropped by a union rally in Nashville on Tuesday before
retiring to a downtown hotel to watch the election returns.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he squeezed in a trip to St. Louis for a rally
Monday night, a final push to sweep even Bradley's native state of
Missouri in the closest thing the United States has ever had to a
national presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking a single vote for granted,'' he told reporters
on Air Force Two en route from St. Louis to Nashville. ``I'm not
looking beyond Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Gore has stepped up his attacks on Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who clinched the Republican presidential
nomination Tuesday, in a clear indication of his confidence in
winning the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And he has heaped praise on Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the GOP
challenger who has excited independent voters this year with his
promises to reform the political campaign finance process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to travel Wednesday to Michigan, an important swing
state in the general election and one where McCain defeated Bush in
the GOP primaries on the strength of independent voters who swamped
the political machine of Republican Gov. John Engler, a staunch
Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore has also sought to soothe any hard
feelings on the part of Bradley supporters, repeatedly expressing
his admiration for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between Senator Bradley and myself are nothing
compared to the differences between both of us as Democrats, on the
one hand, and both of the Republicans on the other hand,'' Gore
told an audience over the weekend.

 NEW YORK REPUBLICANS FAVOR BUSH, BUT INDEPENDENTS SWING TOWARD
McCAIN  
(sw) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among New York voters responding to exit polls,
patterns seen in earlier Republican contests appeared to be holding
on Tuesday, with self-identified Republicans supporting Gov. George
W. Bush, while a wave of independents favored Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll was taken from a sample of 561 Republican and 707
Democratic voters and conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium
made up of television networks and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to viewpoints on the heated Republican contest,
political analysts predicted that the Democratic race in New York
was likely to be just an echo of the ringing of former Sen. Bill
Bradley's death knell. A New York Times/CBS poll taken two weeks
ago showed Vice President Al Gore widening his lead to
26-percentage points over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The New York primary is one of the most important contests on
what has been dubbed ``Super Tuesday.'' At stake are 243 Democratic
delegates and 101 Republican delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In the five weeks preceding Tuesday's contests, upset victories
for McCain in New Hampshire and Michigan have made the Republican
race one of the most closely watched in recent memory. McCain has
painted himself as an establishment outsider, a war hero espousing
campaign reform and denouncing the straight-and-narrow arbiters of
American politics. But in recent contests, Bush has appropriated
that rebel image to some extent and used it to successfully woo
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Tuesday's early exit polls, a third of the registered
Republicans in New York who voted for McCain's delegates identified
themselves as independent, and less than a fifth of Bush's
supporters described themselves that way.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fifths of the voters who preferred Bush were conservative,
and less than a third called themselves moderate, according to the
exit polls. About two-fifths of McCain's supporters described
themselves as conservative, and the same percentage called
themselves moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters were less inclined to favor abortion rights
than those who voted for McCain's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of those who preferred McCain had never voted in
a Republican primary before. Less than 20 percent of Bush's
supporters were new to the Republican primaries, the exit polls
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters named campaign finance and moral values as
the issues that most influenced their vote. Bush's supporters
selected moral values and taxes as the issue with the strongest
influence on their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Half of McCain's supporters said the fact that he ``stands up
for what he believes'' was the quality that mattered most in their
vote decision, followed by strong leader. Almost two-fifths of
Bush's supporters said he ``best represents conservative values,''
and a quarter said he stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's voter turnout in New York was larger than the usual 20
to 25 percent of registered voters. The warm weather was partly
responsible, as was the highly publicized neck-and-neck race
between Bush and McCain. That heated contest has drawn out a record
number of voters in earlier primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates threw themselves into last-minute campaigning
in New York with full determination. Bush flew to Long Island and
attended a staged panel discussion on breast cancer in an effort to
appeal to women voters. At a Wall Street rally, McCain attacked his
opponent's chief patrons in this state, Gov. George Pataki and
William D. Powers, the New York Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders had joined Bush in lobbying to keep
McCain off the ballot. They pushed for enforcement of obscure
campaign rules that made it more difficult for supporters of
Republican candidates other than Bush to collect nominating
signatures. But McCain won public sympathy, and a federal judge
placed McCain and another candidate, Alan Keyes, on the Republican
ballot in early February. McCain spent nearly $200,000 to get on
the ballot in 19 districts.
</P>
<P>
   But New York was deemed a tough battleground for McCain. In
states with open Republican primaries, McCain has won support from
voters labeling themselves independents or Democrats. In New York,
the Republican primary is closed to voters not affiliated with the
party. And even though New York lacks large numbers supporting a
strong religious right, a faction that helped pushed Bush to
victory in South Carolina, some voters said that McCain's recent
religious criticism swayed them toward his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Catholic and I know darn well that Bush is not
anti-Catholic,'' said Vincent Mauro, a Brooklyn retiree. ``That was
dirty pool. I had mixed feelings about who to vote for but those
comments really bothered me. I decided to stick with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race has failed to inspire the strong feelings
that characterize the Republican contest. While many people regard
Bradley as a lost cause, Gore apparently still has to overcome his
wooden image among some voters. Joyce Liona, for instance, a
registered Democrat in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said she reluctantly
voted for the vice-president on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to put my faith in something,'' she said. ``Honestly,
I like McCain, and I wish he wasn't a Republican. Gore has no
charisma. I can't even remember sometimes what Gore looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's supporters, Hillary Rodham Clinton, showed up at 7
a.m. at Douglas Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua in
Westchester County cast her vote. Clinton, a Democratic candidate
for the U.S. Senate seat from New York, was the 11th person to vote
at the precinct. The school is within two miles of the house that
she and President Clinton recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City,
who is Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent in the Senate race,
strode into a high school on Manhattan's Upper East Side and cast
his vote. Giuliani threw his allegiance to Bush.

<P>
   Last October, as an uproar over the move by IBM from a
traditional pension plan to a cash balance plan was peaking, a
group of employees at Bell Atlantic set up a Web site intended to
address questions about their own pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, executives at Bell Atlantic were
deluged with e-mail messages and letters expressing outrage at a
similar move by the company, even though the switch had taken place
two years earlier. ``I've been here 26 years, and I have never seen
such an outpouring,'' said Janice Winston, co-founder of the Bell
Atlantic Employee Coalition for Retirement Security, which set up
the Web site, bapensions.org.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, Bell Atlantic blinked. It told 20,000 employees with
15 or more years of tenure that they would be given their benefits
under a modified traditional plan if the company's analysis found
that they would be better off than under the new pension plan.
Generally, younger employees can do better under cash balance
plans, but workers of middle-age and older often do worse, with
some seeing the value of their retirement benefits drop as much as
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic denied that it had been influenced by the employee
group. ``We would have come to this decision had there been no Web
site,'' said a spokesman, Steven Marcus. ``We have a long tradition
of staying in touch with our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how Winston sees it. ``They knew they couldn't go
forward with employee morale the way it was,'' she said. ``I
believe our Web site was key.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of declining membership in traditional blue-collar
unions, the Internet is spawning a new form of collective
organization that is enabling once-compliant white-collar workers
to put pressure on management. Though some coalitions that are
formed around Web sites and fueled by e-mail and Internet chat
rooms may be fleeting, and though such groups do not enjoy the
legal protections that old-style unions do, they have proven to be
a potent weapon that many companies must come to grips with.
</P>
<P>
   The model for this new worker activism was established by IBM
employees after the computer giant announced its pension conversion
plan last May. Originally, IBM said it would allow about 30,000
employees who were near retirement to stay with the traditional
plan. In September, however, it more than doubled that number to
65,000. What happened? IBM employees used their computers to band
together, to create programs that compared the old plan with the
new and to lobby legislators in Washington against the change. The
company's decision came within days of a congressional hearing on
cash balance plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see how we could have done it without the Web,''
said Lynda French, who created www.cashpensions.com, one of the
best-known sites associated with the IBM employee effort. With more
than 97,000 site visits and with links to government agencies,
congressional offices and other employee-sponsored Web sites,
cashpensions.com has become a fount of information for organizers
at other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since the IBM backpedaling, employees at several large
corporations besides Bell Atlantic have established Web sites and
chat rooms dedicated to pension issues, including att.nac.net for
AT&AMP;T employees and dukeemployees.8m.com for Duke Power employees.
In addition, employees at SmithKline Beecham and the Williams Cos.
have set up sites at clubs.yahoo.com.

   The Coalition for Retirement Security (www.pensions-r-us.org), a
nonprofit umbrella organization for employee groups that is based
in Springfield, Mass., has been active in getting several of these
sites off the ground. ``We have so many new groups coming on, it's
amazing,'' said Paul R. Edwards, the founder of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The results have often been impressive. More than 20,000 hits
have been recorded at att.nac.net since that site was set up in
December with the aim of rolling back AT&AMP;T's switch in 1997 to a
cash balance plan. ``We have copies of hundreds of letters written
to our executives,'' said one AT&AMP;T organizer, who insisted on
anonymity. ``They would never have been written without the Web
site.'' (So far, however, AT&AMP;T is not bending to the pressure,
saying it has ``no plans'' to change its pension plan.)
</P>
<P>
   Even the Labor Department has got into the online act, setting
up a special section on cash balance plans at www.dol.gov and an
e-mail address to take comments and answer questions. ``We've found
the Internet to be one of the best ways to get information out to
the public,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said when asked about
the Web site. ``As the old saying goes: `knowledge is power,' and
this type of information empowers workers to make the right
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this new activism could have happened without the
Internet, in the view of French, who recently retired from IBM She
noted that the conversions had been going on for years with not a
peep of protest. ``Employees didn't understand,'' she said. ``Now,
it's very difficult not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers play down the importance of Web protests on their
policy making. ``We didn't need to look at the Web sites to know
what our employees were thinking,'' said Jana Weatherbee, an IBM
spokeswoman. ``We heard their concerns and we made adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people think the Web's role as a conduit for
employee grievances will only grow. ``Once this tool is understood,
employees will seek to improve all their benefits programs,'' said
David Wray, president of the Profitsharing/401k Council of America,
an association in Chicago of employers with defined-contribution
pension plans. ``This will have a powerful impact on the workplace
over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston is already looking beyond pension issues. ``Now that we
understand how our retirements can be affected by decisions in
Congress and by our employers, we feel we have to make active
decisions to protect our rights,'' she said. ``We hope to branch
out into health benefits.''

BETTER SONGS THROUGH CENSORSHIP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to rap radio is often like reading a declassified
government document in which thick black lines obscure the most
tantalizing parts. Except that instead of black marker, rap singles
are doctored for the public with sound-effects CDs. Gunshots,
sirens, car screeches, turntable scratching and lyrics played
backward conceal words deemed dirty, derogatory or harmful to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Some songs, especially ones with obscene words as their chorus,
become so bowdlerized that their meaning is no longer even
fathomable on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, certain rappers have made it their duty to go back
into the studio and rap extensive new lyrics to a song being
considered for airplay. In one extreme example, Eminem takes ``My
Fault,'' a song about fatally overdosing a girl with psychedelic
mushrooms, and makes it PG by rapping instead about how he slipped
normal, everyday mushrooms onto his friend's pizza, triggering an
allergic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the notion of artists changing their music to please
the prudish and commercial elements of society is odious to
critics, but in the case of several recent singles, the editing has
actually improved the song.
</P>
<P>
   In a pop landscape in which the crude come-on has replaced the
sly innuendo, some remakes are bringing a touch of subtlety back to
urban music.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps taking a cue from 2 Live Crew's cleaned-up tracks, the
record label Cash Money in New Orleans makes it a point to record
clean and dirty versions of songs. For over half a year, two
separate versions of a fast, bouncing party single by the Cash
Money rapper Juvenile have been battling for radio time.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations prefer to play the explicit version that is
included on his album, littering it with sound effects and blank
spaces to cover up the naughty bits. But in the more popular
version, Juvenile changes the lyrics to the song, altering one word
in the title to make it vaguer.
</P>
<P>
   This version is called ``Back That Thang Up'' (in the original,
Juvenile specifies exactly which body part he wants backed up) and,
accidentally or not, it is much richer than its more salacious
antecedent _ more Bessie Smith's ``I'm Just Wild About That Thing''
and less R. Kelly's ``I Like the Crotch on You.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, when Juvenile raps the chorus, ``Girl, you look
good/ Won't you back that thang up,'' it is a lewd catcall. Looked
at more literally, the Juvenile chorus is a more sophisticated
come-on than the original, as if he is asking for supporting
evidence: girl, you look good, but are you willing to prove it?
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by toning down his song, Juvenile has also
increased its profit potential: perhaps a data storage company will
purchase the rights to the song to play in the background of a
commercial warning computer users to back up their files for
safety. (Self-censorship is nothing new in popular music: Little
Richard cleaned up ``Tutti Frutti'' for the radio, with
``alop-bam-boom'' replacing an expletive from the live version of
the song.)
</P>
<P>
   Changes made to choruses simply for reasons of sanitation (like
``Back That Thang Up'' or ``awop-bop-a-loo-mop-alop-bam-boom,'' or
the late Big Pun's sanitizing of a verb to create the chorus ``I'm
not a player, I just crush a lot'') are often incorporated into the
vernacular as slang and hip catch phrases.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as a sexually confounded species (almost always in
denial about our sexuality), we have a habit of constantly trying
to find new nicknames for carnal activity, reproductive anatomy and
waste functions. And it is popular music, speaking in code on
radios and jukeboxes, that has spread many of these terms, not the
least of which are the words rock-and-roll and jazz themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper Jay-Z has been adept at re-rapping songs to turn them
from run-of-the-mill obscenities to shout-along radio hits. He
changed one song title to ``Jigga What, Jigga Who'' to slip around
radio's reluctance to play songs with demeaning words in them, and
succeeded in making the song simultaneously more popular and, to
some critics, more offensive. Though Jigga is Jay-Z's nickname,
some find the word particularly offensive because they think it
incorporates the slur jigaboo. Either way, the result was legions
of suburban white teens calling one another ``jigga.''
</P>
<P>
   Far surpassing Jay-Z, the master of the modified lyric is
Eminem. Not only does he extensively rewrite lyrics for the radio,
but, as proof of his mastery of quick rhyming wordplay, he changes
them so smoothly that one would never know that other lyrics
existed. The interesting thing about Eminem's modified lyrics is
that they don't make the song any better or worse: instead, they
reveal the arbitrariness of the morality of the radio gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Every verse in his hit single ``My Name Is ...'' has lines
rewritten for radio, but often they just replace one taboo with
another. For example, the line ``when you see my dad, tell him that
I slit his throat in this dream I had'' becomes ``ask him if he
bought a porno mag and seen my ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the lyric, ``Hi kids, do you like violence/ Wanna see
me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids,'' is
changed; but it is not the eyelids image that is modified, but the
word violence, which is changed to Primus for radio.
</P>
<P>
   While it is interesting to see how these artists respond when
confronted with the content limitations of radio, re-rapping songs
is a strange practice that supporters of artistic freedom might
compare to painting clothes on nudes before they can be displayed
in a museum where children might see them.
</P>
<P>
   Though I'll take modified lyrics over obscuring sound effects in
my rap any day, I'd also like to see the process work the other way
around. If albums with curse words are deemed dirty and must be
presented in clean versions, why can't albums that are clean to
begin with (Celine Dion, 'N Sync, Barney) be remade into dirty
versions for those who don't like their pop so tame?

IOWA STATE TAKES COACH, PLAYER OF YEAR HONORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Iowa State lost its second game of the season, Larry
Eustachy probably startled Cyclones fans by going on his postgame
radio show and boldly bragging about a team that had just scored 44
points in a four-point loss at Drake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough loss. We really struggled to score, must have
missed about 25 shots around the basket,'' Eustachy recalled. ``But
I went on the radio and talked about how much I liked this team,
that I felt we were going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the same thing to his squad, but sensed that his
optimism went in some ears and out some others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that some of the guys who were on the team last year
had the look of, `The same old thing.' So when we got back home, I
told them it was not going to be this way. That if they were going
to accept losing, they needed to leave the program right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the point.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Eustachy has been good about getting his point
across.
</P>
<P>
   So much so, that in his second year at Iowa State, he molded a
diverse group of holdovers from a .500 team with surprising
newcomers into a team that shocked the Big 12 by winning the
regular-season championship and the No. 1 seed in the conference
tournament, which begins tomorrow in Kansas City, Mo. For his work,
Eustachy has been chosen the Star-Telegram Big 12 Coach of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry has done an unbelievable job to bring his club from
where it was a year ago,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said.
``The addition of the two junior college guards \RJamaal Tinsley
and Kantrail Horton\S and the maturity of Marcus Fizer helped, but
Larry ought to be national coach of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Iowa State is that all their players
complement each other so well,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said.
``Larry has done a great job getting them to understand each of
their roles and how important they are. They play them as well as
any team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Fizer was the biggest reason the Cyclones won their
first basketball conference championship since 1945. He was at his
best in the biggest games of the year, against Texas and Oklahoma
State. His 32.6-point scoring average over the final six
regular-season games made him an easy choice as the Star-Telegram's
Big 12 Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy smokes,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``Marcus
Fizer is a monster. And probably one of the best-kept secrets in
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley joins Fizer on the ``Star-Telegram'' all-conference
first team, as do the three other players whom Fizer overshadowed
for Player of the Year honors _ Texas' Chris Mihm, Oklahoma's
Eduardo Najera and Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ When President Fernando de la Rua took
office nearly three months ago, the unemployment rate stood at a
stubbornly high 14 percent. Consumer demand remained sluggish.
Shantytowns were spreading. And manufacturers seemed to be jumping
over each other to relocate to Brazil where labor was cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   That bleak picture has not changed much.
</P>
<P>
   But since his Dec. 10 inauguration, De la Rua has shown himself
to be an activist who will put the economy before all other issues.
Whether his actions will be sufficient to repair Argentina's
economy remains a big question, but even his critics say they are
surprised by the vigorous pace of reform from the president, who
dared to suggest that he was a boring fellow in a signature
television advertisement during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his first month in office, De la Rua rammed a new budget and
tax package through Congress, slicing this year's fiscal deficit by
more than half and silencing rumors of an impending devaluation.
Then, he reached an unexpectedly generous $7.4 billion loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund that has allowed the
country to swap bonds for new debt at lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded in lowering fuel prices, highway tolls and railroad
freight prices. He ordered raids on tax-evading businesses in order
to raise revenue and relieve law-abiding companies of unfair
competition. He tightened the revenue flow to five provinces that
were virtually bankrupt, forcing them to become more financially
responsible. Declaring a national economic emergency, he has begun
to trim the bloated government bureaucracy. He started by
dismissing one-third of his intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, De la Rua faced down a threatened strike by the
nation's largest labor confederation, opening the way for enactment
of a new labor code designed to reduce the bargaining power of
labor unions and help businesses more easily hire and fire new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an anxious man,'' De la Rua said in his monotone,
displaying a thin, stern smile during a recent interview at the
Casa Rosada presidential palace. ``I like things done quickly,
without delay. But we are definitely on our way.'' He put
Argentina's economic predicament in simple terms, saying, ``If you
ask me what is my chief concern in a word, that word is
`competitiveness.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing business costs and expanding exports are urgent tasks
if South America's second biggest economy _ one with 37 million
consumers that last year had a gross domestic product of $285
billion and $5 billion in imports from the United States _ is to
recoup the high expectations of only a few years ago. The 3 percent
growth rate that most economists expect this year may sound good,
but the economy declined last year by 3 percent in the aftermath of
the Asian and Russian financial crises and the January 1999
Brazilian devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 manufacturing firms have moved to Brazil in recent
months, seeking lower labor costs and offers of tax breaks and
other government subsidies. After Tupperware, Goodyear Tire and
Rubber and Royal Philips Electronics closed factories outside
Buenos Aires _ all decided it was better to supply the Argentine
market from Brazil _ one local business magazine ran the cover
banner headline of ``Bye, Bye Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine auto and auto-parts industries, once seen as an
economic juggernaut that would profit handsomely from a growing
Brazilian market, are barely holding on after suffering a 33
percent loss of production and a 59 percent fall in exports last
year. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat are all transferring
production to Brazil, and with negotiations between Buenos Aires
and Brasilia to revamp the MERCOSUR trade union bogged down, big
layoffs are probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Two deep recessions in the last five years have dimmed the
memories of the go-go years of the early 1990s. At that time,
Argentina became the favored emerging market of Wall Street
following a series of privatizations and a decision to link the
historically unstable peso one-to-one with the dollar. But the
policy, which was initiated by former President Carlos Saul Menem
to end years of hyperinflation, has tied Argentina to a strong
dollar and rising U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Argentine interest rates, which start at 8 percent,
are totally out of proportion with the country's negative inflation
rate of 2 percent last year. When Brazil devalued its currency by
40 percent just over a year ago, making Argentine exports to Brazil
far more expensive, there was no monetary policy card for Buenos
Aires to play.
</P>
<P>
   What cards the new Argentine leader has played have not received
universal approval. Some economists say De la Rua's move to
increase government revenue by $2.6 billion through higher income
and sales taxes and to eliminate tax loopholes for private health
care, transportation and entertainment may have pleased the IMF,
but will only slow the economy. And once the tax increases begin to
be felt by consumers, the economists say, De la Rua could suffer
losses during a congressional election next year that would hurt
his effectiveness in the last three years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still haven't taken into account the distorting tax
structure that costs Argentina competitiveness _ especially the
high taxes on diesel and high payroll taxes,'' said Domingo
Cavallo, the former economy minister who devised the plan to peg
Argentina's currency to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And few analysts see any progress in the effort by De la Rua to
reinvigorate the MERCOSUR trade union and end a year of disputes
with Brazil over sugar, chickens, textiles, shoes and motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, De la Rua and his aides predict that their early
fiscal moves will stimulate bond and stock market rallies and
produce strong growth in the second half of this year. They note
that Standard &AMP; Poor's recently revised its view on the Argentine
economy from ``negative'' to ``stable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people have doubts,'' said Economy Minister Jose Luis
Machinea, the chief architect of De la Rua's economic policies.
``But you can quote me on this: This economy will grow a minimum of
4 percent this year.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government's optimistic view is based in part on a nascent
boom in high technology and the growing number of local Internet
companies. The complete deregulation of the telecommunications
industry, begun under the previous government, promises to lower
business telephone and computer costs significantly by the end of
the year. Meanwhile, rising agricultural commodity prices and the
strengthening of the Brazilian currency as Brazil's economy expands
should improve Argentine export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our eyes are focused on growth and whether we will be
competitive or not,'' Machinea said. ``How do you reduce business
costs? You reduce the country risk ratings and interest rates, then
you lower labor expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   And officials continue to voice cautious optimism that they can
fix relations with Brazil. ``If there is a war of subsidies, all
our peoples will lose from the costs of expanding fiscal
deficits,'' said Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of the De la Rua economic policy is his labor
reform, which passed the lower house of Congress on Feb. 25. The
legislation would increase the probationary period mandated by law
for new workers to six months from the current 30 days, giving
companies more time to terminate an employee without paying
severance. It would lower the payroll tax rate for new hires to 12
percent from 18 percent. It would eliminate a rule that obliges
companies to retain old contracts if negotiations fail, a reform
that would prohibit union leaders from protecting anachronistic
work rules by refusing to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the new labor code would take away the
power of national union leaders to determine salaries and working
conditions across entire industries, allowing smaller and newer
companies to bargain their own terms rather than having to pay the
same salaries as large, established firms.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the labor code in the Senate, senior De la Rua aides
predict, would give the new administration the momentum to further
reduce business costs by deregulating the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be boring before he became president, but now he is
having fun,'' said Eduardo Elsztain, chairman of IRSA and Cresud,
Argentina's largest real estate and farm companies. ``He's making
the right moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But most business leaders, particularly those in the
manufacturing sector who are straining to compete with Brazil, are
skeptical that De la Rua's policies will be sufficient to quickly
return Argentina to the 6 and 7 percent growth rates they had
become accustomed to before last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Ganimian, owner of the Oxigeno shoe company, said he was
happy about De la Rua's labor reforms, and that the expected 10
percent decrease in his labor costs would enable him to add 10
employees to his staff of 80 at a factory outside Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But Ganimian said that as much as he would like to build a new
factory and double his work force, he felt constrained because of
the competitive disadvantage he continued to suffer in relation to
Brazilian shoe producers who pay their workers one-third the wage
an Argentine shoemaker earns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to expand and export,'' Ganimian added, ``but I can't
put my capital on a roulette wheel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pablo Piqueras, a director of Casa Pi-Ro SA, a medical supply
company with $20 million in annual sales, said he applauded De la
Rua's early moves but that he and his partners were still giving
serious consideration to closing their plant in the city of La
Plata and dismissing 150 workers. For the first time in its 70-year
history, the company granted a vacation to all of its factory
workers in February and suspended production for three weeks to
reduce an inventory backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Piqueras said it was impossible to compete with the flood of
cheap Korean and Chinese syringes in recent years, and Brazilian
officials were offering a package of tax-breaks and subsidized
loans to relocate to Brazil. ``I'm an Argentine, and I would like
to believe in my county's future,'' he said, ``but if there is no
national policy to save us and we can't compete, its time to
move.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES TRY TO DEAL WITH PASSENGER RAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla., Calif.)  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
(bl) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How serious a threat is air rage?
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that reports of violent or disruptive
passengers _ known as air rage incidents _ have risen sharply in
recent years, but that may just be a consequence of better
reporting. The 1999 OAG Business Travel Lifestyle Survey, polling
thousands of frequent business fliers, found that 40 percent of
them witnessed an incident of ``verbal or physical abuse'' in the
air last year. Two percent said that their flights were diverted
because of an unruly fellow passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even flight attendants acknowledge that some air rage
reports include verbal disputes that in the past airline employees
would have shrugged off instead of literally making federal cases
out of them. But mounting anecdotal evidence suggests that physical
and verbal incidents that would be defined as violent by any
sensible person are in fact increasing.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, safety experts say, those situations can be made
worse by well-meaning fellow passengers who decide to become
involved.
</P>
<P>
   For an example, let's examine what happened two years ago aboard
a US Airways flight from Los Angeles to Baltimore when a handful of
interfering passengers contributed to a melee that left a flight
attendant seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger, a 200-pound 21-year-old college football player,
began wandering up the aisle, ``blessing'' other passengers by
tapping them on the head with a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant, Renee Sheffer, 34, who had seen just about
everything in 15 years on the job, approached the young man and
gently coaxed him toward an empty seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit down and shut up!'' a male passenger a few rows back
suddenly shouted, adding some profanities that caused the young man
to become agitated. A few other passengers joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``His demeanor then became very aggressive,'' Sheffer recalled.
``He said he had to go up to the front of the airplane now and
bless the pilot because now the plane was going to crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a small incident now loomed as a bigger one. ``We had
the situation under control, but then comes the macho man, `I'm
going to deal with this!''' Sheffer said. ``It's just like a fuse
on a bomb. Outside stimuli from the passengers really set him
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer and another flight attendant ultimately led the man back
to the rear of the plane. But then, she said, ``another macho guy
yelled at us to get the guy in a seat or he would do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbed man wheeled, grabbed her and tossed her into a
bulkhead. A five-minute struggle ensued before the man was
restrained with plastic handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you imagine me at 5-foot-5 and 114 pounds tying up this
200-pound running back, it's kind of amusing in hindsight,''
Sheffer said. Of course, the internal bleeding and the surgery for
knee and shoulder injuries were not so funny, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant was convicted of federal assault charges and given
probation. But Sheffer and her husband, Mike Sheffer, a television
engineer, thought that what she had encountered was just the tip of
a problem the airline industry had ignored for too long.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffers, who live in Gastonia, N.C., began the Skyrage
Foundation to focus more attention on the safety threat posed by
violent or otherwise disruptive passengers. The last two years,
Sheffer has managed a Web site, www.skyrage.org, that assiduously
archives news reports of violent or disruptive passengers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffers were in Los Angeles on Tuesday taking part in a
seminar on violent and disruptive passengers at the annual Aircraft
Cabin Safety Symposium sponsored by the Southern California Safety
Institute. In April, the Air Line Pilots Association will
co-sponsor what it calls the International Aviation Security
Academy in Orlando, Fla. Designed for flight crews and other
aviation professionals, it will be a four-day series of courses on
handling in-cabin safety threats.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffer says he believes that airline passengers in general,
and especially business travelers, also should be giving some
thought to the topic, since the more frequently you fly the more
likely you are to encounter some kind of air rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers have to understand it's a whole different world on
an airplane,'' he said. ``It's not like getting in a taxicab or a
bus. On a plane, when something goes wrong, it can have a domino
effect and a bad situation can snowball into a catastrophic
situation. You're stuck in that aluminum tube, zipping along at 400
miles an hour; there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You can't
call the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Planes are impossibly crowded, flying is vexing, some passengers
are cranky, and some flight attendants can get snippy. Shrug it off
as the price of getting from here to there in a hurry, Sheffer
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even reasonable people are going to have arguments,'' he said.
``But one thing that passengers and air crews both need to keep in
mind is an aircraft in flight is not the place or the time. Wait
till you're on the ground, because once that door is closed, not
only have you sealed the problem inside the aircraft, you've also
sealed out the resources that can help.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES TRY TO DEAL WITH PASSENGER RAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   How serious a threat is air rage?
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that reports of violent or disruptive
passengers _ known as air rage incidents _ have risen sharply in
recent years, but that may just be a consequence of better
reporting. The 1999 OAG Business Travel Lifestyle Survey, polling
thousands of frequent business fliers, found that 40 percent of
them witnessed an incident of ``verbal or physical abuse'' in the
air last year. Two percent said that their flights were diverted
because of an unruly fellow passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even flight attendants acknowledge that some air rage
reports include verbal disputes that in the past airline employees
would have shrugged off instead of literally making federal cases
out of them. But mounting anecdotal evidence suggests that physical
and verbal incidents that would be defined as violent by any
sensible person are in fact increasing.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, safety experts say, those situations can be made
worse by well-meaning fellow passengers who decide to become
involved.
</P>
<P>
   For an example, let's examine what happened two years ago aboard
a US Airways flight from Los Angeles to Baltimore when a handful of
interfering passengers contributed to a melee that left a flight
attendant seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger, a 200-pound 21-year-old college football player,
began wandering up the aisle, ``blessing'' other passengers by
tapping them on the head with a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant, Renee Sheffer, 34, who had seen just about
everything in 15 years on the job, approached the young man and
gently coaxed him toward an empty seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit down and shut up!'' a male passenger a few rows back
suddenly shouted, adding some profanities that caused the young man
to become agitated. A few other passengers joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``His demeanor then became very aggressive,'' Sheffer recalled.
``He said he had to go up to the front of the airplane now and
bless the pilot because now the plane was going to crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a small incident now loomed as a bigger one. ``We had
the situation under control, but then comes the macho man, `I'm
going to deal with this!''' Sheffer said. ``It's just like a fuse
on a bomb. Outside stimuli from the passengers really set him
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer and another flight attendant ultimately led the man back
to the rear of the plane. But then, she said, ``another macho guy
yelled at us to get the guy in a seat or he would do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbed man wheeled, grabbed her and tossed her into a
bulkhead. A five-minute struggle ensued before the man was
restrained with plastic handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you imagine me at 5-foot-5 and 114 pounds tying up this
200-pound running back, it's kind of amusing in hindsight,''
Sheffer said. Of course, the internal bleeding and the surgery for
knee and shoulder injuries were not so funny, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant was convicted of federal assault charges and given
probation. But Sheffer and her husband, Mike Sheffer, a television
engineer, thought that what she had encountered was just the tip of
a problem the airline industry had ignored for too long.
</P>
<P>

ANALYSIS: 2 VICTORS, REDEFINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-RDP)

<P>
   After a year of remarkable political tumult, one party ended up
where it started Tuesday, with the nominee it had expected to have,
and the other found its outlook substantially if not decisively
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who began as a seeming shoo-in for the
Democratic presidential nomination, survived a patch so shaky that
even some of his staff members made fun of him. He moved his
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, to more derisive
catcalls, and pulled his ragged operation together with
considerable skill.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in the closest approximation the nation has ever had to
a national primary, he utterly humiliated his rival, former Senator
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who had looked for a time last year
like the freshest of political faces. Bradley lost on the Atlantic
Coast, on the Pacific coast and in between _ even in Missouri,
where he grew up, and in New York, where he won fame and fortune
playing basketball for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bravura performance by the vice president, if no longer
surprising in view of the near-collapse of Bradley's campaign in
recent weeks, and it positioned him well for the battle against the
eventual Republican nominee this fall, although perhaps situated
somewhat farther to the left on some key issues than he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Even on health care, which Bradley had made his signature issue,
most voters said they believed Gore had outlined a batter plan.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas moved much
closer to the presidential nomination, defeating or contending
closely with Senator John McCain of Arizona everywhere but New
England, a region as out of step with the rest of the country in
2000 as the South was a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   What came before Tuesday was mere skirmishing, in the long view.
If not McCain's Appomattox, the Super Tuesday voting seemed likely
to prove his Gettysburg. The wide lead seized by Bush in the
delegate count gave him a commanding position at the campaign's
most significant moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the governor can look forward with confidence to a day, next
Tuesday, when his own state as well as Florida, where his brother,
Jeb, is the governor, choose their delegates. As they were in
Tuesday's Republican primary and caucus voting in 13 states, the
numbers at stake will be significant: Texas is the nation's
second-largest state and Florida is the fourth-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also began the campaign as a heavy favorite. But he
suffered serious setbacks in New Hampshire and Michigan as McCain
mounted an unexpectedly potent insurgency, and he veered sharply to
the right in South Carolina in a successful effort to head off the
Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush, who had originally presented himself as a
candidate who could appeal to all voters, regardless of party,
found himself redefined as a Republican partisan with little
backing among Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans _
without whom he would have little chance in November.
</P>
<P>
   Again in Tuesday's balloting, Republicans voted heavily for Bush
while Democrats and independents voted for McCain. The pattern was
much the same as in each test since New Hampshire: who won in many
states depended heavily on the proportion of independents and
Democrats in the electorate. The more there were (as in
Massachusetts) the better McCain did; the fewer there were (as in
Ohio), the worse.
</P>
<P>
   If, as now seems highly likely, he moves on to win the
nomination, Bush will have to find a way to remedy this problem. He
has tried hard since South Carolina, without success; his senior
advisers are already deep in discussions about fresh notions of how
to renew his appeal to voters in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, most politicians believe, emerged from the campaign a
weaker candidate than he began it, scuffed by McCain's attacks, and
with a party badly split between conservatives and moderates. Gore
emerged as a stronger, more vivid campaigner, with a relatively
united party.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign for Bush came among Roman Catholics. McCain
sharply criticized leaders of the Republican right in a speech in
Virginia late last month, hoping, aides said, that Catholics and
others in northern states who resent Christian conservatives would
rally to him. But according to exit polls in Missouri and Ohio, in
each of which Catholics accounted for a quarter of the electorate,
Bush received half their votes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept intact a political pattern that went largely unnoticed
in the weeks when his reputation waned, then waxed once more. No
sitting vice president since World War II who sought the
presidential nomination has failed to gain it, except for Alben W.
Barkley of Kentucky, Harry Truman's number 2, who attracted little
support in 1952, largely, it was said, because of his age. He was
then 74.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will no doubt be considered the favorite at first,
especially considering the blood-letting that has taken place in
the Republican primaries for the third campaign running, Gore faces
problems of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor, President Clinton, he has put tremendous effort
into courting the voters of California, and he has built a strong
following there. But in Tuesday's so-called beauty contest in the
Golden State, there was a small note of warning.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bradley together polled considerably fewer votes than
Bush and McCain together. That may have resulted in part from the
fact that the Republican campaign was the more gripping one, but it
also suggested that Gore has work to do.

AS THEY SAY, A GOOD MENTOR IS HARD TO FIND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a clash of management styles, and Tami Sue Keller did not
know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Keller had been put in charge of strategic planning for natural
gas transmission and storage for Consumers Energy in Jackson, Mich.
A Type A personality, she was bubbling with ideas for shaking her
department up. But first she had to sell the innovations to her
fellow managers.
</P>
<P>
   That would be no easy task, but she knew one man could make it
happen: her boss, who has been around the industry and commanded
her colleagues' instant respect. The problem was, he was a Type B
personality who favored a low-key, deliberative approach that would
surely delay the changes she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   So Keller, 33, turned to her mentor, a scholarly looking older
man with more than 20 years in the energy business. She turned to
her father, Gerald A. Abood, 55, a senior director at the Wisconsin
Electric Power Co. in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   His advice was straightforward. ``He told me to lay out the
benefits and the needs and the consequences of not taking an action
_ and to create a feedback loop to the boss after you have
established what needs to be done,'' she said. The advice paid off,
and the two began setting goals and working together to achieve
them.
</P>
<P>
   Every young manager needs a mentor. Despite a mountain of
management tomes out there _ more than 6,400 at last count,
according to R.R. Bowker's Books in Print _ a landmark study of
mentoring in the Harvard Business Review in 1979 established that
nothing beats the human touch for learning how to navigate the
shoals of workplace politics.
</P>
<P>
   But for women, relative newcomers to the ranks of the nation's
19 million managers, it is not always easy to find an in-house
tutor. ``Unfortunately, because the people at the top are still
usually white men, they tend to mentor other white men,'' said
Jennifer Allyn, director of research and advisory services for
Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization in New York that works
to advance women in business. She cited a recent Catalyst survey in
which 47 percent of minority women and 29 percent of white women
said lack of a mentor was a major barrier to advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to fill the void. Six years ago,
Procter &AMP; Gamble created a program called Mentor-Up that pairs
young women with older managers. A New York-based company called
Women Unlimited provides mentoring and educational services to
women who are managers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, finding a mentor remains a largely ad hoc process. For
many women, the surest bet is to tap the expertise of older men who
would never dream of giving them the brushoff: their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn's father, John S. Wilcha, is chief executive of Old London
Foods, in the Bronx, and she definitely considers him a mentor. ``I
wasn't particularly interested in his career when I was growing
up,'' she said. ``But then I got this job at Catalyst, and suddenly
I had a lot more questions for him at the dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller's father, Abood, who oversees a staff of 55, has been
answering questions for a long time. When he and his wife divorced
in 1977, he took custody of their four daughters, then ages 6 to
11. Much like Lewis E. Platt, the former chief executive of Hewlett
Packard who raised his two daughters after his wife died, Abood
quickly gained an appreciation of what girls, and women, are
capable of.
</P>
<P>
   ``They demonstrated to me a potential second to none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Abood was learning from his daughters, they were learning
from him. ``A lot of the skills that I feel are necessary in
management are skills that my dad used in raising our family,''
Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, he insisted that all four girls push
themselves to the limit, but he also recognized that each had
different limits. ``For those of us who got straight As, he would
expect nothing less,'' she said. ``But one of my sisters got Bs and
he would expect nothing else of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Abood said he learned that lesson in the military. He did two
tours of duty in the Vietnam War, rising to staff sergeant in the
Marine Corps, and later spent 16 years in the National Guard. ``You
don't get to pick and choose'' if you are a military officer, he
said. ``So you learn to evaluate and identify each person's
potential and then to develop it. I tried to apply this to my
daughters and teach them this.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who joined Consumers Energy when she was 19, said that
she did not intend to go to work for a power company, but that it
was easier because of her father. ``There's a lot of comfort that I
have a mentor outside the company who understands the environment
in which I work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abood's influence extended to his other daughters as well. All
have ended up in positions that require management expertise. They
are Lori Ann Poirier, 32, the nursing supervisor of two hospitals
and a nursing home in Lansing, Mich.; Madonna Alice Boyd, 29, a
real estate agent in Beaver Dam, Wis., and Natasha Elizabeth
Schmidt, 28, who runs a hog farm with her husband in Fox Lake, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Keller who has most leaned on her father for
management guidance. When she first became a manager, she said, the
youngest person on her team was nine years older than she was, and
she didn't know any of the members all that well. Her father told
her not to worry; he had been around long enough to know that age
and appearance do not matter that much in the dynamics of corporate
power. What really count are self-assurance and decisiveness, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to ignore the perceptions,'' Keller recalled. ``He
said a leader isn't always a person who knows it all or has all the
answers. It's how you get people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Keller said she was having problems with a
colleague, an older man who knew a great deal about older
technologies. She said he felt threatened by her. Her father told
her to try to see the situation through his eyes and find a way to
make him feel wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to consult him on his expertise,'' Keller said. ``I
showed him that I respected him. Then he started to do the same
with me.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chants finally came, arguably a month overdue,
and ironically not even at a Los Angeles Lakers home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``M-V-P.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid Shaquille O'Neal's 61-point extravaganza Monday, a chorus
of Clippers ticket-holders at Staples Center grasped what Laker
fans haven't yet. Amazingly, not a single ``MVP'' yelp has been
audible at a Lakers home game, in the same arena.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign will be hard to stop now and it's a pleasant
sight to the man who predicted O'Neal's MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille, I'm so happy for him and just proud of what he's
accomplished,'' Lakers executive Jerry West said recently, before
O'Neal's latest demolition job. ``His hard work and dedication have
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. O'Neal's career high against the Clippers raised his
scoring average to 28.2 points, second in the NBA. He's also second
in rebounding (14.3 per game), first in field-goal percentage
(.565), third in blocks (3.32) and first in double-doubles (50).
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before training camp started, I'm not a prediction-
maker, but I just felt in my mind this was going to be one of those
watershed years for him,'' West said. ``As he goes forward in his
career, this is something our fans will have an opportunity to
witness firsthand for a number of years going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is also among the league's top five in playing time, at
39.9 minutes per game, in part because coach Phil Jackson has
little faith in his backup centers. But the long minutes don't faze
West, a onetime teammate of Wilt Chamberlain, who averaged 45.8
minutes per game over his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not leading the league in minutes played,'' West said of
O'Neal. ``He !ital!should play 40 minutes a game, period. Good
players should play 40 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to have times when you can rest him, but the fact
remains, he's prospered playing the way he's playing, and the
amount of minutes he's playing. You'd like to be two-deep
everywhere, and I think sometimes when I look at our situation,
we'd like to see development of a backup player in his position
that Phil has confidence in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Down time: After playing five games in seven days, the Lakers
are taking a breather. A Thursday trip to Golden State is the only
game on the calendar between now and Sunday, and Jackson gave his
players Tuesday off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking forward to (the down time); I'm not looking
forward to it,'' Jackson said. ``There's not much I can do to them,
although I'd like to. But they'll have a day off and then we'll
resume and go hard.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dribbles: O'Neal's 61-point, 23-rebound line was the first
60-20 game in the NBA since Chamberlain had 66 points and 27
rebounds Feb. 7, 1969, in a 121-117 overtime loss at Phoenix. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Milestone check: If the Lakers win their 17th in a row Thursday,
their streak will be tied for the sixth longest in NBA history. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   They might not get to 33 the NBA record set by the 1971-72
Lakers but the second-longest streak (20, by the 1970-71 Milwaukee
Bucks) is in reach. After the Warriors, the Lakers are at home
against Sacramento, then on the road at Denver and Washington for
potential wins 19 and 20. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Despite the off day, the Lakers (50-11) were set to be the first
team to clinch a playoff berth. All they needed was a Denver loss
at Indiana on Tuesday, or a victory over the Warriors on Thursday.

   NEW YORK _ With predictions that turnout would be heavier than
usual for a primary, New York voters, energized by a highly
competitive presidential campaign, headed to the polls Tuesday,
even though they were sometimes still puzzled about their choices.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in particular stepped into the booth with more than
a little uncertainty. In some cases this arose from the confusing
ballot, but it was also because of the tough campaigning of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who were
virtually tied in opinion polls heading into the primary. And a few
voters were surprised that they could not cross party lines to
vote, as was the case in a few other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Democrats were very disappointed that they could not
vote for a Republican,'' said Al Krooler, a polling inspector in
Mount Kisco. ``We had to convince some of them that once you go in
the booth you have to vote for somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Election and party officials in several areas said they believed
turnout would be heavier than normal _ for a primary, 20 to 25
percent of registered voters _ but it was impossible to tell early
in the evening if those predictions would come true. Much of the
balloting was expected to take place in the hours right before the
polls closed at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs people were eager to vote. In Putnam County,
Robert J. Bennett, the Democratic commissioner of the Board of
Elections, said voters started calling the board early in the
morning demanding to know why the polls would not open until noon,
the normal hour in most upstate New York counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the number of phone calls we received, it indicates to me
that there is a heck of a lot of interest in these races,'' Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The polls opened at 6 a.m. in New York City, on Long Island and
in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Erie counties; in the rest of
the state, not enough people typically vote in primaries to warrant
longer hours, said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state
elections board.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said the political brawl between McCain and Bush had
ignited their interest. William F. Milford, a farmer in the Suffolk
County community of Southold, said his misgivings about Bush led
him to vote in a primary for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't trust Bush,'' he said. ``I don't agree with
everything McCain says, but I trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another first-time primary voter, Darrin Smith of Eastchester,
said that after reading and hearing so much about the campaign he
would have felt guilty sitting it out. ``I had to do something with
this information,'' said Smith, an accountant who went with Bush
because of his record on education in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters found the ballots baffling. In the Republican
primary, the names of delegates for the candidates were printed in
larger type than the names of the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman A. Ernst Jr., of Garden City, who said he voted for
McCain, linked the small print to the failed effort by the state's
Republican Party leaders to keep the senator off the ballot. ``It's
upsetting to me when the Republicans espouse very democratic
principles, and here they are trying to keep McCain off the ballot,
and there being this confusion on the ballot,'' he said. ``The name
was very tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been an expectation in the McCain camp that New York
Republicans, who are considered moderate, would flock to him, but
in North Castle, a woodsy suburban town in central Westchester
County, a different phenomenon was evident: Republicans _ at least
two of them _ for Gore. Richard and Virginia Weir, lifelong
Republicans, said they were repelled from their own party when both
Bush and McCain began using religion as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very religious people, and that was a real turnoff,''
Virginia Weir said. ``McCain came across as nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, they said, he shared few traits with his father,
for whom they had voted enthusiastically. Looking ahead to
November, each said, the only reasonable candidate left was the
likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. ``I do believe
I'm going to vote for him,'' Virginia Weir said. ``There just isn't
anybody out there who has the old-fashioned qualities we like.
They're all dead now.'' In the meantime, the Weirs said, they were
so frustrated they split their votes Tuesday between Bush and
McCain delegates.

FROM TOP SCORER TO PURE PASSER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He was always a great jumper in high school, and
by the time he was a junior at Palmdale High, Markus Carr could
already dunk a basketball, even though he stood just a tad over
6-feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, four years ago, before his senior season, Carr made the
biggest leap of his life. Unlike many of the players before him,
Carr committed to a four-year school.
</P>
<P>
   He was a kid with skinny legs who weighed maybe 170 pounds
soaking wet. Playing in an area not known for great basketball he
leaped at the chance to sign with Cal State Northridge. Carr was
confident he made the right choice, even as the local junior
college coach asked him to change his mind and stay in the Antelope
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of people before me go to (Antelope Valley
College),'' Carr said. ``I didn't want to do the same thing. I
wanted to try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at him now. Carr, a sophomore, has blossomed into one of
the top guards on the West Coast. He leads the Big Sky Conference
in assists, averaging 7.3 per game, which also ranks him in the top
10 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN (18-9) plays Weber State (18-9) tonight in the first
round of the conference tournament, Carr will take the court as a
first-team all-conference selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carr)'s elevating his game,'' said CSUN teammate Carl Holmes,
who broke in with Carr in 1997. ``He's a solid point guard. He
scores when he needs to, but his No. 1 priority is getting his
teammates the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, now 6-1 and 180 pounds, improves every game. He's a little
cocky and he never hesitates to throw a no-look pass. He's been
known to throw an alley-oop pass, too. From halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flashiness is just an instinct,'' Carr said. ``It comes
with the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr bounces when he walks. There's a rhythm there. It seems
like James Brown's ``Super Bad'' is always playing in Carr's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of being a dreamer,'' he said. ``(Growing up) I did
a lot of dreaming of what I wanted to do on the court, in front of
a large crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Antelope Valley wasn't known for producing players
who could fit nicely into a pickup game on Venice Beach. In
back-to-back years, though, three players brought the playground to
the Golden League.
</P>
<P>
   One was Highland's John Burrell, who averaged 30 points per game
as a senior. After a two-year standout career at Antelope Valley
College, Burrell is at CSUN by way of Nevada. He's sitting out this
season because of NCAA transfer rules. Another was Tony Walker, a
two-sport star at Antelope Valley who went to Utah State to play
football.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Carr, the least-known of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Like Burrell, Carr was a scorer, averaging 18 points as a junior
and 20 as a senior. But Burrell led his team to a Golden League
title. Walker was a football hero, which counts for everything in
the AV.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carr) shot the ball anytime he wanted,'' said Kevin Miller,
Carr's backcourt teammate in high school. ``He had the green light,
every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr said nobody saw the passes he made in practice. No one knew
his ability to do anything other than make baskets. When he got to
CSUN, he even doubted himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (my teammates) first saw me, I don't think they thought I
could handle it at the D-I level,'' Carr said. ``I was really small
and really skinny. I seemed like another average player that might
not be able to step up to this competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markus was probably the best freshman of all of us who came
in,'' he said. ``We knew that right off the bat. He was very
athletic, as small as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in
September of 1997 and missed what would have been his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The injury) was a blessing in disguise, really,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Carr redshirted and he got bigger and stronger
through physical therapy. He also had a chance to observe CSUN
coach Bobby Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I sat out that year, I got to see what (Braswell) really
wanted the point guard to do and how he wanted the point guard to
run the team,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he came back from the injury, Carr had less jumping
ability but a better understanding of the college game. He started
23 of the Matadors' 29 games and he led the team in assists with
127.
</P>
<P>
   Carr has completely changed himself as a player from when he was
at Palmdale. He's averaging 8.4 points this season, up from 6.2
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to college, I realized that around me were a lot of
scorers,'' Carr said. ``I knew I could be the person to get them
the ball to score. Once you get to college, especially at the D-I
level, everybody was a scorer or they were the best on their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to get them the ball. I just figured out a way .
. . to get them the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr has found his way and his friend Miller said everybody in
Palmdale knows how he is doing at CSUN: ``You see his name in the
papers all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But trips home during the school year are infrequent for Carr,
who says he last went back at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go see (my) family,'' he said. ``I'll go out there for the
summer and run up in the hills. Most of the people from my time
left. They've got new people they look up to in high school.''

CONGRESSIONAL PANEL AGREES TO RAISE SPENDING ON AIRPORT
IMPROVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators agreed Tuesday on a
three-year plan that would increase spending on airport
improvements, air traffic control and other aviation needs by 30
percent and would let local airport authorities increase departure
taxes to $4.50 from $3 to pay for additional improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement resolves an impasse on financing airport
improvements that has held up airport aid from Washington since
October. And it preserves 30-year-old limits on the number of
flights from La Guardia and Kennedy airports in New York until
2007, but lifts them at O'Hare Airport in Chicago in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, the transportation secretary, praised the $40
billion plan for the Federal Aviation Administration, which he
described as ``a record level of investment,'' that would allow
improvements in safety, security and capacity of the aviation
system. It differed from the administration's proposal in several
key respects, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had proposed paying for aviation
through a combination of the Aviation Trust Fund, which is fed by
taxes on passenger tickets, cargo shipments and user fees. But the
final bill will rely on general tax revenues for $6 billion to $7
billion over the three-year period, according to the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had also sought to eliminate the ``high
density rule'' limiting flights at Kennedy and La Guardia, as a way
to increase competition among airlines. But it was stymied by sharp
opposition from New York-area legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Crowley, a Democrat whose district includes La Guardia
Airport in Queens County (N.Y.), said that the 2007 provision
``gave us room to breath again and fight the battle'' to keep the
rule permanently. According to the Transportation Department, while
the rule was once justified by airport capacity, technology has
allowed the scheduling of additional flights. The legislation
provides exemptions for some flights to undeserved areas.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also allows an extra 24 landings or takeoffs a
day at Reagan National Airport near Washington, and reserves 12 of
those for flights beyond 1,250 miles. Flights from National were
limited to a particular radius to bolster business at Dulles, also
in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, had sought the change.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the passenger facility charge, to $4.50, is
intended to help bolster competition, according to its backers.
``We think that will help airports get a little more autonomy, and
get out from under the thumb of the airlines,'' said Scott M.
Brenner, a spokesman for the House committee. ``You go to any
airport and there is a dominant airline, and they own every single
gate there.'' With more revenue, airport authorities can build more
gates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airports would still have to apply to the Federal Aviation
Administration for permission to raise their fees.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which the House and Senate are expected to take
up soon, provides for 30 percent increases in federal aid for
runways and other improvements under the Airport Improvement
Program.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides about $1 billion a year extra for air traffic
control modernization. The administration had proposed turning the
FAA's air traffic control section into a ``performance-based
organization,'' giving it a greater degree of independence and some
ability to function more like a private business, but Congress
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   While the compromise seeks to lock in a high rate of spending on
capital improvements, financing for operations, like the salaries
of FAA personnel, would still have to be appropriated from year to
year, according to Transportation Department officials.  &QL;

VERISIGN TO ACQUIRE NETWORK SOLUTIONS IN STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the costliest acquisition of an Internet
company to date, VeriSign Inc., a producer of online security
software, agreed to acquire Network Solutions Inc., the
Virginia-based company that maintains the master list of Internet
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   VeriSign valued the deal, a stock swap, at $21 billion, although
a drop in its share price took it down to $17 billion _ still a
high premium for a company with 1999 earnings of $26.9 million on
sales of $220.8 million. The deal rivals Lucent Technologies Inc.'s
$20 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications Inc. in January
1999 as the biggest high-tech acquisition ever. The major
difference is that Ascend had $1.6 billion in sales in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the price was all the more astonishing because
Network Solutions no longer enjoys a monopoly in the registration
of domain names, as Internet addresses are known, and will see
growing competition in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also constrains VeriSign's ability to form
partnerships or strategic alliances with a generation of companies
that now compete with Network Solutions in registering domain
names, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns drove VeriSign shares down $47.4375 to close at
$200, in Nasdaq trading. Network Solutions shares soared, closing
at $407.3906, up $46.7656, to make it the biggest gainer on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of these two companies makes sense,'' said
Charles Rutstein, an analyst with Forrester Research. ``The
cross-selling and up-selling opportunities are evident to most
observers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``What's a bit confusing is why VeriSign needed to
own this company as opposed to being a marketing partner. The two
have done business together before. At the end of the day, you have
to wonder whether $21 billion was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, VeriSign, whose software keeps sensitive
information safe when people buy and sell things on the Internet,
will issue 2.15 shares of VeriSign common stock for each share of
Network Solutions stock, as constituted before a 2-for-1 split of
Network Solutions stock on March 10. Verisign had earnings of $4
million on revenues of $84.8 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that by combining they would be able to offer
services including domain registration, global directory listings,
basic Web site creation and secure processing of online
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton Sclavos, VeriSign's president and chief executive,
called Network Solutions ``one of the most undervalued assets on
the Internet by any of the standard metrics _ number of customers,
type of business model, revenue growth, profitability, cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there were regulatory issues and competitive
pressures that made the outcome of the merger difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Commerce Department created Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, to end Network Solutions'
monopoly and open up the registration of Internet addresses to
competition. Tuesday, at an Icann meeting in Cairo, people were
caught off guard by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real eye-opener,'' said Ken Stubbs, who runs a
nonprofit group that now competes with Network Solutions. But he
said he was not concerned about its impact on his group. ``I think
I'll register more names tomorrow than today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1979, Network Solutions pioneered the registering of
Web addresses ending in .com, .net, .org and .edu. It is the
world's leading registrar with more than 8.1 million domain
registrations. It also offers so-called registry services, meaning
that it maintains the InterNIC database, the telephone directory of
the Internet. Network Solutions' registry customers include all the
new competing companies that register domains ending in .com, .net
and .org.

CANADIANS CHARGE MCSORLEY WITH ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When suspended defenseman Marty McSorley stopped by the Bruins'
dressing room Monday afternoon, he had a terrible feeling that he
would be facing criminal charges in Vancouver in connection with
the stick-swinging incident Feb. 21 that gave the Canucks' Donald
Brashear a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   His dread turned out to be well-founded, as a Canadian court
ruled Tuesday that McSorley must appear in court April 4 to face
one count of assault with a weapon. If convicted, McSorley faces a
maximum sentence of 18 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' McSorley said during an interview on ESPN.
``I'm disappointed it's going to court, because I don't know if
anybody really knows right now how much I've already lost.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, who has aspirations to coach once his playing career
is over, realizes his reputation has been tarnished and his future
employment in the NHL has been jeopardized. If he wants to return
to playing, the 36-year-old defenseman must petition to be
reinstated and meet with commissioner Gary Bettman in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley's suspension, which covers the final 23 games of the
season, is the longest in NHL history for an on-ice incident. It
will cost him an estimated $72,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in contact with a very good lawyer in Vancouver and
we were trying to not have it go to court,'' said McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Gaul, a spokesman for the British Columbia criminal
justice branch, said the decision to charge McSorley was made after
a prosecutor's review and a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An NHL representative said the league wasn't happy with the
decision but will cooperate with Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the league dealt with the matter quickly,
decisively, and appropriately _ and did not feel that any further
action was either warranted or necessary,'' said Bill Daly, the
NHL's chief legal officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning moments of a 5-2 loss in Vancouver, McSorley
struck Brashear in the right temple and knocked him to the ice,
causing a Grade 3 concussion, the most serious type. McSorley and
Brashear had fought earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no intention of hurting Donald Brashear with
my hockey stick,'' said McSorley. ``I wanted a confrontation with
Donald Brasher, no different than I've done on so many other
nights. It just went badly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time law enforcement agencies have
responded to on-ice violence in the NHL. Who can forget the Wayne
Maki-Ted Green incident? After a stick-swinging duel in a September
1969 preseason game, they were taken to court. Boston's Green, who
suffered a fractured skull, and Maki, who was not injured, were
acquitted of assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Dave Forbes of the Bruins stood trial, accused of using
excessive force against Henry Boucha of the Minnesota North Stars
in another stick attack. The trial ended in a hung jury and the
prosecution did not seek a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent incident involved Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli,
who was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 in 1988 for
striking Luke Richardson several times in the head with his stick.

BUSH TURNING INTO `A BETTER CANDIDATE' AFTER BRUISING PRIMARY
BATTLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush, almost assured of the Republican
presidential nomination after Tuesday's primaries, is emerging from
his brutal nominating battle by taking the attitude that any
illness that does not kill you will only make you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries can be very healthy. It's made me a better
candidate,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's fight with GOP rival John McCain may have left his
candidacy so unhealthy that it would be considered terminal if his
general election Democratic opponent was anyone other than Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wounds are deep,'' said University of Virginia political
scientist Larry Sabato, but ``as many weaknesses that have been
revealed about George W. Bush, he's still 50-50 because Al Gore is
an exceptionally unexceptional candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said Bush's primary campaign exploded the idea that he is
a candidate who can appeal to crossover independent and primary
voters. Sabato said Bush's moderate credentials have been tainted
by his appeal to Southern fundamentalists to the degree that it now
looks unlikely Bush could carry any northeastern states in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely lucky that his opponent is Al Gore. Gore has
the same problem that Bush does: zero appeal to independents or
voters of the other party,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   This status is a far cry from where Bush was coming out of the
Iowa caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was viewed as a centrist whose re-election victory as Texas
governor in 1998 had proven he could attract independents and
Democrats. He had raised more than $70 million, a record in
presidential money-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But in underestimating McCain in New Hampshire, Bush allowed the
Arizona senator to score an upset victory that suddenly made him a
competitive opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss burst the bubble on Bush as the inevitable nominee and
eventual president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign replied by embracing religious conservatives to
win South Carolina. That primary gave Bush's candidacy an extremist
tint. And McCain's subsequent use of Bush's speech at Bob Jones
University harmed Bush's plan to make northeastern Catholics a part
of his winning general election coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, McCain had become what Bush was supposed to be, the
candidate who was attracting independent and Democratic voters. But
Bush outpaced McCain by winning with core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has pushed himself out of the center and that will give
Gore an opportunity to play on the theme that he is too extreme,''
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for the People and
the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said that even though some voters may consider Bush a
centrist, they now view him ``as a moderate in the grip of the
extreme right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign also was harmed by the view that it had been
profligate in spending almost all of the money it had raised.
</P>
<P>
   The original campaign funding plan had been promoted that Bush
would have enough money to win the nomination. He would then have
money left over to campaign against Gore from March until his
campaign receives federal funds after the Republican National
Convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finance chairman Don Evans said there always had been two
plans, and one was that there would be a competitive primary race
through March.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said a series of six events in coming weeks will raise
somewhere between $5 million and $10 million for Bush. He noted
that President Clinton had $18 million in the bank March 1, 1996,
for his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main point is we'll be competitive,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday kept downplaying the idea that the Super Tuesday
primaries would make him the presumptive nominee. But he also
promoted the idea that he can heal his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries are tough because we are arguing among a political
family, but there is going to be ample time to heal wounds that
exist,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he goes into the general election with an excited
Republican base vote. He said he has no plans to change his message
because his programs for tax cuts and education reform cross party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change my message. Maybe Al Gore feels like
that's the way he needs to campaign. He keeps changing message,
changing headquarters or changing suits,'' Bush said, chiding
Gore's campaign overhaul that occurred late last year. ``I'm going
to say the same thing during the course of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also said he believes he faces a stiff challenge this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign, given the way this
administration has conducted themselves over the past seven years.
It's the politics of personal destruction,'' Bush said. ``It's an
administration that if you don't agree with them on an issue,
they'd much rather fight than debate.''

<P>
   In one of the more drastic stock swoons in memory for a blue
chip company, shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble tumbled nearly 31 percent
Tuesday, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average and other makers
of consumer products down with it, after the company warned that it
would not meet earnings estimates for its third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the opening bell at the New York Stock
Exchange, $36 billion in market value for Procter had vanished _
quantifying the wrath of investors unaccustomed to bad news from a
company that is often referred to as an ``iron man'' for its
steady, predictable profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You evaporated a company bigger than Colgate-Palmolive
today,'' said Jim Dormer, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G, the maker of Tide, Pampers, Crest toothpaste and Ivory
soap, thus joined the list of once highflying global
consumer-products giants like Coca-Cola and Gillette whose fortunes
have changed abruptly in recent months. The stock fell $27.0625, to
$60.375. It accounted for about a third of the point decline in the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very significant event for investors, because this
is the kind of stock that people watch,'' said Leah Modigliani, a
stock analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who has favored basic
industries like oil and paper over consumer products for some time.
``And it is something that will cause people to lose faith in some
of the American consumer businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected its profits to drop 10 percent to
11 percent in the quarter that ends March 31 compared with results
in the period a year earlier. That is well off Wall Street's
expectations, which were for earnings 7 percent to 9 percent
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Management's explanation _ which cited rising prices for raw
materials like petroleum and wood pulp, a delay in savings expected
from a sweeping reorganization last year and higher costs because
of a delay in federal approval for an osteoporosis drug _ failed to
satisfy some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are worried there may be another shoe to drop,''
said Wendy C. Nicholson, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who
downgraded Procter to ``hold'' more than a year ago. ``While
Procter is expecting the third quarter to be down, can you really
believe they are going to recover as quickly as they say they
are?''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Clearly, raw material prices have risen. The
question is, why didn't Procter expect this and manage the
expectations better for shareholders and Wall Street?''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, the company issued a similar profit warning,
and its shares slipped 9.7 percent, to $71.875. The company
attributed that shortfall to flat sales in Europe and the financial
crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Procter's stock price slide Tuesday was comparable to the one
recorded by Philip Morris on April 2, 1993, when the company cut
cigarette prices. On what became known as Marlboro Friday, the
share price dropped 23 percent, to $49.375, down from $64.125.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that an aggressive strategy pursued by
Procter's recently appointed chief executive, Durk I. Jager, had
destabilized the share price, annoying investors further. In the 14
months since he became chief, Jager, bent on shaking up the insular
corporate culture, has led a sweeping reorganization, introduced a
raft of new products and pursued a huge acquisition that was later
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the stock was beaten down to $94.8125 a share,
from a high of $117 last fall, after word of talks between Procter
and American Home Products and Warner-Lambert leaked out. Jager was
clearly angry when he announced that Procter was dropping its plan
to acquire the two companies for $142 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Peris, an analyst at Argus Research, said: ``Most CEO's
get a honeymoon and bring their own vision to the company, but the
vision in Durk Jager's case has been loud, in your face,
psychedelic. It seems they may have been doing things too fast.
It's like trying to get a boat in shape and race it at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Jager said he was disappointed by the
third-quarter results. But he vowed to make this the last time
Procter failed to hit its target. ``You'll see an enormous amount
of concentration and focus in our company to ensure that this
doesn't happen again,'' he said. ``Sometimes it takes a crisis to
get the kind of focus we've always been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One retail expert, Burt Flickinger III, said Procter had created
some of its own problems, particularly in Latin America and Europe,
which Jager identified as highly competitive markets where the
company had not done as well as it expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``P&AMP;G stubbed its toe pretty badly with Carrefour, the leading
international retailer,'' said Flickinger, managing director of
Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. When Carrefour executives in
Argentina, Brazil and several European markets complained that
Procter's everyday-low-price plan did not fit the store's strategy,
Procter executives refused to change the plan, Flickinger said.
``They lost significant distribution at Carrefour in their core
categories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A P&AMP;G spokesman, Simon Denegri, said, ``That is not one of the
reasons we've put forward in terms of our earnings decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter has also been reluctant to team up with retailers to
develop private-label brands of detergent and other products that
have been strategically essential for the retailers, Flickinger
added. ``It's still a heretical issue there,'' he said. As a
result, the business has gone to competitors like Colgate-Palmolive
and to private-label American companies like J.L. Prescott, he
added, as well as overseas companies willing to fill the void.
Denegri said he had no comment on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The household-products business,'' said Amy Low Chasen, an
analyst with Goldman, Sachs, ``has gotten more difficult over time,
and the fact that you've got the bellwether company having
difficulty just confirms that.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed caution Tuesday about the company's future.
``Not everything is flowing as they expected, so you're seeing an
imbalance between sales and cost savings,'' said Mark Godfrey, a
senior analyst with Invesco Funds Group in Denver. ``What it
highlights is that it is very difficult to forecast and track the
global economic environment for a lot of these multinationals these
days. There is increased volatility, and things happen so much
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager for Dreyfus, which
owns 4.5 million shares of Procter, said he saw the issue of rising
commodity prices as temporary. ``Pulp costs are not going to stay
this high forever,'' he said. But he added: ``Something Procter has
always been able to do is to let one area bleed, either geography
or product, because they are so massive. And the rest of the
company picks up the slack. This seems to be one of those times
when they are not able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   One marketing expert said he fully expected Procter to regain
its balance, but added that doing so would test Jager's managerial
skill. ``I am willing to hear what they have to say, but I think
they've got about six months,'' said Ken Harris, a partner in
Cannondale Associates, a consulting firm. ``They have got to show
positive results. They are not the kind of animal that does well
when their confidence is shaken.'' He added, ``No one likes a
stalwart company to be doing anything other than being a stalwart
company.''

 &HT;    Delegate math is a sobering equation
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ John McCain has spent the past week
preaching the ``politics of addition, not the politics of
division.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was talking about bringing new blood into the Republican
Party, a key part of his improbable run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But as he awaited the verdict in coast-to-coast voting in 13
states Tuesday, McCain confronted a sobering problem of political
math.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, would McCain have any way of denying George W. Bush
the 1,034 Republican delegates needed to win the presidential
nomination?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will play a decisive role in whether McCain continues
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On top of Bush's bounty Tuesday, Bush's home state of Texas and
five other Southern states with 340 delegates hold primaries next
Tuesday. Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is governor, is one of
the states voting next week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has lost all three Southern states that have voted so
far, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia, and McCain aides have
conceded that Bush will have a good day next week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are pointing to Illinois, which has a March 21
primary open to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain issued a statement early Tuesday night as he watched
election results with his wife, Cindy, from Los Angeles. Early
projections showed McCain winning Vermont, and he anticipated
strong results in Massachusetts and several other Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the polls begin to close on the East Coast, Cindy and I
want to express our tremendous gratitude for the great support my
campaign received at the polls today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is too early to officially comment on all the
results, it is clear we have done very well on the East Coast and I
am deeply grateful for the strong support our campaign is receiving
throughout the state of New York and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic that this trend of support will continue on
the West Coast, and I look forward to all the results as they
continue to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Straight Talk Express, McCain's campaign bus, sat silent
most of Tuesday, while the candidate was closeted in his hotel
suite with much of his family.
</P>
<P>
   His only campaign activity was a round of early morning radio
interviews that began with Don Imus' program and included stations
in San Diego and San Francisco. McCain awoke at 4:30 a.m. PST to
chat with Imus, a McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's public comments provided mixed signals about the future
of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked the kind of
prairie fire out there that is getting people involved,'' he said
on radio station KGO in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The same wistfulness about what he has done over the past few
months also was evident in McCain's last campaign appearance in
California.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in the soothing sunshine in San Diego's Old Town on
Monday afternoon, McCain talked about his stops at factory gates,
his town hall meetings, his enthusiastic receptions on college
campuses, ``the people we've known and the relationships we've
had.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain and his aides insisted he would soldier on, the
candidate is scheduled to go today to his Arizona retreat near
Sedona for a day of rest and consultation with his senior staff and
family.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign schedule is supposed to resume Thursday with a stop
in Grand Junction, Colo., before Friday's primaries in Colorado,
Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, a media consultant, said the campaign has spent
$200,000 to buy time on Colorado television stations this week.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate himself continued to stress the theme of inclusion
that has dominated his rhetoric since he branded religious
conservative leaders Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell
``agents of intolerance'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the speech was to attract moderate Republican,
independent and Democratic voters who object to the political
influence of Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you reach beyond your party,'' McCain said on KGO in
San Francisco, ``you are condemned to minority status.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was appealing to non-Republicans who are allowed to vote
for Republican candidates in California and nine other states. In
California, McCain was hoping to win the overall vote, while Bush
held a wide lead among Republicans. Only GOP votes would count in
awarding the state's 162 delegates to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain again lashed out at Bush for not doing anything to stop a
$2.5 million anti-McCain ad campaign that is being run by a Texan
with ties to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called the ad, which attacks his environmental record and
praises Bush's, ``a violation of everything I've been fighting for
in campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has denied any connection to the ad, which would be
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCain has attacked Bush as a candidate who is
willing to do and say anything to win.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fault McCain for reacting so forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been angry and whiny,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
science professor at the University of Virginia. ``Whether he
realizes it or not, he is proving some of the criticisms of some of
his most ardent opponents to be accurate. He does have a temper and
he's just not a good sport. ... Voters expect a strong leader who
can take criticism. They want someone with elephant skin because
they know that's what the presidency demands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain talked about the topsy-turvy nature of the
2000 Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every model that there's been so far in this primary has not
been true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the biggest political day of the year so far, McCain
showed that he still retained his ability to tease those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cindy, complained that she dined on cashews Monday
night while McCain's senior staff ate at one of Los Angeles' best
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had honey-roasted peanuts, too,'' he told her.

BOURQUE TAKES CLASS ACT TO AVALANCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While the struggling Bruins were working out in the
suburbs Tuesday before leaving for Buffalo, their former captain,
Ray Bourque, was on a private jet alongside Dave Andreychuk on the
way to join the Colorado Avalanche in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who was traded Monday after nearly 21 seasons in the
Black and Gold, had asked to be dealt to Detroit or Philadelphia so
he could stay close to his family, with his first choice being the
Flyers. However, Bruins management felt the Avalanche offered the
best package (Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sami Pahlsson, and a
first-round pick in 2000 or 2001).
</P>
<P>
   This hockey season in Boston has been bizarre from the get-go,
and Tuesday's strange sequence of events was typical of just how
odd and unfortunate things have gotten.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque held a poignant, dignified, and emotional news
conference at Logan International Airport a little after 8 a.m., in
which he bid a tearful farewell to the city he loves and the only
one he's known in his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, I haven't been close to competing for a Cup,''
said Bourque. ``The other reason, another big reason I wanted to
go, is I think I need to challenge myself at this point in time to
really find out what I've got left as a hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, however, Bruins president/general manager
Harry Sinden was pointing the management howitzers at coach Pat
Burns during an interview on WEEI radio.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Sinden felt compelled to travel to New
Jersey to put to rest rumors that Burns was about to be fired.
Tuesday, Sinden said Burns's future would be addressed after the
season, and he clearly criticized the coach when asked by radio
hosts John Dennis and Gerry Callahan whether Burns could have done
anything differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury factor didn't occur on this team until we were
already in very, very bad shape on the ice,'' Sinden said. ``Up to
the point where (Jason) Allison went down. In October, it was our
10th game before we won and we didn't have any injuries then. It
was not the reason we went into (the tailspin). We just lost our
way completely, and had we not had any injuries to Allison and
(Anson) Carter, I still have my doubts if we would've come out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the club's lack of success shocked him, though he
conceded that Byron Dafoe's holdout hurt his ability to pick up
where he left off last year. In a staggering turn, though, he all
but blamed Burns's failings for Bourque's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, we were winning one game in every 15 while he
was playing and everybody else was playing,'' said Sinden. ``I
would've thought we would've been able to win two in every 15. It
seemed to me that it was an absolutely ridiculous record . . . for
a team that everybody thought perhaps could contend and that
Raymond Bourque would say, `I don't want to go anywhere. I want to
stay with this team.' It's one thing to drop a little bit and not
live up to expectations, but to totally, totally fail . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking to me that this group of players could go in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, given those comments, that Burns was subdued
after practice and called for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the mudslinging stops,'' said Burns. ``I've had
enough of that. I'm so tired of it _ who's at fault, what happened,
this guy, that guy . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five weeks of hockey left. I want to have fun with
this group. I want to win some games. Our record sucks right now.
We have to find a way to win some games and change some things.
It's just become so heavy on everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get through these five weeks and try to win as
many games as we can and maybe help some players along. Decisions
will be made, the evaluation period will all happen over the summer
or after the season. Let's just leave it up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   As that situation simmers, the day brought even more negativity
as defenseman Marty McSorley was formally charged in Vancouver with
assault for his stick attack on Donald Brashear Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive note on the day was seeing the classy Bourque
leave with a chance to win something. He was disappointed, though,
not to be going to Philadelphia, a point reiterated by his longtime
agent and friend, Steve Freyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it abundantly clear where he wanted to go and he
wanted to stay close because of family,'' said Freyer. ``So he's
not happy about going to Colorado. It's real rough on the kids. He
probably could've traded him to Hawaii but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bourque, there is no NHL team in Hawaii, but
given the circumstances, he said he was happy to be going to a
talented, contending team. He said his motivation for leaving
Boston was partly not having been in the finals for a decade and
also not having an accurate gauge on his own talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been satisfied with how I've been playing this
year,'' said Bourque, ``and I think a challenge like a Stanley Cup
run will bring the best out of me and I sure hope it does. That
will answer a lot of my questions with regard to if I'm going to
play next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque already has a couple of friends on the Avalanche _
former Bruin Dave Reid and goalie Patrick Roy. The only bad thing
about the situation is how far away he'll be from his wife, Chris,
and three kids. In terms of hockey, though, he's far more
optimistic than he was here, where he was asked to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' he said. ``For 39, playing 30 minutes
some nights or being asked to do a lot of things that a few years
ago were a lot easier, today is a lot tougher. Some things I
couldn't do as well as I would've liked. I think going to Colorado
to go out and play my game, I think it's going to be a lot better
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that isn't the case here.

<P>
   ATHENS, Vt. _ After the crock-potted beans and homemade
doughnuts, after the quick votes on culvert repair and the cemetery
committee, the 60-odd souls gathered Tuesday at the annual town
meeting of this Vermont hamlet turned to the tough, heated part.
</P>
<P>
   Did the town's residents support holding a referendum on
same-sex marriage? Yes, by acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Did they support or oppose same-sex marriage itself?
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief, troubled pause. Then they waded in.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in December that committed
gay couples should receive the same rights and benefits as straight
spouses, there have been surveys and legislative hearings and
endless radio and general store discussions on how to respond to
the ruling. But Tuesday, in more than 30 spots around Vermont, the
ultrademocratic forum of the traditional New England town meeting
offered citizens a chance to weigh in on an issue that has so far
been controlled by the court and the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, a relatively conservative and poor town of about 313
in southern Vermont, the heat of the discussion seemed to indicate
that while the Legislature has agreed to concentrate on a ``civil
union'' bill that stops just short of marriage for gay couples, a
bill that is working its way efficiently through the House of
Representatives, there is no such agreement among many Vermonters.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the question was put, Wayne Ryan, a mechanic in black
garb and cowboy hat, rose and said: ``I believe it's against our
constitutional rights to have government and legislation change the
word `marriage' to mean something as ill and as foul as same-sex
partners. I believe anybody that does so cannot do it in clear
conscience, because it is against our constitutional rights to
change such a sacred word as `marriage.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Perry, a dairy farmer, spoke next. ``I'd like to know our
representatives' opinion on this, and if it comes up, how you
intend on voting,'' because, he said, ``that makes a difference how
we vote in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David L. Deen, a Democrat who represents Athens and
three other towns, promptly obliged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, in fact, abhor discrimination,'' Deen told the townspeople.
``It is just antithetical to everything I am or have been.''
</P>
<P>
   He therefore supports the civil union bill, he said. He also
reminded those at the meeting that despite dire warnings before the
state passed a law banning discrimination based on sexual
orientation back in 1992, ``the world as we know it hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives haven't changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Deen said, if he loses his seat over this issue,
``the world as I know it does not end,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy questions came from the crowd. Harold Noyes, the local
minister who had pushed to put the marriage questions onto the town
meeting agenda, argued that if, under the bill, same-sex partners
would go before an ``oath-giver'' and get a certificate, that would
be virtually no different from marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes and the town clerk, Darlene Wyman, also expressed concern
about whether they would be forced to participate in a same-sex
union procedure to which their consciences objected.
</P>
<P>
   Deen said that he had ``no problem with people opting out if
they chose,'' but that he believed town clerks would be required to
provide couples with the certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have the right to refuse that document?'' Wyman asked.
</P>
<P>
   Told she likely did not, she responded, ``Then they'll have to
find another town clerk because I will not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When other townspeople pressured Deen to vote in accordance with
their majority's wishes and against the bill, he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of conscience for me,'' he said. ``I get to
exercise my conscience, and you all get to vote the first Tuesday
in November every other year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will,'' inserted Walter Ryan, Wayne's father. ``You'll be
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Deen commented that Athens was by far the
most conservative town he represented, and that voters in the
other, bigger and more liberal towns viewed domestic partnership
and gay marriage more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the town's opinions seemed to reflect the significant
depth and breadth of such opposition in Vermont _ in particular,
because it spoke as a whole town and not merely as a motivated few
who ventured to a Statehouse hearing to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, 35 townspeople voted to express opposition to gay
marriage _ a nonbinding vote that did little more than put their
opinions on record _ and 17 people dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In a second vote, on domestic partnership, 13 said they
supported the idea and 39 opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who supported domestic partnership, Tim Stevenson,
said he was not surprised at how the vote broke down, given the
conservative nature of Athens and its many longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was, however, struck that ``this was obviously the
flash point issue of the meeting, even more than the school issue,
which is really one that affects people much more personally, or
seemingly so, than the issue of gay and lesbian partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   And though he was in the minority, he said, ``I feel like, yeah,
the people of this state should express themselves, whether they're
for it or against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Fine, the town moderator, remained skeptical,
however, about whether the town's opinion would be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Legislature cares what Athens thinks,'' he
said.

   &UR; BLUEPLANET  &LR; _ Daniel Lucas usually gets his phone calls
returned because of one word: Tetris. For the past three years his
company, Blue Planet Software, has made or licensed a half-dozen
video-console and PC games based on the addictive, falling-block
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to original titles, executives at the San
Francisco firm fight a battle not unlike an independent filmmaker
trying to woo a major studio. They cajole, beg, wheedle _ whatever
you want to call it _ the large publishers who actually distribute
and market most game titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels between our business and the movie business are
striking,'' said Lucas, Blue Planet's vice president of
development. ``There's a million ideas out there, but you try to
pitch one, and no one wants to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Planet has already shown its latest work-in-progress,
code-named Genesis, to liaisons _ who often act as gatekeepers _ at
three or four publishers. At this week's Game Developers Conference
in San Jose, the company will pitch the game to a couple of
publishers' marketing and sales teams in the hopes of working out a
deal by this summer. By Kelly Zito

BRUINS' LEADERSHIP ROLE GOES TO MCLAREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was no formal ceremony to mark the passing of the
torch from Ray Bourque to Kyle McLaren, the new minister of defense
for the Bruins. There was a two-minute phone conversation Monday
night between Bourque and McLaren, not long after Bourque had been
dealt to the Colorado Avalanche to pursue his Stanley Cup dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That will have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he told me, `Remember what I taught you over the
last couple of years,' '' said McLaren. ``He believes in me. He's
one guy who really believes in what I can do. I know I have a fan
in him that will watch me through the years. To have the respect of
Ray Bourque and what he taught me, I'm never going to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game ever was in the Boston Garden. I started in that
game, the last game ever there. Those memories will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday was warm and springlike outside, it was cold and
gloomy inside the suburban Bruins practice rink on the first day of
the post-Bourque era. One fan expressed the darkness in his soul
planting a sign at the entrance to the Ristuccia Center that said,
``Jeremy Jacobs and Harry Sinden: You suck!'' It was quickly taken
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange day in Bruins history. The most recognizable
figure on the ice was the coach, Pat Burns. There was no presence,
no centerpiece. It was as if the Eiffel Tower had been removed from
Paris, Big Ben ripped out of London.
</P>
<P>
   What remained was, well, the future _ which had swiftly, perhaps
too swiftly, turned into the present.
</P>
<P>
   Will the spotlight fall on McLaren now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's my team,'' he said. ``The younger guys are
definitely now in the forefront. We still have guys around that
have done a great job over the years like Rob DiMaio and Don
Sweeney and Steve Heinze. Those are the veteran guys right now. The
young guys are now having to wise up and mature a little sooner
than expected because we didn't expect Ray to leave this early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not seeing him is strange. It's tough for everyone. Twenty-one
years he's been here. When he's around, he's brightened up so many
guys' lives. Some guys are still shocked it happened. I'm sure it's
not going to settle in for a while, but it has to settle in because
we have to play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   In five years, the 23-year-old McLaren has not yet reached
All-Star level. He has soaked in the wisdom of Bourque, but the
other part, the biggest part, must come from McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at his points and you can look at his production,
but what he did off the ice is what impressed me,'' said McLaren.
``Family came first to him. No matter what. This is the only time
where I see him going for something and maybe moving away from his
family for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McLaren will be expected to handle himself on and off the
ice with the same class, even though he is no Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be pressure there for someone to come
in and fill his shoes,'' said McLaren. ``If people are expecting me
to do it, give them 80-90 points a year, I'd only be kidding myself
to put that kind of pressure on myself. I just have to play the
best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to be the captain of the team or the main
focal point because there are a lot of guys in here who can do the
job, too. Ray was an All-Star here and he'll be that wherever he
goes. You can't just build a team around one guy; it has to be
around a bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As amazing as it seems, McLaren is third on the team in
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange,'' he said. ``Ray's gone and we can't cry about
it. We're certainly sad to see him go, but we have a lot of guys
with five or less years in the league. We need those guys to pick
it up and play stronger. We have to worry about winning those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the need to move on, McLaren thinks some things are
sacred. One of them is the ``C'' that Bourque wore for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if there was a captain for a while,''
said McLaren. ``One of the most respected captains in our league
just left our team. I think it's out of respect that nobody should
wear it, nobody should sit in his stalls here or the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should wear the `C' today and really I don't think
anyone should wear it for the rest of the season and maybe next
year.''

FACING FIGHT, GORE DROPPED BOY-SCOUT IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It was a slap at an already wounded man: The night
before Tuesday's primaries, Al Gore made a quick stop to Bill
Bradley's home state, Missouri, asking for votes he almost
certainly didn't need to dominate the contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to fight for YOU!'' Gore screamed at the St. Louis
crowd in the guttural roar he has employed frequently in the past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has fought very hard for Al Gore since Bradley first
proved to be a serious challenge to the vice president last fall.
The vice president made over his campaign, moving its headquarters
from Washington, D.C., to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He lined up the backing of the Democratic establishment, which,
by publicly embracing Gore, embarrassed Bradley at ostensibly open
Democratic Party events.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president quickly crushed Bradley's efforts to chip
away at the front-runner's support. When Bradley raised questions
about Gore's record on abortion rights, Gore wrangled the
endorsement of the country's biggest abortion-rights group, the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley decided to make an all-out effort to win Washington
state's primary last week _ a contest that awarded no delegates _
Gore determined to crush him there, and did, depriving Bradley of
even a public relations boost.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Gore's boy-scout public image. When it appeared that
Bradley might have a chance to capture the Democratic nomination,
the vice president, the man teased for being stiff and boring,
battled like a gladiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two-fisted fighter,'' said Stephen Hess, an analyst
with the Brookings Institution. ``If he needs to slug it out, he'll
slug it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the backdrop of Gore's speedy comeback was a campaign
tailored to appeal to different Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Before liberal New York and Massachusetts voters, Gore voiced an
impassioned commitment to ``a woman's right to choose,'' and said
that in his boyhood household, he was taught that ``women were
equal, if not more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those references were deleted from an address Gore gave late
last month to Hasidic Jews in a New Square, N.Y., synagogue. To an
all-male audience _ the few women permitted in the building were
seated in a high balcony _ Gore talked about the strong US economy
during the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The comments about the booming economy were themselves softened
in venues such as Cudahy, Calif., and Buffalo, where the local
economies are struggling. There, Gore talked about helping those
``who have been left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke phrases in Spanish in front of Latino audiences, and
joked before raucous Buffalonians that ``you must all have had your
Flutie Flakes today,'' referring to the cereal named after Buffalo
Bills hero Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   The message appeared to work. But while the people at Gore's
rallies pledged their votes, they often lacked strong enthusiasm
for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the most experience,'' said 71-year-old Julian Van of
Cudahy with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as exciting as Bill Clinton. He doesn't bring the
same kind of excitement,'' said Doris O'Meara, 64, of Malden. But
``I would never vote Republican,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters note that the vice president has become more
charged up in his speeches, and, with his knit shirts and casual
slacks, less formal. There is plenty of time, they say, for Gore to
create a groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president transitioned from being vice president to
being the candidate for president,'' said Andrew J. Cuomo,
secretary of Housing and Urban Development and an active Gore
campaigner. ``It's early yet. When we get closer to'' the general
election ``you will see the energy for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to say that in the early fall, late summer, you
could see people were kind of undecided about Al Gore,'' said
Dennis Rivera, president of the high-profile Local 1199 union in
New York, representing health care workers. ``But there has been a
dramatic transformation since then of his campaign style.''

 &HT;    Bradley campaign at crossroads with `no specific plan'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democrat Bill Bradley planned to rest at his New
Jersey home today after watching returns from Super Tuesday's
primary voting at a New York hotel Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley greeted voters on their way to the polls early Tuesday
morning, but spent a largely quiet day in his hotel room with
senior aides and a few close supporters.
</P>
<P>
   With more than one-third of the Democratic delegates up for
grabs, the former New Jersey senator said Tuesday that he had to
win several states to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come what may, he's not dropping out this evening,'' said a
subdued Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman and a former member of his
Senate staff, speaking to reporters at the Sheraton New York Hotel
and Towers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign made tentative plans to campaign in Florida on
Thursday, but virtually the entire Bradley campaign advance team
was in New York preparing the Sheraton ballroom for what could be
Bradley's last party of the 2000 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Lynch, a Bradley supporter from Connecticut,
dropped by the ballroom early to see if he could catch a glimpse of
Bradley, but he encountered Secret Service agents who were still
securing the ballroom. Lynch said he voted for Bradley but was
preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' said Lynch, who recalled watching Bradley play
tournament basketball games at Madison Square Garden while Bradley
was at Princeton. ``He should have had a little of McCain's blood
in him. ... He didn't have the fire. He just didn't go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Super Tuesday party was just 20 blocks from Madison
Square Garden, where Bradley played basketball for the New York
Knicks and where they won two NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   At the Penn South polling place, just two blocks from the
Garden, Irving Pakewitz said he remembered Bradley's glory days
well. ``I thought he was an exceptional figure.'' But Pakewitz said
he voted for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was quixotic, him trying for the nomination,''
said Pakewitz. ``I didn't see that he brought something startling
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Benjamin, 50, a board of education employee, also said he
remembered Bradley fondly. He said he voted for Bradley even though
he suspected the candidate would lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping the polls are wrong,'' Benjamin said. ``It's tough
to run against an incumbent vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared in good spirits as he greeted voters at a
polling place on Manhattan's Upper East Side early Tuesday morning.
Bradley was greeted by seven male staff members, including Hauser,
who stripped to the waist and chanted Bradley's name. In
alternating blue and red paint, the line of staff members spelled
B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful!'' Bradley said, giving each staff member a
high-five.
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper West Side, Louis Gonzalez Jr. was so excited after
shaking Bradley's hand that he changed his plans and went straight
in to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just voted for you,'' said Gonzalez, returning to shake
Bradley's hand again. ``I just voted for you. I pulled the_ the_
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley brightened and said, ``Let me shake the hand that pulled
the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, Bradley predicted ``a couple'' of wins Tuesday, a
hope that he clung to all week. ``We're far from the end,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move for a candidate after such an important round
of primary voting, Hauser said Bradley would grant no media
interviews after he spoke to supporters Tuesday night. Hauser said
Bradley also would not appear on any television news shows today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no specific plan,'' Hauser said. ``I assume he'll
talk to people.''

 Sprint to Hide Web Surfers' Phone Numbers  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
After taking heat from privacy advocates, Sprint PCS yesterday said
it plans to change its policy of transmitting customers' phone
numbers to Web sites they access with their cell phones.
<P>
   But a second company, AT&AMP;T, confirmed yesterday that it, too,
automatically sends customers' phone numbers to Web sites through
its wireless data service. The phone numbers are embedded in every
request for a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy watchdogs complained the practice makes it too easy for
Web sites to forward the phone numbers to their sales department
for follow-up calls. Moreover, Web site operators could potentially
use databases to match the phone numbers with users' real names and
other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst said the practice could hurt AT&AMP;T's and
Sprint's fledgling efforts to persuade customers to use their cell
phone services to access the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal privacy is paramount,'' said Ken Dulaney, a San Jose
analyst with the Gartner Group. ``If that isn't one of the first
concerns of any business, it is likely the business is not going to
do well in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50,000 people in the United States now use cell
phones to access the Web, Dulaney said, but experts expect millions
to do so in coming years, making it an important market.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint said it will let customers decide whether to give out
their phone number in the next version of its wireless Web service,
scheduled to be rolled out in April or May. If users don't make a
choice, Sprint will automatically send Web sites a ``bogus number''
as their user ID.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, though, denied it was making the change because of
complaints by consumers' and privacy advocates. A Sprint executive
said the new product has been in the works for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been focused on customers' privacy,'' said
Keith Paglusch, PCS senior vice president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Paglusch said he didn't realize any customers were upset about
the current practice until The Chronicle published a story about
the issue in yesterday's paper.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``a nonissue'' in focus groups. And a Sprint
spokesman pointed out that it has agreements with a dozen partners
featured on the cell phone screen that bar them from using the
phone number for telemarketing or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Ken Woo also brushed aside privacy worries. Woo
said the phone company hasn't received any gripes from customers
about the practice, which it first publicly disclosed yesterday.
Woo also declined to say whether the company is considering
changing the policy.

CHARLES WIGGINS, WHO LED NIXON'S DEFENSE IN HEARINGS, DIES AT 72

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Charles E. Wiggins, a Republican congressman from
California who was influential in the Watergate hearings and
switched from defending President Richard Nixon to supporting
impeachment, died on Thursday in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 72 and had
lived in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins was elected to the House in 1967 from a district in
Southern California and served until 1978 when he retired to resume
practicing law. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to
the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. He was a senior judge at the
time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Wiggins was considered one of Nixon's
staunchest defenders. Along with two other members of the House
Judiciary Committee, he led the president's defense when the
Watergate hearings began in the summer of 1974. The strategy was to
construe the evidence as narrowly as possible, require ironclad
proof and propose benign explanations of information damaging to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, The New York Times described Wiggins as ``a silky
Southern Californian who would feel at home in the pages of a Ross
Macdonald detective novel.''
</P>
<P>
   In weeks of closed Judiciary Committee hearings and in six days
of televised debate in July, Wiggins argued that none of the
evidence linked Nixon directly to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But his view changed abruptly on Aug. 5, 1974 when Nixon
conceded that he had helped conceal the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a front-page headline on The New York Times
noted Wiggins' change of heart: ``Wiggins for Impeachment; Others
in G.O.P. Join Him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported that ``Representative Charles E. Wiggins,
President Nixon's strongest defender during the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment proceedings, and many other influential
House Republicans'' had announced that ``they would vote for
impeachment,'' and that Wiggins and members of the House Republican
leadership had expressed what The Times called ``a deep sense of
disillusionment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement outlining his new position, Wiggins said there
was no longer any doubt that the president had agreed to a ``plan
of action'' to obstruct the Watergate investigation. ``These facts
standing alone are legally sufficient in my opinion to sustain at
least one count against the president of conspiracy to obstruct
justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Wiggins said, he had reached the ``painful
conclusion'' that it was in the national interest for Nixon to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did so on Aug. 9, 1974. Afterward, Wiggins wrote that it
had been the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a conclusion was a sad and personally wrenching one for
me to reach, because I regarded _ and still do regard _ myself as a
friend of the president and his family and one still willing,
proudly, to claim his achievements,'' Wiggins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known rulings as a judge was in 1994, in Holmes
vs. California National Guard, which upheld the Pentagon's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy. Under the policy, the military may not
inquire into a soldier's sex life unless there is clear evidence of
homosexual conduct, but gays who volunteer the information can be
discharged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee held
a hearing on the consequences of perjury, seeking to stoke support
for impeaching President Clinton on that charge, Wiggins told the
committee, ``I'd recommend you not vote for impeachment.'' He said
the evidence against Clinton was vague.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Edward Wiggins was born in El Monte, Calif., and
received a bachelor's degree in 1953 from the University of
Southern California and a law degree from there in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced law in California and in Washington and served as
mayor of El Monte from 1964 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins married Yvonne L. Boots in 1946. She died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is survived by his second wife, the former Betty J.
Koontz, whom he married in 1972; two sons, Steve, of Aspen, Colo.,
and Scott, of Seattle; two stepsons, Gary Burnett, of Henderson,
Nev., and Craig Burnett, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a stepdaughter,
Darla Colton, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister, Lynn Burdick, of Las
Vegas; and 10 grandchildren.

 Schwab Alters IPO Pipeline for Investors  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Just as investors are clamoring louder than ever to get into
initial public stock offerings, Charles Schwab Corp. has cut off
the tap.
<P>
   Investors love IPOs _ especially those of hot technology
companies _ because these days stock often rise dramatically on the
first day of trading. Last week, for example, in one of the year's
most widely watched IPOs, shares of Palm, which makes a popular
digital organizer, closed at $95.06, up $57.06 from its issue price
of $38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the nation's largest online brokerage, offered 88 such
deals to qualified customers in 1999, reinforcing its position as a
leading provider of IPOs to individual investors. By contrast, so
far this year Schwab's IPO total has been zero.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the hiatus is a direct result of Schwab's push to
grab more IPO shares for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Schwab began selling IPO shares more than two
years ago when it inked agreements with several investment banks
that managed public stock offerings, including Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
and Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, dissatisfied with the tiny number of shares those
firms were setting aside for its customers, Schwab let the pacts
expire. Instead, it helped set up a new investment bank, Epoch
Partners, in cooperation with two brokerage rivals, Ameritrade and
TD Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with no deals flowing from its former partners and San
Francisco's Epoch still gearing up, Schwab is going through a tough
transition, denying its customers while promising them that better
times lie just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're going to have a much bigger supply (of IPO
shares) than we had before, and my sense is that it is very soon to
come,'' said Daniel Leemon, Schwab's chief strategy officer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schwab is slowly getting back into the IPO game,
temporarily getting shares through its Epoch partner Ameritrade,
which is helping arrange several transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming IPOs include Digitas, a Boston Internet consulting
firm; and iPass, a Redwood City Web software company. Through
Ameritrade, Schwab has already sold shares of Red Hat in a
follow-up offering for the software company that had its IPO last
year.
</P>
<P>
   With deals still scarce, IPO-hungry Schwab customers are
steamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. These guys were saying, `We're going to
have more and more IPOs,''' griped Bob Hink of Berkeley, a Schwab
IPO customer for more than two years. ``I don't even bother to look
at the site anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab took the risk of angering customers because its former
investment banking partners were doling out IPO shares with an
eyedropper, reserving the biggest allocations for their traditional
customers among big institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab typically got 1 or 2 percent or less of total IPO shares
for sale, people familiar with the matter said. In turn, that meant
Schwab disappointed most customers who wanted to get into IPOs,
because demand for shares greatly outstripped the brokerage's
supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a part-owner of Epoch, Schwab expects to get a much bigger
share of future offerings. ``Epoch should give us anywhere from
double to quadruple what we were getting before,'' said Leemon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to get access to IPO shares, rival brokers are
following similar strategies of helping to organize or forming
alliances with startup, Internet-based investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the beneficiaries of the trend are in San Francisco.
E-Offering has the backing of Menlo Park's E-Trade Group, the No. 2
online broker. And WR Hambrecht recently signed a deal to provide
IPO shares to the discount brokerage arm of Fidelity Investments,
the giant mutual fund company.  &LR;

AT ART MUSEUMS, LEARNING CAN BE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Three o'clock on a sunny Sunday afternoon and my
7-year-old twins, faces contorted, were hopping before a display
case of classic Maya pottery. ``Like this, Mom?'' Alexander
wondered, as he tried to imitate the victory dance of a Maya lord,
Bird Jaguar, depicted on a clay plate.
</P>
<P>
   To my delight, William and Alexander were in the pre-Columbian
galleries of the Denver Art Museum, learning about an ancient
people, how they lived and what they created. My sons were proving
that art museums are no longer fussy, austere vaults for fine art
and cultivated adults.
</P>
<P>
   At the Denver Art Museum, art is an educational adventure. This
museum leads a pack of art museums that are inventively and
aggressively seeking to educate those who enter their once hallowed
halls.
</P>
<P>
   With a wealth of activities competing for children's time, art
museums can no longer afford to intimidate. How can a museum of
fine art lure children, their future audience, away from computers
that talk back, videogames, laser tag, ski slopes and soccer
fields? A classroom lecture or curator tour clearly cannot match
up. Just as classroom teaching techniques are evolving, museum
education programs are becoming more interactive and engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Denver, families are not just shunted to some basement
filled with linoleum tables, glue, tissue paper and crayons.
Families with strollers and sometimes squealing children can be
found in once hushed galleries of Chinese porcelain or clay
Peruvian pots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Melora McDermott-Lewis, a museum educator here, started
a ``family backpack'' program that has been emulated in art museums
across the country. Nylon backpacks in vivid colors can be checked
out free on Saturdays, Sundays and during school breaks, just as my
boys did in their Mayan gallery visit.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, museum directors would have been pleased to see a
noisy family hike right back out of the museum. Today, this art
museum is happy to send backpackers to an upstairs gallery where
they unpack puzzles, mirrors, crayons, scissors, silver and gold
packets and squeeze bottles filled with a scent held dear to the
Mayans _ chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Children and adults piece together puzzles that mimic designs on
an intricate Navajo blanket or color their own paper versions of a
flashy headdress. In the process, the museum teaches its young
visitors the significance of design, form, iconography and, from
its own selfish view, that its galleries can be comfortable places
for learning.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's dean of education, Patterson B. Williams, said that
since the ``plain brown wrapper versions of galleries and
installations of 30 years ago, there has literally been a
revolution in exhibition design, lighting, seating and interactive
educational programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added, ``Our galleries are now places where people can
linger, hang around and actually do something, make something in
front of the works of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, art museums are setting aside millions of
dollars to educate not just their biggest audience, so-called
novice adults who know little about art, but also a new, previously
ignored audience: families with the kind of scrambling,
touch-everything toddlers and kinetically charged children that
museum directors used to prefer to see on playgrounds. The 1999
Association of Art Museum Directors Survey says that the nation's
top two art museums for education spending, the National Gallery of
Art in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
spent $5.8 million and and $5.7 million, respectively. The Denver
Art Museum was 24th on the list, spending $768,240.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Denver museum opened a new, livelier variation
of the old dusty, instructional basement, a Just for Fun Center on
its lower level. At five play stations, each featuring a world
culture from one of the museum's collections, children are
encouraged to explore, touch, erect and create the designs or
concepts presented in the upstairs galleries.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, 6-year-old Jade, in a burgundy velveteen
jumper, was flipping clamshells with the dexterity of a card shark.
She was playing a Japanese shell game similar to the card game
Memory, but the interiors of the white shells were embossed with
herons, dogs and delicate designs from the upstairs Japanese
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there are many adults who want to do something
with their kids that is `worthwhile,''' Williams said. ``We fit the
bill there. We are more worthwhile than Waterworld or an amusement
park. But we won't attract kids or their families during their
leisure time if all we are is worthwhile. We have to be worthwhile
and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time in history when we can talk on the phone while
driving, and carry our overscheduled agendas in the palms of our
hands, it is refreshing to see that art museums teach young and old
the value of taking time to contemplate the grace and novelty
around us.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott-Lewis said she knew the museum was doing something
right when a 6-year-old girl selected its galleries over Chuck E.
Cheese for her birthday celebration.

 EBay Links Up With Autotrader.com to Auction Used Vehicles Online  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Internet auction pioneer eBay yesterday invested in used car seller
AutoTrader.com, and the two companies have created a co-branded Web
site for auctioning used vehicles.
<P>
   For now, the new site, www.ebay-autotrader.com, lists only 2,100
used cars, for sale by their owners or by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Atlanta's AutoTrader.com has 1.5 million vehicles
listed for sale, and hopes ``to drive as many of our traditional
classified listings as possible into the auction style,'' said
AutoTrader.com chief executive Chip Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Although other online auto sellers, including Santa Clara's
AutoWeb.com, have launched used car auctions in the past year,
revenues have so far been small. Consumers are reluctant to bid on
vehicles that they have never seen, said Chris Denove, director of
auto analysis at market research firm J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Denove believes that eBay and AutoTrader.com may be able to
overcome consumers' fears with a combination of eBay's well-known
seller rating system and AutoTrader.com's large base of consumers
and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could ever make an online vehicle auction
successful, it would be the marriage between eBay and AutoTrader &QL; 
.com,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to introduce several measures _ third-party
inspections, warranties and escrow _ that will help assure car
buyers that they're not getting a lemon. As in eBay's current
Automotive category, shoppers can search for cars within a
geographical range or nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but eBay's
investment in AutoTrader.com will not amount to a majority stake,
according to Simon Rothman, head of eBay's Automotive division.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will share the site's revenue, which will come
primarily from fees: $25 for each vehicle listed and another $25
for each successful sale. EBay will run the site and provide
customer service, while AutoTrader.com will help car dealers use
the site.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrader.com's free classified ad service, its main way of
selling cars, is used by 40,000 dealers and 250,000 private sellers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of AutoTrader.com is held by Manheim Auctions, a
longtime player in the wholesale car auction industry. Another
investor is Automatic Data Processing, a company that provides back
office support for car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its online used car sales, AutoTrader.com is the
exclusive Web distributor of Auto Trader and AutoMart magazines.
</P>
<P>
   EBay began offering vehicle auctions a year ago, when it noticed
that members were selling cars in the Web site's ``Miscellaneous''
category. Since then, Automotive has been one of eBay's fastest
growing areas, both in number of participants and money spent, said
Rothman, who said eBay doesn't release specific figures about sales
in different categories.
</P>
<P>
   While more than a quarter of used car buyers do research on the
Internet, less than 2 percent of them actually find a car they want
to buy online, according to a recent J.D. Powers report. Within
that 2 percent, the group of customers who are willing to
participate in an online auction is even slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's AutoWeb.com and Autobytel.com, an online car
seller based in Irvine, operate mostly by referring car buyers to
local dealers. Both companies offer auctions which represent a
minor portion of their overall sales, according to company
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   AutoWeb.com lets dealers, but not consumers, auction used cars.
Jim Wolfe, the company's vice president in charge of marketing,
said that AutoWeb may offer consumer-to-consumer auctions one day,
but he feels that car buyers aren't ready for it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Delligatta, chief operating officer of Autobytel.com, agreed
that consumer-to-consumer auctions are an alternative that the
average consumer isn't ready to use. Autobytel.com debuted used car
auctions last fall, and has 4,000 used cars up for auction, both by
consumers and dealers.

 Intel Joins PC Giveaway  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The folks who design and manufacture the brains inside most PCs
will soon get a chance to take one home _ with all the fixings _
for free.
<P>
   Intel Corp. yesterday became the latest company to announce
plans to provide home PCs plus Internet access for its employees.
Ford started a similar program last month, and since then, both
Delta and American airlines have boarded the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's offer, however, is the sweetest yet. While the other
companies require employees to make monthly co-payments for
Internet service, the Santa Clara chipmaker's program includes
unlimited Internet access _ via high-speed cable or DSL connections
where available _ at no charge to its workers. If employees face
extra taxes on the new perk _ as they might in some locations _ the
company even plans to cover that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is also upping the ante in terms of hardware. The PCs it
will offer will feature a 667-megahertz Pentium III processor, 128
megabytes of memory, 32 megabytes of video RAM and a 20-gigabyte
hard drive. They'll come with a 17-inch monitor, a printer, a
bundle of ``productivity software'' and a video-conferencing camera
_ not to mention the employee's choice of one computer-connected
toy from the new Intel Play line.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have previously announced similar programs have
offered much more modest configurations. Delta even plans to charge
employees for a printer. Intel will charge only those of its
staffers who want a notebook PC instead a desktop model or a
flat-panel LCD screen instead of a conventional monitor.
</P>
<P>
   All regular full-time and part-time Intel employees _
currently, &LR; about 70,000 people in all _ will be eligible for the
program. About 8,000 of them work in the Bay Area, with another
40,000 or so located elsewhere in the United States. The rest are
scattered around the world, chiefly in Israel, Ireland, Malaysia,
the Philippines, China and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who leave the company will get to keep the hardware,
though they'll lose the free Internet service. Workers who stay
will be offered new machines about every three years, spokesman
Chuck Mulloy said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ford's free-PC initiative that inspired Intel, according
to Mulloy. ``When our HR folks read about it, some of them asked
`That's a neat idea _ why can't we do that?''' he said. ``The
answer is we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel is now soliciting bids from companies to supply the
hardware and the Internet service, he said. Employees should begin
receiving their systems in July, and the roll-out should be
complete by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and Delta contracted with PeoplePC, a San Francisco
company that offers consumers PCs and Internet access for $25 per
month, to manage their home-PC programs. American Airlines has not
yet disclosed who will service its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy said Intel has no data about how many of its workers
already have PCs at home. For those who do, Intel will set up a
program to facilitate donations _ of either the old system or the
new one _ to schools or nonprofit organizations.

 _ SF CHRON   How Much VC You Need And How to Get It 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: Can you offer any tips on how to figure how much venture capital
you need, how to get it and what to give up for it?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: We took your three tough questions to the ``Alley to the
Valley'' conference in San Francisco earlier this week, where 28
e-commerce companies from New York's flourishing ``Silicon Alley''
made pitches to Silicon Valley financiers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such conference and vividly illustrates that
good ideas and money flow easily across state lines. New York City
has more than 3,800 software and information technology companies,
up nearly 50 percent in two years, and most have tapped venture
capital companies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   David Gray, CEO of Wizeup.com, a New York company marketing
electronic versions of college textbooks via the Web, says it is
essential to ``know your market and do thorough financial
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   In his case, that meant studying the college textbook market,
finding books used in classes with at least 150 students and
verifying that a minimum of 35 percent of them would switch to
digital versions if given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching your company takes as much energy and enthusiasm as
running for elected office although you need to go beyond sound
bites and not just bad-mouth your competitors. Gray, who visited a
lot of venture and angel investor forums, was initially turned down
by about 20 potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear `no' a lot, especially in the venture capital
community,'' Gray recalls. ``You have to be able to handle
rejection. At the end of the day, you have to believe in yourself
and your vision. And every day, you have to be willing to scratch,
claw and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   After his early difficulties attracting investors, Gray narrowed
his focus and went after investors who understood his company's
mission and might be interested in partnering with him.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first $500,000 seed capital in mid-1998 from a
Michigan holding company with a publishing arm. Then, last June, he
got $2 million in second-round financing from Enigma Systems, a
Boston company that produces online manuals for jet engine
manufacturers and was interested in expanding its market through a
strategic partnership with Wizeup.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gray is searching for $12 million and has lined up some VC
investors. He also hired a consultant with a good track record as a
financial matchmaker so that he can spend most of his time building
his company. Gray is paying the consultant both cash and stock in
Wizeup.
</P>
<P>
   There is no magic formula on how much ownership to give up for
how much money. ``You have to give up enough to make the investor
feel the risk does not outweigh the potential reward,'' Gray
advises. ``Private equity investors often look for a 10-times
return on their investment over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Millard, head of investment banking for Prudential
Securities Inc., suggests, ``It's always better to own a smaller
percentage of a very large pie than 100 percent of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other financiers also believe it is often best to ``give
up some valuation'' to find the right partner. That means joining
forces with those who have great contacts and credibility and who
you will enjoy working with even if it means getting less money or
retaining a smaller ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond having a brilliant idea, Millard said it is essential
that entrepreneurs explain very clearly just how they are going to
be profitable. That requires careful analysis of the size of the
market and how much money, how many people and how long it will
take to capture a specific part of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get in the door of a VC firm, Millard suggests
asking yourself two key questions: Are you the right person to do
the knocking? Are their flaws in your business plan?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Ellman, a partner of former American Express CEO James
Robinson at RRE Ventures in New York, advises raising ``as much as
it takes to get you to the next significant valuation event.''
</P>
<P>
   That might mean $500,000 to $2 million in seed capital from
angel investors to turn a business plan into a ``beta'' test
program and proving the concept with a couple of customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the next round, when venture capital investors might put in
$5 million to $15 million to build the company, Ellman said
entrepreneurs must typically part with a 20 percent to 33 percent
stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends contacting potential financiers through a source
they already know and taking money from those who can be most
helpful to you.
</P>
<P>
   Your financial partners should understand your market, have
experience building companies similar to yours and help you create
strategic alliances. Also make sure the personal chemistry is
correct since you'll be spending a lot of time together.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of sources of information on VCs and startups.
Ellman's favorites include Red Herring, Upside, Business 2.0,
Industry Standard and AlleyCat News, which sponsored this week's
``Alley to the Valley'' conference.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUBPOENAS FIGHT CARD FROM THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney's office has
subpoenaed the records of the New York State Athletic Commission
for the Feb. 26 boxing show at Madison Square Garden, according to
Scott Trent, a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Trent said he did not know why the district attorney's office
was interested in the commission's records from the fight, but all
of the records were turned over without a challenge from the
commission. The district attorney's office would not comment on why
it wanted the records.
</P>
<P>
   The card, which was headlined by a bout between Oscar De La Hoya
and Derrell Coley, was noteworthy because of the enormous amount of
weight gained by Arturo Gatti in the 28 hours between the weigh-in
on Friday afternoon and the time he stepped into the ring against
Joey Gamache on Saturday night. Gatti weighed in at 141 pounds. But
on the night of the fight he weighed 160 pounds, according to an
unofficial weigh-in conducted by Home Box Office, which broadcasted
the bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti knocked out Gamache in the second round, and, according to
Gamache's manager, Johnny Bos, the fighter suffered a severe
concussion. He was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The records turned over to the district attorney's office show
the official weights of the bout to be 141 pounds for Gatti and
140-3/4 pounds for Gamache. Bos said he believes Gatti was
overweight at the weigh-in. He suspects that Gatti was close to 148
or 150 pounds.

 &HT;    GORE TAKES COMMAND OF DEMOCRATIC RACE
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore took command of the
Democratic presidential race Tuesday, apparently sweeping to
lopsided victories in states from coast to coast and forcing Bill
Bradley to assess whether to continue his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore immediately pivoted to a general election strategy,
planning trips in the coming days that target the independent
voters that were attracted to GOP upstart John McCain and Hispanic
voters that are crucial to a general election victory in key
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is full tonight,'' Gore declared in a victory speech
that not only rallied Democrats but urged independents to ``join us
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also saluted Bradley, calling him a ``good man,'' adding,
``Anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign has
come away from the experience moved and touched by the strength of
his commitment to healing the divisions in our country, especially
divisions based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore won every core Democratic constituency in what is likely to
be his last face-to-face contest with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered in New York to await the final results of the voting,
Bradley supporters grumbled about ``entrenched power'' supporting
the vice president. But according to network television polls, Gore
also won African Americans, Jews, Hispanics, gays, labor and women,
all key elements of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's support came almost exclusively from anti-Clinton
Democrats, not a large constituency in a party that, despite the
impeachment of President Clinton, has presided over the longest
economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories in the largest primary voting of the year
reflected a remarkable comeback from the days last summer when his
campaign was viewed as weak and ineffective in the face of a
surprisingly strong challenge from Bradley and the popularity of
the relatively unknown George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But a disciplined and energetic Gore powered past Bradley on
Tuesday. And in a poll published Tuesday by the Wall Street
Journal, Gore erased the double digit lead Bush had on him last
summer. The latest Wall Street Journal poll shows the two in a
46-46 percent tie with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his family joined hundreds of fellow Tennesseans at a
downtown Nashville hotel to celebrate one of the biggest victories
of his 24-year career in politics, one that brings him a step
closer to the nomination he first sought in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore registered convincing margins of victory in New York,
Georgia and Ohio, three of the most important states in the
so-called Super Tuesday primary. He also rolled up victories in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, Maine and Missouri,
Bradley's native state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, polls showed him leading in California, the largest
of the 15 states that held Democratic primaries Tuesday and the one
state critical to his strategy for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley absorbed Tuesday's crushing returns in a hotel room in
New York City, the place where he once reigned as one of the
nation's greatest basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Glum supporters, including some of Bradley's former NBA
teammates from his days with the New York Knicks, gathered at the
Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers to offer their support to the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said the campaign would issue
a statement Wednesday announcing the candidate's schedule for
Thursday and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate himself planned to spend Wednesday at home in New
Jersey, and was declining all media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Before the election returns came in, Bradley had clung to slim
hopes that a handful of victories in the New England could sustain
his candidacy and perhaps give him enough life to continue on to
the March 14 primary balloting.
</P>
<P>
   But it became clear early in the evening that those hopes would
be dashed. The vice president carried all the New England states
handily. Bradley even lost in his native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his uphill campaign against Gore in December
1998. Others considered the race, but calculated that a sitting
vice president would be too difficult to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scored early success in the fund-raising arena, raising
almost as much money as Gore and threatening the vice president
with positive poll numbers in New Hampshire, site of the nation's
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to be a candidate of ``big ideas,'' Bradley ran on a
plan to provide health insurance to the nation's poor, enact
stricter gun control and replace the campaign finance laws with a
system of public financing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley invested heavily in Iowa and lost. The defeat,
coupled with Sen. John McCain's maverick appeal, contributed to
Bradley's loss in New Hampshire. From then on, Bradley found it
difficult to regain his footing in a national media environment
where all the focus was on McCain and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of this is that we had an extraordinarily hard
task in front of us,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications
director. ``We knew it would not be easy.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Independent Game Developers Look for the Perfect Pitch  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Daniel Lucas usually gets his phone calls returned because of one
word: Tetris.
<P>
   For the past three years his company, Blue Planet Software, has
made or licensed a half-dozen video-console and PC games based on
the addictive, falling-block puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to original titles, executives at the San
Francisco firm fight a battle not unlike an independent filmmaker
trying to woo a major studio. They cajole, beg, wheedle _ whatever
you want to call it _ the large publishers who actually distribute
and market most game titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels between our business and the movie business are
striking,'' said Lucas, Blue Planet's vice president of
development. ``There's a million ideas out there, but you try to
pitch one, and no one wants to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Planet has already shown its latest work-in-progress,
code-named Genesis, to liaisons _ who often act as gatekeepers _ at
three or four publishers. At this week's Game Developers Conference
in San Jose, the company will pitch the game to a couple of
publishers' marketing and sales teams in the hopes of working out a
deal by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is a chance for developers _ about 10,000 strong
this year _ to network with one another, check out the newest in
hardware and software and rub elbows with some of the biggest names
in the business including Sony, Sega and Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   A less well-known facet of the conference, but one important to
the tiniest developers, is the second annual Independent Games
Festival. Much like the film industry's Sundance Film Festival, the
festival is designed specifically to help small shops gain the
attention of a publisher _ an increasingly difficult task as
publishers consolidate and the cost of games skyrockets.
</P>
<P>
   With consumers expected to spend an estimated $7 billion this
year on computer and video games _ more than on movie tickets _ the
industry is ramping up for an unprecedented period of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But one important link within the chain won't necessarily share
in the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party game developers, the small companies that originate
ideas, must land a contract with a deep-pocketed publisher _ like
Redwood City's Electronic Arts _ to cover the multimillion-dollar
expense of actually getting the game to market.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas small firms brainstorm an idea, draw conceptuals and
construct a rough version of a game, most often it's the publisher
who picks up the tab for creating the final version, plus
advertising, manufacturing, packaging and distribution _ costs that
can run into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   The outside developer usually gets its costs covered and
royalties from game sales. But only about 100 of the roughly 1,500
games that premiered last year were profitable. And only a handful
reached the stratospheric sales _ 800,000 or 1 million units _ to
land them on mainstream magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, it's no wonder publishers want to make
sure the next title they scoop up from an external developer has at
least a chance of becoming the next Tomb Raider, the popular
Indiana Jones-like game starring the buxom Lara Croft.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to get the ball rolling, a small developer usually
has to create a workable version of the game to show a publisher.
Such a prototype can be a costly and time-consuming proposition _
especially when the newest PCs and consoles require more work and
larger teams to take advantage of their cutting-edge capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to survive in today's market on your
own,'' said Ben Rinaldi, senior editor at GameWeek Magazine. An
independent developer needs ``not just the funding but the
technology and experience that comes from being part of a bigger
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Seed, a third-person adventure game from San Mateo's Human Soft,
is among nine titles vying for prizes and publicity at the
Independent Games Festival. Human Soft, which incorporates a unique
feature _ real-time shadows _ into Seed's plot, was a finalist last
year as well.
</P>
<P>
   But with little experience developing for consoles, Human Soft
has had a hard time landing a publisher. Consoles like Sega's
Dreamcast and Sony's PlayStation are commanding more and more of
the game market. And although Human Soft has had eight titles
published for the PC, it hasn't had a major hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldi says an external developer typically faces three
scenarios: if successful, it's mostly likely purchased or it signs
a long-term contract with a big publisher. If unsuccessful, often
it folds.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those options can be a hard pill to swallow for a small
game outfit _ usually a band of independent-minded artists and
programmers who relish work outside a corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most would jump at the chance to sign a lucrative deal
with the Activisions or Sonys of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, San Rafael developer Andrew Leker sold his strategy
game Resurrection to Japan's Sega and got a job further developing
the game at the U.S. headquarters of the maker of Sonic the
Hedgehog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' he said. ``I don't have to spend 30 to 40
percent of my time trying to market my game to publishers. And I
don't have to sweat getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any hard figures on the number of small game
developers out there _ mainly because so many are two- or
three-person operations in basements across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But it's safe to say that even if they forge a publishing deal
and remain independent, many won't recoup more than their costs
after 18 months of grueling hours completing a title _ setting them
up for another hardscrabble fight to fund another game.
</P>
<P>
   Developers' royalties, or a piece of the game's sales, vary
considerably and depend on the platform, how much work the
developer does, and whether they own the license to the game. Blue
Planet's Lucas says it ranges between 10 and 30 percent. But often
those royalties don't kick in until after the publisher has made
back its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more common actually not to make a profit,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders draw parallels between the gaming and recording
industries. Publishers or record labels fork over the big bucks to
fund a project; but they also reap the most rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts spokesman Jeff Brown admits commercial potential
is among the top factors when considering an outside game. But
there are other criteria: the team behind the title, their track
record and the potential for multiplayer or online gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also at a point in this industry when the demographics
are getting much broader to include women and older people, so
we're looking for titles that will help us continue that trend,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   When independent firms dream, it's often of one of the
industry's best-known Cinderella stories: Cyan Inc. The four-person
Washington firm, known mainly for edu-tainment titles, created
Myst, one of the first adult-oriented adventure games, in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Infused with groundbreaking graphics and a ``submersive''
environment, Myst catapulted Cyan and its publisher, Broderbund,
into the limelight and inspired a whole generation of indie
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a milestone in the industry,'' said Michael
Arrington, director of software research at Jon Peddie Associates,
a Mill Valley firm that tracks digital media. ``It was the first
big indie game and it established how (developers and publishers)
worked together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyan, run by brothers Robyn and Rand Miller, forged a deal with
Novato's Broderbund (now a unit of toy giant Mattel) to publish
Myst for the PC and Macintosh. Since it was released in November
1993, it has become the most popular PC title of all time, selling
about 7 million units and raking in $146 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even Myst had its doubters in the beginning. Cyan shopped
the title around for about a year before it signed on with
Broderbund. Cyan officials say several publishers turned it down
largely because the market for such a plot-driven game hadn't been
proven.
</P>
<P>
   In Myst, and its successor Riven, the player must determine _
through a series of fantasy-world puzzles _ which of two brothers
is the good guy and which is the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were presenting a game heavily centered on a story, and
that took a little bit of time for publishers to grapple with,''
said Chris Brandkamp, Cyan's vice president of licensing and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Planet would be ecstatic if Genesis attracts a fraction of
Myst's audience.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company estimates it has spent three or four months
and about $150,000 on the strategy game, which pits city against
country. It needs another year to 18 months and several million
dollars to finalize it _ which is why the company needs to find a
well-funded publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In Genesis, players plant ``seeds'' _ gray representing city and
green representing country _ in a particular area. The player who
first controls 50 percent of a zone _ either with skyscrapers or
forests, wins. Blue Planet officials are optimistic that they'll
find a publisher in coming months and subsequently reduce their
financial reliance on the Tetris franchise, which accounts for more
than 90 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   But they know what failure tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Blue Planet scrapped a fantasy, role-playing
game called Black Onyx after searching for a publisher for about a
year. Sketches of medieval-style weapons, costumes and characters
still cover a few walls at the company's Geary Street headquarters.
Ironically, those offices housed a now-defunct game company called
Velocity before Blue Planet moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas guesses that Blue Planet sank a year, and hundreds of
thousands of dollars, into Black Onyx.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he understands why publishers are so picky. In a previous
life, he reviewed game pitches for Alameda's Microprose, now a
Hasbro brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get hundreds of pitches a year ... it's really hard,'' he
said.

MCCAIN CONTINUES ON HIS OWN UNIQUE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the beginning, it was much simpler,
stripped-down, fun.
</P>
<P>
   All over New Hampshire, people knew what Senator John McCain
stood for, and it wasn't about ideology or policy or legislation.
Voters said the same thing over and over again. He is honest. He is
brave. He has integrity. He has my vote.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform? Very important, they all said. But more
important that he has the guts to take it on.
</P>
<P>
   More than a hundred town hall meetings in New Hampshire and
McCain had shaken hands and given that rigid two-thumbs-up to a
huge swath of the state's voters. They had seen him for themselves,
squeezed his shoulder, gotten the wink.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, there have been vast tracts of ground to
cover, and McCain hasn't been able to get to as many people as he
would like to make them his. Forced to rely on less old-fashioned
politics -- on television, where money counts for more, and where
he can be stiff and awkward, more distant from the crowds from whom
he draws his energy and focus, he has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   That glorious night in New Hampshire, McCain so awed by his own
achievement that he was almost subdued, seems long ago now, indeed.
Back then, it seemed his media strategist was right when he said
``inevitability died in the snows of New Hampshire tonight.'' Now
the snow has melted and after five weeks of tumultous campaigning,
things seem much the same as they were before his campaign took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful symbols and inside jokes were born in the months
leading up to his spectacular New Hampshire victory, and they
helped sustain the campaign in the states beyond.
</P>
<P>
   There was the bus, of course. In the last month, awe-struck fans
started climbing aboard it at rallies to snap pictures by his red
swivel seat, though McCain was nowhere near it. A state trooper
pulled it over in South Carolina, jeopardizing his job because he
thought the senator might be on board, and he wanted to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   The one-liners had traveled almost as many miles as the Straight
Talk Express. The ``I want Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians,
Vegetarians'' line pawned a legion of wiseacre signs at rallies.
Ones that said ``Vegetarians for John McCain'' appeared first. By
Tuesday, the vegetarians were joined by Ukranians, Hippies,
Omnivores and Carnivores.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has taken great pleasure in pointing them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, `Soccer Moms for McCain,' McCain said at a rally
in San Diego Monday. ``Up in Santa Clara this morning we had
`Carnivores for McCain.' In Cleveland we had `Ukranians for
McCain.' I'm telling ya,'' he said, laughing, ``We are assembling a
coalition never seen before in the history of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has been McCain's greatest strength, and one of
his biggest weaknesses. Texas Governor George W. Bush has tried to
make the Senator's broad appeal his liability. McCain's relative
weakness among Republican voters in most states has vindicated the
governor. And, then another funny sign appeared, saying something
that in an ordinary campaign, should have been a given:
``Republicans for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of his campaign before Tuesday's primaries,
McCain, the kind of man who absorbs a blow and barrels forward, was
unusally reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back, I wish I hadn't done so many things, but I'm
glad I did so many other things. Come on, you can't complain and
you can't explain. If you do, you diminish what you tried to do.
I'm happy. I'm the three percent guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He did allow that there have been other mistakes. Maybe the
joking comment about Robertson and Falwell being evil. Maybe his
comment to a California newspaper saying he would be unlikely to
repeal Roe v Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much would it have to do with my flip remark about evil?''
he ventured. ``How much would it have to do with my statements to
the San Francisco Chronicle? How much has to do with all the
idiotic things I've said in this campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't going to let those things drive him crazy. He
hadn't gotten this far, in his life and in this campaign, by
dwelling on things. He had battles to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, with two friends of Bush buying $2.5 million worth
of advertising to criticize McCain's environmental record, the
senator seemed to be seething at times, his usually clenched jaw
grinding away as he answered reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain took something from that latest onslaught: a new
focus, he said. See? he told audiences everywhere he went. Those
advertisments are exactly why he wants campaign finance reform.
McCain said Bush had handed his signature issue back to him.
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite the noble, anti-establishment message that had
so inspired New Hampshire's voters, but McCain seemed pleased at
least to be able to speak to his signature issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides, who over the weekend seemed angry and dejected at
the advertising that may have been their death knell, were at peace
Tuesday. They were proud of what they had done, and, before the
final results came in, were looking forward to primaries in
Colorado, Illinois and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be prouder of what John and the campaign
accomplished today and in the future'' political director John
Weaver said. ``We struck a chord with the American people. There's
a hunger in the country for someone like him.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain, whose comments on Bush have grown ever more venomous
this week does not seem like the kind of man who will easily go
back to the bosom of the establishment and stand beside Bush if he
is the nominee, he is also not the kind of man to dwell on his
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   On his bus in central California last week, while he was in the
throes of several controversies, and on hold with a radio
interviewer about to grill him for a long time about his views on
abortion, McCain was surrounded by reporters, heads down, furiously
scribbling in their notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plum trees!'' he said to them, pointing out the window as the
rows of blossom-covered trees rushed by. ``You're missing a lot of
plum trees out there, and they're all blossoming. Millions of
'em.''

 &HT;    Mavericks have left their mark
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the beefs the experts had with so many states
voting early was that it would overshadow the early primaries and
settle the party nominations before there could really be a race.
That didn't come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   This year's early contests, punctuated by the Republican
primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina, produced a
nomination race that was sharp-elbowed and intense, if it was short
and a mismatch, moneywise. While the Democratic race hasn't been as
scintillating, it still was a spirited competition in which Vice
President Al Gore _ outspent by his challenger, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley _ was forced to step up his game to ensure what
could have been a perfunctory endorsement by his party.
</P>
<P>
   The other complaint about the front-loaded primary system was
that it would give the nation two nominees very early, guaranteeing
a long general election campaign with enough time for both
candidates to get in a lot of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of that prediction fell into place Tuesday night,
as the two front-runners piled on big victories that made their
nominations inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not been entirely clear about how long he will go on,
but it's safe to say that the longest general election campaign in
memory has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Outright regional bias might be a thing of the past like, say,
bans on interracial dating. But some voters who have had their fill
of Bill Clinton and a host of Southern Republicans in Congress do
express a preference for a non-Southerner, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to get the South entirely out of the political
equation. This will be a race between the Southerner gone north _
the son of Tennessee raised in a Washington hotel _ vs. the
Northerner come South _ a Connecticut senator's grandson brought up
in the oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   These are two candidates who both express a passionate interest
in education issues and how to launch a nation of students into the
coming century. Yet the educational institution that has been the
focal point of the most heated debate in the nominating process has
been a Bible college in upstate South Carolina with the prosaic
name of Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   More has been said in presidential debates this year about
whether the Confederate flag should fly over Southern statehouses
than whether the nation should launch a Mars exploration effort in
the next decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and religious intolerance are still burning issues, and
Bob Jones U. and the Confederate battle flag are still powerful
symbols. Yet at some point, voters elsewhere in the country are
bound to wonder when the preoccupations of this campaign year catch
up with what concerns them most directly.
</P>
<P>
   This past week has seen some spectacular milestones in
moderation. There was the Rev. Jerry Falwell on television Sunday,
declaring he didn't think Bill Clinton was a murderer and never had
thought so. There was the president of BJU, announcing there really
wasn't anything in the Bible that prohibited interracial dating,
and the ban was a bother, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   These may seem like small things, but no one dreamed they would
see the like before McCain made the religious right, which had
already targeted him, an issue. Small social progress was not
accompanied by success at the polls, and McCain on Tuesday met the
fate of a maverick in a party that has come to see itself as the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues McCain set in motion in the Republican primaries
are likely to roll through this long general election campaign.
McCain promised he would beat Gore like a drum, but in the vice
president's rhetoric over the next few months he may hear the
echoes of his own campaign themes.

ANALYSIS: 2 VICTORS, REDEFINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Strengthens lead by making clear how the primary campaigns
altered the political outlook and the public perceptions of the
probable nominees) 
(With ELN-RDP) 
(jt) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year of remarkable political tumult, one party ended up
where it started Tuesday, with the nominee it had expected to have
all along, but the other found its unity compromised and its
probable nominee weakened by weeks of heavy-duty infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who began as a seeming shoo-in for the
Democratic presidential nomination, survived a patch so shaky that
even some of his staff members made fun of him. He moved his
headquarters to Nashville from Washington, to more derisive
catcalls, and pulled his ragged operation together with
considerable skill.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in the closest approximation the nation has ever had
to a national primary, he utterly humiliated his rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who had looked for a time last year
like the freshest of political faces. Bradley lost on the Atlantic
Coast, on the Pacific Coast and in between _ even in Missouri,
where he grew up, and in New York, where he won fame and fortune
playing basketball for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bravura performance by the vice president, if no longer
surprising in view of the near-collapse of Bradley's campaign in
recent weeks, and it positioned him well for the battle against the
eventual Republican nominee this fall, although perhaps situated
somewhat farther to the left on some key issues than he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Even on health care, which Bradley had made his signature issue,
most voters said they thought Gore had outlined a better plan.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas moved much
closer to the presidential nomination, defeating or contending
closely with Sen. John McCain of Arizona everywhere but New
England, a region as out of step with the rest of the country in
2000 as the South was a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   What came before Tuesday was mere skirmishing, in the long view.
If not McCain's Appomattox, the Super Tuesday voting seemed likely
to prove his Gettysburg. The wide lead seized by Bush in the
delegate count gave him a commanding position at the campaign's
most significant moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the governor can look forward with confidence to a day, next
Tuesday, when his own state as well as Florida, where his brother,
Jeb, is the governor, choose their delegates. As they were in
Tuesday's Republican primary and caucus voting in 13 states, the
numbers at stake will be significant: Texas is the nation's
second-largest state and Florida is the fourth-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also began the campaign as a heavy favorite. But he
suffered serious setbacks in New Hampshire and Michigan as McCain
mounted an unexpectedly potent insurgency, and he veered sharply to
the right in South Carolina in a successful effort to head off the
Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush, who had originally presented himself as a
candidate who could appeal to all voters, regardless of party,
found himself redefined as a Republican partisan with little
backing among Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans _
without whom he would have little chance in November.
</P>
<P>
   Again in Tuesday's balloting, Republicans voted heavily for Bush
while Democrats and independents voted for McCain. The pattern was
much the same as in each test since New Hampshire: who won in many
states depended heavily on the proportion of independents and
Democrats in the electorate. The more there were (as in
Massachusetts) the better McCain did; the fewer there were (as in
Ohio), the worse.
</P>
<P>
   If, as now seems highly likely, Bush moves on to win the
nomination, he will have to find a way to remedy this problem. He
has tried hard since South Carolina, without success; his senior
advisers are already deep in discussions about fresh notions of how
to renew his appeal to voters in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, most politicians believe, emerged from the campaign a
weaker candidate than he began it, scuffed by McCain's attacks, and
with a party badly split between conservatives and moderates. Gore
emerged as a stronger, more vivid campaigner, with a relatively
united party.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign for Bush came among Roman Catholics. McCain
sharply criticized leaders of the Republican right in a speech in
Virginia late last month, hoping, aides said, that Catholics and
others in Northern states who resent Christian conservatives would
rally to him. But according to exit polls in Missouri and Ohio, in
each of which Catholics accounted for a quarter of the electorate,
Bush received half their votes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept intact a political pattern that went largely unnoticed
in the weeks when his reputation waned, then waxed once more. No
sitting vice president since World War II who sought the
presidential nomination has failed to gain it, except for Alben W.
Barkley of Kentucky, Harry Truman's number 2, who attracted little
support in 1952, largely, it was said, because of his age. He was
then 74.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will no doubt be considered the favorite at first,
especially considering the blood-letting that has taken place in
the Republican primaries for the third campaign running, Gore faces
problems of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor, President Clinton, he has put tremendous effort
into courting the voters of California, and he has built a strong
following there. But in Tuesday's so-called beauty contest in the
Golden State, there was a small note of warning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley together polled considerably fewer votes than
Bush and McCain together. That may have resulted in part from the
fact that the Republican campaign was the more gripping one, but it
also suggested that Gore has work to do.

DARTMOUTH STUDENTS SUPPORTED IN ENTRAPMENT CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teaching assistants in the class of Rex Dwyer, Dartmouth
College's embattled visiting computer science professor, Tuesday
backed students in charging him with entrapping them in one of the
Ivy League's worst cheating scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, a North Carolina State College professor on sabbatical,
has accused 78 students in his introductory computer science class
of cheating on a homework assignment by downloading answers he
placed on an unsecured Web site. Students, however, believe Dwyer
put them there so students would find them, essentially setting
them up for a fall because the class was consistently disrespectful
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the college begins hearing the alleged cheating cases
this week, Dwyer's main teaching assistant and students who graded
tests and other assignments in the class describe the professor as
disorganized, vengeful, and out to get the unruly students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very angry at the class, and at the time he appeared to
take quite a bit of pride in catching everyone,'' wrote David
Wagner, the lead teaching assistant in the class of 178 students,
in an e-mail to The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview before attending the first student hearings
Tuesday, Dwyer defended both his teaching methods and the integrity
of his accusations against the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been personally very painful to me,'' Dwyer said. ``I
guess I wanted to get away from here at the end of the semester.
But I certainly didn't want to find out everyone was cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues at North Carolina State also vouched for Dwyer's
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be really surprised if he tried to entrap the kids,''
said Alan L. Tharp, chair of the computer science department at
North Carolina State in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cousins, director of the North Carolina State's office of
student conduct, said he has only heard praise for Dwyer's
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any concerns with professor Dwyer's ability to do
the right thing,'' Cousins said.
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth, where Dwyer taught two courses as a visiting
professor this term, administrators said they would reserve
judgment on the scandal until after the accused students are given
a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But in e-mails and telephone conversations, four of Dwyer's 12
assistants said the cheating charges are unfair and they're
relieved the professor resigned from teaching two computer science
courses at Dartmouth. The other eight assistants did not respond to
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, the lead teaching assistant, said he initially got along
well with Dwyer, who presided over a class where students felt free
to pass around pornographic magazines, read newspapers during
class, and jeer at him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early February, Wagner's opinion of Dwyer changed, he
said. Before the professor disclosed to the class that some
students stole the solution to homework assignment No. 4 off an
unencrypted Web site, he told the teaching assistants that he had
uncovered cheating in the class and threatened them with
disciplinary action if they didn't keep the secret, Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this was, in part, getting back at the class for
their ongoing unruliness and lack of respect towards him,'' Wagner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Wagner went public with his concerns to the campus
newspaper, he said Dwyer sought revenge, e-mailing prominent
faculty members, including the teaching assistant's advisor,
telling them Wagner's performance in the classroom was poor.
</P>
<P>
   But other assistants backed Wagner and questioned Dwyer's
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, students should not have done some of the things they
did,'' said Richard M. Adams Jr., an undergraduate teaching
assistant, ``but the fact that he left the information public,
didn't specifically outlaw such actions, coupled with the fact that
the class was so poorly taught'' was ``ridiculous'' and seemed to
invite students to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Lubna Ammar, another undergraduate who helped Dwyer by grading
assignments, agreed that something was very askew in Computer
Science 4. ``I think the point is he left it up on the Web site,''
she said. ``It's like leaving the answers on the board during a
test. And this wasn't even a test; it was a homework.''
</P>
<P>
   To Sam Desai, another teaching assistant, it's simple: the
professor was striking back at disrespectful students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely agree with the students,'' he said. ``The
animosity just reached that point. So he set them up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dwyer, who resorted to ringing a Tibetan prayer bell to get
the rowdy class's attention, the accusations of entrapment on top
of what he says was blatant cheating on the students' part adds
insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disheartening, and not anything I wanted to be
involved in,'' said Dwyer, adding that he has been sent threatening
e-mails by Dartmouth students. ``It's the last thing I wanted out
of my sabbatacial. There's not an academic who would want to deal
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm not the most popular guy on campus, and most of
the students I see don't acknowledge me. I was a sort of nonentity
before and a nonentity now.''
</P>
<P>
   While he agreed that the assignment may have been above his
students' education level, he rejects the idea that it was an
excuse for for many of them to take answers off the class' Web
site, which he left unprotected for two days after showing it to
students in class.
</P>
<P>
   He said two hours after class on February 2, at least 20
students had already downloaded the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many just decided they wanted to cheat and not do any work,''
Dwyer said. ``And that's what's most offensive about this. These
were not students who ran into trouble. They just decided they
didn't want to do the assignment, they wanted to steal it.''

MICROSOFT QUITS TRADE GROUP AFTER DISPUTE OVER ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. quit the nation's oldest and largest software
industry trade association Tuesday after a long-running dispute
over the group's support for the government in the Microsoft
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly
known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice
Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal
computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because
the company believed that the software trade association had become
totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on
other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked
directly against Microsoft on competition issues.'' But, he said,
``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some
other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made
sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of
disagreement.'' Herbold, a member of the association's board, added
that Microsoft had come to believe that was no longer true.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery reply, Ken Wasch, the group's president, said that by
quitting, ``Microsoft has again proven that their tactics resemble
that of a schoolyard bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade group's board voted two years ago to support the
government in the antitrust case, Wasch said its relationship with
Microsoft had been ``a difficult one, much like the U.S.
relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter of resignation, Herbold said the group was
increasingly ineffective and that its membership was ``sagging.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasch replied that the Software and Information Industry
Association was ``thriving.'' Microsoft paid membership fees of
$125,000 a year. The trade group's annual budget is about $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock jumped more than 5 percent at one point
Tuesday after a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst, Rick Sherlund,
released a research memo suggesting that settlement talks with the
government in the antitrust case ``may be heating up.'' The stock
price fell back to $92.875, an increase of 2.48 percent, by the
close of the regular trading day.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of the antitrust suit has pushed Microsoft's share
price down 25 percent from its 52-week high in recent weeks despite
the introduction of its Windows 2000 operating system in February.

GOP PLAN AIMS TO DRAW MORE TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Senate's Republican leaders proposed a plan
Tuesday to ease the looming teacher shortage in New York state that
seeks to provide salary bonuses, scholarships and other financial
incentives to draw teachers to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is similar to one that Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, proposed earlier this year. It received a warm
reception from the Democratic leaders of the Assembly, increasing
the likelihood that it will pass in one form or another during the
current legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Senate plan calls for providing cash grants to
college students who agree to teach for four years in public
schools that are facing a particularly severe shortage of teachers.
That program would provide each of those students $3,400 annually
for four years to help them repay college loans or to supplement
their income.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also calls for creating a tuition assistance
program to help the state's 11,500 uncertified teachers cover the
costs of college courses they must complete to become fully
licensed teachers. That program would provide uncertified teachers
up to $2,000 each to complete their required course work.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the two initiatives would cost the state about
$25 million a year, and would help it attract more than 50,000 new
teachers into the public school system over the next 10 years,
according to Senate officials.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes as New York City faces the worst teacher
shortage in its history. The city's public school system is
expected to lose more than half of its 78,000 teachers over the
next five years as an unusually high number of them, 54,000, reach
age 55 and become eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader, urged adoption of
the measure, saying the state stands to lose many of its most
experienced teachers. ``We all recognize that there is a crisis in
New York with the teacher shortage,'' he said. ``What we're talking
about is bringing teachers back into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is not the only state grappling with a potential
shortage of teachers. From Massachusetts to Texas to California,
officials are offering a host of financial incentives to woo
prospective teachers into the public schools and to keep good ones
from fleeing to other states or professions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal received tempered support from the
governor's office. ``We are pleased the Senate's plan reflects the
governor's priorities,'' said Charles Deister, a spokesman for
Pataki. ``But as for the details of their plan, we'll have to take
a look at it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the plan drew greater enthusiasm among Democratic leaders of
the Assembly, who said they intended to release their own plan to
address the teacher shortage. ``The speaker is committed to
education,'' said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Sheldon Silver,
the Assembly speaker. ``Obviously, teacher recruitment and
retention is an important component of any plan that addresses
education in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key provision of the Senate plan would eliminate the
penalties that many retired teachers now face if they return to
work. Under current state law, retirees lose $1 of their pension
benefits for every $1 they earn beyond $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal would allow retired teachers to return to
the schools without giving up any of their retirement benefits, at
no cost to the state. The legislation is intended to deal with a
longstanding policy that critics say discourages teachers from
continuing to work after they reach normal retirement age and begin
drawing pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also calls for providing an annual bonus of
$10,000 to experienced teachers who agree to teach in
low-performing schools. To qualify for the bonus, a teacher must be
certified under a series of national standards that are more
rigorous than the state's standards. Republican Senate leaders said
the purpose of the program was to ensure that relatively new
teachers in those schools had experienced colleagues to advise
them. That program is expected to cost the state $10 million a year
and benefit about 1,000 teachers annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would also give teachers five years to earn the
master's degree needed in New York to complete certification
requirements. If approved, the measure would effectively scrap a
proposal by state education officials to reduce to two years the
time teachers are given to earn the degree. Leaders in the Senate
contend that the education officials' proposal would aggravate the
teacher shortage in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan embraces a key element in Pataki's proposal:
encouraging college students to perform volunteer work in the
state's struggling inner-city schools, like tutoring children
enrolled in summer programs. In return, the college students would
earn college credits.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan drew praise from the powerful teachers' union,
New York State United Teachers, a group with considerable political
clout in the Capitol, as well as from Richard P. Mills, the state's
commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate proposal would be an important step in helping
bring teachers to the areas of the state that need them the most,''
Mills said. ``The proposal has come at a good time to support
higher standards and improve student achievement.''

BAY STATE FAVORS MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts can start printing the bumper stickers:
``Don't blame us, we voted for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever willing to ignore national trends, Massachusetts primary
voters reaffirmed their political independence Tuesday, giving
Arizona Senator John McCain his biggest margin of victory on a day
of big losses from coast to coast to his Republican rival, Texas
Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the McCain stronghold of New England _ where, until
recently, he seemed poised for a sweep of all five states holding
primaries _ Bush made late inroads, in Rhode Island and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore's nationwide rout
of former Senator Bill Bradley extended throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said McCain's strength in Massachusetts and
its neighboring states reflects an independent streak in the region
that rewards anti-establishment candidates such as the Arizona
senator, who called for sweeping campaign finance reform and
denounced pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly the case in Massachusetts, the only state
won by Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern in 1972 _ a
tidbit of political history that spawned ``Don't blame me, I voted
for McGovern'' bumper stickers as Watergate unfolded and President
Nixon's administration crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more voters register as independents than Democrats and
Republicans combined in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts has a lot of intellectual pride,'' said John
Berg, a professor of government at Suffolk University. ``It's a
state where people haven't felt comfortable at all about following
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's failure to sweep New England, said others, was a
sign of how far his once-rocketing campaign has fallen since his
Feb. 1 upset victory over Bush in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for McCain to have made that argument to fight on, he
needed that New England sweep,'' said Lou DiNatale, a political
analyst at the University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute for
Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that despite the natural inclination of New England's
independent voters to back McCain, the Arizonan's campaign had lost
its way in recent weeks and enthusiasm dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People following the campaign have been getting more and more
of a sense over the last couple of weeks that it was really all
over already,'' Berg said. ``People like underdogs _ they don't
like losers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bradley was also a victim of perceptions that his
campaign was a lost cause and was doubly damaged by McCain's
appeals to the independents Bradley had once hoped to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that among independents, who were able to vote for
either Democrats or Republicans in every New England state except
Connecticut, ``only one or the other of the insurgent candidates
can do well. . . . McCain probably took most of those votes from
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the excitment over McCain, most polling stations in
Massachusetts were quiet.
</P>
<P>
   At the Talbot School in Weymouth, for example, there were no
signs, no lines, no volunteers outside during late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Voters tried to change their enrollment status on the spot to
vote for McCain, not knowing that they had missed the deadline to
do so by many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confused,'' said one voter who declined to give her
name. ``I didn't know you had to go fill out a card first.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated woman left without casting a ballot for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the rest of New England voted.
</P>
<P>
   --Maine. Bush did not visit the state once to campaign. But no
matter. This is where the Bush family spends its summers, in
Kennebunkport, and it was the only New England state that chose the
Texas governor over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Maine voters are independents, the primary allows
only party members to cast ballots, which also helped Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 14 GOP delegates are apportioned according to vote,
unless a candidate gets more than 50 percent and would then win all
the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won the state and its 23 Democratic delegates.??chart has
14
</P>
<P>
   --Connecticut. This state was logistically and historically
stacked against McCain, but voted for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Only party members are allowed to vote in the winner-take all
primary, which means independents, making up 40 percent of the
electorate, could not cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also faced Governor John G. Rowland's support for Bush
and his opponent's Connecticut family legacy. The ?? and both he
and his son graduated from Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain won the state's 25 GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily claimed the state's 54 Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   --Rhode Island. This overwhelmingly Democratic state also chose
Gore and McCain, who was helped by the Ocean State's primary rules
allowing independents to vote. The state delivered 22 Democratic
delegates and 14 Republican ones, winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   --Vermont. The free-spirited state with strict campaign-finance
laws was fertile ground for McCain, who swept its 12
winner-take-all GOP delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore never visited the state, he was likely helped by
his environmental reputation in defeating Bradley. Gore won 15
Democratic delegates in Vermont's open primary.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ It becomes more and more evident with each
passing day that Scott Elarton likely won't be ready to pitch when
the regular season begins.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker will make the final call,
and at this point he's not ready to completely rule out the
24-year-old righthander, who underwent rotator-cuff surgery during
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that Elarton, who hasn't appeared in any of the
Astros' five exhibition games, is behind the rest of the team's
pitchers, which is exactly what the club expected when spring
training began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give it another week, but we've already played
a week of games, and I'm not going to cut his preparation short,''
Hunsicker said. ``We're rapidly getting to the point where it would
be difficult for him to make up time. Next week, we'll probably
have a better feel for where we are with Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't cut short the time it takes for someone to get into
shape. We've got to get him to the point where he can begin getting
into game shape. I'm certainly not going to be shortsighted there
and worry about racing the calendar for a couple of weeks or
whatever it turns out to be just to try to get him ready (to start
the season on time). It's not the team you start with; it's the
team you finish with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Astros, there is a doctor in the house. He's
not the kind who can speed up Elarton's progress, but the kind who
can help patch up a rotation that probably will start the season
without two of its main contributors from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Gooden is not Elarton, nor is he Mike Hampton, whom the
Astros traded to the Mets over the winter. In fact, Gooden isn't
even the same pitcher he was when he last pitched in the National
League in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But if his first two outings of the spring are any indication,
Gooden just might have the cure for what most expect will ail the
Astros in 2000. Exhibiting the type of precision and attention to
detail one might expect from a doctor, Gooden has been pretty close
to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the 35-year-old righthander has been flawless,
retiring each of the 12 batters he has faced, including six in a
row Tuesday against his former teammates, the Cleveland Indians.
Some nifty defensive work has probably saved Gooden a couple of
hits, but so far he has accomplished what he set out to do this
spring: get ahead in the count, throw strikes and locate his
pitches consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Having pitched in the big leagues for 15 seasons, Gooden isn't
about to get overly excited about two spring outings, but he has
been pleased with his performance nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to throw strikes and to be aggressive,'' Gooden
said. ``It's like I've been saying all along: I'm not the same kind
of pitcher I was years ago when I could fall behind in the count
and everyone knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have to get ahead in the count and be more of a
complete pitcher. Today was probably the best I've located the ball
the whole while. I feel good about where I am at this stage. I just
want to get stronger and stronger each time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Gooden once threw only a rising four-seam fastball, he
now has a sinking two-seamer, which theoretically induces more
ground balls. Seven of his 12 outs this spring have come on ground
balls, a pattern that figures to serve him well at Enron Field,
where the modest dimensions down the lines could spell trouble for
fly-ball pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bako, who was Gooden's batterymate Tuesday, is almost in
awe of the former Cy Young Award winner. When the Indians visited
the Astrodome last season, Bako anonymously had a ball sent to the
visitor's clubhouse for Gooden to sign. Now, he's catching the
icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little hard to believe,'' Bako said. ``It really is a
pleasure to catch him. He's located the ball really well, his
fastball has been sharp, and his slider was sharp today. He's just
gotten better each time in the two weeks since I first caught him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be the first to admit he's not the Doc of old. He was the
dominant pitcher of his time. All he needed to throw back then was
a fastball and curveball. Everyone knew he was coming right at
them, and they still couldn't hit him. Now, he knows he can't blow
people away anymore. He's more of a complete pitcher, and he
probably takes more pride in that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this spring, the thing Gooden is most proud of is also
the thing that has the Astros' brass most encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing a lot of strikes,'' pitching coach Vern Ruhle
said. ``He's been doing that all spring, even in the intrasquad
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunsicker: ``If there has been one culprit for him over the
last few years, it's been that he's walked too many batters and he
pitched behind in the count. I think improving that was one of his
goals for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good goal to work toward, and so far he's done a
great job. When we first got him, we talked to him about the
importance of pitching ahead in the count. To his credit, he's
really worked on it, and so far we've seen some results.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a result of that, Gooden no doubt is making it easier for
the Astros to resist any temptation there might be to push Elarton
any harder than necessary.

GORE ROLLS OVER BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was Al Gore coast to coast, as the vice
president defeated former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley in every
one of the 15 states holding Democratic primaries and caucuses
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in a good omen for his prospects in November's general
election, Gore was also on track to best Texas Governor George W.
Bush in California's ``beauty contest,'' a mini-general election in
the nation's largest state, where voters could pick from candidates
in either party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's clean sweep almost certainly means the end of the
Democratic nomination fight, which Bradley's challenge made a
spirited, sometimes snarling, substantive and close-run affair,
right up to the New Hampshire primary, which Gore narrowly won. In
the five-weeks since, Bradley's national support steadily slipped
away, taking with it his dream of remaking Democratic politics in
his sober, insurgent's image.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Gore will meet with his campaign chairman, Tony
Coehlo, and his chief strategist, Carter Eskew, to make decisions
about his general election strategy. In recent days, he has already
begun focusing his attention on Bush, criticizing him for opposing
trigger safety locks on guns, campaign finance reform, and
attacking his health care record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Gore's apparent clamp on the nomination, he plans a
heavy travel schedule to Texas, Florida, Louisiana and other states
holding primaries on March 14, as well as Illinois, with a primary
a week later. Wednesday he leaves for Michigan, where Democrats
will elect delegates in a caucus on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the vice president, the results marked an impressive
turnaround from his early days in New Hampshire where he initially
struggled to confront a strong challenge from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is really the comeback kid now,'' said Darrell M. West, a
political science professor at Brown University. ``He has turned
around what was a dismal situation in October and emerged in very
good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore revamped his campaign, moved his headquarters to
Nashville and transformed his own persona on the stump, Bradley
often seemed tactically overmatched. Gore attacked Bradley's image
as a reformer and sought to turn the former senator's campaign
centerpiece, a health care plan to give insurance to all Americans,
against him. In their first debate at Dartmouth College, Bradley
responded to Gore's criticism mildly, saying, ``We each have our
own experts, and I dispute the cost figure that Al has used.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bradley was similarly passive during another debate
when Gore asked him to explain why he voted against a flood-relief
amendment that would have helped Chris Peterson, a farmer in the
audience with 300 of his 400 acres of land under water at the time.
Bradley said he wanted to talk about the future, not the past He
didn't defend his record on flood relief, which was not nearly as
stark as Gore made it appear. More telling still, he never spoke to
Peterson's own plight at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the values of the process is you learn whether they
have what it takes, and we learned that Bradley did not,'' said
Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
``Gore demonstrated you've got to be tough in this business, and
he's certainly that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall and into the early winter, Bradley was leading Gore in
the polls in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as in New
York, where he played professional basketball for the New York
Knicks for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Gore bested Bradley in Massachusetts, in New York,
and even in Bradley home state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has yet to win a contest in the 2000 election, beginning
with losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. When he left the Granite
State, a four-point loser to Gore, Bradley still hoped he could
revive his chances and win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're smarter and better prepared and ready and eager to
continue the fight,'' Bradley said at the time. He described the
race as a fight for new politics, big dreams, and a different
philosophy of leadership _ his.
</P>
<P>
   But John McCain's 19-point New Hampshire victory over Bush meant
that the Arizona senator had grabbed the spotlight. With no
Democratic primaries for five weeks, voters were watching the
Republicans do battle in South Carolina, Michigan, and elsewhere,
rather than listening to Bradley hold forth.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tried to take back the momentum in advance of Super
Tuesday by concentrating his time in Washington State, which held
an open primary with no Democratic delegates on Feb. 29. But the
longer Bradley stayed in Washington, the more he dropped in the
polls. Gore won there, as well.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has insisted during the past week that he is ``not
taking a single vote for granted,'' he also has been laying the
groundwork for a general election campaign. Gore, who once
relentlessly criticized Bradley, switched his target to the
Republican contenders, especially Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is moving more and more to the Republicans,'' said
Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane. The two leading Republican
candidates want to make ``a right wing U-turn'' in economic policy,
and ``it's hard not to address that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From California to Massachusetts, Gore has accused Bush and
McCain of being ``two peas in a pod,'' with ``right-wing'' agendas
against abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, they're afraid to do anything that isn't
blessed in advance by the NRA,'' Gore said in a TV interview late
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been harsher toward Bush, singling him out for speaking
at Bob Jones University, which until recently banned interracial
dating, and denouncing the Texas governor for refusing to back a
ban on ``soft money.'' Soft money is loosely regulated, unlimited
cash raised for voter education or party building, and is not
supposed to be spent on behalf of a specific candidate or campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president frequently mentions that he and McCain agree
on issues such as campaign finance reform and the need to ``stand
up to special interests.'' The tactic has allowed him to draw a
comparison between himself and McCain, without completely
alienating McCain's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, hasn't had a nice thing to say about Bush yet.
And he is unlikely to start now.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, Gore will focus his message on the booming
economy, urging voters to continue the policies of the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a critical question in the general election: who
will keep the economic prosperity going?'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is also expected to talk extensively about
Bush's record in Texas, which he likes to note ranks second to last
for children's health insurance, last for women's health insurance,
and first for pollutants and carcinogens released to the air and
soil. One study Gore cites, by the Children's Rights Council,
ranked Texas as the 48th worst place to raise a child.

BEATRICE SCHENK DE REGNIERS, 86, AN AUTHOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ind.)  By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, an author whose ability to recreate
the sensibilities of a child informed many well-loved books she
wrote for young readers, died on March 1 at her home in Washington.
She was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Beni Montresor illustrated de Regniers' ``May I Bring a
Friend?'' (1972) and won the Caldecott Medal for the pictures that
accompany the story of a boy who politely asks a king and queen for
permission before bringing his animal friends along when he is
asked to visit. de Regniers' other books included ``A Little House
of Your Own'' (1954), illustrated by Irene Haas, and ``Little
Sister and the Month Brothers'' (1975), illustrated by Margot
Tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Can You Do With a Shoe?,'' an engaging conversation
between two children, was illustrated by Maurice Sendak in 1955
using two colors. It was republished in 1997 with full-color
illustrations by Sendak.
</P>
<P>
   De Regniers was born in Lafayette, Ind., and raised in nearby
Crawfordsville, a place where, she wrote, a child could ``gather
violets, live in a tree, walk in the woods _ be.'' She earned
degrees from the University of Chicago and the Winnetka Graduate
Teachers College.
</P>
<P>
   She was a social worker and a dancer and during World War II a
welfare officer with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
Administration. For 11 years, she was director of educational
materials for the American Heart Association before becoming the
founding editor of Scholastic's Lucky Book Club in 1961. She
retired from that position in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay, de Regniers explained the deceptively simple style
of her children's books, saying that ``a book for young people that
honestly has its roots in the author's feelings as a child is not
likely to seem old-fashioned or out of date.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the pseudonym Tamara Kitt (Tammy and Mara were her cats'
names), de Regniers also wrote a series of mass-market paperbacks,
including ``Jake'' and ``Sam and the Impossible Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She was married to Francis de Regniers, who worked as a manager
for Air France, and they lived in New York until his death in 1992.
She later moved to Washington to be near her sister, Lillian
Goldman of Washington, who survives her.
</P>
<P>
   When schoolchildren asked if she had children of her own, de
Regniers explained that she had vivid memories of her childhood.
``I remember 'way back,'' she would say, ``even before I was 2
years old,'' adding that ``almost everything I write relates in
some way to these early years. What was important to me then is
important to me now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why, even though I have no children of my own, I think
it is OK for me to write books that children will read or have read
to them.''  &QL;

STATE STREET INVESTMENT ARM UPS PAY TO SLOW DEFECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After eight employees jumped ship last summer to join a
higher-paying rival, State Street Global Advisors had to look in
the mirror _ and open its wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The $667 billion investment arm of Boston's State Street Corp.
confirmed it reviewed the compensation of about 500 employees in
the wake of the Deutsche Bank defections. And it has awarded large
raises to a ``significant number'' of those people in a bid to keep
them from hopping to local mutual fund companies or Wall Street
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exercise for us that was probably long overdue,''
said Marc Simons, chief operating officer at State Street Global.
``It gave us a chance to make sure our folks were competitively
compensated and meeting their long-term goals.''
</P>
<P>
   State Street wouldn't say how big the raises were, but employees
say they ranged from 5 percent to 40 percent. Simons said the
increases came in the form of cash, bonus, and stock, depending on
the employee and the job description. In all, he said, the pay
hikes will add several million dollars to the group's wage budget.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after five years of massive returns in the stock
market that have fueled fast growth at State Street and other
investment shops. Employees increasingly expect to share in their
employers' riches, whether it's at a downtown financial firm or a
high-flying dot-com start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Thomson, an executive recruiter at Pendleton James
Associates in Boston, said candidates for top investment posts no
longer ask just about salary, bonus, and stock options. They want
to know, ``What's the walk-away?'' he said, or how much the hiring
company will pay to make good on deferred compensation and stock
left on the table with the former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Simons said State Street is not looking to match the kind of
eye-popping pay being offered in a frothy market. One of the
executives who left for Deutsche Bank had boasted he was signing on
for $9 million, a sum Simons called ``really off the end of the
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company does want to be able to attract and keep talent
by making sure it's in the top 50 percent of the pay range among
its peers. Said Simons, ``Money has clearly become more of a
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, the recruiter, observed that traditionally ``investment
management firms that are attached to banks have lower-paid
investment managers.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a hot-button issue for State Street Global, whose chief,
Nicholas Lopardo, has labored to create an investment culture quite
separate from the parent company's banking tradition. His pay has,
in some years, exceeded that of his boss, Marshall Carter, chief
executive of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Corp. recently sold its small but profitable bank
division to focus on its core business of keeping records on $6
trillion for mutual funds and pensions. But the company has yet to
entirely shed that banker image with investors.
</P>
<P>
   If State Street Global did, by its own admission, fall behind on
the wage front, Simons said it was partly because turnover has been
light in recent years. The company was lulled into believing its
culture helped keep people, even in a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it was a harsh wake-up call when Deutsche Bank
lured away a fund manager, a quantitative strategies chief, the
head of emerging markets, two analysts, and four salesmen _ all in
one swoop early last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time that's ever happened to us,'' Simons said.
``We recognize that the marketplace has become very competitive,
and that our assets travel up and down the elevator every day.''

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For someone who was embalmed just last fall
by a New York tabloid as ``Dead Veep Walking,'' it was a stunning
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after he embarrassed himself with an ill-conceived
and inept presidential campaign and only a few months after he was
nearly written off as a loser, Vice President Al Gore has revived
his fortunes, sweeping aside an opponent who sneaked up on him last
fall and nearly stole his political future.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fond of saying that competition from his lone rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, has been good for him, that the challenge
by Bradley forced him to become a better candidate. Bradley ``was a
blessing in disguise,'' Gore said recently, invoking Winston
Churchill as he hinted in a trenchant aside just how nervous he had
once been: ``Some disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Bradley did spur Gore into a wholesale overhaul
of his candidacy, prompting an extraordinary political resurrection
of the vice president after Labor Day, when a poll by The Boston
Globe showed Bradley neck and neck with him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the building blocks that helped Gore survive that period
actually were put in place long ago. As Bill Clinton's vice
president, he devoted himself to raising money and doing political
favors _ and collecting iou's from local and state politicians
across the country. And in 1999 he called those chits in, racking
up endorsements from county sheriffs to the president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So formidable was the political infrastructure Gore assembled
that by last year he had scared off any challengers. Most notable
among them was Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who decided that the
Democrats had a better chance of recapturing the House than keeping
the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So confident was the Gore team that when Bradley loped into the
picture from left field, it paid him little mind. After all, Gore
had locked up most of the so-called superdelegates, the elected
officials and party leaders who will pick the nominee at the
party's August convention. He had built a floor through which he
could not fall. And he was campaigning at a time of peace and
nearly unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But then, perhaps feeling too secure, he lapsed into an
imperious Rose Garden strategy that nearly led to his ruin.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles have been well-documented, as has his very public
makeover, in which he abandoned the podium in favor of the
Oprah-style town meeting used with such great success by his
mentor, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to bring an end to Gore Inc.,'' one Gore adviser
recalled recently, referring to the sprawling, complacent, almost
corporate entity that the sterile campaign had become. ``It wasn't
just a building on K Street; it was a psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   What secured his victory, however, were certain strategic
decisions and a newfound discipline in the candidate and in his
campaign to adhere to those decisions. As he was developing a
warmer and fuzzier public image, his campaign was developing a
sharper edge. That sharpness sometimes overtook the candidate in
his debates with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore deftly forced Bradley into a more negative campaign than
Bradley had vowed to run. All the while, the vice president was
nailing down the support of core constituents, relentlessly
painting a worrisome picture of Bradley and resolving not to stray
from his message of the day _ even to the point of laughing in
recent days about his universal answer, no matter the question: ``I
am not taking a single vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The central decision was basically to keep the gas on and not
let up,'' one top Gore strategist said. ``That was the guiding
principle, to stay disciplined, focused, on message, and campaign
like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the history of the Gore campaign is written, it may
focus less on Gore's successful stratagems (and there were many)
and more on Bradley's missteps (and there were many). Even as
Bradley loomed as a potentially serious threat, he mystified Gore
operatives for his inability to build on his assets, and he made
blunders that in retrospect seem naive.
</P>
<P>
   One telling moment went almost unremarked by the Gore campaign
at the time. It was back on Dec. 16, when Bradley shared a stage in
Claremont, N.H., with Sen. John McCain, a Republican, to highlight
their disgust with the campaign finance system. At the time, it
looked like a coup for Bradley: lasso the maverick Republican, make
a name for yourself as a new breed of politician, and build some
excitement among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, that ``summit of the underdogs,'' as Bradley and
McCain termed it, hurt Bradley more than it helped him. In the eyes
of the Gore campaign, at least retrospectively, it validated the
scrappier McCain as the true insurgent and seemed to give Bradley's
stamp of approval for independent-leaning Democrats to vote for
McCain.

 &HT;     BUSH BLITZES McCAIN ON SUPER TUESDAY  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush effectively ended the challenge of Sen.
John
</P>
<P>
   McCain for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday,
setting the
</P>
<P>
   stage for Bush to court McCain and his supporters to join a GOP
crusade to reclaim the White House in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush harnessed hard-hitting campaign ads and a lavishly financed
nationwide campaign organization to score victories in most of the
13 states with GOP contests, according to Voter News Service exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The voter interviews showed Bush beating McCain in California,
Ohio, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Maine with a close race in
New York. Bush was running ahead of McCain, as well, in the popular
vote contest in California in which non-Republicans could cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush swept key winner-take-all delegate contests, including
California, as well as the majority of the GOP delegates in other
states that award delegates on a district-by-district basis, the
exit polls showed. Karl Rove, his campaign manager, said Bush would
pick up as many as 450 of the 613 delegates chosen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN delegate projections at 9 p.m. EST gave Bush a total of 397
delegates and McCain with 193. A Republican candidate needs 1,034
delegates to secure the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose fiery populism sustained an uphill challenge for
the last six weeks, captured only Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war
failed to make inroads among the bedrock Republican voters that he
needed in order to sweep large numbers of delegates in the
district-by-district duels, particularly in Ohio where he was
banking that two campaign stops on Monday would turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, made it clear
that his most pressing task in the days ahead will be to court
McCain as well as the centrist Republicans, independents and
Democrats who rallied to McCain in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush extended an olive branch to McCain even before the results
were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if there's any personal issues between me and my
opponents, we'll sit down and talk,''' Bush said. ``I'm confident
we can heal any wounds that may exist between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a prepared statement, Bush referred to McCain and
said, ``We have our disagreements but I respect him and his
commitment to reform. Republicans and conservatives across America
have said they want me to lead the Republican party to victory in
November _ and I am ready and eager to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove signaled that Bush wasn't interested in pressuring McCain
to withdraw in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to urge him out of the race,'' Rove said.
``What would be appropriate for us to do is to indicate that Gov.
Bush is ready to heal and unify the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary schedule moves into Bush territory next Tuesday,
with contests in six key southern and southwestern states,
including Texas, where Bush is governor, and Florida where his
brother, Jeb Bush, is chief executive. The six states offer 341
delegates _ enough to give Bush a mathematical lock on the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the race will only be over ``when we get to 1,034
delegates and we're the only candidate left,'' adding: ``It's going
to be apparent, particularly after next week, that Bush has got
unstoppable momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would stay in the race only if he believed he
still had a chance to turn things around and win the nomination.
McCain said last weekend that he would withdraw from a failing race
rather than have his ``megaphone turn into a kazoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran senator struck a wistful tone before the results
were in. ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked this
kind of prairie fire out there that got people involved,'' McCain
said told a radio call-in program early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hard-hitting populist bid, featuring attacks on Bush,
``the establishment,'' the White House, Congress and special
interests, attracted legions of first-time voters, once-alienated
young voters, independents and Democrats to the GOP banner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy ignited historic turnouts in New Hampshire
and Michigan, where he won early momentum, as well as in South
Carolina where he lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said excitement does not translate into nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a credible early favorite _ and you have the
fortitude to stay on in the face of early disappointments _ you're
going to win the nomination,'' Baker said. ``Ultimately the
favorites designated by the party graybeards walk away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta who is not
working for any presidential campaign, said McCain could not hope
to win the GOP nomination ``without Republican votes,''' adding:
``Establishment matters, and money matters _ especially in a war of
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which had the support of Republican leaders _
including 29 governors, 38 senators and 175 House members _ carried
out 2 million get-out-the-vote telephone calls in nine states in
the final two days of the Super Tuesday campaign, mailed 2 million
pieces of campaign literature and distributed 69,000 yard signs,
according to Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Ayres said Bush had been strengthened for the
fall campaign by being forced to grapple with McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become ``a far superior candidate, far more aggressive,
far more
</P>
<P>
   unscripted, far more willing to take chances,'' Ayres said.

 NASHVILLE , Tenn. : for McCain.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When Bradley stood with McCain, he provided a letter of
transit for independent voters to go with McCain,'' one Gore
confidant said. ``It didn't matter that McCain was pro-life or
pro-gun,'' he said. ``People saw him as legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Such blunders, over time, created an opening for the vice
president after months of self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``His failures reinvigorated the Gore campaign,'' said Leon E.
Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and a
close observer of the Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Gore campaign was lining up with all the core
Democratic constituencies that vote in primaries. These efforts
were led by Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, who has extensive
experience in working with the party's core groups, like
influential blacks, women and gays. The rest of the Gore team was
also clicking into place, with Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman,
Carter Eskew, the message man, Bob Shrum, the media strategist, and
Michael Whouley, the top field marshal, on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign averted a potential disaster by persuading
organized labor to endorse Gore, which it did on Oct. 12. The
AFL-CIO could have remained neutral and nearly did. Only after
intense lobbying by Gore officials, with an assist from Clinton,
did the unions, though not unanimously, bestow their prized backing
and its promise of election-day manpower on the vice president. It
helped restore a sense of strength that had slipped through Gore's
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before, Gore had signaled a new aggressiveness. In
twin speeches to the Democratic National Committee, Bradley made a
lofty appeal to the party's highest instincts, while Gore, aiming
his message less at suburban moderates and more at the party's
base, said he would roll up his sleeves and fight for the
traditional values the party advocated.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed by a similarly disparate appearance at the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner in Des Moines, where again Bradley
aimed for the ideal and Gore came across as more practical. Gore,
still the self-anointed underdog, pressed Bradley to agree to
debates. Bradley demurred, a pose that he would often adopt, to his
detriment, in the face of Gore's confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Gore's campaign anthem of ``Stay and Fight''
emerged. He had accused Bradley of quitting the Senate (he retired
after a third term), while Gore decided to ``stay and fight'' the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Grisolano, a direct-mail consultant in Iowa and a Gore
supporter, proposed that Gore expand this phrase into a theme. By
the night of the dinner, 1,000 signs had been printed up with the
slogan, and over time it evolved into a full-fledged battle cry
that Gore now gives full throat to at the end of nearly every
speech: ``I am a fighter! I want to fight for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said: ``The crucial thing is that Al Gore came out of
this thing looking like a fighter. Bradley didn't. He wasn't
willing to fight back. And in not fighting back, he let Gore look
like the stronger candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fighter persona emerged just as Bradley was putting his
health-care proposal forward, and it offered Gore a chance to go
after something substantive.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team believed health care would be a central concern of
voters but there was some question about what approach to take
since the Clinton administration's own proposal for universal
coverage had failed so drastically in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One top Gore adviser described the internal debate: ``There was
a very active debate in the campaign between those who wanted a
more sweeping health-care proposal _ those who frankly had lived
with the ghost of Harris Wofford and Bob Kerrey, who had ridden it
with incredible political power and momentum _ and those on the
policy staff who said we should be more incremental.'' The adviser
said Gore had decided to put the brakes on a more ambitious
health-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, Gore ripped into Bradley's proposal as a
half-baked plan that would cost too much and provide woefully
inadequate coverage. His main charge was that Bradley's goal of
universal coverage _ which Gore adopted as his own _ was worthy but
that the approach should be step by step, not in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   From this, Gore extracted a larger message about his candidacy _
that he was a political realist and would be a careful steward of
the prosperity while Bradley was a dreamer with an academic
approach to problems that would end up hurting people and ruining
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were up against a Clinton/Gore-style campaign,'' said Lee
Miringhoff, director of the Marist Institute poll in New York.
``They target, hit, morph their positions very closely to yours and
poke a hole or two in them and then bore away _ and you have to be
up at the same speed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore honed his skills in debate practice with his friend Tom
Downey, a former congressman from Long Island, standing in for
Bradley. More than one observer said that Downey was sharper
playing Bradley than Mr. Bradley was in the actual debates. ``Gore
and Downey are friends, too, and that added to the competition
between them,'' said one who watched.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Iowa was effectively over on Jan. 8, when in a
debate, Gore questioned Bradley's commitment to helping flood
victims in Iowa and Bradley did not address the matter. New
Hampshire, where Gore had been on television for most of October
with no counter-advertising from Bradley, fell into line shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That month that we had to ourselves really helped us to get
back in the race,'' said one strategist. He said that when Bradley
did buy air time, he did so in Boston, and the Gore campaign could
see Bradley gaining ground among voters who watched Boston
television.

   ``We faced a serious financial decision, and that was whether to
go up in Boston or not,'' this adviser said. ``Unless you
communicate through the Boston media, you won't reach a big chunk
of New Hampshire voters. We knew it would cost more and be less
efficient, but if you don't do it, you're cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was also monitoring another topic that no one
wanted to be caught discussing in public. That was Bradley's heart
palpitations, a seemingly minor problem that could have mushroomed
into a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley people say that if he hadn't had the heart thing,
he would have won New Hampshire,'' a Gore adviser said. ``Well, if
we were trailing, we might have run a different kind of campaign,''
he said, not suggesting they would have used Bradley's heart
condition against him but that as long as Bradley supporters were
engaging in hypotheticals, this adviser would too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no lack of will to win over here,'' he said, in a
clear shot across the bow at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
leading Republican candidate. ``If we had found ourselves in a
situation where we were short a vote, we probably would have tried
a different route.''
</P>
<P>
   What would they have done? ``We would have drawn much stronger
contrasts than we did,'' said this adviser. ``We would have brought
up that Bradley wants people to work until they're 70 when they
retire. We didn't unload all our firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Zukin, a public policy professor at Rutgers University,
said that Gore prevailed for both tactical reasons but also larger
reasons that he had little control over. ``Bradley was running
against the longest economic expansion in history,'' he said. ``How
do you call for fundamental change during good economic times? No
one has ever done it successfully.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore crushed Bill Bradley from ocean to ocean
Tuesday in a powerful display that assured him the Democratic
presidential nomination, while Gov. George W. Bush took a huge
stride toward capturing the Republican nomination, piling up far
more delegates than Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories were particularly impressive because he was
supported by every demographic group in the 16 states with
Democratic contests, and, significantly, by women, who backed him
in some states by margins of more than 2-to-1, according to results
or surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was less overwhelming. Bush
prevailed in the Midwest powerhouses of Ohio and Missouri and in
the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. McCain captured
Massachusetts and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the most sought-after electoral prize of all,
Bush was comfortably ahead of McCain in the votes of registered
Republicans, the exit polls showed. That is crucial because the
winner of the Republican vote captures all of California's 162
delegates. It was not clear which of the four contenders would
prevail in that state's popular vote, which is not binding but
could be a telling measure of a candidates' potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the other huge electoral trove, with 101 delegates,
Bush and McCain were battling in what exit polls showed was a tight
contest. The vote was also tight in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the votes were counted, both Gore and Bush were
looking toward the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm privileged to win the nomination, I'm going to need you
more than ever going forward to the general election,'' the vice
president told labor supporters Tuesday, ``because there's an awful
lot at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore has been concentrating his assaults on Bush, while
the Texas governor has softened his conservative oratory in recent
days, positioning himself for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; The Republican needs 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side the primaries capped the most contentious
nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral see-saw in
which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by McCain in the
next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more victories and more
delegates. But no one could safely bet what would happen Tuesday
because in the entire yearlong run-up to the primaries, Bush had
been widely viewed as the front-runner, only to see his prospects
grow far more precarious after McCain trounced him in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The enormity of Gore's triumph allows him to
move more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, patching up with McCain and his supporters could prove
more difficult. The polls of voters Tuesday, conducted by a
consortium of the television networks and the Associated Press,
found that Bush and McCain continued to draw from far different
bases of support. Republicans backed Bush overwhelmingly while
independents and Democrats, in states where they could vote for a
Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries have been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

CSUN WOMEN: NO SLOW START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Any local landscaping company would be lucky to
hire the Cal State Northridge women's basketball players. They've
got a lot of experience in digging out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Matadors were down by 11 (34-23) at halftime at
Weber State and they came back to win. Two days later, they trailed
by nine (36-27) at Sacramento State and won that game, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both must-wins for us,'' CSUN coach Frozena Jerro
said. ``Unfortunately, we got into the habit of digging ourselves a
hole in the first half. The good thing is we were able to battle
back and come out with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded CSUN (17-9) opens the women's Big Sky tournament
Thursday in Missoula, Mont. Northridge faces the highest-seeded
semifinal winner from today's games.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro isn't looking for another slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a season-long thing,'' she said. ``We've had
different starting lineups, but it's just a matter of us coming in
focused and ready to go. . . . I'm sure the adrenaline is going to
be flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Inside-outside: Not many 6-foot-9 forwards take as many
3-point shots as CSUN's Andre Larry, who's tossed it up 61 times
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, a senior who enters the Big Sky tournament second on the
Matadors in scoring (13 points per game), has made 19. His shooting
percentage (31 percent) is next-to-last on the team, and Larry is
just 3 for 15 in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm in a little bit of a slump, but I can't get out
of it by stopping (shooting),'' Larry said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry could be more effective inside, though. An example:
Saturday he missed a wide-open 3-pointer against Sacramento State.
CSUN got the offensive rebound and Larry went inside and scored
while being fouled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I was a guard,'' he said. ``That was just my
thing, just to shoot 3-pointers. Shooting 3's was the first thing I
liked to do. As tall as I am, it's something that a lot of people
can't (defend). I've still got a little guard in me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Primed: Last year the CSUN men went to the Big Sky tournament
with a gimpy Jeff Parris (injured back) a disgruntled Greg Minor
(he quit the team but came back) and a vanished Rico Harris (quit
with Minor and didn't return).
</P>
<P>
   Northridge boarded a plane Tuesday with no injuries and no
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, thank God, we're in good shape,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``Last year we had injuries, we had defections, we
had all kinds of things. This feels like the first time we've had
our whole team solid and locked in.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quotable: ``Everybody feels like they can win the tournament
and make it to the NCAAs. That's the only way any team in our
conference is going to be there, by winning this tournament. So
you're going to have six hungry teams.'' _ Braswell

   NEW YORK _ Charles Schwarz has been held up to the public eye as
a Janus figure, a man with two irreconcilable faces.
</P>
<P>
   To the federal prosecutors who convinced a jury last year that
he was guilty of helping to torture Abner Louima and then won
another conviction against him this week for covering up his role
in the attack, Schwarz is a poster boy for police misconduct _ a
cop who not only willingly joined in one of the most horrendous
assaults in the New York Police Department's history, but who then
ensnared his colleagues in a web of self-serving lies to try to get
himself off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   But to his lawyers, his family, and even the other officers
convicted in the notorious 1997 assault and its cover-up, Schwarz
is an entirely different man. His partisans and colleagues say he
is the victim of an overly zealous federal government _ an innocent
and honest patrolman who was railroaded by a vengeful team of
prosecutors willing to forgo the truth in order to win their case.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, 34, is being held in a cell at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Brooklyn, under lock and key 23 hours a day,
facing a possible life sentence on the assault conviction and five
years for the coverup conviction. His lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, has
promised to overturn both verdicts, but after two juries ruled
against him, the chances of a successful appeal seem dim.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is possible that the truth about Schwarz and his
role in the attack, in which Louima was sodomized with a broken
broomstick in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house, lies
somewhere between the extremes portrayed by prosecutors and by his
supporters. The jurors in both trials were granted anonymity by the
court, so it is impossible to say exactly what they believed about
him. And after two trials, more than 100 pieces of evidence and
untold hours of courtroom arguments, many New Yorkers may be left
with a frustrating sense that the truth _ cold and hard and clean _
remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``Rashomon''-like quality to both trials, as each
person who spoke about what happened on Aug. 9, 1997, came up with
a different version of events. Not only did the accounts of several
witnesses blatantly contradict one another, but there was a gnawing
feeling that no one could offer a complete version, from beginning
to end.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Schwarz loudly proclaimed his innocence _ as
many accused men do _ and he took the stand in his second trial to
present his alibi to the jury: that he was not inside the 70th
Precinct station house at all during the time of the attack, but
instead was outside searching his squad car after a night out on
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the murkiness of the Schwarz case lies with the nature
of the jury system in which 12 ordinary people undertake the tough
task of coming to a conclusion about extraordinary events. But part
of the problem also lies with the general nature of the evidence
introduced at the two Louima trials.
</P>
<P>
   In the first trial, the case against Schwarz was based on the
accounts of Louima himself and of two officers who said they had
seen Schwarz leading Louima toward the bathroom where the attack
took place _ but not into it.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Detective Eric Turetzky, testified to seeing
Schwarz take the prisoner, handcuffed with his pants and underwear
around his knees, from the front desk of the station house down a
hallway that leads to the bathroom. The second officer, Mark
Schofield, recounted seeing Schwarz leading Louima toward the
hallway but not down it.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Louima testified that the officer who pinned him
down during the assault was the same one who had driven the patrol
car that carried him from the streets of Flatbush to the station
house that night. Although police records show that Schwarz was the
driver _ and Schwarz, in fact, testified at his second trial that
he was driving _ Louima gave confusing accounts of the driver's
identity under cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   In the second trial, which concerned a conspiracy to lie about
the assault, the government based its case on phone records showing
a blizzard of calls among Schwarz and his co-defendants, Thomas
Bruder and Thomas Wiese, as well as testimony that the three
officers met with union officials four days after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   While the government offered no tapes of the phone calls or
witnesses who concretely said that a plot to obstruct justice was
discussed at the meeting, they argued that the timing and
circumstances of both the calls and the get-together suggested that
the officers were joining forces to get their stories straight.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also argued that Bruder and Wiese tailored their
false accounts to conform each time a new development arose in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The government argued, for example, that on Aug. 15 _ six days
after the attack _ Bruder told Internal Affairs investigators that
Justin A. Volpe, who eventually pleaded guilty to the attack,
marched Louima to the bathroom alone. But on Aug. 18 _ just three
days later _ Bruder changed his story, the government said, and now
related that Wiese and Volpe had escorted the prisoner toward the
bathroom door.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said that change, mirrored by a similar
alteration in Wiese's story, was made because the conspirators now
had to account for two officers in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In large degree, an assessment of what exactly happened that
night must depend on how one views the testimony of Volpe, the only
person who everyone agrees was there. When he took the stand in the
second trial, he testified _ as expected _ that Schwarz was not in
the bathroom at all and was never involved in the attack. But
within moments Volpe plunged the courtroom into a new round of
chaos when he said that Wiese, who claims he walked in only after
the attack, was, in fact, in the room the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, there would seem to be little reason to
disbelieve the testimony of Volpe, a man who pleaded guilty in open
court last May, who is already serving a 30-year prison term for
his crime, who apparently has nothing more to lose. ``It has
nothing to do with friendship,'' Volpe said of his testimony on the
stand three weeks ago. ``It just has to do with doing what's right
in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to federal prosecutors, Volpe's motives were far
more sinister: they included a desire to seek a lower sentence and
an abiding hatred for Wiese. Indeed, Volpe is expected to file
papers appealing his sentence Wednesday morning and might stand to
gain by having appeared contrite and helpful on the witness stand.

WITH BALLOTS STILL BEING CAST, TV WRITES OFF 2 CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eulogies began at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even he sounded uncertain his campaign would survive,'' said
John King, the CNN correspondent assigned to Sen. John McCain, just
after 5 p.m., as the cable network's Super Tuesday coverage got
underway.
</P>
<P>
   King's CNN colleague, Jeanne Meserve, was equally downbeat about
the candidate on her watch, Bill Bradley. She reported that he had
spent the day ``trying not to appear that the handwriting was on
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   So went the gloomy preambles to an evening of primary election
returns on television and the Net, a night that progressed as a
kind of death knell for insurgency in the 2000 campaign. Across the
networks and the all-news cable channels, the punditcasts and the
political Web sites, the commentary and the reporting concentrated
on the next-step questions: when would McCain and Bradley make
their exits, and which of the survivors, Gov. George W. Bush or
Vice President Al Gore, would have a tougher time uniting his
party? And this was before the first vote was counted, at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson, the host of an hourlong show on MSNBC, said at 5:36
p.m. that polls had showed that McCain was ``going to come up
short.'' At 5:55, Chris Matthews said to Gibson, ``Right now, I
think it's not going to be McCain. I don't think he's done what he
had to do, which was upset the heir apparent of the Republican
party.'' At just after 6 p.m. _ three hours before the New York
polls closed _ Marcia Kramer was reporting on the CBS affiliate in
New York an ominous exit poll trend for McCain: that Catholic
voters in the state were backing his opponent by 49 percent to 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls have become such a sophisticated craft _ and the
commentators so confident in the projected outcomes _ that election
night coverage now has an odd seamlessness, a sense of expectations
fulfilled before the viewer digests the very first statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the competition to call the races in the early hours of
the coverage was something of a yawn. At 7 p.m., for example, when
polls closed in the first of the 16 states to report, Georgia and
Vermont, the network and all-news cable channels went on the air
with identical reports: Georgia in the Gore and Bush columns,
Vermont for McCain and the Democratic race there too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   `Goregantuan!'' was the headline posted on the ABC News Web site
after Gore swept four or five more states in the coast-to-coast
shellacking he was dealing Bradley. CBS, NBC and ABC broke in each
half-hour, with more races to call; the heavy-duty analysis was
left to the bevy of commentators recruited for cable, where the
pundits essentially dismissed Bradley's chances and set the bar for
McCain at a surprise victory somewhere, like Missouri or Ohio, to
prove that he was not a regional candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When those did not materialize, the political talkers on
television were writing McCain off, even though Californians were
still voting and New York remained a tossup. ``McCain had to do two
things simultaneously, appeal to independents and Democrats, and
reassure Republicans,'' said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of
the House, on the Fox News Channel at 9:10 p.m. ``He only got one
of those jobs done. He closed the door on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   How, a viewer might have wondered, had McCain sunk so far so
fast? ``A lot of reporters fear severe withdrawal in their lives if
John McCain loses,'' observed Fred Barnes on Fox. Dick Morris, the
political consultant, suggested the senator lost the race back in
South Carolina, when he failed to respond to Bush's newly
aggressive campaign. To McCain, Morris offered ``the Mike Dukakis
award: he did not answer an attack.''

STARRING THE CHEF, THE SOUS-CHEF ... AND THE DISHWASHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when chefs were anonymous. No one
knew their names. If a restaurant was named Chez Louis, chances
were that Louis was not the guy behind the stove. He was the owner.
When anyone dared to ask Henri Soule, the owner of Le Pavillon, who
was responsible for the greatness of his restaurant, he had a very
simple answer: ``Le Pavillon,'' he would say, ``c'est moi.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself thinking about those far-off days while studying
the menu at Thalia recently. Down at the bottom, the name of the
chef, Michael Otsuka, is printed. Next to him are listed his
sous-chefs, Bill McDaniel and Robert Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Sous-chefs?
</P>
<P>
   The United States has often been called a credit society. It's
true in two senses. Americans love credit cards. They love credit _
the recognition of accomplishment, near-accomplishment,
well-intended lack of accomplishment or merely showing up. In a
success-ethic democracy, it just doesn't feel right unless
everybody wins and trophies are handed out all around.
</P>
<P>
   After a long historical lag, restaurants are catching up to the
rest of the culture. The chefs were the first to step forward and
demand recognition, not as skilled technicians, but as artists.
It's been trickle-down ever since. In recent years, pastry chefs
have been rewarded with credit on menus and, often, menus of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Now the No. 2s _ the sous-chefs, or the chefs de cuisine _ seem
to be restive. At Picholine, Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner,
gives the nod to his chef de cuisine, Peter Dalleda. At Icon, the
menu credits the executive chef, Paul Sale; the sous-chef, Eric
Woods; and Michael Trenk, the manager. Oceana and Molyvos thank
everyone, adding ``and staff'' to the chef's name. That would seem
to be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   But no. New ground has been broken at Chicama, the restaurant at
ABC Carpet &AMP; Home. The menu lists 77 names, from Douglas Rodriguez,
the executive chef, down to Jesus Pedroza, food runner, and Mano
Garcia, coffee maker. I see no end to this. Before long, menus will
look like Playbill, or orchestra programs, with a roll call of
everyone involved in the production from the chef down to the
coat-check attendant. Diners who should be spending precious
minutes studying the appetizers will give in to the irresistible
urge to scan the names, looking for ones that sound funny. Morale,
presumably, will rise to unprecedented heights.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want to know? Of course not. But if it makes their
mothers proud, why quibble?  &QL;

HOUSTON MAYOR SEEKS STATE'S HELP IN MEETING SMOG STANDARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mayor Lee Brown joined local business leaders Tuesday
in asking state lawmakers to approve economic incentives to help
the Houston region meet its federal smog-reduction mandate.
</P>
<P>
   They also appealed for the state's help in persuading U.S.
officials to crack down on emission sources solely under federal
jurisdiction _ things like airplanes, locomotives and ships _ that
contribute to Houston's air pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's office, meanwhile, released a letter he has sent to the
two leading candidates for the Republican and Democratic
presidential nominations, soliciting their views on how they think
the federal government can help the Houston area clean up its air.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and business leaders were among those testifying
before two legislative committees meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, a leader of Texas' environmental commission
indicated his discomfort about two highly controversial programs
his agency is considering mandating for the Houston area _
restrictions on when people can use their vehicles and when
construction equipment can be operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, some way, we've got to find a way out of that,'' said
Jeff Saitas, executive director of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission. ``We've got to replace them with something
more acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and the Greater Houston Partnership, the area's leading
business organization, provided an assortment of recommendations at
the hearing for alternative ways to help reduce smog levels.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC is working on a plan, which it must submit for federal
approval by the end of the year, to bring ground-level ozone below
the federal health standard by 2007, a deadline set in the 1990
Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, smog's main ingredient and a respiratory irritant, forms
in sunlight in reactions of pollutants emitted by industries,
vehicles and many other sources.
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC studies indicate that meeting the ozone standard will
require major reductions in one key group of pollutants, nitrogen
oxides, by all types of emission sources. Agency officials say they
intend to order the biggest reductions at major industries
</P>
<P>
   Brown warned that this goal of a 90 percent nitrogen oxide
reduction by area plants could halt industrial growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the state of Texas to establish a set of tax and
financial incentives to facilitate the needed technological
innovations as well as the installation of pollution-control
equipment by the industrial sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Frels, an attorney who chairs the partnership's
Environment Advisory Committee, supported the plea for economic
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, he said, is to expand a constitutional
amendment, which was adopted in 1993 to provide a property tax
exemption for pollution-control facilities, to encourage both
businesses and home-owners to invest in smog-abatement equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Among other recommendations, Frels urged lawmakers to consider
delaying the opening of public schools in this area, perhaps until
after Labor Day, as another ozone-reducing action.
</P>
<P>
   Heat fosters the atmospheric chemical reactions that yield
ozone, and more violations of the ozone standard are traditionally
recorded in August than in any other month, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Houston surpassed Los Angeles last year to become the city with
the nation's worst smog. The city earned the distinction by
recording 44 days in which the ozone level exceeded federal
standards.

IS DEEPAK CHOPRA TOO CEREBRAL FOR `TODAY'? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California author and spiritual guru Deepak Chopra says an NBC
producer told him he was too brainy for the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic bummer, because Chopra flew all the way to New York two
weeks ago to promote his new book, ``How to Know God,'' on
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   His bad ``Today'' experience catapulted Chopra into a fit of
deep meditation and self-examination. He has recovered and resumed
his book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Chopra's live interview, scheduled for February 22, was bumped
for an interview with jilted TV groom Rick Rockwell _ or Rock
Rickwell, as he'd be known in porn films _ of ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multi-Millionaire'' notoriety. This was network TV; commerce
before God.
</P>
<P>
   So Katie Couric interviewed Chopra on tape instead. Chopra
figured it would air the next day. He was wrong. He says that after
the interview, a ``Today'' producer deemed Chopra too cerebral for
the show's viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Chopra lost Couric during the ``restful
awareness response'' part of the interview. But we might never
know; as of Tuesday, when Couric was busy reporting on her own
colonoscopy to screen for cancer, the Chopra segment still hadn't
been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' spokeswoman Allison Gollust said this week that
there's nothing unusual about shelving an author interview in favor
of timely news. Gollust said the interview still might air, and she
denied that anyone associated with the program told Chopra that he
was too smart for the show.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what Chopra heard because he said, in a subsequent
e-mail to friends and followers, that the incident led him into an
exploration of the ``seven biological responses'' he outlines in
his book.
</P>
<P>
   He would wonder, eventually, what Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Lao
Tsu, Moses and other figures would do ``in such a situation.''
Meaning, presumably, if they'd been bumped by the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Chopra says he first found himself in the throes of the
``fight/flight response,'' grumpy and wanting to confront his
``Today'' show oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   But few gurus _ the late Ayatollah Khomeini excepted _ can stew
for long. Chopra says he ``quickly moved into a `reactive
response,' with my ego wanting to assert control and seeking to
demonstrate how they were wrong and I was right. I stayed in the
reactive response all evening.''
</P>
<P>
   That could take a bite out of anyone's trip to the Big Apple.
Chopra says he woke up the next morning, went into meditation and
experienced the ``restful awareness response,'' a state of centered
awareness that ushered him into a fourth, ``intuitive response''
stage.
</P>
<P>
   He asked himself, ``What was the deeper significance of this
episode? The answer was immediate and obvious. The mainstream media
is stuck in an old paradigm while the world is moving into a new
one.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense. ``Today'' was stuck in an old paradigm. It
booked Rockwell after ``Good Morning America'' had already beaten
it to Darva Conger.
</P>
<P>
   Pondering old paradigms nudged Chopra into the ``creative
response'' stage, in which he realized that a whole new company
could ``develop a multimedia approach that will nurture people in
an evolutionary manner that acknowledges and supports their
relationship with the larger web of life.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure, but I think that's curtains for ``WWF
Smackdown!,'' and possibly for the entire UPN schedule. No, wait,
``Moesha'' stays.
</P>
<P>
   Chopra was reaching fever pitch. He leapt into the ``visionary
response'' stage, in which ``it became obvious to me that if we
could reach critical mass with a nurturing and evolutionary
message, the world would never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Much less the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Chopra says, ``I had a taste of the `sacred
response' through the experience of reverence and gratitude for a
God that makes things happen just as they are supposed to, and for
providing me the opportunity to witness how my reality changes in
different states of awareness. I felt love and appreciation for
everyone engaged in this little drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Me too, especially for Conger. If she hadn't dumped Rockwell,
and ``Today'' hadn't bumped Chopra to get Rockwell on the show, I
might not have had a Wednesday column.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that's a (set ital)bad(end ital) thing.

STUDENTS GETTING JUMP ON REGENTS EXAM REQUIREMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, the New York State Board of Regents
adopted a policy to require all graduating public high school
students to pass high-stakes Regents exams in English, math,
science, global studies and American history and government by
2004.
</P>
<P>
   But some students are not waiting that long.
</P>
<P>
   Though English is the only exam that is required for a diploma
this year, a majority of students across the state have already
taken and passed exams in the other four subjects, the state
education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, said Tuesday at an Albany
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are fulfilling their graduation requirements.
Others are just seeking a bright credential for their high school
transcript, because they will graduate before the new standards are
fully in effect. And still others are being prodded to take the
test by teachers who themselves are gathering experience for the
more rigorous teaching that will be required under the new
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the new data shows that the world of tougher standards
has already arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, flanked by Carl T. Hayden, the chancellor of the Board of
Regents, contended that the results signaled that students could
meet the state's tough new standards, despite warnings by critics
that moving to high-stakes testing would be calamitous. The
findings, released as part of the state's annual school report
cards, outline and compare school performance from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are doing far better than many predicted two years
ago,'' Mills said. ``Many are doing well on tests they don't have
to pass this year. Others need extra help, and they must get that
help.'
</P>
<P>
   The reality on the ground may be more subtle than that, however.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Liebrader, principal of Grover Cleveland High School in
Ridgewood, Queens, said that some students at his school were
rushing to complete the examinations before the passing score rose.
During a four-year transition period, the Regents lowered the
minimum passing grade for the exams to 55 out of 100, from 65. But
a 65 grade for each test will eventually be required.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increased number of kids taking the Regents, but
we've always encouraged our kids to take them,'' Liebrader said.
``It looks better when a kid applies to college to have a Regents
diploma. It all adds up.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said Tuesday that students were not doing better and
that whole swaths of students were not represented in the results,
especially in New York City, because they had been held back, had
dropped out or had left the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this realistically reflects what's happening,''
said Norma Gluck, a former Regent who helped pave the way for the
new standards but has recently asked the board to postpone the plan
for two years, contending that students should not be required to
meet a single, uniform standard. ``It just seems to me there are a
lot of young people who are not included.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City has traditionally lagged behind schools elsewhere
in the state, and it did so again on the results released Tuesday.
Statewide, 83 percent of high school students have taken the global
studies test and 71 percent have passed. In New York City, 68
percent have taken the global studies test and 50 percent have
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the city's high school students have taken the
English Regents, but only 69 percent have passed compared with 80
percent statewide, the statistics show. The results are somewhat
better for New York City's seniors. In this year's graduating
class, 88 percent of the students have passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   This year's graduating class is the first to be required to pass
the stricter new English Regents exam. Some students took the exam
in January, but the results for that test have not been released.
Seniors will have two more chances to pass the English test.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 99 out of every 100 students have taken the math
Regents and 72 percent have passed, news that Mills trumpeted. But
he was disheartened by New York City's performance. Eighty-seven
percent of the city's high school students took the math exam, but
only 47 percent passed. The performance dovetails with findings by
City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who released a report showing that
more students were taking the math Regents, but more were failing.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's seniors will be required to pass the math exam to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that one reason for the large number of failures in
math in New York City was that students were not being adequately
prepared in the middle grades, with students performing poorly on
the new statewide eighth grade math test. Another reason, he said,
is that New York City has 10,000 uncertified teachers throughout
the system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pattern was pretty much the same in American history and in
biology, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of all high school students throughout the
state took the American history and government exam and 64 percent
passed. Fifty-eight percent of New York City's high school students
took the exam and 44 percent passed. In biology, 64 percent of all
high school students took the exam last year and 55 percent passed.
The graduation requirement in science can be met using any Regents
examination in science. Because most New York City students opt to
use tests other than biology, like earth science, comparison
figures were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Though performance varies regionally, Mills said he was pleased
that students were being encouraged to take Regents courses and
pass the exams long before they were required. Most students, it
appears, are taking the exams just after or during the course.
</P>
<P>
   Regents math is offered in the ninth and 10th grades. Global
studies is offered in the 10th grade and American history is
offered in the 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he planned to work with Harold O. Levy, the interim
schools chancellor, on trying to increase state aid and improve
teacher recruitment to help students better prepare for the Regents
exams. Report cards released Tuesday showed a significant increase
in the dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this system can provide students with a longer
instructional program and more certified teachers, our school
report cards will continue to paint a disappointing portrait,''
Levy said in a prepared statement. ``Too many of our students read
below grade level, fail Regents exams and need to spend more than
four years in high school.''

   Dow Industrials Drop 3.7 Percent on Worries About Profits
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 374.47 points, or 3.7
percent, to 9,796.03, on investor fears that rising oil prices
combined with higher interest rates may do significant damage to
corporate profits. Broader market averages fared a bit better. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.6 percent of its value,
and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline began when Procter &AMP; Gamble said that its earnings
in the current quarter would come in well below Wall Street
expectations. Adding to investor anxiety, oil prices soared to
$34.10 a barrel.

TRACKING DAVID GEFFEN'S RUTHLESS RISE TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID WIEGAND  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Press reports on the eve of Tuesday's release of Tom King's
controversial biography of entertainment mogul David Geffen have
the book's subject raging against the tome and ruing the day he
ever granted King interviews for ``The Operator.''
</P>
<P>
   But readers of King's detailed portrait of Hollywood's premier
manipulator may actually wonder if Geffen's fury isn't a brilliant
ploy to draw attention to himself by helping the book's sales.
After all, who wants to read a biography whose subject actually
approved of it? If Geffen really hates the book, it must be filled
with dirt. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Operator'' is as much a composite portrait of the
``New Hollywood'' of its subtitle as it is of the 57-year-old
partner in DreamWorks SKG, whose hardscrabble Brooklyn childhood
convinced him that the best revenge wasn't only living well, but
getting revenge itself. Monstrous though King often makes Geffen
out to be, he is clearly not alone in the moral tar pits of the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Geffen is seen here repeatedly bullying, outmaneuvering
and crushing men who are in his way as he scampers nimbly upward
from the William Morris Agency mailroom, into the lower echelon of
the TV industry, then into the recording and film industries.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also clear that Geffen is merely one master of a very
popular game in Hollywood. Not only do his competitors employ
similar tactics, but many of them also find themselves admiring and
even working with Geffen again after he's ground them into the
dirt. His idols, like Atlantic Records' Ahmet Ertegun, and enemies,
like super-agent Michael Ovitz and Columbia Records' Clive Davis,
all play tough in the high-stakes entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Though it sounds like a line from a bad film, King reports that
while taking his first limo ride to bury his 57-year-old father,
18-year-old David remarked: ``You know ... nobody knows that we're
not rich ... We could be rich riding in this limousine.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Oliver Twist has evolved into Citizen Kane.
From the music business, Geffen made a preliminary stab at films
and fell on his face. But with the money and power amassed by
buying and selling record labels, he took the plunge into films
again and scored big-time with hits such as ``Risky Business'' and
``Interview With the Vampire.'' He saw the century out as a partner
with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg in DreamWorks, an
entertainment hydra involved in film, television and music.
</P>
<P>
   King, an entertainment industry reporter for the Wall Street
Journal, packs his fat biography with detailed descriptions of how
Geffen amassed a fortune estimated at $2.7 billion. We find
ourselves repeatedly aghast at Geffen's amoral compulsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he wanted to renegotiate Geffen Records' deal with
parent company Warner Bros. Records. He knew that his old friend Mo
Ostin was tough to bargain with. So he engineered the end of their
friendship. That would, and did, leave him free to negotiate with
Warner's Steve Ross, who rarely denied his protege Geffen anything.
Geffen destroyed the friendship by taking Ostin's wife to lunch and
telling her that her husband didn't really care about her.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Geffen exercised his skills for the sake of hollow
vengeance alone. While producing the girl-meets-girl sports film
``Personal Best,'' Geffen clashed so violently with director Robert
Towne that he exacted vindication ``in a move so Machiavellian that
it could have fit into a scene in Towne's script for `Chinatown.'''
As the film neared completion, Geffen threatened to pull out unless
Towne signed a contract for two more films. That may sound like an
olive branch, but according to King, Geffen knew that the two films
would never be made and that Towne's career would be ruined because
he would be obligated to Geffen until they were.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is a strong undercurrent of sadness beneath
Geffen's complex surface. We see it in his struggles with his
sexuality, which drew him to relationships with women such as Cher
and Marlo Thomas as he tried to deny his homosexuality. He
eventually came out in grand style at an event honoring him for his
AIDS donations.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, mostly in recent years, that Geffen has shown
generosity on the same level as his monomania. He abruptly ended
feuds with ex-colleagues like agent Sue Mengers when they've been
in trouble, and he's a tireless contributor to AIDS and other
charities.
</P>
<P>
   There is a telling moment in ``The Operator'' when Geffen, as
the producer of ``Risky Business,'' fought director Paul Brickman's
plan to have the young entrepreneur played by Tom Cruise lose
everything because of his manipulative ways. Geffen insisted on a
happy ending in which the character gets into Princeton and walks
into a figuratively golden sunset. The new ending, King writes, was
a mirror of how Geffen saw his own life story: ``If you maneuver
enough, you can get away with anything, and winning is easy. It
does not matter if you tell the truth, cheat on a test, or step on
people on your way to the top. It only matters if you win.''
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start, DreamWorks seems to be fairly stable now.
Geffen's still making millions and squiring pretty young men half
his age around town. And, by the way, Mo Ostin, the man whose
friendship Geffen intentionally destroyed? Geffen hired him five
years ago to head DreamWorks' music division.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual, King writes, in the New Hollywood: ``People he
tangled with returned time and again for more. Alternately
exasperating and exhilarating, some people found Geffen to be like
an intoxicating drug. The high was indescribable, despite the fact
that it would likely be followed by a wicked hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooray for the New Hollywood.

COMMENTARY: MR. RIGHT BECOMES MR. RECTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some campaigns are about winning and some are about losing.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for John McCain to prove that big money corrupts
politics is for his candidacy to be destroyed by big money. The
best way to show how much he rocked the pillars of the Republican
Party is for those pillars to crush him.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator wasn't running a campaign so much as an
auto-da-fe, with himself as the martyr in the flames.
</P>
<P>
   He called Big Tobacco ``jerks.'' He ranted that the people
running Bob Jones University were ``idiots.'' He blasted the
televangelists of the right as ``evil.'' He dubbed his own party
establishment ``the death star.'' He mocked his colleagues in
Congress by christening Washington ``the city of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   His heroic life story was about enduring suffering, which was
stirring. But his campaign was also about enduring suffering, and
that was irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an America that worships victimhood, you can't run for
president as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   As his prolix, caffeinated bus sped through Manhattan, McCain
railed against Sam Wyly, the Texas businessman and Bush contributor
who saturated New York, California and Ohio with ads trashing
McCain's environmental record and promoting George W. Bush's lame
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a textbook study,'' he said. ``This whole thing is the
most perfect example of why I have been so zealous in my pursuit of
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. A third party should not be able to come into a
primary state and drop millions to sway voters with misleading ads.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was not satisfied with merely being right about
sleazy pro-Bush tactics. He tried to make his rightness into the
only rationale of his campaign. In Boston, exhorting a crowd to
rebel against the Wyly ads, he echoed the 1996 Bob Dole line about
Clinton campaign finance abuses: ``Where's the outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work for Dole. And John McCain, who was at his side in
'96, should have known it wouldn't work for him in 2000. Voters do
not respond to mere rectitude. They want to know, in concrete
terms, what you are going to do for them.
</P>
<P>
   The senator kept saying he didn't want to fall into self-pity or
negative attacks. But then he fell into self-pity and negative
attacks. He kept saying he didn't want to act like Bill Bradley,
and make the race about his own moral superiority. But then he
acted like Bill Bradley and made the race about his own moral
superiority. On his bus last Friday, McCain sounded almost wistful.
``If I made a mistake in this campaign, it's because I allowed
myself to be diverted over tactics,'' he said. ``The ability to
inspire young Americans is what this campaign is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He started out with a bracing message about casting the
money-changers out of Washington. But he ended up aggrieved, and he
wanted reporters and voters to feel aggrieved with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became bitter and angry,'' says Frank Luntz, the Republican
pollster. ``Someone around him should have said, `Senator, stop,
you're becoming just another politician.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain confused virtue with substance. He got so absorbed in his
performance as Luke Skywalker that he forgot about the issues. In a
weird way, he became as contentless as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The senator went beyond making the case that the Bush campaign
played out of bounds. He took the smarmy tactics too personally,
and tried to make the case that he was good and everyone who
opposed him was evil. His righteousness slowly morphed into a kind
of narcissism, in which he became the personification of everything
worth voting for.
</P>
<P>
   He was a crusader, and crusaders are easily outplayed. The Bush
strategy was to gaslight the volatile senator. They always knew
that when they turned up the heat, McCain would become inflamed.
Sure enough, his campaign began to seem like a huge inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   His extreme language and defensive tone alienated the voters who
once found him exciting. He thought he was showing them his
strength, but he was showing them his weakness.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody finds weakness exciting for very long.

WITH A SUPER VOTE, NORMALCY RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rebellion's over.
</P>
<P>
   For a giddy few months the country flirted with romantic
notions. It tried on insurrection for size. It test drove reform.
But in the end _ and this morning it looks as if the nomination
struggles are all but ended _ the nation returned to the politics
of the sturdy and steady.
</P>
<P>
   And, after millions of dollars were spent, millions of words
written, millions of soundbites issued, the fight for the right to
move into the White House next January returned to where it
started: a struggle between Vice President Al Gore and Governor
George W. Bush _ two scions of important political families, two
favorites of their respective party establishments, two centrists.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley, who may leave the Democratic race
as early as Wednesday, and Senator John McCain, who may not yet be
ready to exit the Republican race, brought frisson, excitement and
new ideas to the campaign. And though the two _ imperfect
messangers with important messages _ suffered massive defeats in
ballotting across the nation Tuesday, their ideas already have been
coopted by the establishment candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The two insurrectionists put the frontrunners on the defensive,
prompted them to cloak themselves in the raiment of reform, tested
their toughness and their mettle _ and forced them to reveal
aspects of their political styles and characters that underlined
their weaknesses even as they revealed their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the two men who stand in the sharpest relief after
the nation's first continent-wide primary are not Bush and Gore but
Bradley and McCain, both of whom campaigned against the power of
big-money interests, both of whom finally succumbed to the power of
that money and those interests. Gore and Bush endured more than
prevailed, Gore wearing down Bradley in weeks of relentless
assaults against the former senator's health-care plan and Bush
surviving long enough so that his remarkable treasury could
overwhelm McCain in a contest whose demands far exceeded the
Arizonan's resources and his fabled ability to survive politically
from day to day, and state to state.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the delegate leaders and likely nominees in the two
parties are more similar than different, both familiar, both
scripted, both baby boomers, both Ivy Leaguers, both famous for
being unexciting and unexcitable.
</P>
<P>
   And both have survived. Party leaders like to say that rough
nomination fights make their nominees stronger, but that's seldom
true and probably isn't true this year, either. Both Bush and Gore
were forced to fight for what they believed was their birthright.
In baseball terms, they won ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was long the favorite of Republican elected officials, who
liked the idea the Bush candidacy _ a conciliatory persona with an
appealing, mainstream message _ more than any ideas the Texas
governor had. Indeed, they had little notion of what kind of
candidate he might be.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's devastating defeat in New Hampshire only five weeks ago
denied him the easy stroll to the nomination that his strategists
planned and that his supporters thought they were financing.
Instead, he's battle-scarred and weary. The challenges of the
campaign didn't so much enhance Bush as raise questions about him
that he will have to answer should he go up against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for his Democratic counterpart. Gore
trailed Bradley in New Hampshire in the fall, but in battling back
and winning a slender (but, it turned out, critical) victory in the
Granite State, he was forced to slash his rival, fight for his
liberal credentials and defend himself against attacks on his own
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Both men emerged as candidates who seemed willing to win no
matter what it took, or how much it cost. For both of them, the
cost was high. Bush lost his image as a naif only to find himself
battling an image that he pandered to leaders of the
religious-conservative movement and was insensitive to Catholics
and minority voters. Gore lost his image as a altar boy only to
find himself battling an image that he would stretch the truth and
distort a rival's record.
</P>
<P>
   So now _ and politics is full of ironies like these _ Bush and
Gore spent the night in triumph, but in prevailing they have
created even more formidable obstacles for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile _ another irony _ McCain and Bradley suffered personal
defeats but saw the ideas they trumpeted gain attention, scrutiny _
and support.
</P>
<P>
   But the winners from Super Tuesday 2000 were Gore and Bush. The
rebellion was riveting while it lasted. But spring's about to begin
and the fling is over.

WITH BALLOTS STILL BEING CAST, TV WRITES OFF 2 CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 8th graf to insert Dan Rather quote and adds 4 grafs at end) 
(bl) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eulogies began at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even he sounded uncertain his campaign would survive,'' said
John King, the CNN correspondent assigned to Sen. John McCain, just
after 5 p.m., as the cable network's Super Tuesday coverage got
underway.
</P>
<P>
   King's CNN colleague, Jeanne Meserve, was equally downbeat about
the candidate on her watch, Bill Bradley. She reported that he had
spent the day ``trying not to appear that the handwriting was on
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   So went the gloomy preambles to an evening of primary election
returns on television and the Net, a night that progressed as a
kind of death knell for insurgency in the 2000 campaign. Across the
networks and the all-news cable channels, the punditcasts and the
political Web sites, the commentary and the reporting concentrated
on the next-step questions: when would McCain and Bradley make
their exits, and which of the survivors, Gov. George W. Bush or
Vice President Al Gore, would have a tougher time uniting his
party? And this was before the first vote was counted, at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson, the host of an hourlong show on MSNBC, said at 5:36
p.m. that polls had showed that McCain was ``going to come up
short.'' At 5:55, Chris Matthews said to Gibson, ``Right now, I
think it's not going to be McCain. I don't think he's done what he
had to do, which was upset the heir apparent of the Republican
party.'' At just after 6 p.m. _ three hours before the New York
polls closed _ Marcia Kramer was reporting on the CBS affiliate in
New York an ominous exit poll trend for McCain: that Catholic
voters in the state were backing his opponent by 49 percent to 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls have become such a sophisticated craft _ and the
commentators so confident in the projected outcomes _ that election
night coverage now has an odd seamlessness, a sense of expectations
fulfilled before the viewer digests the very first statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the competition to call the races in the early hours of
the coverage was something of a yawn. At 7 p.m., for example, when
polls closed in the first of the 16 states to report, Georgia and
Vermont, the network and all-news cable channels went on the air
with identical reports: Georgia in the Gore and Bush columns,
Vermont for McCain and the Democratic race there too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia peach goes to Bush,'' declared Dan Rather of CBS.
`Goregantuan!'' was the headline posted on the ABC News Web site
after Gore swept four or five more states in the coast-to-coast
shellacking he was dealing Bradley. CBS, NBC and ABC broke in each
half-hour, with more races to call; the heavy-duty analysis was
left to the bevy of commentators recruited for cable, where the
pundits essentially dismissed Bradley's chances and set the bar for
McCain at a surprise victory somewhere, like Missouri or Ohio, to
prove that he was not a regional candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When those did not materialize, the political talkers on
television were writing McCain off, even though Californians were
still voting and New York remained a tossup. ``McCain had to do two
things simultaneously, appeal to independents and Democrats, and
reassure Republicans,'' said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of
the House, on the Fox News Channel at 9:10 p.m. ``He only got one
of those jobs done. He closed the door on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   How, a viewer might have wondered, had McCain sunk so far so
fast? ``A lot of reporters fear severe withdrawal in their lives if
John McCain loses,'' observed Fred Barnes on Fox. Dick Morris, the
political consultant, suggested the senator lost the race back in
South Carolina, when he failed to respond to Bush's newly
aggressive campaign. To McCain, Morris offered ``the Mike Dukakis
award: he did not answer an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels all had moments of insight. On CNN, Candy
Crowley reported after the first polls closed that the Bush
campaign would perhaps look to Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a friend
of both candidates, to ``play some sort of role'' of mediation
between the estranged rivals. On MSNBC, Lisa Myers got an advance
bite from Bush's victory speech, in which she reported that he
would suggest that ``soon our party will unite.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fox scored a bit of a coup by snaring the first television
interview of the night with Pat Robertson, the televangelist who
came under attack from McCain in a speech delivered in the
preacher's home town. Robertson said he was out of the country,
``on a humanitarian mission in Mexico'' when McCain spoke in
Virginia Beach, Va., calling him and the Rev. Jerry Falwell
``agents of intolerance.'' ``I was just absolutely dumbfounded,''
he said. Robertson subscribed to the consensus of Republican
commentary, that McCain's speech was a kamikaze mission: ``To
attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some oddities of the evening as well. Fox, for
instance, was tabulating results from Massachusetts in the
``crawl'' at the bottom of its screen 20 minutes before the polls
there closed.
</P>
<P>
   Much less time was devoted to the Democratic race, although
virtually every station ran footage of Hillary Clinton, at a
polling place in Chappaqua, N.Y., where she cast her first ballot
as a New York resident. ``I voted for Al Gore,'' she said, which
placed her firmly in the majority.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ He is 88 years old, he had a stroke and
underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery last year. But he still
drives to the racetrack every morning before dawn, and he is the
breeder, owner and trainer of a barn of about 20 horses, mostly
claimers. But one of them ran first in the Holy Bull Stakes at 40-1
and second in the Fountain of Youth, and is now considered one of
the favorites for Saturday's Florida Derby and maybe even for the
Kentucky Derby eight weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The man is Harold Rose, and his horse is Hal's Hope. The only
thing that bothers Rose is that for all of the above reasons,
people seem more interested in him than in his horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might win,'' Rose ventures, working his horse into the
conversation. ``He has the potential to win. If you're not an
optimist, you shouldn't be in racing.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want more evangelism than that, Rose is quick to comply,
looking forward with clear vision despite his 88 years. ``If you
don't have the dream,'' he says, ``you don't want to be in racing.
The dream is the basis for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams come in all sizes, but they generally come in extra large
for a man who breeds and sells mostly claimers, less desirable
horses who can be claimed for a price when they are racing. As a
breeder, he controls the horses in his barn at Calder Race Course
near Gulfstream Park, where the Florida Derby will be run. As a
trainer, he controls them as racehorses. As an owner, he may keep
some special ones for himself _ like Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mostly claimers,'' he said. ``I did have one horse in
the Swale Stakes in 1984, Rexson's Hope. He was strictly a
come-from-behind runner. In the Kentucky Derby that year, he didn't
have much chance. He closed to be 10th. It was probably my greatest
thrill in racing. I thought: If I ever get there again. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is 16 years and a lot of claimers later, and he has a
shot at getting to the Kentucky Derby again, with Hal's Hope. Yes,
Hal's Hope means exactly what it says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bred him, his dam was by Rexson's Hope,'' Rose said. ``I
really thought this horse was going to be something from the
beginning. I thought he was something special when he was a
yearling. So, I named him for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The special name for the special horse did not look so promising
when Hal's Hope ran fifth in his debut and sixth in his second
start. He is a dark bay or brown colt sired by Jolie's Halo and his
dam is Mia's Hope, and he finally won a race at Calder in his third
start. But he ran fifth the next time out before fulfilling
whatever it was that Rose saw when he came up with the name Hal's
Hope.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he won an allowance at Calder, then in January
faced the big boys in the Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   He won by five and a quarter lengths. If you bet $2 on him, you
went home with $82.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he went off at 40-1,'' Rose mused later. ``I
wasn't afraid of the other horses in the race. I tried to tell
everybody that I had the best horse down here. But it looks like
nobody believed me.''
</P>
<P>
   More people believed him when Hal's Hope stalked High Yield
throughout the Fountain of Youth two weeks ago after being bumped
at the start, and then missed catching him by three and a quarter
lengths. His jockey, as in all of his seven races, was Roger Velez.
The public had eyes only for Rose.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Newark and graduated from Bucknell University
with a degree in mathematics, working mainly in printing and
publishing but also dabbling in horse racing. When he retired in
1968, he took out a trainer's license in New Jersey, moved his
family and his stable to Florida in the 1970s and became a
full-time racetracker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a heart attack and a slight stroke last year,'' Rose
said. ``I had quadruple-bypass surgery. But so far, I'm fine now. I
still keep going. I'm still at the barn every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose is making one change for the Florida Derby: Hal's Hope will
run on the diuretic Lasix for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gurgled pulling up the other day,'' Rose related. ``He
didn't bleed externally, but there was something internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, visitors don't seem as interested in the horse's medical
condition as in the trainer's. You know, 88 years old, a man who
breeds claimers and sells them for a living, but occasionally keeps
one special horse for his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go on the road normally,'' he said. ``I used to race
on the Jersey circuit. I've nominated him for the Blue Grass Stakes
in Kentucky. It depends on how strenuous the Florida Derby is.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant how strenuous for the horse, not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the dream,'' Harold Rose repeated, ``you
don't want to be in racing.''

<P>
   Circus history is littered with the bodies of its daredevils,
some lying not far from their equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Zazel, the first known human cannonball, died in 1919 in London
when she missed the net. Elvin Bale, doing the stunt at a Hong Kong
amusement park in 1987, was paralyzed when, because of an error
involving his test sandbag _ it had been left out in the rain,
rendering it considerably heavier than Bale _ he overshot the air
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Bale had his accident, as it happened, about the time that Jon
Weiss, Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey's current human
cannonball, as well as a longtime clown, was learning his craft.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bale's accident cause Weiss to reconsider?
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly did,'' says Weiss, 37, a warm, broad-shouldered
man with a surprisingly sunny disposition. ``You start questioning
yourself, `Is this the right job for me?' But I didn't want to miss
out on the opportunity. Clowning, you reach a certain level, but
specialty acts, especially daredevil acts, you have longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Career concerns, very commendable, Weiss. And yet there must be
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notoriety, you know what I mean? It's the  &UR; cannon &LR;  act. How
many people you know are shot out of a cannon?''
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to be a human cannonball like Weiss, who lives
in Port Jefferson, N.Y., and can be seen with the circus this month
at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., and Madison Square
Garden in Manhattan? Knee pads, a back brace, an ability to roll
nicely into the net in a somersault, landing on your shoulders,
which are precariously close to your neck. Also you should allow
for at least two and a half hours after eating before being shot
100 feet across the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, however, does not perform only the cannonball. He also
balances things on his chin: a chair, a ladder, and finally,
terrifyingly, an active buzz saw.
</P>
<P>
   Care to tell us about the first time you tried this, Weiss? It's
not a stunt that seems to allow a large margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, that's an interesting story. Kenneth Feld,'' the
circus' producer, ``and Tim Holst,'' vice president for talent,
``came to me and asked if I could balance a running chain saw. They
wanted something thrilling. I bought the chain saw, but I never
tried it. When you rev up a chain saw it's got a lot of torque.
They kept asking me, `Did you do it yet?' So one day, in Tim's
office, I said, `OK, I'm going to balance it right now.' It was
pretty wild. The top of the saw is three inches from the ceiling,
the room is filling up with smoke. I just psyched myself up and did
it. From then on, I let my hands go longer and longer away. I don't
like to practice outside the show. If I'm gonna get hurt at all,
I'd rather do it for a paying audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment, now, and try to balance your pen on your nose.
Come on, it's New York, no one will even notice. Jon Weiss can do
it, from months of practice as a child in his room. Growing up in
Selden on Long Island, both Jon and his older brother were sent
often to their room by their father, who had a small trucking
company. Jon's older brother passed the time by doing magic tricks,
escaped from home at 18, and is now a professional magician in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' father was a tough guy?
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, whose parents divorced when he was 12, stares out into
the empty arena where an hour earlier people were screaming for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father,'' he says. A long pause. ``It was one of those
things.'' He laughs without humor. ``You know.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited him to see what I do. When I got shot out of the
cannon, he just sat there like this.'' Weiss puts his chin in his
hand, does bored. ``Not interested. So, you know, what's the point?
My mother was the supportive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we need Ringmaster Freud, of the thrilling, chilling, Circus
of the Unconscious, to announce what happens when Dad is an
impossible room to play? Is that not he, in his top hat, shouting,
``A lifelong search for applause, dots vaht happens!'' As for the
cannon thing, don't even think of going there.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, anyway, finds the attention he craves at Centereach High,
balancing cafeteria tables on his chin. He also finds love, with a
classmate, Laura Litts. On an outing to Six Flags, Weiss invites
Litts to join him on the roller coaster, and though she hates the
roller coaster, she accepts. When he graduates from Ringling's
Clown College and is offered a job, she goes with him. The
showgirls teach Litts to dance and she, too, becomes a performer.
</P>
<P>
   They marry in 1986, just before a 1:30 performance, in the
center ring at Madison Square Garden. The bridesmaids are
elephants, the ring bearer  &UR; is &LR;  a bear, Weiss arrives in a clown
car. Describing his wife coming toward him under a 40-foot canopy
of white balloons, in a white feathered headpiece, he becomes
teary.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are three little Weisses, the latest, Max, born a week
ago Monday. Beaming, Weiss brings out the pictures. His wife, the
month before her delivery, had to stay at home on Long Island,
Weiss recalls, so he drove from Richmond, Va., where the circus was
playing, every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The daredevil can balance a buzz saw on his chin, he can be shot
from a cannon. But being separated from his wife for a month would
have been too much stress.

MURPHY AND IRISH LOOKING FOR MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Notre Dame might not have the best team in the Big
East tournament this week, but it will have the player honored as
the best in the conference. He is Troy Murphy, the sophomore
forward from New Jersey, who will lead the Fighting Irish against
Rutgers Wednesday night in what promises to be the most interesting
matchup of four first-round games at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was named conference player of the year Tuesday night
before a banquet at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. The coach
of the year was Jim Boeheim of Syracuse, the rookie of the year was
Troy Bell of Boston College and the defensive player of the year
was Etan Thomas of Syracuse. Two players tied for the most improved
player: Ricardo Greer of Pittsburgh and Shaheen Holloway of Seton
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 21.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, Murphy led the
resurgent Irish to a record of 17-13 over all and 8-8 in the
conference under Matt Doherty, their rookie coach.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant victories over Connecticut (twice), St.
John's and Ohio State, the Irish were only .500 in league play, and
they lost to Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame _ along with Seton Hall and Villanova _ are
considered to be teams that need good showings in this tournament
to qualify for the 64-team National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exceeded all expectations this year, but one more
thing we want to accomplish this year is to play in the NCAA,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The three top seeded teams _ Syracuse, Miami and St. John's _
are expected to be selected by the NCAA, and all have byes
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the defending Big East and NCAA champion, which
should also make the NCAA field, opens against Boston College
Wednesday afternoon. In other games Wednesday, West Virginia plays
Georgetown, Seton Hall plays Providence and Villanova plays
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In Notre Dame's only game against Rutgers, Murphy fouled out,
something he did only one other time. The Scarlet Knights played
him rough and beat the Irish 76-51.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play any team that you lost to by a lot of
points,'' Murphy said. ``It's nice to get a chance. I'll be better
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the inconsistency of Notre Dame's season,
Murphy replied: ``We're young, and we don't have the maturity yet
to handle big wins. After we beat a UConn or something or St.
John's, we lose to a team in the lesser half of our league.
Hopefully, as we get older, we get better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being chosen as most valuable player in the conference,
Murphy called it ``a great honor. With all the great players in
this conference, I'm lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall (19-8, 10-6) enters the tournament with a better
record than Notre Dame. But the Pirates lost their last four league
games and played a weaker schedule overall. Their coach, Tommy
Amaker, said that a week off following a season-ending loss to St.
John's is a mixed blessing because his players needed to get
``healthy, rested and better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing contradicts the other two,'' Amaker said. ``We
try to get them to remember why we were good and not that the
bottom is falling out because we lost a few.''
</P>
<P>
   As for NCAA tournament speculation, Amaker said: ``It surrounds
us. Everybody talks about it. Our mood will greatly improve when we
win. We're a fragile team. We've got to get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   For Villanova (18-11, 8-8), aa victory over Pittsburgh in
Wednesday's 9:30 p.m. finale would send the Wildcats against St.
John's in the last game of the quarterfinals Thursday night. The
Notre Dame-Rutgers winner plays Miami. The Seton Hall-Providence
winner plays either Connecticut or Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Should Notre Dame get by both Rutgers and Miami, the Irish could
face St. John's in a semifinal on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley, the point guard of the Red Storm, is the only
other sophomore with Murphy on the all-conference team. Recalling
Notre Dame's 73-60 victory over the Red Storm on Jan. 29, Barkley
said: ``You would never think we'd go down to Notre Dame and lose
to Notre Dame. But any team on any given night can beat anybody. I
consider Notre Dame a Cinderella team. I think they'll be in the
NCAA tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, under Coach John McLeod, Notre Dame finished with a
14-16 record, 8-10 in the league. The Irish have not been in the
NCAA tournament for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're kind of having a year like we had last year,''
Barkley said. ``They're doing real well. They are on the rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Barkley and Murphy are coy about a major decision that will
come soon. Should they remain in college or declare for the
professional draft?
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he has not decided, and Murphy said: ``I don't
know. I'll sit down and talk to coach at the end of the season, and
we will decide from there.'' But, as he accepted his award last
night, Murphy addressed his coach and said ``I just look forward to
next year.''

SUPER TUESDAY ALL BUT LOCKS IT UP FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who began his presidential odyssey as the
sure-fire Republican front-runner only to suffer a series of
damaging defeats, took a giant leap toward securing the nomination
Tuesday by winning key coast-to-coast primaries against his
insurgent rival, Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In one vital state, New York, the contest was neck-and-neck as
early results were reported, with the outcome possibly determing
whether McCain remains in the race. Elsewhere, McCain had hoped for
a surprise showing in Ohio or Missouri, but Bush won both states.
Bush also easily took Georgia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose campaign took off after a huge victory in New
Hampshire five weeks ago, had his strongest showing Tuesday in New
England, winning Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island and
Connecticut, according to exit surveys and early returns. But Bush
won Maine, where his family has a summer home in Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself the presumptive nominee,'' Bush, the
governor of Texas, said in Austin. ``I consider myself a huge step
closer and will work hard to secure the nomination. I think it's
great . . . a victory for a message that is positive, inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who plans to spend Wednesday assessing his campaign at
his vacation home in Sedona, Ariz., said he remained hopeful about
his chances. ``Clearly our message of reform has had a powerful
impact,'' McCain said in a statement from his hotel in Beverly
Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear we have done very well on the East Coast and I am
deeply grateful for the strong support our campaign is receiving
throughout the states of New England and the Northeast,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the son of the former president, hoped to score his
biggest victory in California, with his eye on winning all 162
delegates, while McCain hoped for at least a moral victory by
winning California's popular vote that allows Democrats and and
independents to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who relied on independent and Democrats to score
some early victories, remained notably weak among Republicans.
Moreover, the exit polls showed that McCain's attack on Christian
Coalition leader Pat Robertson as an ``agent of intolerance'' may
have backfired. Voters who identified themselves as religious
conservatives overwhelmingly supported Bush, while McCain did not
get a significant enough boost among those who said they were not
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did win some support among Catholics in the wake of his
attack on Bush for speaking at Bob Jones University, whose leaders
have said Catholicism is a ``cult.'' But it was not enough in many
states for McCain to beat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, which McCain won easily with votes from
independents, he narrowly trailed Bush among Republicans, according
to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a case of the Bush campaign employing a longterm
strategy, bringing massive amounts of resources and applying them
in a methodical manner, which, over time, overwhelmed the McCain
hit-and-run campaign,'' said Republican strategist Rich Galen.
``It's like a football team with a very good ground game. Sooner or
later they're going to grind you down and put the ball in the end
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strength was evident among first-time voters, who made
up 15 percent of the electorate. He won that group by a 2-to-1
margin, according to a cross-sampling of Tuesday's exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's weakness, however, was evident in Ohio, which the
senator's aides said until recently could be the site of a McCain
upset. The McCain campaign hoped the open primary in Ohio would be
similar to Michigan, which McCain won two weeks ago with the
support of independents and Democrats. But Ohio, unlike Michigan,
had a concurrent Democratic primary, so most Democrats didn't vote
in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   While more than half of those voting in Michigan were not
Republican, 70 percent of those voting in Tuesday's GOP primary in
Ohio were Republicans. Only 7 percent were Democrats. As a result,
Bush used his strength among Republicans to gain a decisive victory
over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attack on the religious right also hurt McCain in Ohio.
Twenty-three percent of Ohio voters called themselves religious
conservatives, with three-quarters of them backing Bush, according
to the exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush met with aides at the Governor's Mansion in Texas,
while McCain made a final round of calls to radio shows. The
senator spent much of the day in his suite at the Beverly Hilton
hotel, surrounded by family, friends, and aides who had flown in
from around the country to be with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to have these primaries,'' McCain quipped on one
radio show. ``It gives me a chance to see my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to hammer away at Bush because of
advertisements paid for by two Texas friends of the governor, one
of them a campaign fund-raiser. McCain called the commercials,
which criticized his record on the environment, ``a violation of
every principle I've been voting for in campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain defended his appeal to Democrats and independents, who so
far have been the lifeblood of his campaign. He said he believes
those who voted for him in the primaries would stay loyal to him if
he became the nominee. Any other scenario would be ``too cynical a
view of Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Americans are looking for something they haven't
had in a while,'' he said. ``I can't tell you how proud I am to
have sparked this kind of prairie fire out there that's getting
people involved. Especially our rallies are so full of young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he lagged in polls in most states in recent days, McCain
was optimistic Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a very competitive position,'' he told his
radio interviewer. ``I think we're going to win New York. All the
models were knocked into a cocked hat because of the huge turnout.
The one thing we've done in this campaign is energize voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the results in the Super Tuesday primaries, McCain
and his aides said the senator intends to compete in Friday's
primaries in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. After resting at his home
in Sedona, Ariz., McCain plans to campaign Thursday in Colorado,
where he trails Bush in the polls. McCain media strategist Mike
Murphy said the campaign bought $200,000 in advertising in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who arrived in Austin, Texas, at 2 a.m., went for a jog
and told reporters he would try to make amends with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primaries can be tough because we are arguing amongst a
political family,'' Bush said. ``But there's going to be ample time
to heal any wounds, and I'm confident we can heal any wounds that
may exist between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was looking ahead to a general election contest,
mocking Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, as a
candidate who ``changes his message, changes his headquarters,
changes his suits.''

GERMAN BANK IN TALKS TO BUY RIVAL

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a move that could lead to one of the
biggest job reductions yet in Europe, Deutsche Bank AG plans to
acquire a big German domestic rival, Dresdner Bank AG, people close
to the deal said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is already the largest bank in Europe in terms of
assets and the world's second largest behind the pending
combination of three big Japanese banks. If a deal to purchase
Dresdner Bank goes through, Deutsche Bank would become a far bigger
No. 2, with more than $1.2 trillion in assets, about twice the size
of Citigroup, the largest bank in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Tuesday that if the deal _ potentially worth
more than $30 billion _ is completed, the two German banks would
eventually eliminate 1,000 to 2,000 branches in Germany and, over
time, cut tens of thousands of jobs. The two banks have combined
work forces of 120,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said the ultimate goal is a fundamental
overhaul of the banks that have been the hub of this country's
postwar economy.
</P>
<P>
   A ``new Deutsche Bank,'' they said, would largely retreat from
the basic business of serving retail customers at local branches.
The combined branch network of both banks would be spun off as a
separate company. Though Deutsche Bank might still own a majority
stake, it would concentrate on serving wealthy individuals and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Dresdner and Deutsche would only say on Tuesday that
they are in ``advanced'' talks about a collaboration and would hold
a news conference on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said it is to be structured as a
three-way agreement between the two banks and the biggest European
insurer, Allianz of Munich.
</P>
<P>
   All three institutions hold stakes in each other, as well as
many other German companies, and have been at the center of a web
of cross-holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the talks said that under a proposed
agreement, Allianz would take a significant stake in the new branch
network.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of the deal would be to guarantee Allianz a
distribution channel for its insurance and investment products. At
the moment, Allianz distributes many of its products through
Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz would also like to acquire Deutsche Bank's huge mutual
fund business, known as DWS. People close the talks said this may
also become part of the agreement, because Dresdner Bank has its
own mutual fund business and antitrust regulators in Germany or at
the European Commission in Brussels may demand that one of the two
businesses be sold.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, according to one executive, a combined company would
become what Deutsche Bank's top executives have long wanted: a bank
focused on serving the wealthy and the corporate.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted jubilantly to the prospect of a merger. Shares
of Deutsche Bank rose nearly 8 percent on Tuesday to 94 euros, or
$90.01. Dresdner soared 21 percent, to 57.20 euros, or $54.77.
Allianz shares gained 12.9 percent, to 383.30 euros, or $367.05.
</P>
<P>
   Though German banking executives have speculated about mergers
for years, the prospect of a deal between Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank caught many analysts by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The two held extensive negotiations last year about merging
their retail networks, but Dresdner Bank's chief executive, Bernard
Walter, broke off the talks in September.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, has been
restlessly restructuring his company from the time he took over the
top post three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer engineered Deutsche Bank's $10 billion acquisition of the
Bankers Trust Corp. last year, a move that gave Deutsche Bank a
much bigger presence in the United States and strengthened its
position in investment banking and transaction services.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breuer, Deutsche Bank has realized its biggest profits
from trading in bonds and derivative securities like options and
futures.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to those businesses, Deutsche Bank's net
income rose 50 percent in 1999, to 2.6 billion euros. Dresdner's
profit rose 13 percent, to 1.1 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   But their retail banking businesses have consistently kept
overall profitability below those of American and British financial
institution. Deutsche Bank's return on equity, a commonly used
measure of bank performance, was roughly 9.9 percent last year, and
Dresdner Bank's even lower. By comparison, Citigroup's return on
equity was around 14 percent.

WITH TIDE AGAINST HIM, UNDERDOG TURNS TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Refusing to surrender, but aware of the mighty odds
he faced, Bill Bradley has made the painful psychological
adjustment of addressing his presidential campaign in the past
tense here.
</P>
<P>
   New York is where he won fame as a professional basketball
player for the New York Knicks. Across the Hudson River is his home
in New Jersey, which he represented in the US Senate for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Bradley's poignant choice to spend his last 48 hours
here, awaiting the Super Tuesday results, hoping that New Yorkers
would confound the polls. And as he traveled the city streets, he
took stock of the accomplishments _ and failures _ of his
presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I am most proud of is we put some issues on the
agenda that weren't there before, in terms of health care, in terms
of gun control, in terms of making sure people understand how
important campaign finance reform is in this country,'' Bradley
said on CBS's ``Early Show'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Democratic Party has moved in the direction
that I've pushed it over the last year,'' said Bradley. ``I'm
pleased about that. But, of course, having the party move in a
direction is not the same as leading the party as the candidate, or
as president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At a noontime rally in Westchester County on Monday, Bradley's
wife, Ernestine, told the crowd, ``It has been a wonderful
experience.'' Then she caught herself and made the correction: ``It
continues to be a wonderful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband grew poetic. Quoting Eleanor Roosevelt, Bradley told
the crowd to cling to hope because ``the future belongs to those
who believe in the beauty of their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you share my dream,'' Bradley said, ``help me make it our
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   From suburban Westchester, Bradley traveled to Brooklyn, and
then ended his last full day of campaigning with a rally at dusk in
Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. When the speeches were over, he
lingered long after the crowd had drifted away, chatting with the
well-wishers who remained, as if to savor the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The young, tired members of his staff, many of whom had come to
New York from the campaign headquarters in New Jersey, hugged one
another and took souvenir group photographs at what they knew might
be the last Bradley 2000 rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was up early Tuesday, greeting New Yorkers at a bagel
shop, a subway stop, and a polling booth, and telling the mob of
photographers and reporters that ``I think there will be some
surprises today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll win a couple and then we'll move on,'' Bradley said.
``We're far from the end.''
</P>
<P>
   At one stop, Bradley was met by seven male staffers with
B-R-A-D-L-E-Y spelled out in paint on their bare chests. He told
them they looked ``beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign began in obscurity last spring, then soared
in excitement and expectation when the polls showed that many
Democrats were tired of the Clinton-Gore scandals and receptive to
a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley's cerebral approach to the campaign trail
intrigued many independents, he failed to thrill or clinch the
loyalties of enough wavering Democrats, said Mark Green, a top
Democratic official here.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Al Gore, the choice of the party establishment,
launched attacks on his rival, questioning Bradley's fortitude and
challenging him in debate. When Bradley suffered a series of minor
heart problems, the sizzle seemed to drain from his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of organized labor and the Democratic faithful,
Gore trounced Bradley in Iowa, and beat him more narrowly in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at a Bronx high school on Monday, Bradley was
asked why he chose this year to run. He gave the students his
reasons for not running in 1988 or 1992, and acknowledged that time
may have passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   He had once been a famous basketball player, Bradley told the
high school students, but that was long ago, in the days ``before
you were born.''

IN TEXAS, LITTLE WORRY ABOUT BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Amid all the revelry here Tuesday night, even as
supporters cheered and aides beamed and nearly everyone basked in
the presence of the man they believed was the next president of the
United States, there seemed one small blot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was, after all, trounced in Massachusetts, rejected more
completely than he had been in any state since his first
devastating primary loss in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But no one on the Bush team really expected much from the Bay
State in the first place. If anything, the campaign had quietly
conceded Massachusetts days before, writing it off as ``that
state'' neighboring New Hampshire, where liberals still rule
politics and where voters continually choose to reelect Senator
Edward M. Kennedy. That explained, in part, why Bush aides were
still glowing about Governor Paul Cellucci, their New England point
man, despite the outcome the governor's organization couldn't
alter.
</P>
<P>
   There were no suggestions Cellucci might suffer in Bush's eyes.
There were no hints he might be crossed off the list of supporters
who could reasonably hope for a position in a Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Cellucci's star is very high with the Bush campaign.
He's been a warrior. He's done everything we've asked and more,''
senior Bush strategist Karl Rove said as the returns poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's been tough for him, because it's not exactly
been fertile ground for Governor Bush,'' agreed Bush communications
director Karen Hughes. ``But we all see the polls. We all know
Massachusetts is a very difficult state. And we all know how hard
Governor Cellucci has worked for us.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it would have taken more than one small state to
taint the gleeful spirit of the Bush campaign as exit polls
indicated him the clear victor in most other states holding
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their reluctance to formally declare Bush the nominee,
aides said the Texas governor was considering calling Senator John
S. McCain when he returns to his ranch in Arizona Wednesday. Bush
did not plan to ask McCain to withdraw from the race outright, they
said. But he would work to ``heal'' the rift between the two men,
Hughes said _ indicating that Bush hopes McCain will consider
moving on.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is moving ever closer to the number of
delegates required to make it mathematically impossible for McCain
to catch up, Rove said. ``It could be that, after next Tuesday, it
would take somebody running virtually the rest of the table to keep
it running,'' he said, ``and that's just not going to happen.''
Both Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is governor, and Texas have
primaries next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying sentiment of Tuesday night's celebration in
the ballroom and lobby of the most ornate hotel in the Texas
capital was that the nomination was already won. And early exit
polls reinforced what Bush had said all along: That among
Republicans, he was the clear favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Which appeared true even in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush aides blamed not Massachusetts Republicans but the
thousands of Democrats and Independents who swapped their party
affiliation in order to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   They blamed the state's proximity to New Hampshire, as well.
With the Boston media market so close to the southern part of the
state that hammered Bush early on, voters were ``bombarded'' by the
impression that McCain was the preferred candidate, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other Republican governors, particularly Governor
John Engler of Michigan, Cellucci never promised easy victory.
Instead, he paid his dues in dollars, helping raise $1.75 million
for the Texas governor over the last year _ a feat Bush aides
immediately cited in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke so highly of Cellucci, in fact, that one aide seemed
surprised when asked whether Bush had formally forgiven Cellucci
for the outcome in his state. Don Evans, the national finance
chairman for Bush, said it was obvious Cellucci had been given a
pass. ``He knows that,'' Evans said. ``He knows he's our friend. I
don't question Governor Cellucci's leadership or friendship. The
people of Massachusetts will vote how they see fit.''

EDITORIAL: TROUBLED TRIP TO PAKISTAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's decision to include a stop in Pakistan in
his visit to South Asia later this month should not be seen as an
American endorsement of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, that country's
military ruler. Since seizing power last October, Musharraf has
ignored Washington's concerns in three vital areas. He refuses to
cut links with international terrorist groups, resists treaty
commitments to curb Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and declines
to take steps toward restoring democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, Clinton would have done better to skip
Pakistan, limiting his visit to India and Bangladesh. Since he has
chosen to add a stop in Islamabad, he should use his time there to
encourage constructive changes in Pakistani behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials concluded that a snub of Pakistan might
drive it toward even more belligerent conduct. With only 10 months
remaining in Clinton's term, this is probably his last chance to
visit Pakistan as president. He enjoyed some success interceding
with Musharraf's deposed predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, getting him to
pull back from a dangerous military confrontation with India in
Kashmir last summer. That border remains dangerous, with
Pakistani-backed militants regularly attacking Indian positions.
</P>
<P>
   Since both countries became independent a half-century ago,
Pakistan has been challenging India's control over this restive
Muslim-majority state. Clinton now seems eager to offer American
help in resolving the longstanding dispute. But India remains
opposed to any form of international mediation on Kashmir, and
without New Delhi's cooperation any American effort would be
doomed. For now, America should limit its role to trying to prevent
further armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should also press Musharraf to sever ties with Harakat
ul-Mujahedeen, a Kashmiri terrorist group backed by the Pakistani
Army. He ought to insist that Pakistan use its close links with the
Taliban government in Afghanistan to press for the expulsion of
Osama bin Laden, the international terrorist implicated in the
deadly bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Another goal
should be to persuade Pakistan, as well as India, to sign the
nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   South Asia is home to more than a sixth of the world's
population and is of growing economic importance. For too long it
has been neglected by American presidents. This is not the ideal
moment for Clinton to visit Pakistan. He should keep his visit as
brief as possible and not flinch from telling Musharraf what he
must do to win American and world respect.  &QL;

FOCUS SHIFTS TO SHORTSTOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Brian Dohn  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
entered spring training wanting to make sure the catching
situation, especially Todd Hundley, was fine.
</P>
<P>
   No problem there, so his next agenda item was to chart the
progress of Mark Grudzielanek in the transition from shortstop to
second base. Again, no drama.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Johnson's list: shortstop. While Alex Cora is the
favorite, Johnson isn't ready to declare Cora the winner of the
four-man battle that includes Juan Castro, Kevin Elster and Jose
Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortstop, that one has been a C-plus,'' Johnson said.
``They've showed me a little nervousness. That's going to get more
of my focus, more of my attention because it's so critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he hasn't focused on the shortstops yet because the
position is so muddled. The Dodgers have 12 middle infielders in
camp. That number will change with the first round of cuts today
and give the contenders a chance to play more innings.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is what type of shortstop best fits this
club. Cora seems the safe bet because he's strong defensively and
showed last season he could hit _ he batted .308 in Triple-A
Albuquerque _ but a sliding scale could be in effect for the
Dodgers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is superb defensively, but his offense is lacking even at
the minor-league level. Vizcaino is a proven veteran, but his
ability to play anywhere in the infield works against him. Elster
is a wild card, mainly because he played for Johnson during his
Mets days and he provides power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait until we find out what type of offensive club we're
going to be,'' Johnson said. ``Right now, we're just trying to get
something going here, and it's slow going. Guys are having trouble
getting going.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Workin' the weights: Right-hander Darren Dreifort's last two
seasons ended with him watching the last few weeks instead of
pitching. Both years it was due to problems with his right
shoulder. Though Dreifort said he could have pitched through it in
1999, he took steps during the offseason to prevent it from being
an issue again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing a little bit more, weights-wise,'' Dreifort
said. ``More back work, more back-of-the-shoulder work, lat work.
Stuff like that, maybe strengthen everything around the shoulder
more. I'm anxious to show myself. It's as important to me as it is
to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tix on sale Friday: Tickets for individual home games,
including the opener against Ken Griffey Jr. and the Cincinnati
Reds, go on sale at 8:30 a.m. Friday at the Dodger Stadium
advance-ticket windows. Tickets can also be purchased by calling
(323) 224-1-HIT.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Scott Boras, the agent for third baseman
Adrian Beltre, and Bob Daly, managing general partner and CEO of
the Dodgers, are supposed to meet today in hopes of working out a
three-year contract that would put an end to a four-month battle
for free agency. If the sides agree on a deal, the players
association will drop the grievance filed on Beltre's behalf. . . .
Lefty Onan Masaoka (sprained left ankle) could be ready to pitch
Thursday and right-hander Mike Fetters (quadricep) is hoping to
return by the weekend. . . . Right-hander Robinson Checo is
expected to arrive in camp today, and when he arrives he'll be
greeted by a trip to minor-league camp instead of big-league camp.

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore crushed Bill Bradley from ocean to ocean
Tuesday in a powerful display that assured him the Democratic
presidential nomination, while Gov. George W. Bush took a huge
stride toward capturing the Republican nomination, piling up far
more delegates than Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories were particularly impressive because he was
supported by every demographic group in the 16 states with
Democratic contests, and, significantly, by women, who backed him
in some states by margins of more than 2-to-1, according to results
or surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was less overwhelming. Bush
prevailed in the Midwest powerhouses of Ohio and Missouri and in
the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. McCain captured
Massachusetts and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the most sought-after electoral prize of all,
Bush was comfortably ahead of McCain in the votes of registered
Republicans, the exit polls showed. That is crucial because the
winner of the Republican vote captures all of California's 162
delegates. It was not clear which of the four contenders would
prevail in that state's popular vote, which is not binding but
could be a telling measure of a candidates' potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the other huge electoral trove, with 101 delegates,
Bush and McCain were battling in what exit polls showed was a tight
contest. The vote was also tight in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Nashville Tuesday night, Gore praised
Bradley, saying he was ``moved and touched'' by his rival's
commitment to healing racial divisions. Then he quickly looked to
the general election, calling on the Republican nominee to debate
him twice a week, spurn unregulated soft money donations and appear
with him at open meetings around the country. He also put forth an
unvarnished plea for the independents and Republicans who backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Gore depicted the Republicans as intolerant.
``Tonight I want to reach out to all who believe that this is a
time for great progress, for great reform, for an America of
tolerance and high ideals,'' he said. ``This year, in this
election, we are the party of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore has been concentrating his assaults on Bush, while
the Texas governor has softened his conservative oratory in recent
days, positioning himself for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge step closer to the nomination,'' Bush told The
Associated Press in an interview. Stopping short of proclaiming
himself the certain nominee, he said, ``I have a long-term
perspective and tonight's going to be a good night, but my frame of
mind is to keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, of Arizona, said in a statement, ``It is clear we have
done very well on the East Coast and I am deeply grateful for the
strong support our campaign is receiving throughout the states of
New England and the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; The Republican needs 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side the primaries capped the most contentious
nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral see-saw in
which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by McCain in the
next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more victories and more
delegates. But no one could safely bet what would happen because in
the entire yearlong run-up to the primaries, Bush had been widely
viewed as the front-runner, only to see his prospects grow far more
precarious after McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued gathering in Manhattan Tuesday night, Bradley said
he had called the vice president to congratulate him _ and he
insisted that his campaign was a worthy crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our lack of victory tonight, we've shaped the national
debate in this campaign,'' he said. ``We've brought core Democratic
issues to the fore. When no one was talking about the 44 million
Americans without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.
When no one was talking about the 13 children who die every day of
gun violence we heard their cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The sweep of Gore's triumph allows him to move
more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was not as pronounced. The polls of voters
Tuesday, conducted by a consortium of the television networks and
the Associated Press, found that Bush and McCain continued to draw
from far different bases of support. Republicans backed Bush
overwhelmingly while independents and Democrats, in states where
they could vote for a Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries have been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.

 &HT;    Bush supporters buoyed by victories on Tuesday
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As news of George W. Bush's sweeping primary
victories rolled in Tuesday night, several hundred Bush supporters
at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Austin celebrated a day they
always expected would come _ if perhaps a little earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Tuesday triumphs virtually assured his nomination as the
Republican candidate for president after a surprisingly strong
challenge from Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain's victories in New
Hampshire, Arizona and Michigan delayed what looked to be a
coronation last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Johnson, a member of the Austin Republican Women's Club,
was one of the early arrivals. Wearing the group's traditional red,
she sold Bush for President pins that looked like sheriff's badges
for $15 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   She was beaming as the primary results rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' she
said. ``I don't know of any president who's won without California.
It's in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   California wasn't among the state's Bush had won by early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Munday, another club member, said that if Bush hadn't
wrapped up the nomination with his Tuesday night victories, he'd
certainly come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week from tonight is what? Texas and Florida,'' she said,
dragging out the names of the Bush-friendly states in a sing-songy
drawl. Bush's brother Jeb is the governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Munday stood with a thickening crowd outside the
ballroom of the Four Seasons, waiting to be ushered in for the
victory celebration. Outside the hotel, two-dozen satellite trucks
filled the eastern portion of the parking lot, ready to beam news
of Bush's victories around the globe. Reporters, photographers and
cameramen from across America and the world packed into the
ballroom to await Bush's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45 p.m., Bush strategist Karl Rove strolled through the
lobby outside the ballroom on his way to the first of many
television interviews. Even at that early hour, he was grinning.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd outside the ballroom grew, people jockeyed for
position in front of the four large television sets broadcasting
CNN's coverage of the primary results. Cheers went up when the
screen flashed a graphic showing a Bush victory, with the biggest
cheers reserved for the largest states.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the televisions showed the scene in the ballroom
next door, which at that point was filled only with reporters and
Bush staff members. Bush volunteers handed out stickers and
campaign literature as the guests came downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Butchko said she'd been waiting for Tuesday night for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always an anxiety when you see the bumps along
the way, but in my opinion it's made him a much stronger candidate
and solidified his base,'' Butchko said of McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Masset, a Republican consultant based in Austin, dispensed
his political wisdom to a circle of Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly never had a doubt,'' Masset said of Bush's apparent
clinching of the nomination on Tuesday night _ although he admitted
that he had thought the night would come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of those at the Four Seasons, Masset said McCain's
challenge had only strengthened Bush for a battle with Gore, the
likely Democratic nominee, in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all vetting George something fierce,'' he said. ``It's
far better to learn now. Everyone's a lot stronger for this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Those inside the Four Seasons were giddy at Bush's big
victories. But on the street outside the hotel, several dozen
protestors were less sanguine about the brightening prospects of a
second Bush presidency. Shouting into a stiff wind, they decried
Bush's support for the death penalty, chanting ``Stop Bush's
killing machine!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically just all anti-Bush, and anti-death penalty,''
said Molly Moore, a student at Austin Community College whose lip
ring and black T-shirt stood in stark contrast to the well-dressed
crowd inside. ``We just want to alert everybody that he's not as
good as he's making himself out to be.''

   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

EDITORIAL: A VERDICT ON A COVER-UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of three New York City police officers, Charles
Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, for conspiracy to obstruct
justice in the torture of Abner Louima concludes the government's
second trial of individuals involved in this vicious crime. A third
trial, of two other officers, Rolando Aleman and Francisco Rosario,
who are charged with lying to federal investigators about the
attack, will begin at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution charged that Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder conspired
to cover up Schwarz's role in the attack. To some observers the
case is troubling because Justin Volpe, the officer who admitted to
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum in a Brooklyn station house
bathroom, says that Schwarz was not in the bathroom and did not
participate in the attack. The defense argued that there could be
no conspiracy to hide Schwarz's involvement since he was not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the crime of conspiracy to obstruct justice does not require
a finding that the underlying crime was carried out. It is illegal,
even for a person innocent of the underlying crime, to conspire to
create a false alibi or hinder an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a federal jury convicted Schwarz last June of
helping to hold down Louima while Volpe assaulted him. Volpe
pleaded guilty to the attack during that trial, and has been
sentenced to 30 years in prison. At that trial, Volpe was not
called to testify on Schwarz's behalf. Schwarz maintains he is
innocent, and he is appealing the earlier verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution in this second trial presented evidence of
dozens of phone calls among the three defendants soon after the
assault, and evidence of a meeting they had with a police union
representative to discuss the investigation. The prosecutors argued
that the defendants tailored their accounts to investigators to
protect Schwarz. The most riveting testimony came from Volpe, who
testified that Schwarz was never in the bathroom. But the jury
clearly did not see Volpe's words as proof of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, having lied about his crime initially, has little
credibility. There are serious questions about his motives for
exonerating Schwarz and for placing Wiese in the bathroom during
the assault instead. There was also testimony from two other
officers that they saw Schwarz escort Louima toward the bathroom,
though Schwarz testified that he was outside the station house
searching his patrol car during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   All three defendants are expected to appeal Monday's verdict.
The torture of Louima has brought enormous shame to the Police
Department. Prosecuting the cover-up is as important as punishing
the brutality itself.

   NEW YORK _ A state appellate court Tuesday rejected the efforts
of the New York state Crime Victims Board to seize book and movie
profits from Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia informer known as Sammy
the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   The board sued Gravano in 1997, seeking to collect $250,000 he
said he received for assisting the author Peter Maas with
``Underboss,'' a best-selling book that gave details of Gravano's
career as a killer and racketeer who rose to the No. 2 position in
the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, who defected from the mob and testified against the
Gambino family boss, John Gotti, and other organized crime figures,
once said he might earn as much as $1 million from his tale.
</P>
<P>
   The suit _ which also named Maas, two divisions of HarperCollins
Publishers, the ICM talent agency and the 20th Century Fox Film
Corp. _ was filed under the state's so-called Son of Sam law. That
law allows crime victims and their relatives to sue criminals for
profits they earn from telling their tales.

EDITORIAL: THE SUPER TUESDAY PRIMARIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on early returns and exit polls, Vice President Al Gore
won a sweeping nationwide victory in the ``Super Tuesday''
primaries, sealing his capture of the Democratic presidential
nomination. Gov. George W. Bush also appeared to be headed toward
capturing most of the delegates at stake, based on exit surveys in
California and vote tabulations elsewhere. Sen. John McCain's
victories in New England may persuade him to continue his
candidacy, but he will face long odds. Bush is expected to shift
his focus now to the general election, but the tough primary
contests have left him looking more battered than anyone could have
predicted when he began as a pre-emptive favorite. Recent polls
show him even with Gore, instead of leading the vice president as
he was a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Gore has scored one of the most impressive
recoveries in many years. He started out only six months ago
struggling to overcome his image s an awkward figure running a
costly, uninspired campaign based on the idea of entitlement. When
Democrats started moving toward Bill Bradley as a fresher
candidate, Gore junked his campaign plan, threw off the smothering
cloak of supposed inevitability and starting fighting for the
nomination. He emerged from his clashes with Bradley with a sharper
debating style, though still lacking the kind of emotional
connection with voters that seemed to come so easily to McCain on
the Republican side. Gore's unbroken string of primary victories
has made him no less reviled by Republicans, but many of them admit
that he will be a tough competitor in November.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Gore was able to use the primaries as a warm-up, they
have been a battle for survival for Bush and McCain. Bush, in
particular, endured unexpected questions about his knowledge,
experience and debating skills. But the most ominous sign for the
Republicans, if Bush gets the nomination, may be the ideological
repositioning forced upon him by McCain. After stepping onto the
national political stage as a new-style Republican moderate, Bush
was forced to embrace the agenda of the party's cultural
conservatives in order to counter McCain's reform candidacy. Now
when he tries to move back to the center, Bush will find Gore
camped out there, if the two meet in the general election. McCain's
victories in the primaries in Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Vermont were another sign of Bush's continuing difficulties in
areas with moderate voting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush's lead in the exit polls in California holds up, his
supporters will have ample reason for optimism about his potential
in the mega-states. Next Tuesday will bring primaries in Texas,
Florida and other friendly Sun Belt states. As Tuesday's win in
Georgia attests, Bush has a strong regional base and deep campaign
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed there has been a lot of talk in recent weeks about
``firewalls'' in various states known to be reliable Bush
strongholds, ready to prevent a stampede to McCain. In the end,
however, the governor's main firewall has been money _ his own and
the large sums put up by his rich Texas friends to pay for attack
ads at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not McCain continues after Super Tuesday, he clearly
fell far short of the scenario his team envisioned following the
New Hampshire victory on Feb. 1. It was then that his spokesmen
talked openly of igniting one state after another with McCain's
heroic story and his crusade for reform. When he was attacked
unfairly by the religious right in South Carolina, McCain returned
the fire. But his decision to counterattack now looks like a costly
tactical mistake that damaged the aura of his campaign and revived
old worries about his temperament. Even Republicans friendly to him
were unsettled by the ferocious tone of his attack on Christian
conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say what McCain's future will be this year.
Even if he drops out of the race, he will probably continue to
speak out and espouse his appeal for moderation and especially for
campaign finance reform, demanding that the party listen as the
price for vigorously supporting the nominee. Whatever happens,
McCain has opened a historically significant debate among
Republicans over the fundamental purpose and direction of their
party. That debate must continue. &QL;

INTERNET AD PLACEMENT FIRM HIRES 2 TO CALM FEARS ABOUT PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ DoubleClick, the Internet's largest advertisement
placement company, has hired two of New York's most prominent
consumer advocates in an effort to reassure the public, investors
and federal and state regulators that it will respect computer
users' privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Abrams, who served four terms as state attorney general
as well as stints as a state assemblyman and Bronx borough
president, has been named chairman of the company's new privacy
advisory board. Jules Polonetsky, the city's commissioner of
consumer affairs and a former state legislator, said Tuesday that
he was leaving the Giuliani administration in two weeks to take
over as DoubleClick's chief privacy officer.
</P>
<P>
   The two join another recent recruit from the political world,
Josh Isay, the former chief of staff and campaign manager for Sen.
Charles E. Schumer. In January, Isay took over as DoubleClick's
Washington and New York lobbyist. Abrams and Polonetsky will be
assigned to formulate corporate privacy policies as the Federal
Trade Commission and attorneys general in Michigan and New York
state investigate how the New York City-based company uses consumer
data to decide where to place online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is how can businesses continue to expand on the
Internet and still protect consumer rights,'' Abrams said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments of Abrams and Polonetsky, whose compensation
the company would not disclose, comes a week after DoubleClick
announced that it would delay a plan to merge a vast database it
recently acquired containing names, addresses and offline buying
habits of millions of consumers with information it anonymously
assembles each day about Internet users as they visit Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick started with two employees four years ago, but today
employs 1,800 people in 22 countries who place advertisements on a
network of 1,500 Internet sites and share data with them, including
some of the most popular online addresses, such as Travelocity and
AltaVista. It also places ads on more than 11,000 other sites,
including The New York Times on the Web, that are not part of the
DoubleClick network but use the company's technology to send banner
ads to their Web pages. The company's sales last year were $315
million, and its stock closed Tuesday at 96.1875, up 4.6875, but
down over all since the end of last year by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to take an old form of advertising _ direct
marketing _ into the Internet world, by directing ads to consumers
who have already shown a potential interest in buying certain
products through their previous Internet use. The company notes
that Internet users have the right to request that any Internet
visits or personal data not be collected. But privacy advocates say
the notice is inadequate, and they fear that despite DoubleClick's
assurances to the contrary, it routinely records information as
detailed as what video movies or plane tickets a consumer buys, as
well as information about health and even phrases typed into search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of consumer groups and civil liberties advocates
have filed complaints in recent months with the FTC, asking it to
investigate the company's data-collection practices. And last
month, Attorney General Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan announced
that she intended to sue the company, which she said was
essentially putting a ``bar code'' on a consumer's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amounts to little more than a secret cyberwiretap,''
Granholm said in announcing her investigation. The New York state
attorney general's office is also conducting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Polonetsky, 34, a lawyer who has served as commissioner of
consumer affairs for two years, said Tuesday that he would work
with federal and state regulators, industry officials and privacy
advocates to try to draft Internet privacy regulations or voluntary
guidelines. He also said he would monitor the company's adherence
to these standards.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, 64, who will retain his position as a partner at the New
York law firm Stroock &AMP; Stroock &AMP; Lavan, will serve a similar role,
helping to pick members for and then overseeing a new board charged
with assuring that DoubleClick is honoring its commitments to
consumer privacy. The company also is hiring PricewaterhouseCoopers
to audit its use of consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   Polonetsky and Abrams said in separate interviews Tuesday that
they were confident that DoubleClick and its executives were
committed to addressing the privacy concerns, in part because such
a move is essential to the success of the new advertising medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need to feel comfortable surfing online if online
advertising is going to work,'' Polonetsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre K. Mulligan, staff counsel at the Washington-based
Center for Democracy and Technology, said she was pleased that
DoubleClick was appointing executives to address consumers' privacy
concerns, but she added that it remained to be seen how serious the
company's commitment is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is only window dressing, it is not adequate,'' she
said, noting that her organization believed that it was likely that
federal legislation would still be needed to govern how such vast
loads of consumer data can be used.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick's president, Kevin Ryan, said Tuesday that the
Internet community and users would gradually understand that the
company was committed to respecting consumers' privacy over the
long term. ``People will see over time what we do,'' Ryan said.
``The appointments of Abrams and Jules are two steps along the
way.''

 &HT;    Prairie fires replenish and restore
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Early settlers to the West called them
``necklaces,'' long, thin lines of dancing light stretching from
horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon was caused by the leading edge of immense prairie
grass fires, touched off by lightning and often consuming millions
of acres of the tall prairie grass that once covered the West.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie fires were not uncommon in Ohio, either. American
Indians as far back as 10,000 years ago, as their societies became
more agricultural based, set fire to prairies, showing a knowledge
of land management.
</P>
<P>
   Fires help replenish and restore prairies.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the warm, dry weather, Five Rivers
MetroParks managers set fire to the big prairie at Possum Creek on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying cans of diesel fuel and gasoline, David Nolin and Mary
Klunk of Five Rivers MetroParks lit a backfire on the downwind side
of the 50-acre prairie to contain the main blaze. Other park
workers kept the fire in check with water hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the other side, with a steady southwest wind at her
back, Klunk then ignited the main fire. In a flash, a string of
fire swept across the dry grass field, sending a surge of smoke
into the sky and turning the ground black.
</P>
<P>
   Klunk, who is a land stewardship specialist, directs prairie
burns every two or three years on some portion of MetroParks' 300
acres of prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Left unattended, prairies in Ohio can become choked with vining,
cool-weather plants such as fescue and start turning into tree
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burning gets rid of some of the woody plants,'' Klunk
said. ``Also the blackened ground warms up quicker, which releases
nutrients and allows the seeds to germinate sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The prairie, which contains Indian grass, big bluestem, prairie
cord grass and little blue stem, will have grown back by late May,
Klunk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plant diversity is one of our main goals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The park workers conduct the burn with great caution, but not
without some fun.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the job touches some deep childhood wish to set a
really big fire, Klunk said, ``Oh, yeah.''

 &HT;    Ohio man gets 4 life terms for killings
 &HT;    By Lisa Perry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIDNEY, Ohio _ In a plea agreement to avoid a possible death
sentence, a man who his lawyer said believed ``Satan was more
powerful than God'' admitted Tuesday to the murders of three
teen-age girls and a Bible studies teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Michael Hensley entered the pleas in Shelby County
Common Pleas Court. The three-judge panel then sentenced the
30-year-old to four consecutive life terms, plus 80 years, without
the possibility of parole for the July 8 deaths of the three teens
_ Sherry Kimbler, 16; Kimbler's cousin, Tosha Barrett, 16;
14-year-old Amy Mikesell; and Brett Wildermuth, Hensley's
37-year-old Bible studies teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The shackled Hensley sobbed and wiped tears from his cheeks when
sentenced. The victims' families, who packed the courtroom, were in
tears for most of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say I'm sorry to all the victims' families. I'm
sorry for taking your daughters' lives. I am so sorry. It haunts me
all the time, that they won't get their licenses or go to
Homecoming, or get married. Sheila (Wildermuth's wife), I am so
sorry for what I did to Brett,'' Hensley said through his sobs.
``Please forgive me. Please forgive me for what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley also pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted
aggravated murder, and three counts of kidnapping. In exchange for
the plea, Shelby County Prosecutor Jim Stevenson said he would not
seek the death penalty out of deference to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wanted closure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley's lawyer, Kort Gatterdam, said prior to sentencing that
testimony would have shown that Hensley had a mental defect that
made him unable to understand ``the criminality of his conduct.''
Hensley also was addicted to exposing himself and believed that
members of an imaginary satanic cult were trying to harm him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hensley) began to create a cult,'' Gatterdam said. ``Not a
real cult, but something to cover up that he was a very sick
individual who needed help. He could not beat his addiction. ... He
continued to pay people so he could expose himself to them. ... He
was possessed by the thought that Satan was more powerful than
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to Hensley's Sidney home July 8, moments
after Veronica Eagy, 22, crawled out of the house's basement. Eagy
had been shot numerous times, but survived. Wildermuth was shot
inside his home outside Sidney 20 minutes after police began
searching Hensley's home. Mikesell and Kimbler were both stabbed
and beaten; Barrett was beaten and shot in the chest at close range
with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said Hensley killed the teens to cover up activities
with the girls in which criminal charges could have been filed. He
did not elaborate.

IN AUSTRIA, POLITICS WAVES THE BATON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., March 12) 
(jt) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diplomatic relations are one thing. The really important
business of Austria is music, and while the hills are sure to be
alive this summer, they do not look entirely well.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case, the venerable Salzburg Festival
promises to be the center of attention among European music
festivals, but the reasons extend well beyond the usual sheer
quality and variety of its presentations. A noisy dispute about the
nature of the programming erupted last year between Gerard Mortier,
the festival's innovative artistic director, and a traditionalist
rear guard including Thomas Klestil, the nation's president.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that appears mild compared with the potential storm
brewing this year around the inclusion of Joerg Haider's right-wing
Freedom Party in the national governing coalition. Haider, who
stepped down as leader of the party on Feb. 28, and his
sympathizers are widely thought to be soft on Nazism if not kindly
disposed toward it, and the 14 other European Union nations have
downgraded diplomatic relations with Austria. Now, musicians from
around the world are reconsidering their activities in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, events in Salzburg and elsewhere are subject to
change. The pianist Andras Schiff, who is scheduled to participate
in the Vienna Festival this summer, though not in Salzburg until
next year, has said that as long as Haider and the Freedom Party
remain in power, he intends to cancel his appearances in Austria
one by one. As proof of his intentions, he canceled a performance
at the Austrian Embassy in Washington during his recent triumphal
American tour, citing his intense distress, as an Austrian citizen
and a European Jew, at political events back home.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier, whose successor, Peter Ruzicka, has already been named
for next year, has called for a boycott of another national
showcase, the annual New Year's concerts of the Vienna
Philharmonic. In addition, he has threatened to oust the Austrian
conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, a recent mainstay of the Salzburg
Festival, if he accepts an invitation to become involved with those
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   What is promised in Salzburg, at any rate, is a handsome array
of operas on stage and in concert, radiating outward from a
familiar core of Mozart (``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' ``Don Giovanni'' and
``Idomeneo'') and Wagner (``Tristan und Isolde''). Other staged
works are all in French: Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride,''
Berlioz's ``Troyens'' and Offenbach's ``Belle Helene.'' Even the
new opera by Kaija Saariaho, a Finnish composer with whom New York
Philharmonic audiences made a happy acquaintance last year,
``L'Amour de Loin,'' will be in French, with Peter Sellars
directing.
</P>
<P>
   The concert presentations, on the other hand, range from the
French of Cherubini's ``Medee'' to the Russian of Tchaikovsky's
``Queen of Spades'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Invisible City of
Kitezh,'' and the Danish of Carl Nielsen's ``Saul and David.''
</P>
<P>
   A game of musical podiums involving the conductors of some of
those works has already taken place, with Claudio Abbado
withdrawing and Lorin Maazel and Valery Gergiev taking on new
assignments: more a matter of musical shenanigans as usual,
presumably, than of world politics. Among the star singers
scheduled to appear are Renee Fleming in ``Don Giovanni'' and Ben
Heppner and Waltraud Meier in ``Tristan.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Festival, too, explores fascinating operatic byways,
with Monteverdi's ``Incoronazione di Poppea'' and Schumann's
``Genoveva.'' In the present climate, this festival's opening
event, on May 12, in which ``2,000 musicians send their greetings
from Vienna to the world to celebrate the year 2000,'' as a
prospectus puts it, sounds loaded in every sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Philharmonic, meanwhile, a fixture in both of those
festivals, strikes an altogether different note on May 7, with a
long-planned and perhaps now increasingly meaningful memorial
concert at a former concentration camp in Mauthausen, Austria. Sir
Simon Rattle conducts the orchestra in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
as ``an affirmation of humanity at a site of horror,'' in the words
of Clemens Hellsberg, the Philharmonic's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A final uncertainty for Austria, whatever the administrators and
artists decide, is audiences. How eager will foreigners be to
travel to Austria and to patronize such events? Other festivals
around Europe could hardly be blamed for sensing an opportunity
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Zurich Festival, for example, was intended as a rival to
Salzburg when it was founded four years ago. And Switzerland in
general must be relieved that the shadowy activities of its banks
during and after World War II have been crowded from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In Zurich, Franz Welser-Moest will conduct a potted history of
Germanic opera: Mozart's ``Zauberfloete,'' Berg's ``Wozzeck'' and
``Lulu,'' and Strauss' ``Arabella.'' And Cecilia Bartoli will sing
two soprano parts in Haydn's ``Anima del Filosofo.''
</P>
<P>
   A commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Bach's death
involves a variety of specialists, including Harnoncourt, John
Eliot Gardiner and Reinhard Goebel. And Wolfgang Sawallisch leads
the Tonhalle Orchestra in Brahms' ``German Requiem'' on his way to
Salzburg, to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic in Schumann's Requiem.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucerne Festival, too, offers glittering attractions. Schiff
plays all the major keyboard works of Bach, a series he began last
month at Lincoln Center and completes in the fall at Carnegie Hall.
In what amounts to a royal flush of European orchestras, Abbado
conducts the Berlin Philharmonic, Zubin Mehta the Vienna
Philharmonic and Riccardo Chailly the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra
of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the musical hills of Austria and Switzerland, the
Munich Opera Festival celebrates a composer who wrote no operas,
Bach, with a performance of his ``St. John Passion'' and with the
jazz fusion pianist Uri Caine playing the ``Goldberg'' Variations.
Not surprisingly, composers who did write operas are also amply
represented: Handel, Mozart, Strauss and Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   But for full immersion in Wagner, the Bayreuth Festival, founded
by the composer, remains the place to go. A new production of ``Der
Ring des Nibelungen,'' directed and designed by Juergen Flimm and
Erich Wonder, and conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli, gives New Yorkers
the option of a second opinion after the Met's ``Ring'' revival in
the spring. In addition, Christoph Eschenbach conducts
``Parsifal,'' Christian Thielemann ``Die Meistersinger von
Nuernberg'' and Antonio Pappano ``Lohengrin.''
</P>
<P>
   In other climes, there are attractions aplenty in
Aix-en-Provence, France (with intensive activities by the
contemporary specialist Pierre Boulez and the Baroque specialist
William Christie); in St. Petersburg, Russia (with Valery Gergiev
conducting Prokofiev's ``Fiery Angel,'' ``War and Peace'' and
``Semyon Kotko'' at the White Nights Festival); and in
Glyndebourne, England (with Janacek's ``Jenufa,'' Britten's ``Peter
Grimes'' and Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress'' blended with Mozart).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, listeners who wish to turn their backs squarely on
Austria might look to a new opera festival at the Roman Theater in
Caesarea, Israel. With forces from the New Israeli Opera, Strauss'
``Elektra'' will have what is said to be its first staging in
Israel, alongside Puccini's ``Tosca'' and a concert featuring
Jessye Norman. To be sure, it's not quite Salzburg, but then, for
good or ill, what else is?

A DIRECTOR WITH A SENSE OF WHERE HE'S GOING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the film ``Boiler Room.''  
 (af)  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Call it vision, or perspective, or intuition.
Call it the residue of a boy's imagination (``From when I was about
7 to about 13, I had weird feelings, and people had to stay with me
because I felt uneasy about the room or the house I was in.'')
Ascribe it to a sensitivity earned from a youth in schools as the
only Indian among Americans, the only Hindu among Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Attribute it to the eye that is trained when a 10-year-old is
given a movie camera, which he uses to make 45 short films before
age 15. Whatever the reason, it should seem appropriate that M.
Night Shyamalan _ M., for Manoj; Night, a name he adopted at 17
(``romantic, mysterious, poetic''); Shyamalan (pronounced
SHA-ma-lan) _ would come up with ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's a thriller about a boy, Cole, who sees things
that no one else can see (dead people, as it happens), and it
features an alarming secret, numerous clues to which have been
sitting in plain sight. Shyamalan has a way of seeing things other
people do not see, and recognizing things others are slow to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about knowing that Bruce Willis could play the subtle
and subdued psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe because of the way he played
John McClane, the can-do cop in ``Die Hard.'' He says he sensed
that Haley Joel Osment, 11, whose astonishing performance has won
him a best supporting actor nomination, could handle the part of
the emotionally fraught, hypercompassionate Cole because he showed
up at his audition wearing a suit.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about casting Toni Collette, the actress whose
performance as Lynn, Cole's mother, earned her a best supporting
actress nomination: how she came in with her head shaved wearing,
as he puts it, ``this bag,'' and how he ended up just flat-out
telling the studio he wanted her and denying he had an audition
tape to send them, because ``with the way she looked it would be
difficult for them to get her, to think of her as a Philadelphia
mom, kind of sexy but kind of tired, but in an endearing way.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they see all that I saw in her?''
</P>
<P>
   How does anyone? Barry Mendel, one of the producers of ``The
Sixth Sense,'' remembers the day he saw the rough cut of the
picture. ``Afterwards, Night said: `I think we did it. I think
we'll get a best picture nomination.' I thought we'd done a good
job, but he was way ahead of the rest of us.'' Young Osment recalls
that during filming Shyamalan, a basketball fan, shot hoops to
relax, and that ``one day he made 20 foul shots in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Osment adds the kicker: ``With his eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful pro quarterbacks will often refer to the point in
their careers when the game ``slows down'' and they can see the
momentarily available gaps in the defense. Hockey mavens talk about
Wayne Gretzky's extraordinary vision, how he could see who would be
open for a pass before anyone else would even look. These athletes
do not feel they are seeing anything extraordinary; these patterns
are just what they see, and that, of course, is what is
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Shyamalan is in possession of something similar. He is
only 29, and ``The Sixth Sense'' is only the third picture he has
directed. Yet in that film he has managed to combine artistry and
commercial appeal ($600 million worldwide, and counting) to make a
genre film with a genuine emotional touch, a suspense film with a
genuinely surprising ending. It has earned six Oscar nominations,
including best picture, and two _ best screenplay and best director
_ for him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything is instantly visible to Shyamalan.
``The big challenge in writing the screenplay was to not make this
story the familiar, unimportant, popcorn-type pabulum,'' he says,
sitting in the production offices of his next movie,
``Unbreakable,'' in a vacant, fairly dilapidated, ivy-overrun
museum on the edge of the University of Pennsylvania campus. ``It
took a lot of drafts until I got even a moment that I thought was
truthful, and it wasn't until the sixth draft that I thought of the
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the film's popularity means that more than a few
readers know the ending, nothing will be revealed here, except to
say that Shyamalan found it challenging to preserve the secret in
the story. ``It was really restricting, because the character
couldn't do a lot of things,'' he says. ``But it was exciting, too.
</P>
<P>
   I had to make dialogue scenes feel like movement. Take that
early scene between the psychiatrist and Cole, when he has Cole
move forward if he says something right, and step back if he was
wrong. I needed the movie to have a sense of physicality to it, so
you wouldn't notice how passive he was being. And it had to be on
the edge of eerie but not confusing. You couldn't have people
saying, `What the hell's wrong with him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Excited as he was by the screenplay, Mendel was even more
impressed by how confident, even daring, the relatively
inexperienced Shyamalan was as a director. (His two earlier efforts
_ the independent productions ``Praying With Anger,'' a
semi-autobiographical film about an Indian-American visiting India
in which he starred, and ``Wide Awake,'' about a boy's search for
God _ created little stir.)
</P>
<P>
   Mendel points to the scene in which the mother and the boy are
having dinner and discussing a bumblebee pendant that keeps showing
up in his room. ``The safe way to handle that scene would be to
shoot it a couple of times and cut them together,'' Mendel says.
``But Night shot it all in one shot, with no coverage, meaning
there's no way to edit it or shorten it or finesse mistakes. And
Night just said, `I promise you it won't be boring, I promise you
we won't need to cut, I promise you it will work.' I kept wishing
he'd shoot close-ups, but he was totally confident, with a kind of
boldness that's scary in one so young. And he was totally right.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one lesson Shyamalan, a New York University film school
graduate, took from ``The Sixth Sense'' was to have
(italics)more(end italics) confidence in himself. ``I learned that
when I get the feeling that something's wrong,'' he says, ``that I
shouldn't ignore it and just keep pushing through and pushing
through, and not listen to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks about a scene he wrote, in which Cole and Lynn are in a
car: ``Cole sees a pregnant woman, and he screams, `Watch out!' and
the car hits the woman, and the woman goes through the windshield,
and Lynn hits the brakes and almost causes an accident. And then he
opens his eyes, and the windshield's fine, it was just one of his
visions. The scene was really exciting, almost a pure action scene,
but I knew it would ruin the pace. But then I also thought the
audience would love it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He ended up shooting the scene, at great cost and difficulty,
but it did not get into the film. ``And I knew from the beginning
it shouldn't have!'' Shyamalan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when you're doing something at the highest level,
you understand the flow of things without knowing why. Now I grasp
that. I wrote one of those scenes for `Unbreakable.' I thought it
was great, and I added more, and more, and more, but then I
realized, `This is that scene!' And I pulled it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbreakable,'' which will begin shooting next month, is about
a man who has survived a train wreck. (A lot of Shyamalan's
projects explore death, one exception being the screenplay he wrote
for ``Stuart Little.'' Doesn't he have a nice romantic comedy
floating within? ``I have them. I have a great idea for a comedy
with Jim Carrey that would kill. But I just can't bring myself to
do them. They just don't feel resonant enough. They just don't have
enough weight.'')
</P>
<P>
   Disney paid Shyamalan $5 million for the screenplay, a record
amount for a screenplay written on spec, and paid him another $5
million to direct. Again he wrote the screenplay with Bruce Willis
in mind but without any commitment, and again Willis will star
(reportedly he signed onto ``Unbreakable'' practically overnight
and told Shyamalan that ``it would be an honor'' to appear in the
movie.)
</P>
<P>
   I'm always surprised about how closely we think about our
characters,'' Shyamalan says. ``There's a trust thing that's
happening that's working both ways. In `The Sixth Sense,' in the
Vincent scene'' _ an early scene in which Malcolm Crowe is
confronted by a former patient _ ``I wrote it with Vincent having
the gun out and aiming it at Bruce the whole scene. And Bruce said:
`You know, I'm known for having guns pointed at me. Let's not make
this a gun scene. Let's make this about Malcolm talking to a
disturbed patient.' And he was absolutely right. The gun didn't
appear until Malcolm was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan is handsome, trim, friendly, neatly and plainly
dressed, a dedicated family man who has made up his mind to live
and work in Philadelphia, where he grew up, the son of two
physicians. He lives in the suburbs with Bhavna, his wife of seven
years, and their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not willing to give up a normal life plan in order to make
movies,'' he says calmly. (His hometown has reciprocated his ardor.
At a Sixers game he attended recently his face was shown on the
Jumbotron, and the crowd cheered. ``It was sweet,'' he says,
``definitely.'')
</P>
<P>
   He is very matter of fact about his accomplishments; if there is
no self-effacing humor or self-doubt or astonishment, neither is
there any bragging. He does not refer to himself in the third
person, but seems able to see himself that way, almost as a
character. He says that if his first two films had not been
failures, his current success would have been ``meaningless; it
wouldn't have been a good experience to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He likens himself to an athlete who ``went from `I wish I could
play' to being on the team, to coming off the bench, to being a
star, to being an all-star, all in one season, and it was a weird
feeling, because I never got to feel those middle things.'' He
describes his experience as ``an interesting arc.'' He speaks about
having to give up moviemaking, or about the possibility of hitting
a dry period, almost clinically, like the fiction writer he is,
clicking off possible fates a character could meet in Act II.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mendel, Shyamalan is not much of a cinema
historian. Among the directors he admires are Peter Weir, Cameron
Crowe, Alfred Hitchcock and the Wachowski Brothers. (``Whatever you
think of `The Matrix,' every shot is there because of the passion
they have! You can see they argued it out!'') Not surprisingly, at
the top of the list is Steven Spielberg, who has made the kind of
large-themed movies with wide audience appeal that Shyamalan
envisions himself directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in things coming together right,'' says Shyamalan, a
man used to seeing things others do not. ``It's not altogether a
coincidence that as a kid I saw `Jaws' and `E.T.' and dreamed about
making movies, and that in the room where I write I have three
posters _ `Jaws,' `E.T.' and `Jurassic Park.' And now the poster
for `The Sixth Sense' is there, and actually, when I sit down to
write now, in the image of `Jaws,' in the black, you see `The Sixth
Sense' reflected. It's not like I sat there, lining up the
reflection _ it just happened! And he was 28 when he made `Jaws,'
the same age I was when I made `Sixth Sense.' Maybe life has
orchestrated itself that way, or if it's destiny or what. But right
now I see things coming together, and everything is in balance.''

WHEN NOTHING BUT NEW MASTERPIECES WILL SUFFICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While waiting for the next Balanchine to fill the
original Balanchine's shoes, the trick is to preserve his legacy
and breathe fresh air into the company he founded.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, as the New York City Ballet demonstrated this
winter, is to present an exuberantly danced season, introduce young
and gifted dancers, and realize that there is no second Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it would be helpful to accept the idea, 17 years
after George Balanchine's death, that his kind of genius comes
along only once every 100 years and to stop measuring other
choreographers in the company by his standard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, do what he and Lincoln Kirstein did as founders and
directors of the City Ballet: encourage talent from within the
ranks to create ballets, and invite guest choreographers. Remember
also that all the premieres once staged for City Ballet by
Frederick Ashton, Antony Tudor, William Dollar, Lew Christensen,
Todd Bolender, Ruthanna Boris, John Taras and Birgit Cullberg, to
list a few established names, have long vanished from City Ballet's
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   These works may not have been masterpieces, but they were worth
doing, and some were considered hits. None had to undergo the
scrutiny that every premiere does today.
</P>
<P>
   If masterpieces were not required or expected, this was possibly
because Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, the company's two founding
choreographers, provided the balance. They created the occasional
masterpieces that still exist at City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   But now a young choreographer's premiere suffers precisely
because it is surrounded by masterpieces. Even established
choreographers are asked to meet some impossible standard when they
step into City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   It was nonetheless a capital idea for Peter Martins, the
company's artistic director, to invite Twyla Tharp to create a
premiere, ``The Beethoven Seventh,'' for the recently concluded
season. Inevitably, there would be disappointment among viewers who
expect Tharp to clown around forever as she did in 1976 with ``Push
Comes to Shove,'' created for Mikhail Baryshnikov and American
Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Beethoven Seventh,'' set to the composer's Seventh
Symphony, is the best of Tharp's works in the classical idiom. It
breaks down ballet conventions and extends City Ballet's dancers in
new directions.
</P>
<P>
   One sees them in a fresh light, looking more uninhibited but
still performing with the strong classical technique that allows
Tharp to try out difficult and speedy combinations of steps. In
short, a serious ballet and a step forward for Tharp.
</P>
<P>
   Her Beethoven, however, is not everyone's Beethoven. He is used
more as a challenge than a springboard. Not for Tharp the logic of
following a composer's structure when she can build her own
structures and mesh them into the music's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in inviting an experimentalist like Tharp into
the City Ballet and then assuming she will choreograph like
Balanchine or Robbins. That is not her background. Although she
collaborated with Robbins on her only other work for City Ballet
(``Brahms/Handel,'' 1984), she is not necessarily familiar with key
works in the company. She has never seen ``The Cage,'' one of
Robbins' most famous ballets.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp comes out of modern dance and the fact that her own early,
spiraling idiom has been largely replaced in the last 25 years by
ballet's academic vocabulary does not alter her approach to music.
Like many modern dancers, she is apt to choreograph to no music and
then add it later; or she will substitute music in performance that
was not used initially in rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Even Roland Petit, following Jean Cocteau's directions,
choreographed to jazz and then used Bach's Passacaglia in his
landmark ballet, ``Le Jeune Homme et La Mort.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that surprising to learn that the central duet in
``The Beethoven Seventh,'' danced so magnificently by Nikolaj Hubbe
and Wendy Whelan, began in the studio to music from a couple of
Beethoven sonatas rather than the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, the choreography's fit to the symphony's
second movement is striking. Anyone can hear its dirgelike sound
and Tharp extends these rhythms into her own dramatic image of
irretrievable loss. Hubbe, limping to the staggered chords, has a
whirlwind encounter with Whelan, whose technical brilliance
deliberately contrasts with his weighted heroic postures. When she
is carried off by a cortege of men, not once but twice, Hubbe's
body breaks down in isolated movements, a study in disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the ballet is a pure-dance work, an experiment
with the ballet vocabulary. It is not, as in the past, an example
of Tharp's inability to accept this idiom as a given. Here is a
Neo-Classical ballet with a difference.
</P>
<P>
   True, Tharp's obsession with counterpoint brings in too many
crisscrossing lines in the opening ensemble, led by the mercurial
Tom Gold and the noble Peter Boal, partnering Jenifer Ringer. This
raw outburst excites with its refusal to be neat or packaged or to
keep the dancing in one place. Entire groups nest on one side of
the stage rather than yield to conventional symmetrical design.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp is hardly the first to see Beethoven's symphony as a
bridge between the Classical and Romantic eras. Boal embodies the
first principle in the initial movement and Damian Woetzel, with
Miranda Weese, embodies the more emotional aspect in his fabulous
Pan-like creature. He leads the third movement into the jubilant
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Within the context of repertory, ``The Beethoven Seventh'' is
more than just another addition. And it is not just another Tharp
ballet. Unlike many of the works she has staged for Ballet Theater
or her modern-dance troupe, this one has nobody in sneakers. Nor
are there contrasts between classical dancers and modern dancers.
</P>
<P>
   There are simply no modern dancers in City Ballet. Those who
have never liked the company are those who have never been
interested in the steps of the academic idiom for their own sake.
Kirstein, just 10 years ago, still promoted the company as the
``fortress of the traditional classic dance.'' Tharp did not storm
the gates this time around. She walked right in and felt at home.

 &HT;    Court issues guidance on abortion law
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Further defining how a state law governing
abortion for minors will be applied, the Texas Supreme Court on
Tuesday set standards for lower courts to use when deciding whether
it would not be in the child's best interest to notify parents that
their daughter is seeking an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature passed the Parental Notification Act last year
to require physicians who perform abortions to notify the parents
if a minor daughter seeks one. But the law also gave minors the
right to apply to a state district judge to get an abortion without
parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 ruling written by Justice Craig Enoch, the court said a
district judge must consider at least four factors in deciding
whether, as the law puts it, ``notification would not be in (her)
best interests'': her emotional or physical needs; the possibility
of emotional or physical danger to the minor; the stability of her
home and whether notification ``would cause serious and lasting
harm to the family structure''; and the effect of notification on
the girl's relationship with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not identify the minor, ``Jane Doe 2,'' or where
the case originated.
</P>
<P>
   But a dissent by Justice Nathan Hecht, joined by Justice Greg
Abbott, said she was 16 years old, lived with both parents, was a
junior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Doe 1 was the unidentified minor in the court's first
ruling on Feb. 25 that outlined how judges should decide whether a
girl was mature and sufficiently informed to get an abortion
without telling her parents.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge and appeals court had turned down Jane Doe 2's
application. The Supreme Court told the judge to reconsider in
lights of its rulings.

A FRENCH-RUSSIAN TEAM TELLS A FORGOTTEN STORY OF THE COLD WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The end of the Cold War was definitely bad news for
those novelists and screenwriters who were counting on the ``evil
empire'' to provide them with plots for life. Yet, while the KGB
may no longer be a credible adversary, the old Soviet Union has not
been exhausted as a font of good stories. In fact, thanks to the
collapse of Communism, it is now possible to see many human dramas
long obscured by the glare of the ideological struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The French director Regis Wargnier's new movie, ``East-West,''
nominated for best foreign language film in this year's Oscars,
recounts one such drama. When it was released in France last
summer, some critics described it as anti-Communist. Yet, in a
sense, it is no more anti-Communist than ``Indochine,'' Wargnier's
prize-winning 1991 film about the struggle against French
colonialism, was pro-Communist. Both films are love stories in
which love is tested by _ and eventually triumphs over _ politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have made this movie in any place or any country where
there had been a totalitarian regime,'' the 51-year-old Wargnier
said of ``East-West,'' which opens in the United States on March
31. ``I was most interested in the human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt helps that the political context of the movie is
relatively unfamiliar. After World War II, thousands of Russian
exiles living in France were wooed back to the Soviet Union in the
name of reconstructing the motherland. Once they arrived by boat or
train, often accompanied by French spouses, most were forever cut
off from the West. Some were assigned work, but others, suspected
of being spies, were sent to labor camps. Only a handful managed to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier first learned of these returnees and their dismal fate
in the mid-1980s. Then, a decade later, while researching another
film in Kazakhstan, he met some French-speaking Russians who
explained that they were brought up in France and returned to the
Soviet Union with their parents in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said the same thing,'' he recalled in an interview in
his Montmartre apartment, ``the very dramatic conditions of their
arrival, people being separated, some being sent to camps, others
sent into `exile' in Kazakhstan because it was difficult to leave
there. Some were also `saved' because they were useful to the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier mentioned these dramatic stories to the Russian movie
director Sergei Bodrov (``Prisoner of the Mountains'') and the idea
of a film was born. Wargnier brought in the French writer Louis
Gardel, while Bodrov invited the Russian author Roustam Ibraguimbek
to join their screenwriting team. Their script was filmed in
Ukraine and Bulgaria over 12 weeks in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a true story, but it could have been,'' Wargnier
said. ``Everything is real except our characters. But there were
people whose experiences were very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens aboard a ship carrying scores of returning
Russian exiles, among them Aleksei Golovine, a Russian doctor
played by Oleg Menchikov; his French wife, Marie, played by
Sandrine Bonnaire, and their young son, Serioja. Their optimism
disappears as soon as they land in Odessa and their passports are
seized. Allocated a single room in a communal apartment in Kiev,
they immediately recognize they have made a mistake. Marie demands
to return to Paris; Aleksei already knows this is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Marie, though, does not give up, ignoring Aleksei's warning that
she is putting the entire family at risk. She sees her first chance
to escape when a famous French actress, Gabrielle Develay
(Catherine Deneuve), arrives in Kiev with a French theater troupe.
Marie appeals to Develay for help, but Aleksei steps between them.
With her marriage increasingly strained, Marie turns her attention
to a 17-year-old neighbor, Sacha, played by Sergei Bodrov Jr., the
son of the director. Sacha is a champion swimmer who also dreams of
freedom. Friendship grows into love and, when Sacha escapes, he
pledges to rescue her. Instead, the KGB discovers her collusion and
jails her. Aleksei, however, does not abandon her.
</P>
<P>
   Wargnier credits his Russian co-writers for what he believes is
the authenticity of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have done the film without them,'' he said. ``It's
their lives. It's their blood. When I suggested that Aleksei and
Marie would live in a big building outside Moscow, they said, no,
those apartment blocs were built later. When I had Marie taking a
train on her own, they said, no, she'd be arrested within two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting the film in Ukraine and Bulgaria presented different
challenges. It helped, for instance, that Kiev today still looks
much as it did in the 1950s, so no new sets had to be built. On the
other hand, Ukrainian and Bulgarian film crews had little
experience with new movie equipment. Further, Bonnaire noted, the
psychological scars left by Communism have not fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still very distrustful,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``They are people who have been silent for long years,
so it is not easy for themselves to learn how to express themselves
overnight. It was also delicate for them because we were telling
their story. At times, we all felt a bit like exiles, like the
characters in the film, wondering if we would ever get out.''
</P>
<P>
   A different kind of cultural gap became apparent when Menchikov
arrived to work on the movie. A major star in Russia thanks to his
leading roles in ``Prisoner of the Mountains'' and in Nikita
Mikhalkov's ``Burnt by the Sun'' and ``Barber of Siberia,'' he
showed no interest in mixing with other members of the cast or
crew. He also refused to rehearse, even though he speaks no French
and learned his French-speaking role phonetically. Bonnaire grew
alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oleg is unapproachable,'' she said. ``When he's not on the
set, you never know where he is. And yes, he is very mysterious.
Perhaps he protects himself by isolating himself. I was scared.
Would he speak French? How would we get across that Marie and
Aleksei had been living together for 10 years when we had hardly
spoken? Yet, on camera, he spoke French and was present,
emotionally present. Off camera I had no contact with him, but on
camera he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnaire was also working for the first time with Deneuve,
herself no beginner in appearing mysterious, although the younger
actress had nothing but praise for Deneuve's openness towards her.
Wargnier was no less grateful that Deneuve was willing to accept
the small part of Gabrielle Develay. Her only condition, he said,
was ``if I like the script, I'll be with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with French stars like Deneuve and Bonnaire on
board, ``East-West'' received mixed reviews when it was released
here. But Wargnier, no favorite of art house audiences in France,
was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if I didn't sign the film with my name, the
reviews would have been different,'' he said. ``But some critics
just say, `Oh, it's another film by this guy, it's going to be a
kind of bloody epic, an old-fashioned melodrama.' It's not. It's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he conceded, the film may have been chosen as France's
candidate for a foreign language Academy Award this year because it
is something of an epic. After all, he said, over the last 15
years, only three French films have been nominated for an Academy
Award. Of these, he added with a slightly triumphant smile, only
``Indochine'' has won.

NEW ENGLAND GIVES MCCAIN SOME HOPE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ While the news looked grim for Sen. John
McCain in much of the country, in New England things looked much
brighter Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Gov. George W. Bush in Massachusetts and Vermont and
was running well against him in Connecticut. But Bush was ahead in
Maine, where the Bush family owns a summer home.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing in the region, with its 102 collective
delegates, was crucial to McCain's hopes of keeping his
presidential campaign alive, especially in light of his projected
losses in most of the other states holding primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite McCain's victories in New England, Tuesday's
primaries also showed his enduring inability to capture votes from
registered Republicans. In Massachusetts, for example, where polls
of voters showed McCain garnering six out of every 10 votes,
two-thirds of the voters who cast ballots for McCain were Democrats
or independents who supported him. In Vermont, Democrats and
independents carried McCain, who won by capturing just 45 percent
of registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did well in Connecticut, home to a historically moderate
and independent electorate, despite significant efforts by Gov.
John G. Rowland and every Republican lawmaker in the state, all of
whom had publicly endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very intelligent, capable man,'' said Hope Whitehead,
78, a retired history teacher, after she voted for McCain at the
Davis Middle School in Guilford. ``He has our interests at heart.
He wants to make big changes in the government, which is why the
Republican Party is not behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, thousands of Connecticut voters throughout the
state switched their party affiliations to register as Republicans
in time for Tuesday's primary. Polls of voters also suggested
McCain won a majority of the state's large number of Catholic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   They also showed he drew much support in both Connecticut and
Massachusetts from former Democrats and Liberals who recently
switched to the Republican Party. McCain received fewer than half
of the votes from registered Republicans in both states.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, McCain won the state's 12 delegates by nearly a
2-to-1 margin over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring McCain's showing in New England was Massachusetts,
where he outpaced Bush by about a 2-to-1 margin overall, and
received the support of a strong majority of Catholic voters. But,
just as he did in Michigan and New Hampshire, McCain's
Massachusetts victory was because of an outpouring of Democrats and
independents which, combined, accounted for about two-thirds of the
ballots cast for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said the number of
non-Republicans who supported McCain bodes well for Bush in the
fall. ``I think it shows dissatisfaction with the Democratic
candidates,'' said -Cellucci, who noted that the presidential
primary showed the largest turnout in state history.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican voters said they were upset with the McCain
campaign and said it had become increasingly negative, especially
in the last few weeks.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Declaring a proud victory for idealism even as he
conceded total defeat in Tuesday's primaries, former Sen. Bill
Bradley told supporters Tuesday night that his long insurgent
campaign had ``shaped the national debate'' and returned ``core
Democratic values'' to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember the fact that we did not succeed in winning
tonight's primaries makes that cause no less just, the fight no
less honorable, the goal no less reachable,'' Bradley told several
hundred tearful supporters at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown
Manhattan. ``Some have called our goals unrealistic. I call them
common sense. I call them democratic. I call them American. And I'm
going to work for them until we win. And we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told the crowd that he had called Vice President Gore to
congratulate him just minutes after 9 p.m., when the polls had
closed in New York and most other eastern states. By that time, it
was clear that Bradley was well behind in all of the 16 states that
held primaries and caucuses Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley said he would spend Wednesday resting at his
home in Montclair, N.J., as well as calling friends to talk about
his future. They said he was likely to hold a news conference on
Thursday somewhere in New Jersey to announce his withdrawal from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley did not mention talk of quitting Tuesday night,
though he spoke of his campaign in the past tense. Instead, he
spoke with soaring oratory about how his campaign had succeeded in
bringing young and idealistic people back into politics, in forcing
a national debate on things like campaign finance reform, universal
health care and child poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave voice to the voiceless,'' he said. ``When no one was
talking about the 13 children who die every day from gun violence,
we heard their cries. When no one was talking about the nearly 14
million children who still are in poverty in this country, we said
America can't remain America if they remain poor in a time of
plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he often has during this campaign, he referred to
Robert F. Kennedy, saying, ``34 year ago in South Africa, Robert
Kennedy said, `Few will have the greatness to bend history, but
each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and in
the total of all these acts will be written the history of this
generation.'' I believe history will write that we tried to change
politics, to restore trust and to defeat the politics of
expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   There is already talk among some of Bradley's staunchest
supporters about laying the groundwork for a Bradley campaign in
2004. ``There should be some time for mourning, but then it will be
time to go back to work,'' said a friend and adviser to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But close aides to Bradley said he had given absolutely no
thought to mounting another campaign in four years, and none would
hazard a guess about his intentions. ``I was wrong about his
running this time, so I'm not one to prognosticate,'' said Anita
Dunn, his communications director.
</P>
<P>
   They also declined to speculate on whether Bradley would be
willing to take a position in a Gore administration. Bradley has
already ruled out being Gore's running mate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters began filtering into the narrow ballroom
before 8 p.m. and, despite the rhythm 'n' blues band, the red,
white and blue balloons and the free-flowing wine, most were
already wearing long faces. The news reports all day had been
unrelentingly bad, and even before the polls had closed, they were
prepared to hear their candidate concede.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was so prepared for bad news that when CNN projected
Gore the winner in New York at precisely the moment the polls close
at 9 p.m., there was not so much as a murmur or a groan from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Many people said they were first-time political volunteers who
had been drawn into the campaign by Bradley's idealism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good seeds planted an nurtured don't always come up when you
expect them to,'' said Chris Hansen-Nelson, 45, of Manhattan. ``But
they come up eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   At another corner of the room, Stuart Kolbert, a 62-year-old
real estate broker from Westchester, and Ed Gerstein, a 52-year-old
accountant from Brooklyn, were reminiscing like old college
roommates about their volunteer days for Bradley in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did something good this country,'' Kolbert said. ``I
have to believe we elevated the process.'' He added, ``Tomorrow I'm
going to be depressed. I'm depressed now.''

 &HT;    Florida voters lament lack of impact
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ If you feel a little like the kid who was told he
could play later and then suddenly the game was over, don't feel
bad, you're not alone. Millions of Florida voters found out Tuesday
that the game of presidential nominations has once again ended
early.
</P>
<P>
   While that is good news for Texas Gov. George Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, even some of their biggest Sunshine State
supporters wish next Tuesday's primary could be as important as
tiny New Hampshire's.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Floridians haven't paid for the privilege of an
exciting primary. So far, more than $8 million of Florida cash has
been given to the presidential candidates. But with the party
nominations all but formalized Tuesday night, the nation's fourth
largest state finds itself with no say in the country's politics
until the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we have to change,'' said GOP state chairman
Al Cardenas, who supports Bush. ``We can't continue to have a
primary system where states like ours do not get to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was hope as recently as two weeks ago that Floridians
would share the excitement. Arizona Sen. John McCain looked as if
he might drag out the primary season and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley held out hope that he might have a few surprises up
his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it one step at a time,'' said an ever hopeful
Natalie Zellner, Bradley's Florida state director, even as Tuesday
night's dismal results were becoming known. ``I'm trying to sound
hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bradley's campaign fizzled, McCain appeared in recent
weeks to have an outside shot of thwarting Bush's march to the
nomination. McCain's Florida campaign chairman, Bob Milligan, the
state comptroller and a retired Marine general, suggested that
large numbers of volunteers were ready to move out in force here
once McCain gave the word.
</P>
<P>
   Their strategy relied on the idea that if McCain could not win
the entire state, he could win a chunk of the 80 delegates, which
are divided by congressional district, by winning two or three
districts, particularly around Pensacola and Tampa Bay, that have a
strong military presence. One thing McCain could not depend on was
Democrats and independents. Unlike Michigan and New Hampshire,
where McCain won because of help from those groups, Florida has a
closed primary meaning you must vote according to your party
registration.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would also be going up against the formidable political
machine of Gov. Jeb Bush, the younger brother of the Texas
governor. Months ago, Jeb Bush dispatched senior aides to Coral
Gables to open a campaign headquarters and organize all 67
counties. They have been operating phone banks and mailing campaign
brochures to likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jillian Inmon, a political veteran, the Florida
headquarters was filled with volunteers and paid staff last night
as they continued to prepare for Tuesday's election determined to
make sure that Democrats will be impressed by Bush's prowess here.
</P>
<P>
   And for Florida voters that is good news. Both Democrats and
Republicans expect Florida to be a key battleground state in the
November election. For Jeb Bush, a loss here would be humiliating
and he will do everything he can to make sure his brother defeats
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, emboldened by President's Clinton victory here in
1996, believe that they can be competitive. Clinton and Gore have
made frequent visits to the state in recent months. Whether Florida
will remain in play will most likely be determined by campaign
polling in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to lose this state,'' says Inmon. ``There is
no way we are going to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, so far neither Bush nor Gore has made plans to come
here before Tuesday.

 &HT;    GORE GREETS VICTORY IN THE TOWN THAT TURNED HIS CAMPAIGN AROUND
 &HT;    Eds: inserts grafs 3 -4 with speech color.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore, in a triumphant
return Tuesday to his campaign headquarters in the shadow of Music
City's gleaming skyline, couldn't resist a dig at the critics who
had dismissed his move here as a crass political stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that idea to move to Nashville was a gimmick,'' Gore
quipped sarcastically as hundreds of volunteers welcomed him home
to celebrate one of the biggest political triumphs in a career that
began in 1976 with his election to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced by his wife, Tipper, as ``the next
president of the United States,'' Gore told a raucous crowd that
``while we are here to celebrate great victories, I say to you
tonight _ and hear me well _ you ain't seen nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech punctuated by the refrain ``join us now,''
Gore marched through his policy positions on taxes, gun control,
education, and other major issues, laying the groundwork for what
he promised would be ``a campaign that trusts the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision last October to move his presidential campaign
headquarters from Washington's lobbyist-infested K Street to the
capital of his home state of Tennessee marked the turning point in
a White House bid that had stumbled through most of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to Nashville, Gore was able to streamline an
organization that had grown top-heavy with high-priced consultants
and to energize his campaign with only the most committed workers
and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process of moving ``from K Street to the K Mart,'' as
he phrased it, he remade himself as a candidate, shedding the
trappings of the vice presidency and his trademark blue suits,
reaching out to voters in open meetings in a casual, more personal
way.
</P>
<P>
   He also trained his political sights on his challenger, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and picked apart the Bradley
candidacy with precision. He prevented him from wooing away any of
the core Democratic constituencies _ blacks, Jews, union members
and gays _ while holding together the more conservative ``New
Democratic'' coalition built by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two days of campaigning before the Super Tuesday
primaries, Gore appeared before some of the most loyal Democratic
voters. He met with Jewish leaders and gay activists in New York on
Monday and dropped by a union rally in Nashville on Tuesday before
retiring to a downtown hotel to watch the election returns.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he squeezed in a trip to St. Louis for a rally
Monday night, a final push to sweep even Bradley's native state of
Missouri in the closest thing the United States has ever had to a
national presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking a single vote for granted,'' he told reporters
on Air Force Two en route from St. Louis to Nashville. ``I'm not
looking beyond Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Gore has stepped up his attacks on Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who all but clinched the Republican
presidential nomination Tuesday, in a clear indication of his
confidence in winning the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And he has heaped praise on Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the GOP
challenger who has excited independent voters this year with his
promises to reform the political campaign finance process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to travel Wednesday to Michigan, an important swing
state in the general election and one where McCain defeated Bush in
the GOP primaries on the strength of independent voters who swamped
the political machine of Republican Gov. John Engler, a staunch
Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore has also sought to soothe any hard
feelings on the part of Bradley supporters, repeatedly expressing
his admiration for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between Senator Bradley and myself are nothing
compared to the differences between both of us as Democrats, on the
one hand, and both of the Republicans on the other hand,'' Gore
told an audience over the weekend.

 &HT;    More witnesses are emerging in case of Buckhead stabbings
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A grant of immunity to a Houston woman riding with Ray Lewis the
night of the Buckhead murders may prompt a string of new witnesses
to surface in the case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the potential witnesses emerged Tuesday and is conferring
with a lawyer about speaking to authorities. The man, a law student
from Texas, was one of several individuals identified by Jessica
Robertson as being among the passengers in the stretch limousine
with Lewis on the night of the slayings, said Atlanta lawyer Dwight
Thomas, the law student's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, also a passenger, was given immunity by prosecutors
last week. Her statement broke an investigative logjam in the case,
Thomas said. He said Robertson's statement was the first time
authorities had spoken to a passenger in the limousine, apart from
initial comments Lewis made to police. Police have obtained
statements from the limousine's driver. Thomas said there were 13
people riding in the limousine that night and that Robertson gave
several of the names to District Attorney Paul Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few people from the vehicle have surfaced, but they
have surfaced with counsel,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his client, whom he would not name, ``witnessed
quite a bit'' and that he would confer with the man this weekend
before allowing him to talk to prosecutors. He may seek immunity
for his client, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the witnesses are retaining lawyers because they
fear being charged in connection with the deaths of Jacinth Baker,
21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of Decatur. The two were stabbed
to death near a Buckhead nightclub the night of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a star NFL linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, is
charged with murder. He is out of jail on bail and under a
court-supervised curfew in Maryland. Also charged with the murders
are two other passengers: Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and
Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami. They are jailed in Atlanta awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone they can put in that limousine has the potential for a
criminal charge _ obstruction of justice, a party to the crime,''
said Thomas. ``These people can be squeezed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his client has long been a friend of Robertson, who
is also known as Jaye Roberts, but the law student barely knows
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Tuesday obtained the
affidavit for the warrant police used to search Lewis' home in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit relies heavily on statements that Duane Fassett,
Lewis' longtime limousine driver, gave authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said that he ``routinely picks 'Shorty' and 'Derby' up
at Raymond Lewis' residence ... on Sundays when there is a home
game for the Baltimore Ravens.'' Oakley is known as ``Derby'' and
Sweeting as ``Shorty.'' Fassett also said Oakley and Sweeting
``would be at the Foxcreek Court address (Lewis' home) without
Raymond Lewis Jr. being present.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was vague in statements to police about the occupants of
the limousine, calling them ``club people'' and only naming A.J.
Johnson and Kwame King. A.J. Johnson was an alias used by Oakley.
Lewis told police he'd only met him the night of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit also stated Lewis was ``observed in a physical
altercation with one of the victims'' and that a ``substantial
amount of blood'' was found in the limousine's passenger
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit appears to go further than what Fassett told
police in a taped interview. In the interview, Fassett did not
describe a physical altercation with a victim but said he saw Lewis
throw a punch.

 &HT;    McCain loss in New York could silence campaign
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Sen. John McCain's hopes for New York were
dashed in what could be his greatest political defeat as early
projections awarded this key state to Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's additional wins in the major swing state of Ohio, as
well as Maine, the governor robbed McCain of the Northeast sweep
his camp was counting on. A New York victory would have allowed
McCain to march on, his strategists surmised.
</P>
<P>
   Even without New York, Bush knew enough late Tuesday to look
toward November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, in the other party, Al Gore is celebrating victory as
well,'' Bush said in Austin, Texas, even before hearing of New
York. ``I congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is
the candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a
tough case to make in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's primary is really 31 separate contests held in each
of the state's congressional districts. Delegate, not candidate,
names appear most prominently on the ballot, arguably giving Bush
an edge since he enjoyed the backing of party leaders from Gov.
George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers on down.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials dropped their efforts to keep McCain off the
state ballot after Bush's sobering New Hampshire loss raised
concerns of a backlash in this state. But that didn't stop McCain
from dubbing Pataki and Powers ``Comrade Pataki'' and ``Comrade
Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush have sparred over a Bush campaign ad featuring
Geri Barish, a breast cancer survivor and activist who criticizes
McCain for failing to vote for federal funding that included money
for some breast cancer research programs. The issue is a potent one
on Long Island where activists say rates of the disease are
unusually high and where more moderate Republicans who could help
McCain are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, tried to distance himself from a campaign waged
by backer Sam Wyly, a wealthy Texan who spent $2.5 million on TV
ads in New York, California and Ohio attacking McCain and touting
Bush's environmental record. Bush said he knew nothing about the
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush sent a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor
expressing regret for not speaking out about his objection to Bob
Jones University's anti-Catholic philosophy. Bush kicked off his
South Carolina primary bid with a speech at the evangelical
university in February.
</P>
<P>
   That speech and the timing of the letter changed Republican Joe
Artino's mind about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week before the New York primary, he writes a letter to the
cardinal apologizing. I felt he only did that because he was
looking for the Catholic vote,'' said Artino, a Catholic. ``I
didn't like that at all. So, I said maybe McCain is the better
person for the job.''

CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER DENIES CLAIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; CAMARILLO, Calif. _ California Amplifier Inc. isn't waiting for
a court date to defend itself from a lawsuit by a competitor
alleging patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The Camarillo-based company issued a statement Tuesday saying
allegations contained in a federal lawsuit filed by Orland Park,
Ill.-based Andrew Corp. are without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cal Amp officials have seen a copy of the complaint,
they have not yet been formally served with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed that Andrew Corp. did not contact us
prior to filing this complaint,'' chief executive officer Fred
Sturm said in a statement. ``We firmly believe that if we had been
given the opportunity to clarify the design characteristics of our
transceiver products, Andrew Corp. would have had significant
relevant information to consider before filing this infringement
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Corp. spokesman John Byrne declined to comment beyond
confirming the existence of the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Andrew purchased Conifer Corp., which, like
California Amplifier, makes multichannel multipoint distribution
service products, including microwave amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   They enable cable television signals to be transmitted via
microwave. The technology is also called wireless cable.
</P>
<P>
   The service eliminates the need for much of the wiring a cable
connection requires but is limited by geography because microwaves
travel in a straight line and cannot pass through mountains or
heavy vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caliornia Amplifier closed at $43.75 Tuesday, up 25
cents, and shares of Andrew Corp were up 13 cents to close at
$29.75.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For someone who was embalmed just last fall
by a New York tabloid as ``Dead Veep Walking,'' it was a stunning
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after he embarrassed himself with an ill-conceived
and inept presidential campaign and only a few months after he was
nearly written off as a loser, Vice President Al Gore has revived
his fortunes, sweeping aside an opponent who sneaked up on him last
fall and nearly stole his political future.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly giddy here Tuesday in acknowledging his triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is full tonight, and I want to thank all of you who
are here and all those across America who have stood with us and
helped to bring us this moment,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech after
the voting in the Super Tuesday primaries. ``This is your victory,
too.'' Gore and his wife, Tipper, watched the returns in a hotel
suite here. Shortly after 9 p.m. East Coast time, Gore took the
stage at the hotel ballroom here where he claimed his last Senate
title in 1984. While he did not technically declare victory because
the polls had yet to close on the West Coast, he said he had
received ``a very gracious'' telephone call from his only rival,
former Senator Bill Bradley. His conciliatory tone toward Bradley
belied the heat of the campaign and the scare that Bradley had
given him. He did not reveal the contents of the conversation, even
to his aides, because he rushed to the ballroom right after he hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fond of saying that competition from his lone rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, has been good for him, that the challenge
by Bradley forced him to become a better candidate. Bradley ``was a
blessing in disguise,'' Gore said recently, invoking Winston
Churchill as he hinted in a trenchant aside just how nervous he had
once been: ``Some disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Bradley did spur Gore into a wholesale overhaul
of his candidacy, prompting an extraordinary political resurrection
of the vice president after Labor Day, when a poll by The Boston
Globe showed Bradley neck and neck with him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the building blocks that helped Gore survive that period
actually were put in place long ago. As Bill Clinton's vice
president, he devoted himself to raising money and doing political
favors _ and collecting iou's from local and state politicians
across the country. And in 1999 he called those chits in, racking
up endorsements from county sheriffs to the president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So formidable was the political infrastructure Gore assembled
that by last year he had scared off any challengers. Most notable
among them was Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who decided that the
Democrats had a better chance of recapturing the House than keeping
the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So confident was the Gore team that when Bradley loped into the
picture from left field, it paid him little mind. After all, Gore
had locked up most of the so-called superdelegates, the elected
officials and party leaders who will pick the nominee at the
party's August convention. He had built a floor through which he
could not fall. And he was campaigning at a time of peace and
nearly unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But then, perhaps feeling too secure, he lapsed into an
imperious Rose Garden strategy that nearly led to his ruin.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles have been well-documented, as has his very public
makeover, in which he abandoned the podium in favor of the
Oprah-style town meeting used with such great success by his
mentor, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to bring an end to Gore Inc.,'' one Gore adviser
recalled recently, referring to the sprawling, complacent, almost
corporate entity that the sterile campaign had become. ``It wasn't
just a building on K Street; it was a psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   What secured his victory, however, were certain strategic
decisions and a newfound discipline in the candidate and in his
campaign to adhere to those decisions. As he was developing a
warmer and fuzzier public image, his campaign was developing a
sharper edge. That sharpness sometimes overtook the candidate in
his debates with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore deftly forced Bradley into a more negative campaign than
Bradley had vowed to run. All the while, the vice president was
nailing down the support of core constituents, relentlessly
painting a worrisome picture of Bradley and resolving not to stray
from his message of the day _ even to the point of laughing in
recent days about his universal answer, no matter the question: ``I
am not taking a single vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The central decision was basically to keep the gas on and not
let up,'' one top Gore strategist said. ``That was the guiding
principle, to stay disciplined, focused, on message, and campaign
like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the history of the Gore campaign is written, it may
focus less on Gore's successful stratagems (and there were many)
and more on Bradley's missteps (and there were many). Even as
Bradley loomed as a potentially serious threat, he mystified Gore
operatives for his inability to build on his assets, and he made
blunders that in retrospect seem naive.
</P>
<P>
   One telling moment went almost unremarked by the Gore campaign
at the time. It was back on Dec. 16, when Bradley shared a stage in
Claremont, N.H., with Sen. John McCain, a Republican, to highlight
their disgust with the campaign finance system. At the time, it
looked like a coup for Bradley: lasso the maverick Republican, make
a name for yourself as a new breed of politician, and build some
excitement among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, that ``summit of the underdogs,'' as Bradley and
McCain termed it, hurt Bradley more than it helped him. In the eyes
of the Gore campaign, at least retrospectively, it validated the
scrappier McCain as the true insurgent and seemed to give Bradley's
stamp of approval for independent-leaning Democrats to vote for
McCain.

TWO FROM KC AREA SUMMONED TO TESTIFY ABOUT FETAL-TISSUE
TRANSACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A pathologist and a medical technician from Lee's
Summit, Mo., who worked at clinics that perform abortions have been
subpoenaed to testify before a U.S. House committee investigating
whether fetal tissue was sold at excessive prices for medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The men worked with two companies that did fetal-tissue removal
at various places in the country, including the clinic of Planned
Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The companies leased facilities for the tissue work. Planned
Parenthood is not accused of breaking the law but has been drawn
into what could be a highly charged congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows fetal tissue to be donated for research, but
the House committee will focus on whether fees charged to cover
costs of tissue removal and transportation are unreasonable and in
violation of the law. Stronger laws are being advocated in
resolutions in the House and in the Senate, where members of the
Judiciary Committee also talked last month of calling for witnesses
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a for-profit, market-driven sale of body
parts,'' said Steve Schmidt, spokesman for the House Commerce
Committee. Its Health and Environment Subcommittee will conduct the
hearing Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to testimony about the sale of fetal parts, the
committee is expected to hear graphic description of organs being
removed from fetuses. Some Democrats are trying to close the
hearing, but Republicans are resisting that, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents acknowledge that fetal-tissue research is
valuable in finding treatments for certain diseases, but they said
it could increase abortions by making women feel less guilty about
having one.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has subpoenaed pathologist Miles Jones and medical
technician Dean Alberty, both of Lee's Summit. Jones has given no
indication he will appear, Schmidt said. Alberty intends to appear
if his expenses are paid, said his lawyer, David Stout of Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had an agreement to work at the Planned Parenthood clinic
for 10 weeks in 1998 and has worked at clinics in several other
states. He has a businesses called Opening Lines, which puts out a
brochure listing fetal-organ prices, such at $999 for a brain and
$150 for a liver.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not returned phone and e-mail messages from The Kansas
City Star. No one answered the door at his house on recent visit by
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight the ABC News program ``20//20'' is scheduled to show a
hidden-camera interview conducted by an ABC producer, pretending to
be a potential investor, meeting with Jones over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty worked for Opening Lines and for the Georgia-based
Anatomic Gift Foundation as a technician when the company leased
space at Planned Parenthood's clinic in Overland Park several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty has not returned phone calls seeking comment. Anatomic
Gifts sued him after he left its employment, alleging he violated
an agreement to keep details of his work confidential. In his
response to the lawsuit, Alberty said he witnessed illegal tissue
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bardsley, president of Anatomic Gift, said Tuesday that the
company did nothing illegal or unethical and that Alberty was
working as a spy for an anti-abortion organization that was
investigating fetal-tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything to hide, and we abide by the law,''
said Bardsley, who agreed to testify voluntarily to the
subcommittee. The company, however, got out of the fetal-tissue
business Jan. 1 because it detracted from its other work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty told the ``20//20'' reporter that he was so disturbed by
the practice of fetal-tissue extraction that he accepted money from
an anti-abortion group to work under cover.

 NASHVILLE, Tenn.: for McCain.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When Bradley stood with McCain, he provided a letter of
transit for independent voters to go with McCain,'' one Gore
confidant said. ``It didn't matter that McCain was pro-life or
pro-gun,'' he said. ``People saw him as legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Such blunders, over time, created an opening for the vice
president after months of self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``His failures reinvigorated the Gore campaign,'' said Leon E.
Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and a
close observer of the Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Gore campaign was lining up with all the core
Democratic constituencies that vote in primaries. These efforts
were led by Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, who has extensive
experience in working with the party's core groups, like
influential blacks, women and gays. The rest of the Gore team was
also clicking into place, with Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman,
Carter Eskew, the message man, Bob Shrum, the media strategist, and
Michael Whouley, the top field marshal, on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign averted a potential disaster by persuading
organized labor to endorse Gore, which it did on Oct. 12. The
AFL-CIO could have remained neutral and nearly did. Only after
intense lobbying by Gore officials, with an assist from Clinton,
did the unions, though not unanimously, bestow their prized backing
and its promise of election-day manpower on the vice president. It
helped restore a sense of strength that had slipped through Gore's
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before, Gore had signaled a new aggressiveness. In
twin speeches to the Democratic National Committee, Bradley made a
lofty appeal to the party's highest instincts, while Gore, aiming
his message less at suburban moderates and more at the party's
base, said he would roll up his sleeves and fight for the
traditional values the party advocated.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed by a similarly disparate appearance at the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner in Des Moines, where again Bradley
aimed for the ideal and Gore came across as more practical. Gore,
still the self-anointed underdog, pressed Bradley to agree to
debates. Bradley demurred, a pose that he would often adopt, to his
detriment, in the face of Gore's confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Gore's campaign anthem of ``Stay and Fight''
emerged. He had accused Bradley of quitting the Senate (he retired
after a third term), while Gore decided to ``stay and fight'' the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Grisolano, a direct-mail consultant in Iowa and a Gore
supporter, proposed that Gore expand this phrase into a theme. By
the night of the dinner, 1,000 signs had been printed up with the
slogan, and over time it evolved into a full-fledged battle cry
that Gore now gives full throat to at the end of nearly every
speech: ``I am a fighter! I want to fight for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said: ``The crucial thing is that Al Gore came out of
this thing looking like a fighter. Bradley didn't. He wasn't
willing to fight back. And in not fighting back, he let Gore look
like the stronger candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fighter persona emerged just as Bradley was putting his
health-care proposal forward, and it offered Gore a chance to go
after something substantive.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team believed health care would be a central concern of
voters but there was some question about what approach to take
since the Clinton administration's own proposal for universal
coverage had failed so drastically in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One top Gore adviser described the internal debate: ``There was
a very active debate in the campaign between those who wanted a
more sweeping health-care proposal _ those who frankly had lived
with the ghost of Harris Wofford and Bob Kerrey, who had ridden it
with incredible political power and momentum _ and those on the
policy staff who said we should be more incremental.'' The adviser
said Gore had decided to put the brakes on a more ambitious
health-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, Gore ripped into Bradley's proposal as a
half-baked plan that would cost too much and provide woefully
inadequate coverage. His main charge was that Bradley's goal of
universal coverage _ which Gore adopted as his own _ was worthy but
that the approach should be step by step, not in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   From this, Gore extracted a larger message about his candidacy _
that he was a political realist and would be a careful steward of
the prosperity while Bradley was a dreamer with an academic
approach to problems that would end up hurting people and ruining
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were up against a Clinton/Gore-style campaign,'' said Lee
Miringhoff, director of the Marist Institute poll in New York.
``They target, hit, morph their positions very closely to yours and
poke a hole or two in them and then bore away _ and you have to be
up at the same speed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore honed his skills in debate practice with his friend Tom
Downey, a former congressman from Long Island, standing in for
Bradley. More than one observer said that Downey was sharper
playing Bradley than Mr. Bradley was in the actual debates. ``Gore
and Downey are friends, too, and that added to the competition
between them,'' said one who watched.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Iowa was effectively over on Jan. 8, when in a
debate, Gore questioned Bradley's commitment to helping flood
victims in Iowa and Bradley did not address the matter. New
Hampshire, where Gore had been on television for most of October
with no counter-advertising from Bradley, fell into line shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That month that we had to ourselves really helped us to get
back in the race,'' said one strategist. He said that when Bradley
did buy air time, he did so in Boston, and the Gore campaign could
see Bradley gaining ground among voters who watched Boston
television.

   ``We faced a serious financial decision, and that was whether to
go up in Boston or not,'' this adviser said. ``Unless you
communicate through the Boston media, you won't reach a big chunk
of New Hampshire voters. We knew it would cost more and be less
efficient, but if you don't do it, you're cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was also monitoring another topic that no one
wanted to be caught discussing in public. That was Bradley's heart
palpitations, a seemingly minor problem that could have mushroomed
into a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley people say that if he hadn't had the heart thing,
he would have won New Hampshire,'' a Gore adviser said. ``Well, if
we were trailing, we might have run a different kind of campaign,''
he said, not suggesting they would have used Bradley's heart
condition against him but that as long as Bradley supporters were
engaging in hypotheticals, this adviser would too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no lack of will to win over here,'' he said, in a
clear shot across the bow at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
leading Republican candidate. ``If we had found ourselves in a
situation where we were short a vote, we probably would have tried
a different route.''
</P>
<P>
   What would they have done? ``We would have drawn much stronger
contrasts than we did,'' said this adviser. ``We would have brought
up that Bradley wants people to work until they're 70 when they
retire. We didn't unload all our firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Zukin, a public policy professor at Rutgers University,
said that Gore prevailed for both tactical reasons but also larger
reasons that he had little control over. ``Bradley was running
against the longest economic expansion in history,'' he said. ``How
do you call for fundamental change during good economic times? No
one has ever done it successfully.''  &QL;

DEFENDING THE SMALL INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One of the questions most frequently asked
when Americans are frustrated by their inability to make government
more responsive concerns how they can ``make a difference,'' as
they usually put it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nadler began mulling how to improve the system a few
years back, and his ruminations resulted in the American
Shareholders Association, which is nearing its first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler is best known in Kansas City as editor in chief of K.C.
Jones Monthly, a journal of conservative commentary, and as a
regular panelist on KCPT's ``Ruckus'' program. His epiphany
occurred, he relates, when, as a small investor reaping the rewards
of a rising stock market, he came to realize he was a small part of
a history-making epoch. His next step was an attempt to determine
just how large the working-class capital-ownership phenomenon had
become.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler's research led him to write a monograph titled ``The Rise
of Worker Capitalism,'' which late last year was published as a
Cato Institute policy analysis. What Nadler discovered along the
way was the emergence of what he characterizes as ``the first mass
class of worker-stockholders in history.'' These are wage earners,
he says, who derive a substantial portion of their income from
investments.
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps most surprising about Nadler's research was how
it showed this development transcending age, sex, race, wealth and
occupation. During the first half of the '90s, stockholding
increased significantly for virtually all demographic groups. His
study revealed, for instance, that of all those owning stocks or
stock mutual funds, half had incomes under $50,000, and the
ownership increase has been especially steep for families with
incomes under $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increasing capital ownership comes from expanded
opportunities. Companies offering 401(k) plans tripled during the
'90s, and mutual fund holdings of private pension plans increased
15-fold from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While there are several powerful organizations representing
America's capitalists, Nadler believed there still was a need for a
lobby for the little guy. From this belief emerged the American
Shareholders Association. Nadler, who serves as executive director,
established his association as an affiliate of Americans for Tax
Reform, a strong advocate of taxpayer rights.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far it's not a mass movement. Nadler estimates current
membership at some 5,000, with about half the U.S. congressional
districts represented. In the early going he is recruiting people
interested in doing grass-roots lobbying. A big part of that effort
this year is attempting to get congressional candidates to respond
to the association's questionnaire on legislation affecting
investors.
</P>
<P>
   They survey attitudes toward capital gains tax rates, Internet
taxation, taxation of retirement investments and estate taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Will Nadler's association evolve into a behemoth resembling an
AARP for individual investors? It's an interesting thing to
contemplate, Nadler concedes, but the priority is to create a
organizational foundation on which to build.
</P>
<P>
   If he's successful, those who want to ``make a difference'' will
have increasing opportunities to do so.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For someone who was embalmed just last fall
by a New York tabloid as ``Dead Veep Walking,'' it was a stunning
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after he embarrassed himself with an ill-conceived
and inept presidential campaign and only a few months after he was
nearly written off as a loser, Vice President Al Gore has revived
his fortunes, sweeping aside an opponent who sneaked up on him last
fall and nearly stole his political future.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly giddy here Tuesday in acknowledging his triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is full tonight, and I want to thank all of you who
are here and all those across America who have stood with us and
helped to bring us this moment,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech after
the voting in the Super Tuesday primaries. ``This is your victory,
too.'' Gore and his wife, Tipper, watched the returns in a hotel
suite here. Shortly after 9 p.m. East Coast time, Gore took the
stage at the hotel ballroom here where he claimed his last Senate
title in 1984. While he did not technically declare victory because
the polls had yet to close on the West Coast, he said he had
received ``a very gracious'' telephone call from his only rival,
former Senator Bill Bradley. His conciliatory tone toward Bradley
belied the heat of the campaign and the scare that Bradley had
given him. He did not reveal the contents of the conversation, even
to his aides, because he rushed to the ballroom right after he hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is fond of saying that competition from his lone rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, has been good for him, that the challenge
by Bradley forced him to become a better candidate. Bradley ``was a
blessing in disguise,'' Gore said recently, invoking Winston
Churchill as he hinted in a trenchant aside just how nervous he had
once been: ``Some disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Bradley did spur Gore into a wholesale overhaul
of his candidacy, prompting an extraordinary political resurrection
of the vice president after Labor Day, when a poll by The Boston
Globe showed Bradley neck and neck with him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the building blocks that helped Gore survive that period
actually were put in place long ago. As Bill Clinton's vice
president, he devoted himself to raising money and doing political
favors _ and collecting iou's from local and state politicians
across the country. And in 1999 he called those chits in, racking
up endorsements from county sheriffs to the president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So formidable was the political infrastructure Gore assembled
that by last year he had scared off any challengers. Most notable
among them was Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who decided that the
Democrats had a better chance of recapturing the House than keeping
the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So confident was the Gore team that when Bradley loped into the
picture from left field, it paid him little mind. After all, Gore
had locked up most of the so-called superdelegates, the elected
officials and party leaders who will pick the nominee at the
party's August convention. He had built a floor through which he
could not fall. And he was campaigning at a time of peace and
nearly unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But then, perhaps feeling too secure, he lapsed into an
imperious Rose Garden strategy that nearly led to his ruin.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles have been well-documented, as has his very public
makeover, in which he abandoned the podium in favor of the
Oprah-style town meeting used with such great success by his
mentor, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to bring an end to Gore Inc.,'' one Gore adviser
recalled recently, referring to the sprawling, complacent, almost
corporate entity that the sterile campaign had become. ``It wasn't
just a building on K Street; it was a psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   What secured his victory, however, were certain strategic
decisions and a newfound discipline in the candidate and in his
campaign to adhere to those decisions. As he was developing a
warmer and fuzzier public image, his campaign was developing a
sharper edge. That sharpness sometimes overtook the candidate in
his debates with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore deftly forced Bradley into a more negative campaign than
Bradley had vowed to run. All the while, the vice president was
nailing down the support of core constituents, relentlessly
painting a worrisome picture of Bradley and resolving not to stray
from his message of the day _ even to the point of laughing in
recent days about his universal answer, no matter the question: ``I
am not taking a single vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The central decision was basically to keep the gas on and not
let up,'' one top Gore strategist said. ``That was the guiding
principle, to stay disciplined, focused, on message, and campaign
like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the history of the Gore campaign is written, it may
focus less on Gore's successful stratagems (and there were many)
and more on Bradley's missteps (and there were many). Even as
Bradley loomed as a potentially serious threat, he mystified Gore
operatives for his inability to build on his assets, and he made
blunders that in retrospect seem naive.
</P>
<P>
   One telling moment went almost unremarked by the Gore campaign
at the time. It was back on Dec. 16, when Bradley shared a stage in
Claremont, N.H., with Sen. John McCain, a Republican, to highlight
their disgust with the campaign finance system. At the time, it
looked like a coup for Bradley: lasso the maverick Republican, make
a name for yourself as a new breed of politician, and build some
excitement among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, that ``summit of the underdogs,'' as Bradley and
McCain termed it, hurt Bradley more than it helped him. In the eyes
of the Gore campaign, at least retrospectively, it validated the
scrappier McCain as the true insurgent and seemed to give Bradley's
stamp of approval for independent-leaning Democrats to vote for
McCain.

 &HT;    GORE TAKES COMMAND OF DEMOCRATIC RACE
 &HT;    Eds: updates throughout.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore took command of the
Democratic presidential race Tuesday, sweeping to lopsided
victories in states from coast to coast and forcing Bill Bradley to
assess whether to continue his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a victory address at a posh downtown Nashville hotel,
immediately pivoted to a general election strategy with an appeal
to the independent voters that were attracted to GOP upstart John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us now,'' he said in touting the economic prosperity of
the last seven years and presenting the Democratic Party as
``mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is full tonight,'' Gore declared to the hundreds of
supporters who celebrated his victory with food, drinks and country
music.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to heal any wounds from the surprisingly bitter battle
with Bradley, Gore called his challenger a ``good man.'' He added,
``Anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign has
come away from the experience moved and touched by the strength of
his commitment to healing the divisions in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   A subdued but relaxed Bradley spoke to supporters in an
appearance shortly after the polls closed in New York. Surrounded
by longtime friends and campaign staff at a New York hotel, Bradley
hinted that the losses would force him to withdraw from the race,
but vowed to continue the fight for a ``new kind of politics in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won; I lost,'' Bradley said. ``On one level I agree with
Vince Lombardi when he said winning isn't everything, it's the only
thing. Tomorrow, I'll consult with supporters around the country
and get their thoughts and advice and I'll make my plans known
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chairman Doug Berman shook his head ``no'' when asked
if the the speech left any doubt that Bradley planned to exit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley had long contended that he was up against
``entrenched power'' in his campaign against Gore, he lost every
core Democratic constituency in what is likely to be his last
face-to-face contest with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   According to network television polls, Gore won African
Americans, Jews, Hispanics, gays, labor and women, all key elements
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's support came almost exclusively from anti-Clinton
Democrats, not a large constituency in a party that, despite the
impeachment of President Clinton, has presided over the longest
economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories in the largest primary voting of the year
reflected a remarkable comeback from the days last summer when his
campaign was viewed as weak and ineffective in the face of a
surprisingly strong challenge from Bradley and the popularity of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But a disciplined and energetic Gore powered past Bradley on
Tuesday. And in a poll published Tuesday by the Wall Street
Journal, Gore erased the double digit lead Bush had on him last
summer. The latest poll shows the two in a 46-46 percent tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his family joined fellow Tennesseans at a hotel near
the Vanderbilt University campus to celebrate one of the biggest
victories of his 24-year career in politics, one that brings him a
step closer to the nomination he first sought in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore registered convincing margins of victory in California, New
York, Georgia and Ohio, the most important states in the so-called
Super Tuesday primary. He also rolled up victories in Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island and Missouri,
Bradley's native state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his uphill campaign against Gore in December
1998. Others considered the race, but calculated that a sitting
vice president would be too difficult to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scored early success in the fund-raising arena, raising
almost as much money as Gore and threatening the vice president
with positive poll numbers in New Hampshire, site of the nation's
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to be a candidate of ``big ideas,'' Bradley ran on a
plan to provide health insurance to the nation's poor, enact
stricter gun control and replace the campaign finance laws with a
system of public financing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley invested heavily in Iowa and lost. The defeat,
coupled with McCain's maverick appeal, contributed to Bradley's
loss in New Hampshire. From then on, Bradley found it difficult to
regain his footing in a national media environment where all the
focus was on McCain and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of this is that we had an extraordinarily hard
task in front of us,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications
director. ``We knew it would not be easy.''

 NASHVILLE, Tenn.: for McCain.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When Bradley stood with McCain, he provided a letter of
transit for independent voters to go with McCain,'' one Gore
confidant said. ``It didn't matter that McCain was pro-life or
pro-gun,'' he said. ``People saw him as legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Such blunders, over time, created an opening for the vice
president after months of self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``His failures reinvigorated the Gore campaign,'' said Leon E.
Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and a
close observer of the Gore candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Gore campaign was lining up with all the core
Democratic constituencies that vote in primaries. These efforts
were led by Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, who has extensive
experience in working with the party's core groups, like
influential blacks, women and gays. The rest of the Gore team was
also clicking into place, with Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman,
Carter Eskew, the message man, Bob Shrum, the media strategist, and
Michael Whouley, the top field marshal, on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign averted a potential disaster by persuading
organized labor to endorse Gore, which it did on Oct. 12. The
AFL-CIO could have remained neutral and nearly did. Only after
intense lobbying by Gore officials, with an assist from Clinton,
did the unions, though not unanimously, bestow their prized backing
and its promise of election-day manpower on the vice president. It
helped restore a sense of strength that had slipped through Gore's
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before, Gore had signaled a new aggressiveness. In
twin speeches to the Democratic National Committee, Bradley made a
lofty appeal to the party's highest instincts, while Gore, aiming
his message less at suburban moderates and more at the party's
base, said he would roll up his sleeves and fight for the
traditional values the party advocated.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed by a similarly disparate appearance at the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner in Des Moines, where again Bradley
aimed for the ideal and Gore came across as more practical. Gore,
still the self-anointed underdog, pressed Bradley to agree to
debates. Bradley demurred, a pose that he would often adopt, to his
detriment, in the face of Gore's confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Gore's campaign anthem of ``Stay and Fight''
emerged. He had accused Bradley of quitting the Senate (he retired
after a third term), while Gore decided to ``stay and fight'' the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Grisolano, a direct-mail consultant in Iowa and a Gore
supporter, proposed that Gore expand this phrase into a theme. By
the night of the dinner, 1,000 signs had been printed up with the
slogan, and over time it evolved into a full-fledged battle cry
that Gore now gives full throat to at the end of nearly every
speech: ``I am a fighter! I want to fight for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said: ``The crucial thing is that Al Gore came out of
this thing looking like a fighter. Bradley didn't. He wasn't
willing to fight back. And in not fighting back, he let Gore look
like the stronger candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fighter persona emerged just as Bradley was putting his
health-care proposal forward, and it offered Gore a chance to go
after something substantive.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team believed health care would be a central concern of
voters but there was some question about what approach to take
since the Clinton administration's own proposal for universal
coverage had failed so drastically in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One top Gore adviser described the internal debate: ``There was
a very active debate in the campaign between those who wanted a
more sweeping health-care proposal _ those who frankly had lived
with the ghost of Harris Wofford and Bob Kerrey, who had ridden it
with incredible political power and momentum _ and those on the
policy staff who said we should be more incremental.'' The adviser
said Gore had decided to put the brakes on a more ambitious
health-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, Gore ripped into Bradley's proposal as a
half-baked plan that would cost too much and provide woefully
inadequate coverage. His main charge was that Bradley's goal of
universal coverage _ which Gore adopted as his own _ was worthy but
that the approach should be step by step, not in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   From this, Gore extracted a larger message about his candidacy _
that he was a political realist and would be a careful steward of
the prosperity while Bradley was a dreamer with an academic
approach to problems that would end up hurting people and ruining
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were up against a Clinton/Gore-style campaign,'' said Lee
Miringhoff, director of the Marist Institute poll in New York.
``They target, hit, morph their positions very closely to yours and
poke a hole or two in them and then bore away _ and you have to be
up at the same speed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore honed his skills in debate practice with his friend Tom
Downey, a former congressman from Long Island, standing in for
Bradley. More than one observer said that Downey was sharper
playing Bradley than Mr. Bradley was in the actual debates. ``Gore
and Downey are friends, too, and that added to the competition
between them,'' said one who watched.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Iowa was effectively over on Jan. 8, when in a
debate, Gore questioned Bradley's commitment to helping flood
victims in Iowa and Bradley did not address the matter. New
Hampshire, where Gore had been on television for most of October
with no counter-advertising from Bradley, fell into line shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That month that we had to ourselves really helped us to get
back in the race,'' said one strategist. He said that when Bradley
did buy air time, he did so in Boston, and the Gore campaign could
see Bradley gaining ground among voters who watched Boston
television.

   ``We faced a serious financial decision, and that was whether to
go up in Boston or not,'' this adviser said. ``Unless you
communicate through the Boston media, you won't reach a big chunk
of New Hampshire voters. We knew it would cost more and be less
efficient, but if you don't do it, you're cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was also monitoring another topic that no one
wanted to be caught discussing in public. That was Bradley's heart
palpitations, a seemingly minor problem that could have mushroomed
into a larger one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley people say that if he hadn't had the heart thing,
he would have won New Hampshire,'' a Gore adviser said. ``Well, if
we were trailing, we might have run a different kind of campaign,''
he said, not suggesting they would have used Bradley's heart
condition against him but that as long as Bradley supporters were
engaging in hypotheticals, this adviser would too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no lack of will to win over here,'' he said, in a
clear shot across the bow at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
leading Republican candidate. ``If we had found ourselves in a
situation where we were short a vote, we probably would have tried
a different route.''
</P>
<P>
   What would they have done? ``We would have drawn much stronger
contrasts than we did,'' said this adviser. ``We would have brought
up that Bradley wants people to work until they're 70 when they
retire. We didn't unload all our firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Zukin, a public policy professor at Rutgers University,
said that Gore prevailed for both tactical reasons but also larger
reasons that he had little control over. ``Bradley was running
against the longest economic expansion in history,'' he said. ``How
do you call for fundamental change during good economic times? No
one has ever done it successfully.''  &QL;

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore crushed Bill Bradley from ocean to ocean
Tuesday in a powerful display that assured him the Democratic
nomination, while Gov. George W. Bush piled up so many more
delegates than Sen. John McCain that he all but declared himself
the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories were particularly impressive because he was
supported by every demographic group in the 16 states with
Democratic contests, and, significantly, by women, who backed him
in some states by margins of more than 2-to-1, according to results
or surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was less overwhelming. Bush
prevailed in the Midwest powerhouses of Ohio and Missouri and in
the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. McCain captured
Massachusetts and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the most sought-after electoral prize of all,
Bush was comfortably ahead of McCain in the votes of registered
Republicans, the exit polls showed. That is crucial because the
winner of the Republican vote captures all of California's 162
delegates. It was not clear which of the four contenders would
prevail in that state's popular vote, which is not binding but
could be a telling measure of a candidates' potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the other huge electoral trove, with 101 delegates,
Bush and McCain were battling in what exit polls showed was a tight
contest. The vote was also tight in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Before the outcome was certain in some states, Bush declared to
supporters in Austin, Texas, that ``we have good news from sea to
shining sea'' and laid out several themes for the general election
in a combative speech that was mostly devoted to lambasting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is celebrating victory as well,'' Bush said in
prepared remarks. ``I congratulate him and look forward to the
contest. He is the candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C.,
and he has a tough case to make in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``American must not give Clinton/Gore a third term,'' he said,
reciting a list of ills of the current administration. And,
pointedly, he raised Gore's fund-raising troubles, saying, ``I will
remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House where there
is no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Nashville on Tuesday night, Gore
praised Bradley, saying he was ``moved and touched'' by his rival's
commitment to healing racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like Bush, he quickly looked to the general election,
calling on the Republican nominee to debate him twice a week, spurn
unregulated soft money donations and appear with him at open
meetings around the country. He also put forth an unvarnished plea
for the independents and Republicans who backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not attack Bush directly, he depicted the
Republicans as intolerant. ``Tonight I want to reach out to all who
believe that this is a time for great progress, for great reform,
for an America of tolerance and high ideals,'' he said. ``This
year, in this election, we are the party of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore had been concentrating his assaults on Bush, while
the Texas governor has softened his conservative oratory in recent
days, positioning himself for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, of Arizona, said in a statement, ``It is clear we have
done very well on the East Coast and I am deeply grateful for the
strong support our campaign is receiving throughout the states of
New England and the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; The Republican needs 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side the primaries capped the most contentious
nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral see-saw in
which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by McCain in the
next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more victories and more
delegates. But no one could safely bet what would happen because in
the entire yearlong run-up to the primaries, Bush had been widely
viewed as the front-runner, only to see his prospects grow far more
precarious after McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued gathering in Manhattan Tuesday night, Bradley said
he had called the vice president to congratulate him _ and he
insisted that his campaign was a worthy crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our lack of victory tonight, we've shaped the national
debate in this campaign,'' he said. ``We've brought core Democratic
issues to the fore. When no one was talking about the 44 million
Americans without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.
When no one was talking about the 13 children who die every day of
gun violence we heard their cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The sweep of Gore's triumph allows him to move
more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was not as pronounced. The polls of voters
Tuesday, conducted by a consortium of the television networks and
the Associated Press, found that Bush and McCain continued to draw
from far different bases of support. Republicans backed Bush
overwhelmingly while independents and Democrats, in states where
they could vote for a Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries have been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE'S REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech by Vice President Al Gore
Tuesday night at his campaign headquarters in Nashville, as
transcribed by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I want to thank all of you who are here and all those across
America who have stood with us and helped to bring us this moment.
This is your victory, too. And I want to say something to _ I want
to say something to a good man for whom I have great respect, Sen.
Bill Bradley and Ernestine Bradley and to their supporters. I
received a very gracious telephone call from him a few moments ago,
and I appreciate that. I think that anybody who has heard Bill
Bradley throughout this campaign has come away from the experience
moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to healing the
divisions in our country, especially divisions based on race. He
believes in this healing heart and soul. I share his commitment to
it. I have learned from his passion for it. Tonight I salute Sen.
Bill Bradley ...
</P>
<P>
   Tonight I want to reach out to all who believe that this is the
time for great progress, for great reforms, for an America of
tolerance and high ideals. We stand at a mountaintop moment in our
history, the longest period of economic growth this nation has ever
known. Under President Clinton, almost 21 million new jobs. Welfare
reform, crime down. We're putting 100,000 new police on our
streets. More Americans are safer, more Americans have hope.
America is strong, prosperous, at peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while we are here to celebrate great victories, I say to you
tonight, and hear me well _ you ain't seen nothing yet. Our fight
has just begun. Our fight for the working families of this country
has just begun, and tonight I invite all Americans who seek the
best America, all Americans regardless of party to join us in this
cause. We need to build on our record of prosperity. We don't need
to go back to where we were eight years ago. They tried their
approach before. It produced a triple-dip recession and quadrupled
the national debt. If you don't want to go back to that then join
us now. Our campaign is your cause.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in using our prosperity wisely to lift our nation
up, not wasting the surplus on a risky tax scheme, then join us ...
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in setting aside enough of the surplus to
safeguard Social Security and strengthen Medicare, then join us
now. Join us, our campaign is your cause. Join us to secure health
care as a fundamental right to cover every single child in the next
four years, to move forward step by step to universal coverage. And
then pass a new program of medicoverage so that all of our seniors
will have the financial help they need to purchase the prescription
drugs that their doctors prescribe for them. Join us to pass a
patients' bill of rights so medical decisions are made not by
insurance company accountants or H.M.O. bureaucrats, but by doctors
and nurses and medical professionals. Join us to bring
revolutionary improvements to education, investing more but also
demanding more. ...
</P>
<P>
   And if you believe in a just and tolerant society and not the
politics of division, I say join us now. And to those Republicans
and independents out there whose heroes are Theodore Roosevelt and
Abraham Lincoln, to all of you I say as well, join with us. Our
campaign is now your cause.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Several election stories have referred to polls of voters
today; this story can accompany any of them.) 
(nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by
voters leaving voting stations in six states Tuesday. The poll was
conducted by Voter News Service, an organization created by ABC
News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, the results were based on 500 to 800 Republican
primary voters, and 350 to 700 Democratic primary voters, in
randomly selected precincts throughout California, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls
should differ by no more than plus or minus 5 to 7 percentage
points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview
all primary voters who turned out in each of the six states
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential
sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical
difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election
Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out a
questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Helmut Norpoth of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook is assisting The Times in its Election Day polling
analysis.

ROCKER REPORTER VISITS ANGELS CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Jeff Pearlman, the Sports Illustrated reporter
whose interview and subsequent article on Braves pitcher John
Rocker caused such a stir, was in Angels camp Tuesday working on a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman said he has been surprised at the uproar the story
caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting it at all,'' Pearlman said. ``I thought
maybe it would be a note on the wire. I guess I was naive. It's
kind of silly the proportion it's grown to. This is the first time
I've ever experienced anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman has remained relatively anonymous considering the
attention his story received. However, his phone rang off the hook
when the magazine first hit the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day it came out, I got about 50 different requests for TV
and radio interviews,'' he said. ``It was a little overwhelming.
But it hasn't changed my life. It gave me a little bit of
recognition, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sales down: Angels season-ticket sales are down 20 percent
from last season, despite the club's promotional offer to draw fans
back after last season's last-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The club is offering a money-back guarantee if, at the end of
April (after 16 home games), the buyer is not satisfied with the
team's performance. Fans can get a refund for the remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made available when season-ticket renewal packages
went out but is available to all fans. The Angels sales department
said there is no way of quantifying the effect on sales the
promotion has had.
</P>
<P>
   __ Woeful Washburn: Pitcher Jarrod Washburn had another poor
performance in Tuesday's 5-3 loss to the Mariners. Competing for a
spot in the starting rotation, he gave up three runs and five hits
in 2 innings. He allowed two runs in two innings in his first
spring start last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't throw strikes,'' said Washburn, who walked four.
``I'm not very locked in to the strike zone. I have to try to get
used to throwing again. There's a lot of work to do in all areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn knows what's at stake for him personally _ a starting
spot in the majors or a trip to Triple-A Edmonton, but he's trying
not to think about the importance of each outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the world I want more than to make the team
out of spring training,'' he said. ``I don't want to go back to the
minor leagues again. But I can't put pressure on myself, because
that will put strain on myself mentally. Mentally I have to be
strong so I can pitch like I can.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Results are in: The Angels announced their all-time team in
celebration of their 40th season. The voting was done by fans on
the team's Web site, Angelsbaseball.com.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the voting: Manager _ Jim Fregosi; catcher _ Bob
Boone; first base _ Rod Carew; second base _ Bobby Grich; third
base _ Doug DeCinces; shortstop _ Fregosi; left field _ Brian
Downing; center field _ Jim Edmonds; right field _ Reggie Jackson;
DH _ Don Baylor; right-handed starters _ Nolan Ryan, Mike Witt;
left-handed starters _ Frank Tanana, Chuck Finley; reliever _ Troy
Percival. &QL;

ELECTRONIC PROCESSING CHANGES NAME, ADDS FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic Processing Inc., a publicly owned developer of
bankruptcy software, is jumping feetfirst into the burgeoning
business-to-business e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Kan.-based company on Tuesday announced an
agreement to acquire the assets of Phitech Inc., a San Francisco
developer of products that route data over the Internet and private
networks, for $6.25 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a bold one for Electronic Processing, which has
changed its name to EPIQ Systems Inc. to reflect its leap into the
advanced-technology market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will catapult EPIQ into a new era of growth,''
said Christopher Olofson, the company's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street greeted the announcement favorably. Shares in EPIQ
rose 20 percent Tuesday to 12 on a volume of 41,600 shares, nearly
four times its daily average.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to produce software for Chapter 7 and
Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustees, its main line of business. The
software allows trustees to manage many bankruptcy cases
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Phitech produces a software tool called Data Express, which
enables corporate customers to secure, format and automatically
route data using different Web-based protocols. The company
reported $2.1 million in revenue last year, a 60 percent increase
from 1998, mostly from Data Express licensing, maintenance and
other fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet economy develops, there's a real need for
high-quality infrastructure to get from point A to point B,''
Olofson said. ``Four out of the five largest banking companies have
adopted this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Phitech is working on a new, Java-based product, jDX, for
release later this year. Olofson said jDX would enable EPIQ to
double revenue from Phitech's business annually for at least the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy software, however, will remain EPIQ's core business.
In November, the company purchased the assets of a competitor, DCI
Chapter 7 Solutions Inc., for $10 million. More recently, EPIQ
established a toehold in the back yard of another competitor, Chase
Manhattan Bank, when it acquired two major accounts in New York.
Chase markets a rival Chapter 7 software.
</P>
<P>
   Most of EPIQ's current revenue derives from a marketing
arrangement with Bank of America under which it licenses its
Chapter 7 software to trustees who, in turn, deposit cash proceeds
from asset sales with the bank. EPIQ gets a percentage of those
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also gets licensing fees from Chapter 13 trustees
and monthly fees based on the number of cases the trustees manage.
</P>
<P>
   For its third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, EPIQ's net income
increased 58 percent to $605,100, or 13 cents a share, on revenue
of $3.1 million. For nine months, net income increased 64 percent
to $1.49 million, or 31 cents a share, on revenue of $11 million.
The company's fourth-quarter and yearly results have been delayed
by the DCI purchase.
</P>
<P>
   EPIQ, which has about 100 employees, was founded in 1964 by
Kansas City, Kan., lawyer Claude Rice. The company went through
several ownership changes before being acquired by an investment
group led by Olofson's father, Tom Olofson, in 1988. Tom Olofson, a
former executive with Marion Laboratories Inc., is the company's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   EPIQ went public three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Phitech, which has about 20 employees, was founded 15 years ago
by Hinda Gilbert, its president and chief executive. Gilbert will
become vice president and general manager of EPIQ in San Francisco
after completion of the asset sale, which is expected within two
weeks.

GAS LEAK CUTS USC'S PRACTICE SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's basketball practice Tuesday was canceled
after less than an hour because of a gas leak in the physical
education building that caused several campus buildings to be
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a gas leak in the North Gym and it killed our
whole practice,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had practiced for nearly an hour when Los Angeles
City Fire Dept. personnel arrived on campus and forced the P.E.
building to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   __ NIT breakdown: Forward Brian Scalabrine was asked if he would
be disappointed if the Trojans won their final two regular-season
games, and did not make the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen,'' Scalabrine said. ``If it does, I don't
know. It won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans (14-14, 7-9) are no sure bet for the postseason
tournament, even if they sweep the Washington schools this weekend.
Consider some of the Western teams that could be trying to squeeze
into the 32-team field if they don't make it into the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Arizona State (17-11) and Cal (16-12) from the Pac-10,
there's New Mexico State (20-8), Fresno State (21-9), SMU (21-7),
Long Beach State (23-4), San Francisco (19-8), New Mexico (17-12),
Colorado State (18-11) and Wyoming (18-11).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll go to the NIT. I'm excited about going to the
NIT,'' Scalabrine said. ``I know it's not the NCAA, but we put
ourself in this situation. Sam (Clancy) got hurt and we didn't get
it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Trojans were not happy about the prospect of being
bypassed by the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be upset,'' Clancy said. ``I'd be a little disappointed. I
think if we win both games, we should get in. I don't know how the
NIT does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added guard Jeff Trepagnier: ``Yeah, I think we'd be a little
disappointed. We're already disappointed to miss the NCAAs. So we'd
be disappointed if don't get to the NIT.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Health check: Scalabrine (strained hip) did not practice
Monday or Tuesday but said he would be ready for Thursday's game
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting therapy three or four times a day,'' Scalabrine
said. ``It's not tight or sore, but I can't control it completely.
I should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy has also missed both practices but will return today. He
has been resting after coming back from the broken right foot he
suffered on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some soreness, but the swelling has gone down,'' Clancy
said. ``It feels fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier's swollen right eye is OK and he has practiced all
week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Most improved: Bibby was asked which player benefited most
from Clancy's six-week absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kostas (Charissis) has really grown and made giant,
giant steps,'' Bibby said of the 6-foot-11 freshman. ``That really
helps us going into next year. And he'll grow into being our
starting center.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not on final cut: Scalabrine, who was among 11 players added
for consideration for the Wooden Award, did not make the final cut
of 10 players.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUBPOENAS FIGHT CARD FROM THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for additions; adds byline, and final 10 grafs are new.)  
(lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney's office has
subpoenaed the records of the New York State Athletic Commission
for the Feb. 26 boxing show at Madison Square Garden, according to
Scott Trent, a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Trent said he did not know why the district attorney's office
was interested in the commission's records from the fight, but all
of the records were turned over without a challenge from the
commission. The district attorney's office would not comment on why
it wanted the records.
</P>
<P>
   The card, which was headlined by a bout between Oscar De La Hoya
and Derrell Coley, was noteworthy because of the enormous amount of
weight gained by Arturo Gatti in the 28 hours between the weigh-in
on Friday afternoon and the time he stepped into the ring against
Joey Gamache on Saturday night. Gatti weighed in at 141 pounds. But
on the night of the fight he weighed 160 pounds, according to an
unofficial weigh-in conducted by Home Box Office, which broadcasted
the bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti knocked out Gamache in the second round, and, according to
Gamache's manager, Johnny Bos, the fighter suffered a severe
concussion. He was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The records turned over to the district attorney's office show
the official weights of the bout to be 141 pounds for Gatti and
140-3/4 pounds for Gamache. Bos said he believes Gatti was
overweight at the weigh-in. He suspects that Gatti was close to 148
or 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bos protested the day of the weigh-in by saying that Gatti was
overweight, because when Gatti got on the scale, which was already
set at the prescribed weight of 141 pounds, the needle went right
to the top of the scale. Gatti waved his arms in the air and the
needle bounced. Tony Russo, the executive director of the New York
commission, announced his weight at 141 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started yelling and screaming,'' Bos said. ``Russo told me
to shut up and stop stirring up a stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Bos did not ask the commission to make Gatti get back on the
scale. Trent said that Gatti would have had to climb back on the
scale if Bos had insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The needle also banged the top of the scale when De La Hoya
climbed on, which enraged Coley and his trainer, Leonard Langley.
Coley kept screaming: ``He's over. He's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wynne, vice president of sports properties at Madison
Square Garden, said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, a former 135-pound world champion who boxed as a junior
lightweight (130 pounds) as recently as three years ago, is
legendary for his enormous weight gains between the weigh-in and
the fight. Before a bout against Reyes Munoz on Aug. 17, Gatti
weighed 139 pounds at the weigh-in and stepped into the ring at 160
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gatti has found a way to put on 19 pounds of muscle
overnight then more power to him,'' Bos said. ``That's a gift I
don't think anybody's ever had. But I don't think he made weight.
And he came into the ring looking faster and quicker than I've ever
seen him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a winnable fight for Joey. If you look at the Arturo
Gatti, outside of the fight against Reyes Munoz, he has never had
the kind of power he showed against Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   Bos said that Gamache was still being treated for the severe
concussion he received in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fight, I thought he was all right in the dressing
room,'' Bos said. ``They sent him to the hospital, and I'm glad
they did. When he got there he was throwing up. It was serious.''

 IN NEW YORK, GORE WINS BIG AND BUSH-McCAIN RACE IS TIGHT  
 (subs for updating and rewriting throughout)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adding to his string of victories across the country,
Vice President Al Gore soundly trounced former Sen. Bill Bradley in
the  &UR;  &LR; Democratic primary in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the closely watched Republican primary, the outcome was
too close to call Tuesday evening. Gov. George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain were running neck-and-neck in early vote tallies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, exit polls showed Gore with a commanding
lead of 66 percent of the vote over Bradley's 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, exit polls in New York showed Bush and
McCain running within several percentage points of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium made up of television networks and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The New York primary was one of the most important contests on
what has been dubbed ``Super Tuesday,'' in which millions of voters
in 16 states swarmed to the ballot boxes to dictate the loyalties
of convention delegates. At stake in New York were 243 Democratic
delegates and 101 Republican delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts had predicted that Gore would easily beat
Bradley in New York, opinion polls had forecast a tight race
between the two major Republican candidates. Winning a majority of
New York delegates was seen as crucial to McCain's chances of
staying a viable contender.
</P>
<P>
   Among New York voters responding to early exit polls, Republican
party loyalists were supporting Bush, while Republicans who saw
themselves as independents favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In the five weeks preceding Tuesday's contests, upset victories
for McCain in New Hampshire and Michigan made the Republican race
one of the most closely watched in recent memory. McCain painted
himself as an establishment outsider, a war hero espousing campaign
reform and denouncing the straight-and-narrow arbiters of American
politics. But in recent contests, Bush appropriated that rebel
image to some extent and used it to successfully woo voters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Based on early exit polls, a third of the registered Republicans
in New York who voted for McCain identified themselves as
independent, while less than a fifth of Bush's supporters described
themselves that way.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fifths of the voters who sided with Bush labeled
themselves conservative, and less than a third were moderate,
according to those polls. About two-fifths of McCain's supporters
described themselves as conservative, and the same percentage
called themselves moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters were less inclined to favor abortion rights
than those who voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of those who preferred McCain had never voted in
a Republican primary before. By contrast, less than a fifth of
Bush's supporters had never voted in a Republican primary, the exit
polls indicated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters named campaign finance and moral values as
the issues that most influenced their vote. Bush's supporters chose
moral values and taxes as the issues with the strongest influence
on their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Half of McCain's supporters said the fact that he ``stands up
for what he believes'' was the quality that mattered most in their
vote decision, followed by the fact that they perceive him as a
strong leader. Almost two-fifths of Bush's supporters said he
``best represents conservative values,'' and a quarter said he
stands up for what he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's voter turnout in New York was larger than the usual
turnout of 20 to 25 percent of registered voters. The warm weather
was partly responsible, as was the highly publicized neck-and-neck
national race between Bush and McCain. That heated contest
attracted a record number of voters in primaries earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates threw themselves into last-minute campaigning
in New York with full determination. Bush flew to Long Island and
attended a staged panel discussion on breast cancer in an effort to
appeal to women voters. At a Wall Street rally, McCain attacked his
opponent's chief patrons in this state, Gov. George E. Pataki and
William D. Powers, the New York Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders had joined Bush in lobbying to keep
McCain off the ballot. They pushed for enforcement of obscure
campaign rules that made it more difficult for supporters of
Republican candidates other than Bush to collect nominating
signatures. But McCain won public sympathy, and a federal judge
placed McCain and another candidate, Alan Keyes, on the Republican
ballot in early February. McCain spent nearly $200,000 to get on
the ballot in 19 districts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But New York was still deemed a tough battleground for McCain.
In states with open Republican primaries, McCain won support from
voters labeling themselves independents or Democrats. In New York,
the Republican primary was closed to voters not affiliated with the
party. And even though New York lacks large numbers of people
supporting a strong religious right _ a faction that helped Bush to
victory in South Carolina _ some voters said that McCain's recent
religious criticism swayed them toward his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Catholic and I know darn well that Bush is not
anti-Catholic,'' said Vincent Mauro, a Brooklyn retiree. ``That was
dirty pool. I had mixed feelings about who to vote for, but those
comments really bothered me. I decided to stick with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to their views of the heated Republican contest,
political analysts predicted that the Democratic race in New York
was likely to be just another echo of Bradley's clamorous death
knell. His supporters here were puzzled by the candidate's intense
campaign focus on Washington state, especially since New York was
seen as a possible victory for the former senator and basketball
star. But a New York Times/CBS poll taken two weeks ago showed Gore
widening his lead to 26-percentage points over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race failed to inspire the strong feelings that
characterized the Republican contest. While many people regarded
Bradley as a lost cause, Gore apparently still has to overcome his
wooden image among some voters. Joyce Liona, a registered Democrat
in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said she reluctantly voted for Gore on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to put my faith in something,'' she said. ``Honestly,
I like McCain, and I wish he wasn't a Republican. Gore has no
charisma. I can't even remember sometimes what Gore looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's supporters, Hillary Rodham Clinton, showed up at 7
a.m. at Douglas Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua to cast her
vote. Mrs. Clinton, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seat
from New York, was the 11th person to vote at the precinct. The
school is within two miles of the house that she and President
Clinton recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's
Republican opponent in the Senate race, strode confidently into a
high school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and cast his vote
for Bush.

WARD PUTS THE BITE BACK IN THE KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He did not erupt for 20 points or wow the masses with
open-court flair. Charlie Ward merely did what he does best for the
Knicks: help them win.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever funk had engulfed the Knicks, Ward helped to erase it
with a superlative performance at point guard Tuesday night. He
moved the ball around the perimeter quickly. He stepped in front of
larger men on defense, often slamming to the hardwood in hopes of
drawing an offensive foul. He snatched rebounds with malice.
</P>
<P>
   When Madison Square Garden had emptied, the Knicks had run the
Vancouver Grizzlies off the floor in a 111-86 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, returning to the lineup after missing nine games, was the
elixir, despite his modest line of seven rebounds, six assists and
5 points.
</P>
<P>
   He led a fuel-injected offense that made 62.1 percent of its
shots from the field, a season-high. Ward not only helped the
Knicks end a two-game skid, but also showed how easy the game can
be when you persevere and don't take a struggling opponent lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell, Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston were in
perfect rhythm, combining for 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   John Wallace added 13 points off the bench as the Knicks moved
to within a half-game of Miami in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim's 18 points led Vancouver, which never led
and fell behind by 20 several times in the second half en route to
the blowout loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks entered the game having lost three of their last four
games, including two straight to Atlanta and Utah. They look tired
and disinterested against the Jazz on Sunday at the Garden, never
making a game of it until late in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But they were re-invigorated Tuesday night. Whether it was Ward
or the lackluster competition, the Knicks started quickly. They
opened the game with a 13-0 run. Ward had four rebounds and two
assists in the opening 4 minutes 30 seconds, sacrificing his
6-foot-1 frame as he lunged for loose balls. He found Larry Johnson
in a maze of bodies for a dunk on the fast break _ a Knick rarity
for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ward returned after missing the past nine games with a fractured
right pinkie. The Knicks averaged 7 fewer points without their
starting point guard. In 10 games overall without Ward, the Knicks
are 5-5. Beyond the numbers and the record, the Knicks miss Ward's
grit and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Houston have brought the ball upcourt decently in
Jeff Van Gundy's big-backcourt offense. But it's not the same. Ward
had a presence about him, eyeing Vancouver's young point guard,
Mike Bibby, as he directed the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Through three quarters, Ward contributed 6 points and six
assists. He also provided the intangibles that make the Knicks'
offense purr for more than one possession. In the second quarter,
four of the five Knicks on the floor touched the ball before they
scored inside.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was able to create scoring opportunities without
worrying about being a playmaker, Houston was freed of his
ballhandling duties and Ewing had all the space he wanted to make
things happen in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks traveled to Washington after the game to make up a
contest that was postponed due to bad weather. In the second game
of back-to-back series this season, the Knicks are an abysmal 3-10.
The Wizards should be ripe. Wednesday night's marks their third
game in a row, the most any team in the NBA will play consecutively
this season.
</P>
<P>
   With Ward back in the fold and Marcus Camby projected to return
from injury in the next week, the Knicks seem to be closer to being
at full strength.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state appellate court Tuesday rejected the efforts
of the New York state Crime Victims Board to seize book and movie
profits from Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia informer known as Sammy
the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   The board sued Gravano in 1997, seeking to collect $250,000 he
said he received for assisting the author Peter Maas with
``Underboss,'' a best-selling book that gave details of Gravano's
career as a killer and racketeer who rose to the No. 2 position in
the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, who defected from the mob and testified against the
Gambino family boss, John Gotti, and other organized crime figures,
once said he might earn as much as $1 million from his tale.
</P>
<P>
   The suit _ which also named Maas, two divisions of HarperCollins
Publishers, the ICM talent agency and the 20th Century Fox Film
Corp. _ was filed under the state's so-called Son of Sam law. That
law allows crime victims and their relatives to sue criminals for
profits they earn from telling their tales.
</P>
<P>
   But a Supreme Court judge dismissed the case in 1998, saying
that the law did not apply to Gravano because, although he admitted
to killing 19 people and pleaded guilty to racketeering, he was
convicted of federal, not state, crimes. Further, the court found
that the board was not in itself a victim and did not have the
authority to bring the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Tuesday, by the First Department of the Appellate
Division, upheld the lower court's ruling. Larry H. Krantz, one of
Gravano's lawyers, said, ``We believe that the Appellate Division
was correct in affirming the trial court.''
</P>
<P>
   Krantz said he had not talked with Gravano, who is being held on
drug charges in Arizona, and did not know his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the board, said the
members were disappointed and reviewing the decision. ``We will
continue to fight to ensure victims are compensated, and criminals
can't benefit from the crimes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano faces several federal lawsuits seeking to seize his
earnings from the ``Underboss'' story.

CARELESS POLLUTER OR VICTIM OF HYSTERIA? CHEMICAL LEAKS SPLIT
VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRIMAN, N.Y. _ At first glance, this seems an unlikely place
to be troubled by chemical leaks, school evacuations and
denunciations of one of its oldest employers. A placid suburban
village nestled in the unspoiled Ramapo Mountains of Orange County,
Harriman spreads out like a fief beneath the century-old hilltop
estate of its namesake, the railroad and finance tycoon Edward H.
Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   But the area has been gripped in recent weeks by widespread
anger at a local chemical manufacturer _ or, if one listens to the
other side, by an almost Salemlike hysteria. State officials have
halted production of the company's primary product, pyridine, and
though all 105 of its employees continue to report for work, some
fear for their jobs. The local police say they and the FBI are
investigating threats sent by e-mail to a critic of the company,
and the air is rife with conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just won't die,'' said Harriman's mayor, Charles Gayser,
who is frequently stopped by residents who want to sound off on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The furor began on Oct. 26, when Nepera Inc., which has operated
its single factory here since 1957, accidentally leaked a small
amount of gaseous residue from its production of pyridine, an
ingredient in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and anti-dandruff
shampoo. School officials, alerted by the authorities, sent 4,000
students home early from three schools a mile from the factory;
some complained of nausea, dizziness, skin rashes or asthmalike
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Pyridine is a known eye, nose and respiratory irritant,
according to the state Department of Health, and can induce
dizziness, although little is known about its long-term health
effects on humans. The company, which was subsequently cited by the
state Department of Environmental Conservation for violating air
pollution regulations, voluntarily stopped pyridine production for
nine days while it repaired faulty equipment that caused the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, on Nov. 19, schools were dismissed
early and the pyridine operation was temporarily shut down again
after odors were detected inside the plant.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, the DEC says, there were two more residue
leaks, although schools were not evacuated: one on Feb. 22 and
another two days later.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the agency's commissioner, John P. Cahill,
ordered Nepera (pronounced ne-PARE-a) to halt manufacturing
immediately, pending completion of a long list of safety measures.
It was only the third such emergency closing in 20 years by the
agency, which takes such action when it sees ``an imminent danger''
to residents or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Cahill had to issue his directive twice before Nepera
complied _ the result of either a miscommunication, as Nepera
officials say, or of company arrogance, as its critics say.
Whatever the case, the lingering image of a business defying
authority has many residents on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting alarmed,'' said Michelle Miscioscia, who
has three children in schools that have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Miscioscia was among about 400 people who crowded an elementary
school auditorium on Feb. 28 for the monthly meeting of the
Community Advisory Panel, which discusses and recommends safety
policies for Nepera _ normally drawing little public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Many called for the factory's overhaul or outright closing. A
handful of Nepera employees who defended their company were
heckled, and more than a dozen local police officers and state
troopers ringed the room in case words spilled over into something
more.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie O'Brien, a mother of three school-age boys, made a
tearful plea to the advisory panel and representatives of the DEC
and the State Department of Health to close Nepera for good. ``I
would like to know they're not going to operate anymore,'' she said
later. ``They're careless.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said youngsters were playing at the bus stop near her
house on the morning of the latest incident when a familiar odor
permeated the air. ``All the children ended up in the nurse's
office with the same symptoms: nausea, dizziness, headaches,'' she
said. She has felt the effects, too, she said. ``You feel like
you're coming down with something, but you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell of pyridine, a sweet odor that can be nauseating at
higher concentrations, has drifted periodically over the Harriman
area since Nepera's inception. Many in the village say odors were
more common in the 1960s and '70s than today, and they do not
remember widespread claims of adverse physical effects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a series of airborne leaks and school evacuations led
to a consent agreement between the environmental conservation
department and the company, which installed sophisticated
monitoring equipment on its property to detect chemical emissions.
The company has also removed from its property contaminated soil
and water and drums of hazardous waste, some of which was deposited
by a previous chemical manufacturer. It has also submitted plans
for long-term monitoring of ground and surface water.
</P>
<P>
   Nepera, which is owned by Cambrex, of East Rutherford, N.J.,
also produces niacinamide, an ingredient in enriched foods and pet
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely safe plant,'' said John Van Hulle, the
president of Nepera. ``We're aware of odor issues and certainly
want to work with the community to reduce these in every way
possible. The discussion needs to move from the extremes and into
the middle. We make a lot of good things here. Shutting the plant
down does nobody any good.''

 HARRIMAN, N.Y.: any good.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the most recent leak, the DEC has allowed Nepera to resume
all operations except production of pyridine, after it agreed to
several measures, including the posting of a DEC monitor at the
plant and the retaining of an engineering firm to review
operations. The company is in talks with the DEC over when it can
resume making pyridine; the agency is expected to fine the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, employees who used to run the superheated
reactors that make pyridine now busy themselves with cleanup
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset, because it's my livelihood and because it's a
responsible company,'' said Pete Gallagher, a senior chemical
process operator and 27-year Nepera employee. ``We'd never operate
any process in an unsafe manner. We run it. We'd be the first ones
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Kanterman, a Nepera customer service representative for
two years, said she was angry at her community and the
environmental conservation department. ``I'd like the community to
be more open-minded and allow us to educate them,'' she said. ``If
something smells in the area, you can't assume it's Nepera. Kids
are being prodded by their teachers and parents'' to blame the
company for unfamiliar odors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hysteria,'' said Dolly Mancino Kirk, a shipping
supervisor who has worked at Nepera for 23 years and has heard
colleagues wondering if layoffs are around the corner. She said the
company's major mistake had been its failure to better inform
residents about the plant and its products.
</P>
<P>
   Gayser, the mayor, said the company, which is due in local court
March 15 to answer for violations of the village's air-quality
ordinances, had cooperated in investigations into leaks and
traditionally provided support to local sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a chemical company, they're doing the best they can,'' he
said. ``But I take it very seriously when people bring me their
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools superintendent, Terrence Olivo, said he believed
that some of his students were genuinely affected by exposure to
pyridine, while a larger percentage suffered a psychosomatic
reaction triggered by the first group. A third group, he said,
played along in hopes of getting time off from school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the schools' first tactic for dealing with
announced leaks is to close windows and doors, which eventually
leads to stuffy classrooms and, some maintain, the true cause of
headaches and other ailments laid at Nepera's door.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Olivo said the district was interviewing law firms for a
possible suit against Nepera for disrupting the schools. ``There
have to be changes,'' he said. ``Our goal is for Nepera not to
restart without the reasonable certainty that there will be no
emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 22 the Zoning Board of Appeals in the town of Woodbury,
of which Harriman is a part, will consider renewal of Nepera's
special operating permit, something that Jay M. Gubernick, a town
supervisor who is not a member of the board, said he would oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that Nepera hasn't served the public
safety and welfare,'' Gubernick said. ``If they can't live with us,
then they shouldn't live here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nestor Pozzo, who works in a cafe just outside Harriman,
said that he lived for more than 20 years without ill effect in the
path of the prevailing wind that blows over Nepera. After a decade
away, he moved back to the same area.
</P>
<P>
   The odor that was so prevalent in the 1970s was much reduced, he
said. He has never experienced any of the symptoms claimed by some
of Nepera's opponents. Asked to explain the commotion, he said,
``It doesn't take much to agitate the masses.''

NEW ENGLAND GIVES MCCAIN SOME HOPE

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ While the news looked grim for Sen. John
McCain in much of the country, in New England things looked much
brighter Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Gov. George W. Bush in Massachusetts and Vermont and
was running well against him in Connecticut and Rhode Island,
according to early returns. But Bush was ahead in Maine, where the
Bush family owns a summer home.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing in the region, with its 102 collective
delegates, was crucial to McCain's hopes of keeping his
presidential campaign alive, especially in light of his projected
losses in most of the other states holding primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite McCain's victories in New England, Tuesday's
primaries also showed his enduring inability to capture votes from
registered Republicans. In Massachusetts, for example, where polls
of voters showed McCain garnering six out of every 10 votes,
two-thirds of the voters who cast ballots for McCain were Democrats
or independents who supported him. In Vermont, Democrats and
independents carried McCain, who won by capturing just 45 percent
of registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did well in Connecticut, home to a historically moderate
and independent electorate, despite significant efforts by Gov.
John G. Rowland and every Republican lawmaker in the state, all of
whom had publicly endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very intelligent, capable man,'' said Hope Whitehead,
78, a retired history teacher, after she voted for McCain at the
Davis Middle School in Guilford. ``He has our interests at heart.
He wants to make big changes in the government, which is why the
Republican Party is not behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticutsaid he was dissapointed in
Bush's showing, but he shrugged off its significance in the
national campaign. ``I don't mind losing a battle if we win the
war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, thousands of Connecticut voters throughout the
state switched their party affiliations to register as Republicans
in time for Tuesday's primary. Polls of voters also suggested
McCain won a majority of the state's large number of Catholic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   They also showed he drew much support in both Connecticut and
Massachusetts from former Democrats and Liberals who recently
switched to the Republican Party. McCain received fewer than half
of the votes from registered Republicans in both states.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, McCain won the state's 12 delegates by nearly a
2-to-1 margin over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring McCain's showing in New England was Massachusetts,
where he outpaced Bush by about a 2-to-1 margin overall, and
received the support of a strong majority of Catholic voters. But,
just as he did in Michigan and New Hampshire, McCain's
Massachusetts victory was because of an outpouring of Democrats and
independents which, combined, accounted for about two-thirds of the
ballots cast for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said the number of
non-Republicans who supported McCain bodes well for Bush in the
fall. ``I think it shows dissatisfaction with the Democratic
candidates,'' said -Cellucci, who noted that the presidential
primary showed the largest turnout in state history.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican voters said they were upset with the McCain
campaign and said it had become increasingly negative, especially
in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it when he started attacking on religion,'' said
Muriel Porto outside the Community Center in Branford. She voted
for Bush, she said, because of his morals and personal character.

DESPITE STRUGGLES THIS SEASON, TUBBS WOULD LIKE TO STAY AT TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU hired Billy Tubbs in 1994 to resuscitate
its basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great hire at the time,'' former TCU athletic director Frank
Windegger said recently. ``We got a name coach, and he's done a
tremendous amount for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years before this season, Tubbs led his team to at
least 21 victories and postseason play. In doing so, he fulfilled
the mandate of Provost William Koehler, TCU's executive
administrator to the athletic department, and Windegger, who asked
Tubbs to give the Horned Frogs instant credibility and a national
profile.
</P>
<P>
   But, starting with an incident that embarrassed school officials
before last season concerning a scholarship promised to a local
high school star, and a perceived slide in his team's on-court
performance this season, the shine on the most-successful coach in
school history has dulled. So much so that sources close to the
athletic department say the 64-year-old Tubbs might not coach at
TCU beyond next season. A buyout of his contract is possible, the
sources say, if his team struggles again next season or if Tubbs
further clashes with the school's power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Factors fueling speculation about Tubbs' future include:
</P>
<P>
   TCU's failure to extend his contract after last season, as was
routinely the case under Windegger;
</P>
<P>
   a strained relationship with athletic director Eric Hyman that
soured when Tubbs reneged on a scholarship commitment to former
Crowley High School standout Brian Brookhart before last season;
</P>
<P>
   and a home-attendance drop of more than 20 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs admits his sixth season has been his most disappointing at
TCU. This week's suspension of forward Myron Anthony, once thought
by Tubbs to be a fix for his team's early-season problems, is
indicative of the Frogs' up-and-down 17-13 season heading into
Western Athletic Conference tournament play tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said his program has merely hit a ``hiccup.'' Hyman,
diplomatically, calls it a ``speed bump.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontent of both parties goes deeper than this season's
record, however.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Tubbs say he would be agreeable to a buyout of
the final two years of his contract. The same sources said Tubbs
talked to Lamar University, his alma mater and one of his first
coaching stops, about its head-coaching job after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said, ``I want to coach as long as they want me, and as
long as I think I'm doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman refused to address Tubbs' contract situation and said
discussions on his performance would wait until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make things better and improve, and you want to
be up-front with the coach and let him know that,'' Hyman said.
``With every program here we discuss how we can make things
better.''
The first hiccup
</P>
<P>
   Hyman began his first full academic year as TCU's athletic
director in the fall of 1998. The school year had barely started
when he was left to deal with a major public-relations
embarrassment concerning the case of Brian Brookhart.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart, a lifelong TCU fan, had signed a national letter of
intent with the school in November 1997, his senior season.
However, when Brookhart arrived on campus the following August, a
TCU assistant coach told him it would be best for him to first play
junior-college basketball instead of coming to TCU.
</P>
<P>
   The Brookhart family took issue with the suggestion. Eventually
Brookhart, disillusioned with his treatment by the basketball
staff, decided to transfer. Chancellor Michael Ferrari said at the
time: ``I was disappointed how this particular instance was
handled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we do things around here, especially
coaches,'' said a prominent booster. ``That's not TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tubbs was hired from Oklahoma in 1994, Koehler and
Windegger provided him with a comfortable support system. A close
associate of Tubbs said the coach wants to run his program with the
autonomy he was given by Windegger but has been held more
accountable under Hyman. Under Windegger, Tubbs received contract
extensions after each season, in essence leaving Tubbs with a
four-year contract when Windegger retired two years ago. Hyman
didn't extend Tubbs' contract after the Frogs finished 21-11 last
season, which included advancing to the third round of the National
Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs turned a team that had won 13 games combined the previous
two seasons before his arrival into a competitive team his first
season, then built on that success to start a run of three
consecutive postseason appearances.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team, however, probably needs to win at least one
game in this week's WAC tournament to be considered for an NIT bid.
The Frogs have been inconsistent, losing five home games, their
most in a season under Tubbs, and five games by at least 10 points,
including 33- and 21-point losses to WAC champion Tulsa. Though TCU
has beaten 21-7 SMU twice, the Frogs rank 84th in the latest
CollegeRPI.com ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said the expectations he helped create with three
consecutive 20-victory seasons have made him a target of his past
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've raised the bar at TCU,'' Tubbs said. ``Twenty-win
seasons and legitimate expectations for a conference championship,
that's what people expect. And that's what I expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is like a little hiccup. Like my financial adviser
tells me after a drop in earnings, look back at '94, the same thing
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Koehler: ``Every time a team doesn't win 20, people want to
fire the coach, but that would get awfully expensive. Eight to 10
years ago, if we'd won 13 games, people would be ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's eight or 10 years ago.
Greater expectations
</P>
<P>
   The recent success of the TCU's football team (back-to-back bowl
victories), ironically, has taken some of the spotlight off the
basketball program. When TCU officials hired Dennis Franchione they
were determined to get a football coach to fulfill's Hyman's goal
of having a ``nationally prominent'' program to match what Tubbs
appeared to be building in basketball, a program that helped TCU
get an invitation to Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman wants both programs to be competitive on a national scope
heading into C-USA, an acknowledged step up from the WAC, in the
2001-2002 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Fan interest in the basketball program, however, dropped
dramatically this season. After averaging slightly more than 5,900
fans for home games in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons, TCU
averaged 4,536 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Season-ticket holders are not coming to games,'' Hyman said.
``I'd like to get in a situation where we sell out every game, and
that's in the realm of possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler said: ``We have to put a product on the floor that Fort
Worth and the surrounding areas can relate to. We're Fort Worth's
team. We've got to have a product that's exciting and people can
personally invest in without fear of disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, TCU hit its pinnacle under Tubbs, fielding a Top
25 team that swept through WAC play 14-0 and earned an NCAA
Tournament bid. Since then, Tubbs has had difficulty replacing
standouts such as Lee Nailon, Malcolm Johnson, Mike Jones and
Prince Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman prefers TCU's recruiting philosophy in all programs focus
on Fort Worth-Dallas area talent. Tubbs, however, has relied
primarily on transfers and has had little success signing and
keeping area players. Only two of the players on the current roster
are from Fort Worth-Dallas. One, J.R. Jones of Brewer High School,
is a walk-on. The other, Colin Boddicker of Duncanville,
transferred to TCU from Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The booster is critical of Tubbs' recruitment of junior-college
players _ ``they're just hired guns'' _ and said TCU can't build a
competitive Conference USA program relying primarily on transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Ryan Carroll, one of only four current scholarship
players who didn't transfer to TCU, said the team has struggled to
find the right chemistry all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really jelled as a unit,'' Carroll said. ``This team
is more talented and deeper , but we didn't have enough guys in the
system. A lot of learning has to be done in practice, and it took
some time for guys to get adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tubbs: ``I accept full responsibility. I try to stay in
touch with the fact that I'm an optimistic person, but I'm not so
optimistic that I'm out of touch with reality. I would like people
to be supportive of our program, but would I expect them to be
happy with this year? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but at least we've changed the attitude
around here. TCU expects to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he doesn't need to coach anymore, but the competitive
fire still burns. He would like to coach at least five more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a point in time where I just want to be good and I want
the program to be good,'' Tubbs said. ``Today, I don't feel any
different than when I came to TCU. If I would have stayed at
Oklahoma, I would have quit coaching by now. I was in a rut. Coming
here energized me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs certainly isn't talking about slowing down. He has high
expectations for next season. He said the recruiting class coming
in could be TCU's best in some time. Plus, the addition of transfer
guard Greedy Daniels to a team that returns everyone except forward
Marquise Gainous should put the Frogs in the running for the WAC
title in their final season in the league, Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of the fact that whenever he leaves, the TCU
program, much like Oklahoma and Lamar, will be left in better shape
that what he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is when.

HITCHCOCK AIMS FOR 200TH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is one regular-season victory
shy of No. 200. If he gets it tonight against the Vancouver
Canucks, he will be the fourth-fastest coach in NHL history to
reach 200 victories. In 355 games, Hitchcock is 199-114-42. Don
Cherry did it in 341 games, Toe Blake did it in 345, and Tommy Ivan
did it in 353. Mike Keenan is fourth, notching 200 victories in 357
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, in his fourth full season as the Stars' coach, has a
.620 winning percentage, the second highest among active NHL
coaches. Detroit coach Scotty Bowman is first at .653. Hitchcock
became the Stars' winningest coach with his 175th victory on Dec. 1
at Montreal.
Fernandez in net
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough being a backup goalie and going day to day not
knowing the next time you'll play. It's worse when your most-recent
game was a 5-2 loss to Nashville. Manny Fernandez returns to the
net tonight having plenty of time to mull that Feb. 21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try it all over again,'' Fernandez said. ``I don't play
much, so I'll get back to the basics. I just want to win the games.
We've got to get the two points from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour has taken the past two days of practice off. He's
using the extra time to work out at Dr Pepper StarCenter and at his
home gym, Ken Hitchcock said.
Penalty killer
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner has become a penalty killer out of
necessity. With penalty-killing regulars Blake Sloan and Guy
Carbonneau out with injuries for at least two weeks, Langenbrunner
has emerged as Ken Hitchcock's choice to play on the special-teams
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it; it keeps you in the flow of the game,''
Langenbrunner said. ``We tend to play a lot of pressure, so you get
to keep moving, and I like that. We try to get after them and try
to make them make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said defenseman Darryl Sydor will likely be pulled up
as forward more often on the penalty-killing unit while Sloan and
Carbonneau are out.

PERISHO LOCKED IN BATTLE TO MAKE ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Matt Perisho has two opportunities to
make the club. He can beat out Mark Clark and become the fifth
starter, or he can earn a spot as a left-handed reliever.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't hurt his chances for either job yesterday, pitching
two hitless innings in the Rangers' 3-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays. He only allowed one base runner, on a one-out walk to Dave
Martinez in the fourth inning. He struck out Greg Vaughn and Vinny
Castilla to open the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw strikes and got people out,'' manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho is looking forward to a springlong battle with Clark,
who shut out the Devil Rays for three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to bring out the competitor in both players,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho was 15-7 with a 4.61 earned-run average in 27 starts at
Triple-A Oklahoma City last season, and he had a 2.61 ERA in four
appearances with the Rangers in September.
</P>
<P>
   He is out of options, and likely would be claimed if the Rangers
tried to get him through waivers to return him to the minors. That,
along with left-handed reliever Mike Venafro's finger injury, makes
Perisho a good bet to make the club in some role.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easier, though, if he could be certain of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be like 130 other guys where they say, `Here's
your job, here's what you need to do, now let's go get ready for
the season,' '' he said.
Wetteland not a concern
</P>
<P>
   When outfielder Rusty Greer and reliever John Wetteland suffered
injuries in an intrasquad game Thursday, both were expected to miss
three to four days.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who had inflammation around his right ankle, was back in
the lineup Monday. He took the day off yesterday as scheduled and
isn't expected to have any lingering problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who strained his right calf muscle, was back on a
mound to throw on the side Sunday but has yet to make his
exhibition debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure when he'll be ready to throw in a game,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, though, has yet to raise a warning flag like the
ankle injury he had last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not serious,'' Oates said. ``I've been told it's just a
strain. If John can get ready last year, he can get ready any time.
He didn't pitch at all last spring, and he had a pretty good year.
He's already got his arm strength up there fastball-wise, so it
won't take him that long to get ready to pitch.''
Base-running blunder
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton was successful on a steal of third with no one out
in the first inning Monday. He tried it again yesterday, this time
in the wrong situation and without success.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was thrown out at third with two outs and Rafael
Palmeiro up in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're having spring training,'' Oates said. ``He
knows he made a mistake, and we talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he gives everyone on the team a green light on the
bases this early in the spring in order to learn who gets one
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get a lot of knowledge about who knows how and when to
go,'' he said.
Alicea solid
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Luis Alicea displayed his power Monday, hitting
two home runs. He displayed his bat control yesterday, flicking it
out to make contact that led to a infield single with Royce Clayton
running in fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea, who is expected to take over for Mark McLemore as the
regular second baseman, is hitting .300 and has made all the plays
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything that I did not expect,'' Oates said.
``He's a good baseball player; he knows how the game is supposed to
be played. I'm not sure he's a 140-game type guy, but when he's
rested and healthy he can do a lot of things well.''
More Mateo
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ruben Mateo again displayed the ability to handle
the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo's one-out, fourth-inning sacrifice fly with the bases
loaded scored Royce Clayton. Mateo delivered the sacrifice fly
despite a two-strike count against right-hander Chad Ogea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two times in a row he's been able to get the ball to
the outfield'' with a runner at third and less than two outs,
Johnny Oates said. \Nname:_ Johnny Paul
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Third-base coach Jerry Narron was hit by a Ruben Mateo foul ball
for the second time this spring. He also was nailed in the
exhibition opener.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler's grand slam against the Boston Red Sox on Monday
was the first by a Ranger in spring training since Shawn Gallagher
hit one against the Detroit Tigers on March 13, 1999. Kapler played
for the Tigers that day, and went deep twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have had two two-homer games this spring, one by
Alicea and one by Tom Evans in the exhibition opener Friday against
the Minnesota Twins. Before this year, the last two-homer spring
game was by Dean Palmer on March 4, 1997.

TEXAS CANCELS GAME AT HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas officials, citing concerns about
rising travel costs and the possible wear and tear on athletes
during a possible 14-game season, have canceled the team's Sept. 2
football game at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director DeLoss Dodds made the announcement yesterday,
meaning the Longhorns' season opener will be Sept. 9 in Austin
against Louisiana-Lafayette. Under terms of the agreement, Texas
officials must pay Hawaii a $100,000 cancellation fee if the
Rainbow Warriors cannot find ``an opponent of similar stature'' to
replace Texas on their 2000 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dodds said school officials expected to lose $175,000
going to Hawaii because of rising fuel costs that made the trip
``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Texas coach Mack Brown expressed concerns about
playing a 14-game schedule if the Longhorns reaches the Big 12
title game and earned a bowl invitation.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping Hawaii, the Longhorns now have 11 regular-season
games and would play a maximum of 13 games next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry this didn't work out and for any inconvenience it
causes Hawaii,'' Dodds said yesterday in a prepared statement. ``We
looked at this from every angle. ... The bottom line is we have to
do what is in the best interests of our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his team lost its final three games to end last season
with a 9-5 record, Brown has been lobbying to avoid the chance of
playing another 14-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we got a little tired at the end of the season last
year, and the schedule played a part,'' Brown said. ``We played 14
games ... and our guys just wore out.''

CLARK MAKE BID FOR FIFTH SPOT IN RANGERS' ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Questions regarding the health of
right-hander Mark Clark can be put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Only one question requires an answer this spring. Will Clark be
part of the Rangers' rotation by Opening Day?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out there and pitch the way I'm capable, I don't see
any reason why I won't be the fifth starter,'' Clark said after
pitching three scoreless innings during the Rangers' 3-1 loss
yesterday to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Clark or left-hander Matt Perisho likely will join left-handers
Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver and right-handers Rick Helling and
Esteban Loaiza in the Rangers' rotation. The odd-man-out likely
will become the staff's long reliever. Perisho replaced Clark
yesterday and also pitched impressively, with two innings of no-hit
relief that included strikeouts of Greg Vaughn and Vinny Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   Only one batter reached safely against Clark during his
economical, 33-pitch appearance against a Devil Rays lineup that
included power hitters Jose Canseco, Fred McGriff, Vaughn and
Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better now than I felt at any time last year,'' Clark
said, ``and I think they're seeing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not see that last year in his debut with the
organization after signing a two-year, $9 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clark went 3-7 with an 8.60 earned-run average in 15 starts
before being placed on the disabled list June 20 with a tear of the
ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. Clark never returned
from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to prove that I can pitch,'' said Clark, who did
not allow a well-hit ball to any of the nine batters he faced
yesterday. ``They know I can pitch. I've got to show them that I'm
healthy, and I'm doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Gerald Williams had the only hit against Clark, a
first-inning infield single. Clark struck out McGriff and second
baseman Miguel Cairo and threw first-pitch strikes to seven of nine
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to Clark's sinking, two-seam fastball, the
foundation of his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my pitches come off that pitch,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury prevented Clark from extending his right arm during
his delivery, and that robbed him of velocity and movement.
Opponents hit .329 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been throwing the ball well,'' bullpen coach Larry Hardy
said. ``He's getting through the ball, and his fastball has
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark does not relish the idea of pitching in relief and
informed general manager Doug Melvin of that this winter in a
cordial conversation. Clark also informed Melvin of his desire to
be traded if relegated to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' Clark said of the conversation. ``I just
expressed my thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's performance, though, will determine his role and future
with the Rangers. The organization also has an option on his
contract for the 2001 season worth $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, would it be nice to have him come out of the chute and
pitch like he can,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``He had a pretty
good year in '98. He was hurt in '99. We didn't see Mark Clark last
year.''

COWBOYS WAITING ON WORD FROM MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Could the Cowboys lose a free-agent prospect to
lowly Cincinnati?
</P>
<P>
   That appears more possible as Baltimore Ravens quarterback Scott
Mitchell didn't contact the Cowboys yesterday, a day after they
offered him a contract to replace Jason Garrett as Troy Aikman's
backup.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with the Bengals has not been completed, but Mitchell's
agent, Tony Agnone, asked the team to send a contract to the
quarterback via overnight delivery, the ``Dayton Daily News''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Agnone could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys offensive coordinator Jack Reilly, whose close
relationship with Mitchell from the University of Utah was the
impetus for the Cowboys' interest, said the quarterback believes he
would have a better chance of playing next season as a backup to
Akili Smith in Cincinnati than as a backup to Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys don't get Mitchell, they could turn to Mike
Quinn, the team's No. 3 quarterback last season, as the primary
backup or to a moderately priced veteran free-agent quarterback,
such as Shane Matthews, Billy Joe Hobert and Paul Justin.

HITCHCOCK AIMS FOR 200TH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is one regular-season
victory shy of No. 200. If he gets it tonight against the Vancouver
Canucks, he will be the fourth-fastest coach in NHL history to
reach 200 victories. In 355 games, Hitchcock is 199-114-42. Don
Cherry did it in 341 games, Toe Blake did it in 345, and Tommy Ivan
did it in 353. Mike Keenan is fourth, notching 200 victories in 357
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, in his fourth full season as the Stars' coach, has a
.620 winning percentage, the second highest among active NHL
coaches. Detroit coach Scotty Bowman is first at .653. Hitchcock
became the Stars' winningest coach with his 175th victory on Dec. 1
at Montreal.
Fernandez in net
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough being a backup goalie and going day to day not
knowing the next time you'll play. It's worse when your most-recent
game was a 5-2 loss to Nashville. Manny Fernandez returns to the
net tonight having plenty of time to mull that Feb. 21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try it all over again,'' Fernandez said. ``I don't play
much, so I'll get back to the basics. I just want to win the games.
We've got to get the two points from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour has taken the past two days of practice off. He's
using the extra time to work out at Dr Pepper StarCenter and at his
home gym, Ken Hitchcock said.
Penalty killer
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner has become a penalty killer out of
necessity. With penalty-killing regulars Blake Sloan and Guy
Carbonneau out with injuries for at least two weeks, Langenbrunner
has emerged as Ken Hitchcock's choice to play on the special-teams
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it; it keeps you in the flow of the game,''
Langenbrunner said. ``We tend to play a lot of pressure, so you get
to keep moving, and I like that. We try to get after them and try
to make them make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said defenseman Darryl Sydor will likely be pulled up
as forward more often on the penalty-killing unit while Sloan and
Carbonneau are out.

EXCERPTS FROM BUSH'S PREPARED REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the advance text of remarks Tuesday
night by Gov. George W. Bush:
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, we have good news from sea to shining sea. We were
challenged, and we met the challenge. We were tested, and we were
equal to the test. We promised a national campaign. And, tonight,
we have a national victory. Republicans and conservatives across
America have said they want me to lead the Republican Party to
victory come November, and I am ready and eager to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I commend two good men and tough competitors: Alan Keyes and
Sen. John McCain. This has been a spirited contest. I congratulate
John. We have our disagreements, but I respect him and his
commitment to reform. I congratulate Alan for his campaign of
conviction. Soon, our party will unite and turn to the main task at
hand: ending the era of Clinton and Gore. ...
</P>
<P>
   From the first day, this campaign has had a cause, a vision of
change for our party and our country. Republicans must expand our
prosperity, and extend it to those who still struggle. We must be a
strong nation _ that also cares for the weak and forgotten. We must
welcome the new Americans _ Americans by choice _ because legal
immigration is not a source of national weakness, it is a sign of
national success.
</P>
<P>
   We are a party of principle. We must also be a party of
inclusion _ a party with a generous heart and an open door.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, in the other party, Al Gore is celebrating victory as
well. I congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the
candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough
case to make in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has had
history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security _ with a
growing surplus and a willing public. But they have chosen to
demagogue Social Security, not repair it. America needs a president
who will make Social Security a priority, not use it as a ploy. As
president, I will reach across party lines to strengthen and
preserve Social Security. ...
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has spoken of
education as a matter of bricks and mortar and bureaucratic
mandates. But the real problem in education is politicians who
never stop talking, and children who never start reading.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, we are going to dramatically
improve the performance of out public schools. As president, I am
going to rescue children from failure, and return excellence to
American education through high standards, accountability and
results.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of Clinton-Gore, we have the highest tax
burden since World War II. And yet we are told that taxes are not
an issue. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm not proposing tax relief because it's the popular thing to
do. I'm proposing it because it's the right thing to do. I will
stand on principle, and I will bring honor to this process and to
the office I seek. I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want
a White House where there is no controlling legal authority. I will
repair the broken bonds of trust between Americans and their
government. ...
</P>
<P>
   Someone will make history this November. Either we will ratify
the status quo or we will have a new beginning in American
politics. I say: America must not give Clinton-Gore a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, I invite every American, of every background, to join
our cause. If you believe our nation needs high standards and new
leaders, this is your campaign. If you believe politics should
inspire young people, not disillusion them, this is your campaign.
If you believe our country needs a fresh start ... a clean break
... a rebirth of idealism, this is your campaign.

PRONOUNCED MOVE FROM RIGHT TO CENTER ACCOMPANIES BUSH'S PRIMARY
SUCCESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nearly five weeks ago, when Gov. George W.
Bush's grip on the Republican presidential nomination looked
tenuous, he indulged in the most controversial symbolism of his
campaign and appeared at Bob Jones University, a conservative
Christian school in South Carolina that still had a prohibition
against interracial dating in place.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, as the Texas governor basked in several key
victories that put him in what he clearly felt was a very different
position, he turned that symbolism inside out. He chose to be
introduced at his celebration here by a black female educator from
Houston, Phyllis C. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   More than any exit poll or tally of delegates, that change in
signals illustrated what really happened to Bush and his advisers
Tuesday. They pivoted from flattering the right to courting the
center, from nurturing their most reliable sources of electoral
strength to cultivating new supporters, from traditional tactics to
bolder plans.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they began their general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That shift was also reflected in Bush's speech. It not only
anticipated the nomination, relegating the Republican primary
contest to the past tense, but also sought to woo the independent
and moderate voters who liked Sen. John McCain and to allay any
concerns or speculation that McCain might have been a stronger foe
for Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans must expand our prosperity, and extend it to those
who still struggle,'' Bush said, sounding the centrist theme of
compassionate conservatism that was sometimes lost in his bitter
struggle against McCain. ``We must be a strong nation ... that also
cares for the weak and forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party of principle,'' Bush added. ``We must also be a
party of inclusion a party with a generous heart and an open
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also signaled that he was ready to take on Gore _ and that
he had already hammered out many of the battle lines for that
engagement _ by repeatedly mentioning the vice president repeatedly
and unreservedly attacking the record of ``the Clinton-Gore
administration.'' That phrase, used like a mantra, tethered Gore
tightly to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is celebrating victory as well,'' Bush told hundreds
of cheering supporters at the Four Seasons hotel here. ``I
congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the
candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough
case to make in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House
where there is no controlling legal authority,'' Bush said, showing
at least one of the cards he planned to play. ``I will repair the
broken bonds of trust between Americans and their government.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, his advisers and his supporters, Tuesday night was
more than a sweet vindication of their tireless predictions that
the governor would win the nomination decisively and early, despite
the surprising potency of McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance to turn their attention in the direction they
had always wanted to _ toward November and Gore. Although there had
been something akin to a superstition in the Bush campaign about
talking too extensively about the general election before the
primaries were won, aides were suddenly willing to talk Tuesday
about the need to widen the campaign's circle of advisers, bring
new allies onboard, plot the details of the convention in August
and coordinate efforts more closely with the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They reevaluated Bush's upcoming travel schedule in the context
of what would be most helpful for the general election, not what
was necessary to secure the nomination, and the details of that
schedule betrayed no sense of urgency. Bush planned to spend most
of the next four days at home in Austin, off the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said that their firmer purchase on the
nomination would allow them, between now and the end of April, to
begin folding more fund raisers into Bush's plans. One aide said
that the campaign would raise another $5 million to $10 million
between now and the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   But, most important of all, Tuesday's results meant that Bush
could focus on the themes he would need and the weapons he would
use to prevail in November, campaign officials said.

 &HT;    GORE TAKES COMMAND OF DEMOCRATIC RACE
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects last word of 9th graf to ``Gore.''
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore took command of the
Democratic presidential race Tuesday, sweeping to lopsided
victories in states from coast to coast and forcing Bill Bradley to
assess whether to continue his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a victory address at a posh downtown Nashville hotel,
immediately pivoted to a general election strategy with an appeal
to the independent voters that were attracted to GOP upstart John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us now,'' he said in touting the economic prosperity of
the last seven years and presenting the Democratic Party as
``mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is full tonight,'' Gore declared to the hundreds of
supporters who celebrated his victory with food, drinks and country
music.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to heal any wounds from the surprisingly bitter battle
with Bradley, Gore called his challenger a ``good man.'' He added,
``Anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign has
come away from the experience moved and touched by the strength of
his commitment to healing the divisions in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   A subdued but relaxed Bradley spoke to supporters in an
appearance shortly after the polls closed in New York. Surrounded
by longtime friends and campaign staff at a New York hotel, Bradley
hinted that the losses would force him to withdraw from the race,
but vowed to continue the fight for a ``new kind of politics in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won; I lost,'' Bradley said. ``On one level I agree with
Vince Lombardi when he said winning isn't everything, it's the only
thing. Tomorrow, I'll consult with supporters around the country
and get their thoughts and advice and I'll make my plans known
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chairman Doug Berman shook his head ``no'' when asked
if the the speech left any doubt that Bradley planned to exit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley had long contended that he was up against
``entrenched power'' in his campaign against Gore, he lost every
core Democratic constituency in what is likely to be his last
face-to-face contest with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   According to network television polls, Gore won African
Americans, Jews, Hispanics, gays, labor and women, all key elements
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's support came almost exclusively from anti-Clinton
Democrats, not a large constituency in a party that, despite the
impeachment of President Clinton, has presided over the longest
economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories in the largest primary voting of the year
reflected a remarkable comeback from the days last summer when his
campaign was viewed as weak and ineffective in the face of a
surprisingly strong challenge from Bradley and the popularity of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But a disciplined and energetic Gore powered past Bradley on
Tuesday. And in a poll published Tuesday by the Wall Street
Journal, Gore erased the double digit lead Bush had on him last
summer. The latest poll shows the two in a 46-46 percent tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his family joined fellow Tennesseans at a hotel near
the Vanderbilt University campus to celebrate one of the biggest
victories of his 24-year career in politics, one that brings him a
step closer to the nomination he first sought in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore registered convincing margins of victory in California, New
York, Georgia and Ohio, the most important states in the so-called
Super Tuesday primary. He also rolled up victories in Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island and Missouri,
Bradley's native state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his uphill campaign against Gore in December
1998. Others considered the race, but calculated that a sitting
vice president would be too difficult to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley scored early success in the fund-raising arena, raising
almost as much money as Gore and threatening the vice president
with positive poll numbers in New Hampshire, site of the nation's
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to be a candidate of ``big ideas,'' Bradley ran on a
plan to provide health insurance to the nation's poor, enact
stricter gun control and replace the campaign finance laws with a
system of public financing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley invested heavily in Iowa and lost. The defeat,
coupled with McCain's maverick appeal, contributed to Bradley's
loss in New Hampshire. From then on, Bradley found it difficult to
regain his footing in a national media environment where all the
focus was on McCain and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of this is that we had an extraordinarily hard
task in front of us,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications
director. ``We knew it would not be easy.''

BRUINS HAVE MUDDLE IN THE MIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's riddle begins in the middle. It's either
awesome or awful, depending on the play of sophomore big men Jerome
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, who are either dominant or dormant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent, there's no doubt,'' Moiso said. ``But
we've also been struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Moiso scored six points and grabbed one rebound
at Arizona State. Saturday, he dominated Stanford with 12 rebounds
and 17 points _ including eight in the final minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Gadzuric scored eight points and grabbed six
rebounds at Arizona State. Last week, he dominated Cal with a
career-high 22 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With both, because of the fact that they're from overseas
(Gadzuric is Dutch, Moiso's from Guadeloupe in the West Indies) . .
. we have to be more patient with them,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``We have to understand that they aren't going to play
consistently at the level of Lew Alcindor or Bill Walton.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the most deluded UCLA fans have asked them to play like
Walton or Alcindor. The Bruins simply need Gadzuric and Moiso to be
impact players on a weekly basis. In the Bay Area, they were. Will
it last?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's postseason success depends on the mystery men in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more confident,'' Gadzuric said. ``I'm learning
more about recognizing defenses so I know when the double team is
coming and can find the open man. In the game, it all happens in
the snap of your fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Solid sophs: Gadzuric, Moiso, Ray Young, Matt Barnes and
JaRon Rush arrived 18 months ago as one of the nation's top rookie
classes. Each has excelled at various times, but Saturday's
performance at Stanford was their best collective effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rush scored a team-high 19 points and hit the game-winner. Moiso
dominated in the final minutes of regulation. Gadzuric had 10
points before fouling out. Barnes had 10 points and three assists
off the bench, and Young played 16 minutes without a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I can remember all five playing well at
the same time,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The Bruins have won four in a row for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is 6-2 in overtime games under Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   Iona, one of UCLA's early-season victims, won the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference title and earned an NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' victory over Stanford was their first over a No. 1
team in 13 years (North Carolina) and their seventh overall. Notre
Dame leads all schools with nine victories over top-ranked teams,
according to the Associated Press.

<P>
   It has become almost as much of an Oscar ritual as overwrought
production numbers and fashion gaffes: a documentary that has
entranced both critics and audiences is inexplicably omitted when
the nominations in that category are announced. Over the years, the
roster of distinguished non-nominees has included ``Shoah,'' ``28
Up,'' ``Roger and Me,'' ``The Thin Blue Line,'' ``Brother's
Keeper,'' ``Crumb'' and ``Hoop Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The snubbing of acclaimed pictures like these proved so
embarrassing to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
that its leaders began tinkering with the selection process half a
dozen years ago. But the complaints persisted.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's awards, academy officials went much further.
They set in motion a process that led to a complete overhaul of the
documentary selection process. This time, according to some of
their harshest critics, they appear to have gotten it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new system seems to be working very well,'' said Betsy A.
McLane, the executive director of the International Documentary
Association, a nonprofit organization that represents 2,500
documentary filmmakers. ``I haven't talked to anyone who doesn't
feel this is an improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to past years, when popularity at the box office
seemed to disqualify a documentary from academy consideration, this
year's five nominees include one film that found an unusually large
audience for a work of nonfiction: ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
about a group of forgotten musicians from prerevolutionary Cuba.
The other nominees include some well-regarded pictures, two of
which also focus on musicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, academy officials acknowledge, the choice of
nominees in the documentary category was skewed by rules that
required every member of the screening committee to watch every
eligible film in a theater, subjecting them to a marathon of as
many as 65 films in the space of two months.
</P>
<P>
   Since few people working in Hollywood have that much disposable
time, many of the committee's volunteers were retired people, not
even necessarily documentary filmmakers, who often had little
appreciation for innovative work or for complex, unsentimental
approaches to social themes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve James' ``Hoop Dreams,'' for example, which traced the
lives of two Chicago youths who dreamed of becoming basketball
stars, was regarded by many critics as one of the best films of
1994, documentary or dramatic. But the academy screening committee
did not share that enthusiasm, said Jean Rouverol Butler, an
actress and screenwriter, now 83, who was a member for more than 15
years. ``I don't think `Hoop Dreams' was that popular,'' she said.
``People felt it was self-indulgent, in terms of being an hour too
long and running well past what it had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the committee rejected ``The Thin Blue Line,'' the
much-praised 1988 film by Errol Morris that helped bring about the
release of a death row inmate, on the ground that some scenes were
re-enacted. ``People were quite bitter against it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reform the screening process, the academy tried
to reduce the workload, including barring films that had been seen
at festivals but not in theaters. But this year, it took a much
bigger step by asking some leading documentary filmmakers to come
up with completely new procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwartzman, the producer of the 1981 Oscar-winning
documentary ``Genocide,'' was named chairman of a 12-member
documentary executive committee consisting of a number of
well-known filmmakers, including Morris, Michael Apted (``28 Up'')
and Barbara Kopple, who received Academy Awards for the 1976
``Harlan County U.S.A.'' and the 1990 ``American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We put them into a room,'' said Bruce Davis, the executive
director of the academy, ``and we said, `You need to work out a
system, and do it better than we've been doing it in the past.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The system they devised worked like this: about 130 academy
members across the country who are associated with the nonfiction
genre were asked to help come up with a short list of 12 films,
culled from 55 entries. About 80 people responded, many more than
expected, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a departure for the academy's leadership, which has
generally frowned on the use of videotapes in the selection
process, they were encouraged to see the entries on their VCRs. The
volunteers were divided into four groups so that no one had to
watch more than 14 cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   After the results of the first round of voting were announced,
in early January, the process was opened to the entire academy
membership of 5,607. To join the voting at this point, members had
to see all 12 films in a screening room in Los Angeles, San
Francisco or New York. About 140 people participated, Davis said.
(Before the remaining academy members vote in the best documentary
category, they must see all five nominees.)
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky, the co-director of ``Brother's Keeper,'' said he was
thrilled that so many documentary filmmakers had taken part in the
initial selection. ``They are opening it up from the myopic view of
what a nonfiction film is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five nominees, the heavy favorite is ``Buena Vista Social
Club,'' directed by Wim Wenders. The film has already picked up
awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics.
</P>
<P>
   The other nominated films with musical themes are ``Genghis
Blues,'' produced by Roko and Adrian Belic, which follows a blind
San Francisco blues singer and guitarist who becomes enamored of
the Central Asian vocal technique called throat-singing; and
``Speaking in Strings,'' Paola di Florio's portrait of the
Italian-born violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Cohn, a two-time Oscar winner, is represented by ``One
Day in September,'' an account of the 1972 massacre of Israeli
Olympic athletes, produced with Kevin McDonald. Rounding out the
nominees is ``On the Ropes,'' a film by Nanette Burstein and Brett
Morgen that looks at the role of the Bed-Stuy Boxing Center in
Brooklyn in the lives of three aspiring prizefighters.
</P>
<P>
   (A film by Morris, ``Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.
Leuchter Jr.,'' which was a runner-up for several critics' awards,
made the first cut but was eliminated in the second round.)
</P>
<P>
   The response to the new system has been positive, Davis said.
``It is very exhilarating to walk into a roomful of documentarians
and have them all smiling at you,'' he said. ``It's a nice
change.''

McCAIN'S MAVERICK STYLE MAY HAVE COST HIM WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS 
 
(Eds.: Story will update) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ John McCain's ``great ride'' for the
White House was sputtering Tuesday, largely because his maverick,
reform-oriented campaign still appeals more to independents and
Democrats than to his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has spoiled early Republican front-runner
George W. Bush's ``coronation,'' and he was reluctant to throw in
the towel. But McCain's anti-establishment message hasn't caught
fire with most GOP voters, and time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's history as a political renegade _ he likes to brag at
campaign rallies that he never has been voted ``Miss Congeniality''
in Washington _ may have been a particularly acute problem in
Tuesday's lineup. The elections were dominated by states, such as
Ohio, with strong Republican traditions or states, such as New York
and California, where only Republicans could vote or where ballots
cast only by Republicans counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stuck his finger in the eye of the (Republican)
establishment, and he did so at a time when they had already made
their choice (of Bush), which only further irritated them,'' said
University of Texas professor Bruce Buchanan, a specialist in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, McCain, never a favorite of many religious
conservatives, alienated even more members of that significant
Republican bloc by branding two major fundamentalist leaders
``agents of intolerance.``
</P>
<P>
   As the senator was still adding up the numbers late Tuesday, his
aides announced that he will campaign in Colorado and Illinois on
Thursday and Friday, in advance of upcoming primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But, barring a surprise in late-reporting California, it
appeared that McCain would fall short of the 200 delegates that his
strategists had said earlier were the minimum he needed from Super
Tuesday to maintain a realistic chance at the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's election, the McCain camp had ceded
California's 162 delegates, the richest nominating prize, to Bush,
who had the strong backing of the state's GOP establishment.
Although any voter could cast a ballot in the state's primary, only
Republican votes counted toward delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was hoping to win the most overall votes in the state's
primary in order to claim that he would be the most ``electable''
candidate in California in November. But setbacks for the Arizona
senator in other states, notably Ohio and Maine, and a close race
in New York may have made California's so-called ``beauty contest''
moot.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting out election returns in a hotel suite in Beverly Hills,
McCain told a radio interviewer early Tuesday that he was pleased
with his effort _ what he often calls a ``great ride'' _ to broaden
the Republican Party's base, which has resulted in record primary
voter turnouts in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Gibson, a University of Connecticut political scientist,
said McCain needed to reach out to non-Republicans to capture New
Hampshire and Michigan, states with open primaries where his
victories gave momentum to his underdog effort. ``But by doing
that, he certainly offends the traditional power base,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout in Michigan's Republican primary two weeks ago was
more than double what it was four years ago, and at least half of
the voters who cast ballots were Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said McCain's alienation of religious conservatives with
his attacks on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell may have been a
factor in Tuesday's balloting but probably was not an overriding
one. She made a similar assessment of a TV ad that Bush supporters
ran in New York, Ohio and California, attacking McCain's
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick off pieces,'' she said. ``I'm not sure either one of
those would be a key piece (by itself).``
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign said it already has spent $200,000 on
advertising in Colorado, which will hold its primary Friday. But
the senator's next major test will be March 14, when he faces a
difficult lineup of states, including Texas, Bush's home state;
Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor; and other Southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll indicated that McCain is competitive in Illinois,
but that state won't hold its primary until March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Buchanan agreed that, even if McCain loses the
Republican presidential nomination, he probably has forced the GOP
to soon address political reform, the cornerstone of the senator's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has made campaign finance ``a high profile embarrassment''
for the GOP, Gibson said. ``I think that will be his legacy, making
reform a more difficult thing for Republicans to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the Republican Party, in order to expand its base,
will need to consider political reforms because of its popularity
with independents. He said McCain presented a message of ``making
politics higher and better and more noble ... and that seemed to
catch on'' with independent voters.

EXCERPTS FROM BRADLEY'S REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech by former Sen. Bill Bradley
Tuesday night in New York, as transcribed by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I just called the vice president to congratulate him on his
victories tonight. He won. I lost. And on one level I agree with
Vince Lombardi when he said winning isn't everything, it's the only
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, I'll consult with supporters around the country to get
their thoughts and advice. And I'll make my plans known shortly.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight, I want to go to a deeper level than winning or
losing ...
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, we celebrate what each of you in this room, tireless
workers for our campaign throughout this country and millions of
voters, have accomplished. And that is the beginning of a new
politics in our country.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this campaign I've talked about the essential
goodness of the American people. I see and feel it as deeply and as
clearly today as I ever have.
</P>
<P>
   But in running for president I've also sought to enlist
something else. Something I've always seen in the eyes in the
American people. And that is idealism. A belief that good can
triumph over bad, that principle can defeat expediency.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to run for president to tap into that deep and abiding
strand in our national character. For only by enlisting it can we
create a new politics and do the great things that still need to be
done. The things we can now afford to do in these unprecedented
times of prosperity. ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite our lack of victory tonight, there's so much that every
one of you who became a part of our campaign has to be proud of.
We've shaped the national debate in this campaign. We've brought
core Democratic issues to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When no one was talking about the 44 million Americans without
health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless. When no one was
talking about the 13 children who die every day of gun violence, we
heard their cries.
</P>
<P>
   When no one was talking about the nearly 14 million children who
still live in poverty in this country, we said America can't be
America if they remain poor in a time of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When no one was talking about campaign finance reform, we
connected people's skepticism about the state of our democracy to
the pollution of money in our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Over a year ago I began the journey to seek the Democratic
nomination. It is truly a joyous journey, one that reaffirms my
belief that America is a special nation at a special moment in our
history. A moment which if we do not seize will cause future
generations to judge us harshly and say they knew what was wrong,
they had the means to make it better but they did not act.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of people across the nation voted for a change
in the way Washington works and political campaigns are run. I've
always believed that politics is the way we experience collectively
what we can never know alone. The campaign reaffirms that belief
for me every day.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that tonight we're a step closer to
a society in which no family has to fear being one paycheck away
from financial disaster because their children get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight we're a step closer to being a democracy where reform
once again has its day.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight we're a step closer to realizing the promise of America,
that we are one nation, where people can see beneath skin color,
eye shape or sexual orientation to the person, to the American that
is their neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no doubt in my mind that tonight we're a step
closer to a politics that once again is seen as noble service.
Where those who practice it are trusted. Where corruption and
deceit give way to truth and candor. ...
</P>
<P>
   I believe history will write that we tried to change politics,
to restore trust and to defeat the politics of expediency.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, we must remember that the fact that we've not
succeeded in winning tonight's primaries makes the cause no less
just, the fight no less honorable, the goal no less reachable. Some
have called our goals unrealistic. I call them common sense. I call
them Democratic. I call them American. And I'm going to work for
them until we win _ and we will win.

 &HT;     BUSH BLITZES McCAIN ON SUPER TUESDAY  
 &HT;     (Eds: Updates with delegate figures, early returns in New York,
McCain quote)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush effectively ended the challenge of
Sen. John
</P>
<P>
   McCain for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday,
setting the
</P>
<P>
   stage for Bush to reach out to McCain and his supporters to join
a GOP crusade to reclaim the White House in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain pledged late Tuesday that his ``crusade'' would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush harnessed hard-hitting campaign ads and a lavishly financed
nationwide campaign organization to sweep most of the 13 states
with GOP contests.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial returns and television network projections showed
Bush beating McCain in California, New York, Ohio, Georgia,
Maryland, Missouri and Maine. Bush dashed McCain's last hopes for a
symbolic victory by capturing the popular vote contest in
California in which non-Republicans cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Bush dominated key winner-take-all
delegate contests, including California, as well as the majority of
the GOP delegates in states that award delegates on a
district-by-district basis.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, said the Texan would pick up
as many as 450 of the 613 delegates chosen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN delegate projections at 11 p.m. EST showed Bush winning 245
delegates from the Super Tuesday contests, not including the 162
delegates at stake in California. The projections showed McCain
picking up 108. Including his anticipated victory in California,
Bush has won 622 delegates and McCain 213 since the 2000 contest
began in Iowa in January. A Republican candidate needs 1,034
delegates to secure the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose fiery populism sustained an uphill challenge for
the last six weeks, captured Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts
and Rhode Island. He did not sweep New England and New York, as he
said he needed to do to sustain his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the 63-year-old former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner
of war make inroads among the bedrock Republican voters who he
needed in order to garner large numbers of delegates in the
district-by-district duels in states such as New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, made it clear
that his most pressing task in the days ahead will be to court
McCain, and the centrist Republicans, independents and Democrats
who rallied to McCain, in hopes of ending the GOP fratricide that
imperils his chances in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush paid homage to McCain, echoing the Arizonan's message of
reform and publicly praising him. ``We have our disagreements but I
respect him and his commitment to reform,'' Bush said in remarks
prepared for his victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, savoring the likely end of his GOP primary struggle,
shifted his attention to Vice President Al Gore, ``the candidate of
the status quo'' who must be defeated because ``America must not
give Clinton-Gore a third term.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign manager signaled that the victor would await
McCain's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to urge him out of the race,'' Rove said.
``What would be appropriate for us to do is to indicate that
Governor Bush is ready to heal and unify the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush would only claim victory ``when we get to 1,034
delegates and we're the only candidate left.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary schedule moves into Bush territory next Tuesday,
with contests in six key southern and southwestern states,
including Texas, where he is governor, and Florida where his
brother, Jeb Bush, is chief executive. The six states offer 341
delegates _ enough to give Bush a mathematical lock on the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would stay in the race only if he believed he
still had a chance to turn things around and win the nomination.
McCain said last weekend that he would withdraw from a failing race
rather than have his ``megaphone turn into a kazoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran senator struck a wistful tone before the results
were in. ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked this
kind of prairie fire out there that got people involved,'' McCain
said told a radio call-in program early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hard-hitting populist bid, featuring attacks on Bush,
``the establishment,'' the White House, Congress and special
interests, attracted legions of first-time voters, once-alienated
young voters, independents and Democrats to the GOP banner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy ignited historic turnouts in New Hampshire
and Michigan, where he won early momentum, as well as in South
Carolina where he lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said excitement does not translate into nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a credible early favorite _ and you have the
fortitude to stay on in the face of early disappointments _ you're
going to win the nomination,'' Baker said. ``Ultimately the
favorites designated by the party graybeards walk away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta who is not
working for any presidential campaign, said McCain could not hope
to win the GOP nomination ``without Republican votes,'' adding:
``Establishment matters, and money matters _ especially in a war of
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which had the support of Republican leaders _
including 29 governors, 38 senators and 175 House members _ carried
out 2 million get-out-the-vote telephone calls in nine states in
the final two days of the Super Tuesday campaign, mailed 2 million
pieces of campaign literature and distributed 69,000 yard signs,
according to Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Ayres said Bush had been strengthened for the
fall campaign by being forced to grapple with McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become ``a far superior candidate, far more aggressive,
far more
</P>
<P>
   unscripted, far more willing to take chances,'' Ayres said.

CLIMBING MT. OSCAR: SO MANY MOVIES, SO LITTLE TIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics) March 7, 2000. Days remaining: 19. Best film nominees
seen: 5 of 5 (excellent). Best actor and actress nominees seen: 16
of 20 (very .good.). Films of best director nominees seen: 5 of 5
(excellent). Best screenplay nominees seen: 9 of 10 (v.g.).
Calories consumed in process: 6,400, mostly three-ounce boxes of
Milk Duds (unfortunate).(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year I'm really going to do it. When Billy Crystal bounds
onto the stage of the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium on March 26, I
will have seen every single film and performance nominated for an
Academy Award in every major category, so help me God. Even if I
have to go to a movie about an old man driving a lawn mower across
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I am not alone in this quest. There are many of us, the
Oscar-dependent, who view the annual awards presentation as not
just a reason to stay home and watch movie actresses try to
outshine one another in borrowed dresses but as a crucial filmgoing
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, of course, is to see as many of the nominated movies
and performances as possible _ at the very least, to see more of
them than your friends have. And some people actually don't
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Oscar parties are a factor. Whether you are the host or a
guest, it's very satisfying to be the person in front of the
television set who knows the most about the nominees. And if
there's a party prize for the greatest number of accurate
predictions (or if you're making predictions in the office pool),
it certainly doesn't hurt to have checked out the nominees
firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the whole story. Anyway, since when does knowing
who (italics)should(end italics) win give you any insight into who
(italics)will(end italics) win? Those crazy Oscar voters chose
``Chariots of Fire'' as best picture over ``Reds'' for 1981. They
picked ``Forrest Gump'' over ``Pulp Fiction'' for 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And even when you try to think like them and forecast a victory
for a sentimental favorite, they'll fool you every time. I was
almost as surprised as Lauren Bacall was three years ago when
Juliette Binoche's name was read as the supporting actress winner
for ``The English Patient.'' ( Bacall was expected to win for
having played Barbra Streisand's gloriously egocentric mother in
``The Mirror Has Two Faces.'')
</P>
<P>
   What this multiplex-to-multiplex quest is really about is
informed opinion. Yes, there are moviegoers who will be willing to
insist that Michael Clarke Duncan should be named best supporting
actor for playing the gentle giant of a death row prisoner in ``The
Green Mile'' without having seen Tom Cruise as the slightly
deranged sex guru in ``Magnolia'' and vice versa. Well, that's OK
for some people, for some humdrum people, but no serious Oscar
devotee would make such rash judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Real Oscar devotees start making their mental lists early, at
least by November and December, when most of the likely award
contenders are released. Those of us who saw ``American Beauty''
back in September were smart; it ended up with eight nominations.
Seeing ``The Sixth Sense'' was a lucky break. Who knew back in
August that this Bruce Willis ghost movie with the nifty surprise
ending would rack up six Oscar nominations including _ excuse me _
best picture? Not that it isn't a lot of fun, but come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Ripley,'' on the other hand, was a miscalculation
on my part. I really liked it, but it yielded fewer major
nominations than I had thought: only Jude Law for supporting actor
and Anthony Minghella for adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Golden Globe Awards narrow things down
considerably. Then, when the actual Academy Award nominations are
announced, it's time to get serious. I happened to be in Los
Angeles and awake on Feb. 15, when this year's were read aloud on
television, and a friend and I saw ``Boys Don't Cry'' that night.
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, to evaluate Hilary Swank's gender-bending
performance as Brandon Teena. I had waited in case her Golden Globe
victory had been a fluke. (The Screen Actors Guild Awards are
Sunday night; I'm hoping for no surprises.)
</P>
<P>
   The best actress award is going to be a tough one to call,
because I missed Janet McTeer in ``Tumbleweeds'' in November, and
Fine Line doesn't plan to rerelease it in New York. I have a
feeling I'm missing something important, because McTeer was amazing
in ``A Doll's House'' on Broadway three years ago. Rumor has it
there are several great performances in not-so-great movies this
year. Do I really want to see ``Music of the Heart,'' for instance,
about a depressed single mom who becomes an inspiring violin
teacher in East Harlem? I know Meryl Streep can do anything, but
I'm imagining some misguided combination of ``Dangerous Minds'' and
`` Holland's Opus.''
</P>
<P>
   This Oscar madness has one positive side effect. It helps me
focus and prioritize my moviegoing. There are always more good
movies than there are free afternoons or evenings to see them in,
and for a couple of months it's a little easier to choose. So
``Wonder Boys'' will have to wait, as will a lot of Broadway
theatergoing.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time to catch up later. Meanwhile I am definitely
going to see Richard Farnsworth in ``The Straight Story'' (the
aforementioned old man on a lawn mower). Its reviews have been
enthusiastically positive, and there's a 7:30 at the Village East.

BUSH WINS MISSOURI GOP PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the vanguard of the state's Republican
Party in his corner, George W. Bush thumped John McCain in
Missouri's GOP presidential primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With 71 percent of the state's 4,017 precincts reporting, Bush
led 59-35 percent with former Ambassador Alan Keyes getting 6
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, Bush won by about the same margins. In
Jackson County, he was up 57-35 percent over McCain with all
precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 percent of the precincts reporting in Clay County, Bush
won 54-39 percent. In Platte and Cass counties with all votes
counted, Bush won with 52-41 percent and 58-34 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a better victory than we could have hoped for,'' said
Catherine Hanaway, Bush's Missouri executive director. ``We think
that bodes very well for November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was strong in St. Louis where he was buoyed by the
efforts of relatives, including his uncle, Bucky Bush, who lives in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that Bush's support from conservative
Republicans easily offset crossover voting by Democrats and
independents, the force that propelled McCain to victory in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in most state primaries, Bush was the clear
choice of GOP voters. Six in 10 voters in the GOP primary
identified themselves as Republicans. Among them, seven in 10
favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain pulled in more independents than Gore, his numbers
were nowhere near the two-thirds of independents he attracted in
other recent primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed Bush was not severely damaged by his speech at
Bob Jones University, a South Carolina college whose leaders have
espoused some anti-Catholic views. A quarter of Republican voters
were Catholic, and a majority of the Catholics favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness of the GOP race seemed to work against McCain.
Nearly half of all voters said McCain's attacks on Bush were
unfair; only about one-third said that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Final visits by both candidates were of little use, the poll
showed. Seven in 10 Republican voters had made up their minds at
least a week before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Former Missouri GOP chairman Woody Cozad said McCain's recent
denunciation of conservative religious leaders Jerry Falwell and
Pat Robertson as ``forces of evil'' backfired on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's divisive, and everybody in the party agrees they don't
want that this year,'' Cozad said.
</P>
<P>
   One voter McCain lost because of his comments was state Rep. Roy
Holand, a Springfield Republican. Heading into last week, Holand
said he was undecided between McCain and Bush. But that changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pop off like this is surprising and disappointing,'' Holand
said. ``If John McCain feels that conservative Republicans are that
bad, then that includes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked for his Missouri victory. Although he spent the bulk
of his time in California and New York, states that offered far
more delegates Tuesday, the Texan stopped in St. Louis and
Springfield last week and visited Kansas City on Feb. 22. He also
spent thousands of dollars on television advertising focused on
specific regions, but not the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to the next president,'' he said in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush volunteers made more than 200,000 telephone calls during
the last 10 days, an effort that made the difference, Hanaway said.
</P>
<P>
   With little time to organize here, McCain ran a
seat-of-the-pants campaign based exclusively on volunteers. He made
only one stop in the state _ a hastily arranged event last week in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain campaign simply didn't have the resources I would
have liked seen devoted to Missouri,'' said David Steelman,
McCain's Missouri chairman. ``We were outspent 10 to 1, maybe 20 to
1.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Part of it hangs on the walls of a cramped corridor
in an East Harlem school, identified by tiny paper labels,
yellowing and brittle. A portion is squeezed into a shelf under an
assemblage of broken appliances. Another piece of it is encased in
bubble wrap, lining the bottom of a deep closet.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its current undignified setting, the Raices Latin
Music Collection is considered one of the most important archives
of Afro-Caribbean music in America today. It has about 15,000
items, including a marimba made to order for Tito Puente, Machito's
original orchestral arrangements, rare photos of Mongo Santamaria
performing with Dizzy Gillespie, posters promoting concerts, rare
magazines, hand-scrawled sheet music, slides, rare 78 rpm
recordings and oral histories with the music's pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Raices, which means roots, tells the story of
how Latin traditions and American jazz converged into the brassy
percussive sound of salsa. Its story, archivists and music
historians say, is just waiting to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Its fans hope Raices will soon be drawn out of the dusty closets
and arid filing cabinets where it has been stored since 1978 at the
Boys Harbor's Conservatory for the Performing Arts, a music school
for children at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a government-financed
local development corporation, voted in January to give Boys Harbor
a $450,000 grant to help the conservatory preserve the collection
and transform it from a private archive to a public institution,
although the grant is still awaiting final approval from the city.
</P>
<P>
   That financing follows a 1998 zone grant of $125,000, which
allowed the Harbor to hire an appraiser to assess the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has also helped the cause by naming the
collection an ``American treasure,'' a designation by the Save
America's Treasures program that will help it receive recognition
and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Rodriguez, director of the Boys Harbor Conservatory, and
Louis Bauzo, director of its Latin percussion program, have long
been frustrated that the collection is now seen only by scholars
who make appointments to rummage through it. They have great
visions for a museum that they hope will eventually house the
material.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that museum is only a dream. The empowerment zone money
is only a small portion of the $36 million the Harbor must raise
either to renovate a building somewhere in East Harlem or to build
anew and have money left over for an endowment.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. The grant will enable Boys Harbor to
appoint Gladys Pena Acosta, a former curator for the city's Art
Commission, director and curator of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very, very detailed work,'' she said, ``and
the first step is to take it out of the closets and put it in a
situation where it's going to be safeguarded. It's an incredible
opportunity to come in and rescue these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry C. Lane, president and chief executive of the Upper
Manhattan Empowerment Zone, said the support was part of an effort
to promote ``heritage tourism,'' which he said is the growth sector
of the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   The collection and the hoped-for museum, Lane said, ``would be a
destination on upper Museum Mile,'' along with El Museo del Barrio,
the Museum of the City of New York and the Schomburg Center for
Research in Black Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Raices' collection may not be well known, but it was not for
lack of effort. Nina Olson, who has been the fund-raiser and
publicist for Raices for nine years, has written at least 50
requests for grants and financing, most of them rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've ever read that someone is interested in Latin music,
believe me they've gotten a letter,'' she said. ``Avon, Coors,
Philip Morris, Herb Alpert, Rums of Puerto Rico, Bacardi Rum,
there's quite a list. I'm hoping now that somehow the declaration
of an American treasure and support I've gotten from the
empowerment zone will give it a kind of validity somehow that's
more inviting to funders.''
</P>
<P>
   A scholar who has plumbed the Raices collection said that there
is nothing else like it in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Raices gets a lot of support, it may be the foundation of
what would become the recognized national archive of East Coast
Latino music,'' said the scholar, Juan Flores, a professor of black
and Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College and a professor of
sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he added, the collection puts to rest the
notion that America's craze for Latin music began when Ry Cooder
visited Havana to resurrect the Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a surge in the popularity of Afro-Caribbean music
nationwide, spurred in part by the growing Hispanic population and
in part by the rise of a handful of mainstream music stars who have
Latin roots, like Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Although some would argue that these artists have little
connection to the Latin jazz pioneers like Machito, Mario Bauza or
Noro Morales, their popularity promotes an interest in the music's
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundations of salsa are unarguably in Cuba and the
capital of modern salsa is New York,'' wrote Sue Steward in her new
book, ``Musica!'' (Chronicle Books, 1999). The American Latin tinge
was born and raised in el Barrio, the South Bronx, Harlem and parts
of Brooklyn when Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican artists and
black jazz musicians mingled.
</P>
<P>
   The fusion began in the early 1920s when streams of immigrants
from Puerto Rico and a smaller group of immigrants from Cuba
arrived in Spanish Harlem, many toting instruments from their
homelands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bauza, the Cuban clarinetist and trumpeter who played in the Cab
Calloway orchestra with Gillespie in the 1930s, pulled together the
Afro-Cuban and American jazz traditions in 1940, when he became
musical director for Machito's Afro-Cuban orchestra. The brassy
power of this new swing music, Latin jazz, created the first major
mambo craze in America.
</P>
<P>
   The new music gained its greatest popularity during the
``Palladium age'' in the 1950s, when people of all ethnic groups
began to frequent the Palladium and other clubs to see performances
by artists like Machito, Puente, Tito Rodriguez, Beny More and Joe
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But it took years for the sound to get its modern-day name. At
some point in the early 1970s (scholars argue over the date), Fania
Records, an influential New York company known as the ``Latin
Motown,'' began to market Puerto Rican music infused with other
cultural elements as salsa, the Spanish word for sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Rodriguez and Bauzo began collecting salsa's artifacts
more than 20 years ago. Bauzo, an avowed pack rat, said it was a
silent process at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bring things in and he would store it,'' Bauzo said,
smiling at Rodriguez across a small rehearsal room on the
conservatory's fifth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Then the items started to pile up.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 5,000 Latin music LPs, many of which are
original pressings, including the entire personal collection of Al
Santiago, a renowned Latin record producer, 200 78s and 75 45s.
</P>
<P>
   The records are stacked haphazardly in a closet on the fifth
floor. Many have lost their sleeves or jackets and are marred by
scratches and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Items from the personal collection of Puente, the ``King of
Mambo,'' are scattered about the conservatory in rehearsal rooms,
classrooms and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Raices has 200 videos, including a tape of the last concert
Puente and the vocalist Santos Colon performed together, and rare
copies of Machito's orchestra performing in the 1940s. The first
conga drum of the composer and vocalist Miguelito Valdez, who was
sometimes called `` Babalu,'' is kept in a former utility closet.
Other instruments, badly in need of repair, hang by strings from
classroom ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Cardboard boxes are overflowing with tapes of interviews with 35
prominent Latin musicians, like the pianist and band leader Eddie
Palmieri, the percussionist Ray Barreto and Bauza, who was credited
by the jazz historian John Storm Roberts with creating the New York
Latin sound.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 photographs are beginning to discolor and crack in
their glass frames in the hallway. The rest of 10,000-piece photo
archive, including shots of Latin musicians, orchestras and
ensembles from the 1920s to the present, is either in plastic wrap
in closets or crammed into stuffed file drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Black loose-leaf binders bulge with all but three issues of
Latin New York magazine, the primary chronicler of the scene from
1970 to 1985. This is a more comprehensive set than that owned by
the New York Public Library, according to an appraisal completed
last year by Archival Music Collections, a Brooklyn company.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Carp, an archivist and librarian at the Milken Archive
of American Jewish Music in Manhattan, said that Raices is probably
the only archive of its kind that is not privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other archive that deals with the performing arts
in the Afro-Caribbean field,'' he said, ``and unfortunately I can
say that with some certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that much of its existing collection is
collecting dust, Raices' keepers are still looking for more
treasures. They fear that at any moment someone in New York could
be tossing a potentially vital piece for the collection into the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is still out there,'' Rodriguez said. ``More than with
any other type of music, so much has been lost. As a people, there
was never the notion to save anything about this culture. The music
was developed, used, given to the band, the band would rehearse it
and toss the sheet music. All the old arrangers never made copies,
the musicians certainly didn't make copies. Even when people did
keep it, the next generation wasn't interested.''

GORE CAPTURES DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Reinforced by the backing of Missouri's
Democratic elite and talk of the seemingly inevitable demise of his
opponent, Vice President Al Gore captured the Missouri presidential
primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who was a star athlete
and scholar at high school in Crystal City, Mo., failed to turn his
fading native son status into victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most people in the party really see Gore as the
person who can lead us to victory,'' said Jackson County Executive
Katheryn Shields, a supporter of the vice president. ``They think
he can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, Gore won 64 percent of the vote to 34 percent for
Bradley, a one-time professional basketball player, with 71 percent
of the precincts reporting. The precise delegate split won't be
determined until the party works through a series of meetings that
wind up in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson, Clay, Platte and Cass counties, Gore was beating
Bradley by nearly 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that lacking significant differences on policy _
Bradley and Gore want tougher gun control, broader health-care
coverage and an end to racial profiling _ voters saw little reason
to bank on an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Missouri was an afterthought in the most decisive
day to date in the presidential campaign. Missouri promises just 92
Democratic delegates (including 17 chosen without regard to the
popular vote) while Ohio, New York and California held 170, 294 and
434, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a great incentive for people to turn out here,''
said Woody Overton, who ran then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's
Missouri campaign in 1992. ``Missouri's just not a player on Super
Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made a strategic move by challenging Gore in Iowa's
caucuses, where overcoming the might of organized labor and the
endorsement of Sen. Tom Harkin proved too difficult, Overton said.
And, he said, perceptions began to build that Bradley couldn't
overcome the political clout of the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when he lost in the New Hampshire primary it only got
worse,'' Overton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters meeting at Kansas City's Union Station as the
results trickled in took some solace in their candidate's forcing
issues such as racial justice into the campaign. They blamed the
primary losses on timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley was on fire a few months ago and he was the star of
the media,'' said Mary Ellen Miller, a former labor union
president. ``Then McCain got hot and the media ended up paying all
the attention to the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Bassa, a University of Missouri-Kansas City professor,
said he hopes Bradley stays in the race even if his chances of the
nomination have badly faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to raise the issues that determine what people talk
about in the campaign,'' Bassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling conducted by The Associated Press and Voter News
Service also found many independents forsaking the Democratic
primary to support McCain in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   Of those voters in the Democratic primaries who chose Gore,
about eight in 10 approved of the job President Clinton has done.
But the Democratic voters were nearly evenly split on their opinion
of Clinton as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dominated Bradley in virtually every subgroup. Bradley was
slightly favored by Missouri Democrats with post-graduate degrees,
but that group made up only about a quarter of all voters. Among
those with college degrees, the vote was about evenly split.
</P>
<P>
   Nine in 10 Democrats favor Gore over Bush, but only seven in 10
favor Gore over McCain. In fact, eight in 10 Democrats had an
unfavorable opinion of Bush. A majority of Democrats had a
favorable opinion of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor and Gore backer Claire McCaskill said the results
in Missouri mimic the change in the national Democratic race. Where
polls late last year showed Gore in trouble, he has since rebounded
in popularity and a newly assertive and flexible campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on,'' she said, ``before Gore started asserting himself
as a distinct personality, I would have said it would be a
barn-burner in Missouri.''

SINGING DYLAN'S WORDS TO A DIFFERENT TUNE

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12)  
 (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bob Dylan was an acerbic young folk singer warning that the
times were a-changin', one change he probably did not envision was
that he would become a darling of the high-art world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last fall, nearly 40 years after he made his first records,
Dylan was declared one of the greatest artists of the 20th century
by Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate. And now the composer
John Corigliano, commissioned to write a song cycle for the soprano
Sylvia McNair's Carnegie Hall recital on Wednesday evening, has
produced `` Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan,'' a 35-minute
song cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano, a composer known for his accessibly melodic style,
has not merely spiffed up Dylan's music with a high-toned crossover
accompaniment. He insists, in fact, however implausibly, that he
has never heard Dylan's music. Rather, he selected a group of
lyrics from a collection of Dylan's work and treated them as he
would anyone else's poetry: he set them as he felt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I may have heard them in the background and not
focused on them,'' said Corigliano, 62, who was in his 20s in the
1960s when Dylan came to prominence and when Joan Baez, Peter, Paul
and Mary, the Byrds and Manfred Mann recorded hit versions of his
songs. ``That was when I was getting my skills in the contemporary
orchestral repertory. I was listening to late Stravinsky and
Penderecki. I knew show music. I knew Rodgers and Hammerstein. But
I didn't really listen to much rock music. I heard the Beatles, who
were fascinating because of what they were doing musically, and I'm
not saying I wouldn't have found Dylan fascinating had I turned my
attention to him. But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Corigliano maintains that this gap in his musical experience
allowed him to encounter Dylan's lyrics uninfluenced by the
songwriter's own ideas. Once he decided to write the cycle, he went
out of his way to avoid Dylan's music. When McNair started to sing
``Blowin' in the Wind'' for him at one point, he made her stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dylan first heard about this project, his response was,
`Well, this is how they go; it's done,''' said Corigliano, who did
not speak to Dylan directly but negotiated for permission to use
the lyrics through Dylan's manager, Jeff Rosen. ``And the way I put
it was, `Wouldn't you be curious to see what someone with no
musical preconceptions, who comes from a completely different world
from yours, would do with poetry of yours that he finds moving and
beautiful?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not like what I've done. I'm not sure he will. But if
the poetry is good, it can stand it, just as a poem by Goethe can
stand different settings by Schumann, Brahms or Wolf. And I think
it (italics)is(end italics) good, otherwise I wouldn't have set
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Dylan agreed to the project is unknown. He did not
respond to a question faxed through his publicity agent, and Rosen
refused to comment. But Corigliano and McNair jumped through a few
hoops to obtain Dylan's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of collecting of credentials about a year
ago,'' McNair said recently. ``We had to list the Grammys we had
each won, and all the cities in the United States and Europe where
the songs would be performed. We had to prove we were the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference between Goethe and Dylan, of course, is that Goethe
wrote his poetry as poetry, with little concern about whether it
would be set to music. Dylan's songs were written as songs, and
their words are fitted closely to their melodies. Corigliano
rejects this distinction as too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, maybe Dylan bought Corigliano's Goethe argument. Or
maybe he was just curious.
</P>
<P>
   What he will hear, if he listens to the cycle, is the difference
between his directness and Corigliano's artfulness. In place of the
simple, flowing melody that listeners associate with ``Blowin' in
the Wind,'' for example, Corigliano has written a highly chromatic
setting, marked ``solemn'' in the score, and mostly in the lopsided
meter of five beats to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes Line,'' originally in a blues form edged with Dylan's
wry humor, is now a complex structure in which the time signature
changes almost every bar, and the dialogue within the song has been
marked ``him'' and ``her'' and set in corresponding ranges.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is music for virtuoso performers. The vocal line has leaps of
a 12th (an octave and a half) in either direction. The pianist
(Martin Katz, at McNair's recital) has a tough job, too. He is
asked to create overtone effects to suggest bells in ``Chimes of
Freedom'' and to play a brisk accompaniment for `` Tambourine Man''
in which the right hand plays in the key of F sharp and the left in
the key of C.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the score, a few weeks ago,'' McNair said, ``I
thought, `Why me?' There are some very, very difficult things in
this song cycle. There are huge melodic leaps, which I always find
difficult. And keeping track of the meter changes _ there are
places where the meter changes 6, 8, 10 times per page. I've had to
learn to sing a tritone as easily as a whole step, and a minor
ninth as easily as an octave. But your ears get used to it, and it
becomes simpler after a while. And as a musician, I'm in awe of the
architecture of this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carnegie Hall invited Corigliano to write a song cycle for
McNair, he did not have any text ideas in mind. In fact, when the
New York Philharmonic commissioned him around the same time to
write a work for the ``Messages for the Millennium'' series it was
to present last November, he wrote the wordless ``Vocalise,'' in
which McNair was also the soloist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' he said. ``I'll be reading poems I like, and
one word or phrase will seem clumsy or unsettable, and will ruin it
for me. So I've not been able to set many poets.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's one request here was that Corigliano set works by an
American poet, and on a whim, he bought a book of Dylan's work, It
was a surprise to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up with the idea of setting Dylan on his own,'' she
said. ``Originally, we were going to bat ideas about texts back and
forth, and we did that a bit. Then the next thing I knew, he had a
big book of Dylan's lyrics and was trying to get permission to set
some of them. I thought that was great. I'm realizing _ finally, in
my early 40s _ that Bob Dylan has been one of the great thinkers of
my lifetime. I read these poems over and over, and I am
fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano, who typically works out a structural plan for his
compositions before he begins writing the music, originally chose
more than a dozen lyrics, then narrowed them to seven that fell
into what he considered a logical order: `` Tambourine Man'' is a
prelude of sorts, and ``Clothes Line'' struck him as a charmingly
innocent foil for the more worldly wise ``Blowin' in the Wind.''
``Masters of War'' and ``All Along the Watchtower'' represent
political fury and an apocalyptic view of the future, after which
``Chimes of Freedom'' and ``Forever Young'' offer a brighter vision
and a closing benediction.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano sent his final revisions to McNair only three weeks
ago, and he is about to take a break before transforming his String
Quartet into his Second Symphony, for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, between this and `Vocalise,' I've spent the last
year and a half writing for Sylvia,'' he said. ``Sylvia, Sylvia,
Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he should write her an encore. After all, there is an
excerpt from Shakespeare's ``Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' famous as a
Schubert song, ``An Silvia'' (``Who Is Sylvia?''), that is surely
due for a new setting.

IT'S ALL GORE AS BRADLEY TAKES BEATING FROM COAST TO COAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore swept the Super Tuesday primaries,
crushing rival Bill Bradley from Maine to California and forcing
him to begin planning an exit from the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley withdraws, a prospect his aides did not dismiss late
Tuesday, Gore will emerge as the first candidate since World War II
to win a contested Democratic presidential nomination without
losing a single state primary.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his attention late Tuesday to the November general
election, Gore began trying to unify the Democratic Party,
appealing to liberals and independents who supported Bradley's
insurgent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout his
campaign has come away from the experience moved and touched by the
strength of his commitment to healing the divisions in our
country,'' said the vice president, who vigorously attacked the
former New Jersey senator in campaign debates and television
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reach out to all who believe that this is a time for
great progress, for great reforms, for an America of tolerance and
high ideals,'' Gore said at a victory rally in Nashville, Tenn.
``We need to build on our record of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the polls closed in the East, Bradley aides put his
campaign on hold and said the former New Jersey senator would
announce Thursday whether his campaign will continue.
</P>
<P>
   When he appeared at New York's Sheraton Hotel to concede the
Super Tuesday primaries, Bradley all but conceded that he would
pull out and only spoke of his campaign in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe history will write that we tried to change politics,
to restore trust and to defeat the politics of expediency,''
Bradley said. ``We shaped the national debate. We brought core
Democratic issues to the fore. We gave voice to the voiceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has yet to win a primary contest against Gore, set
Tuesday as the day he would have to break through and win in at
least two states. Short of that, he said, continuing to challenge
Gore would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be dropping out this evening,'' said Eric Hauser,
Bradley's campaign spokesman. He added that the campaign early
Wednesday ``will put out a paper and announcement explaining what
we plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst news of the evening for Bradley was his weak
showing in New York, where he spent five of the past six days
campaigning. Exit polls showed Bradley, a former player on the New
York Knicks basketball team and a former senator from neighboring
New Jersey, trailing Gore 2-1 in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns also showed Gore winning by wide margins in
Georgia, Vermont, Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland,
Maine, Rhode Island and Missouri, the state where Bradley was born
and raised.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls not only show Gore overwhelming Bradley in other
Super Tuesday states, the surveys by Voter News Service found the
vice president to be the favorite of key Democratic constituencies;
black and Hispanic voters by an 8-1 margin, labor households by
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found the vice president, who was backed by most
organized labor groups, running stronger than Bradley among the
party's liberals and conservatives. Among women, Gore was backed in
some states by more than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In more good news for the vice president, a Wall Street Journal
poll showed him tied with likely Republican nominee George W. Bush
with 46 percent apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore could effectively clinch the Democratic nomination
if Bradley withdraws, the vice president will be short of the 2,170
delegates needed to officially claim the party's nomination until
at least next Tuesday, by which time another 13 states, including
Texas, will have held presidential primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday's primaries, Gore had won 1,005 delegates to
280 for Bradley, according to unofficial counts. At stake Tuesday
were 1,315 delegates, which will be awarded based on the
candidates' proportional share of the states' primary results.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, Gore will face a Republican opponent
scarred by the GOP's roughest primary campaign since 1976, when
President Ford fended off conservative insurgent Ronald Reagan in a
fight that went all the way to the party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's cross-country primaries, Gore had been
looking beyond the primaries, no longer criticizing Bradley,
instead beginning his attacks on Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain,
the only other Republican with a chance for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley's challenge from the political left unable to shake
Gore's image as a centrist, he is expected to have a slight edge on
issues important to voters. On subjects such as gun control, health
care or Social Security, polls show that a majority of Americans
favor the approach taken by Gore and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore comes out of these primaries as very much someone who
represents the mainstream values of the American people,'' said Bob
Schrum, a consultant with the Gore campaign. ``By contrast, Bush is
a different candidate than he was six or seven months ago. He had
to move to the right if he was to get the Republican nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   As he turns toward the fall campaign, Gore is expected to wrap
himself in the mantel of a de facto incumbent, which carries with
it two key advantages _ a world at peace and a country with
unparalleled economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore carries several weaknesses into the
general election, even without a foreign-policy crisis or an
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to remind voters of his involvement in
the Democratic Party's 1996 fund-raising scandals. One of his
allies, Maria Hsia, last week was convicted for 1996 campaign
finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   Voters can expect to see Republican-financed campaign ads
showing Gore enthusiastically praising President Clinton on the day
he was impeached.

2 VICTORS, REDEFINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS  
 (EDS: TIGHTENS LEAD, MOVING SOME ANALYTICAL MATTER TO 2ND GRAF; 8TH
AND 9TH GRAFS INJECTS ASSESSMENT OF MCCAIN'S POSITION)
</HEADLINE>
   (jt) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year of remarkable political tumult, both parties ended
up back where they began Tuesday, with the presumptive presidential
nominees they had expected all along.
</P>
<P>
   But there were important differences. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, most politicians believe, emerged from the campaign a weaker
candidate than he began it, scuffed by the attacks of his rival,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and with a party dangerously split
between conservatives and moderates. He has yet to prove he can
appeal to voters in the vital electoral center.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, on the other hand, emerged as a
stronger, more vivid campaigner, and stands at the head of a much
more united party.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush assured himself of the nomination
by defeating or contending closely with McCain everywhere except
New England, a region as out of step with the rest of the country
in 2000 as the South was a half-century ago. And even in New
England, McCain had to yield Maine, where the Bush family has spent
summers for generations.
</P>
<P>
   After the closest approximation the nation has ever had to a
national primary, Gore and Bush both made a victory speeches
looking to the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What came before Tuesday was mere skirmishing. If not quite
McCain's Appomattox, the Super Tuesday voting seemed certain to
prove his Gettysburg. The extremely wide lead seized by Bush in the
delegate count gave him a commanding position at the campaign's
most significant moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the governor can look forward with confidence to a day, next
Tuesday, when his own state as well as Florida, where his brother,
Jeb, is the governor, choose their delegates. As they were in
Tuesday's Republican primary and caucus voting in 13 states, the
numbers at stake will be significant: Texas is the nation's
second-largest state and Florida is the fourth-largest.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he headed for his retreat at Sedona, north of
Phoenix, with the weight of self-interest seemingly favoring a
withdrawal. If he stays in the race for another week, facing long
odds, he might do little except win a reputation as a
party-wrecker. If he pulls out, he could accelerate the healing
process and enhance his chances of trying again four years from now
if Bush were defeated. McCain will be 68 in August, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCain's few backers in Congress, Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, said McCain had failed to get the ``rocket boost'' he
needed and would make a decision in a day or two on what to do
next. Hagel said his colleague ``won't put the party or country
through any high drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began the campaign as a heavy favorite. But he suffered
serious setbacks in New Hampshire and Michigan as McCain, running
as an outsider, mounted an unexpectedly potent insurgency, and he
veered sharply to the right in South Carolina in a successful
effort to head off the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush, who had originally presented himself as a
candidate who could appeal to all voters, regardless of party,
found himself redefined as a Republican partisan with little
backing among Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans,
without some of whom he would have scant chance in November.
</P>
<P>
   Again in Tuesday's balloting, Republicans voted heavily for Bush
while Democrats and independents voted for McCain. The pattern was
much the same as in each test since New Hampshire: who won in many
states depended heavily on the proportion of independents and
Democrats in the electorate. The more there were (as in
Massachusetts) the better McCain did; the fewer there were (as in
Ohio), the worse.
</P>
<P>
   If, as now seems highly likely, he moves on to win the
nomination, Bush will have to find a way to remedy this problem. He
has tried hard since South Carolina, without success; his senior
advisers are already deep in discussions about fresh notions of how
to renew his appeal to voters in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also began as a seeming shoo-in for the Democratic
presidential nomination, survived a patch so shaky that even some
of his staff members made fun of him. He moved his headquarters
from Washington to Nashville, to more derisive catcalls, and pulled
his ragged operation together with considerable skill.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he utterly humiliated his rival, former Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, who had looked for a time last year like the
freshest of political faces. Bradley lost on the Atlantic Coast, on
the Pacific coast and in between _ even in Missouri, where he grew
up, and in New York, where he won fame and fortune playing
basketball for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bravura performance by the vice president, if no longer
surprising in view of the near-collapse of Bradley's campaign in
recent weeks, and it positioned him well for the battle against the
eventual Republican nominee this fall, although perhaps situated
somewhat farther to the left on some key issues than he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Even on health care, which Bradley had made his signature issue,
most voters said they thought Gore had outlined a batter plan.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, the vice president praised Bradley in a bid
to create greater party unity. After praising the former senator's
``commitment to healing the divisions in our country, especially
divisions based on race,'' Gore said in Nashville: ``He believes in
this healing, heart and soul. I share his commitment to it. I have
learned from his passion for it. Tonight I salute Senator Bill
Bradley and Ernestine Bradley, his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a similar appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign for Bush came among Catholics. McCain sharply
criticized leaders of the Republican right in a speech in Virginia
late last month, hoping, according to aides, that Catholics and
others in northern states who resent Christian conservatives would
rally to him. But according to exit polls in Missouri and Ohio, in
each of which Catholics accounted for a quarter of the electorate,
Bush received half their votes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept intact a political pattern that went largely unnoticed
in the weeks when his reputation waned, then waxed once more. No
sitting vice president since World War II who sought the
presidential nomination has failed to gain it, except for Alben W.
Barkley of Kentucky, Harry Truman's number two, who attracted
little support in 1952, largely, it was said, because of his age.
He was then 74.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will no doubt be considered the favorite at first,
especially considering the blood-letting that has taken place in
the Republican primaries for the third campaign running, Gore faces
problems of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor, President Clinton, he has put tremendous effort
into courting the voters of California, and he has built a strong
following there. But in Tuesday's so-called beauty contest in the
Golden State, there was a small note of warning.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bradley together polled considerably fewer votes than
Bush and McCain together. That may have resulted in part from the
fact that the Republican campaign was the more gripping one, but it
also suggested that Gore has work to do.

 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the British artist Cornelia Parker.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ In a stage-worthy scene, the artists Richard
Artschwager, Daniel Buren, Sol LeWitt and Robert Ryman met here
recently to reveal the secret contents of four steel boxes they
individually filled and sealed 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These artists' time boxes, and the dramatic opening held at the
Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University on Feb. 24, are both part of
a quarter-century-long collaborative project initiated by another
artist, Stephen Antonakos. The boxes, their contents and a neon
installation by Antonakos will be displayed here through Sunday as
part of the museum's millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   None of this started out nearly as portentous as it turned out
to be. Antonakos was not thinking about the millennium in the early
'70s, nor did he foresee that museums everywhere would be looking
for special programs to mark the momentous turn of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years just seemed like a nice round number, and
2000, well, that was too far away to ever come,'' he says. But when
Joseph Ketner, the director of the Brandeis museum, heard about the
boxes from Antonakos, he thought opening them would be a perfect
salute to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The time-box project began when Antonakos, who is perhaps best
known for his meditative architectural spaces and neon
installations, began several series of ``package'' projects in
1971, all of them involving other people. On a fellowship in
Fresno, Calif., and feeling lonely for his New York City circle of
friends, he wrote to them requesting that they send him something,
anything, in a package.
</P>
<P>
   He received 87 parcels. A year later, he displayed them _ large,
small, variously shaped, but all still unwrapped _ in the gallery
at Fresno State College, where he was in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he admits he never intended to open the packages, and he
still does not, even though this frustrated many of the senders.
The parcels, too, are on display at the Rose, looking a bit
battered but still very tantalizing: an array of brown paper
packages tied up with string, tape, stickers, etc., bearing fading
return names like Art Works on T.V./Don Judd, Richard Tuttle, Rudy
Burckhardt, Dorothea Rockburne, Hans Haacke and Ray Johnson.
There's even one from Christo.
</P>
<P>
   Once Antonakos realized the emotional response a simple unopened
package could provoke, he also realized that their small,
mysterious, dark interiors were the inverse of the light-filled
spaces he created in his larger works. He decided to follow the
project with a return mailing, wrapping and sending his own
packages and pledging the recipients to honor his instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Some packages were marked to be opened on certain dates (which
have come and gone in some cases), others were to be opened upon
the death of Antonakos, still others were never to be opened.
</P>
<P>
   Antonakos says some things he sent were sketch books, or
collages, usually enclosed with a copy of that day's New York
Times. The contents are less important to him, though, than the
tension of waiting _ a mixture of anticipation and potential
disappointment _ along with the implied presence of the sender that
an unopened package can quietly emit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have displayed them for years on their wall,'' he
says. ``They tell me of their anxiety as the opening time comes.
Will they like what's inside? Will they like the way it looked
unopened better?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to cap his package projects, Antonakos found
four simple steel boxes, each about the size of an average
television, and had an idea. He approached four close friends,
Artschwager, Buren, LeWitt and Ryman, with a proposition: a
contractual agreement whereby each would fill a box, seal it, swear
to secrecy regarding its contents and agree to open it with him in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Artschwager said that when he received Antonakos' 1974 proposal,
he was inclined to think it might be tempting providence. ``I was
sure I'd never live to see its conclusion, that it would be a total
waste of time,'' he says. Did he remember what he had put inside?
``No. I forgot about the box entirely. At my age, I've dropped a
few things along the way _'' a wry smile ``_ it's the best kind of
security.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The use of time as an artistic dimension sprang from the late
'60s and early '70s when conceptualism was fresh. ``Time was one of
the many conceptual toys that came to the surface when Stephen,
some of the other people here and I were kicking around back
then,'' Artschwager said. ``It was kind of a cooperative venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has played its own tricks on the artists. Just before the
opening, LeWitt also said that he never thought he would see this
day, and that he had forgotten what he put in his box. ``I hope
it's not embarrassing,'' he said. ``Twenty-five years was too long
to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the French artist Daniel Buren, who flew in
from Paris to attend, said: ``I have a fresh memory of filling the
box. I am excited about it. I even wrote a letter in mid-1999 to
ask: `What's happening with our box? We are close to the
anniversary date.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even though in 1974 Antonakos had envisioned the opening to be a
private gathering of his friends, he was quite happy to share it
with a sold-out crowd of more than 250 people who came to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Following a piano concert by the composer Terry Riley, Ryman's
box was opened first. He was the only one to alter the box itself,
crisscrossing it with now-yellow masking tape that recalled the
texture of his variously white canvases. He explained: ``I wanted
there to be something on the outside as well as the inside, so the
box itself would be seen as a thing _ and also to keep anyone from
peeking.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside his box was a square wrapped in brown linen; inside the
linen was a small, framed glass palette, dominated by a swirl of
white paint. It was signed by Ryman and dated 1961.
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt's box was next. At first its white-painted interior
looked empty; then a tiny, one-inch white cube was discovered.
``The cube opens,'' said Antonakos, ``and there's a note inside the
lid.'' LeWitt asked what it said. `` `A line, not straight, corner
to corner, Sol LeWitt, Oct. 14, 1974,''' Antonakos read aloud.
``This must be Sol's smallest work.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Artschwager's box lay a nest of four skillfully made
plywood boxes, the lids of which required a rather tedious
unscrewing to reveal, finally, that the last and smallest box
contained nothing. These foreshadowed, perhaps, the artist's recent
series of packing-crate sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   It was Buren's box, though, that held the most poignant
surprise. In keeping with the spirit of the project, he had given
his box to yet another artist, Chris D'Arcangelo, who had been
Antonakos' studio assistant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arcangelo, who died in the early 1980s, had, in turn, paid
homage to Buren by painting the inside of the box with two wide red
stripes (narrower, though, than Buren's standard stripe of 8.7
centimeters or 3.4 inches). A letter inside the box from Buren,
dated June 1975, explained this exchange, and ended with this
salutation from the past: ``Best regards to you from New York and
... 25 years ago!''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that the contents of the boxes turned out to be
consistent with the work these four artists have gone on to
produce, Ketner said he had come to realize the contents were less
important than the time and space between the creation of the boxes
and the opening. ``It was the mystery, the wonder, the
anticipation, the waiting for discovery and all that preceded that
was the crux of the project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antonakos was just relieved that the waiting was over. ``It was
a tremendous responsibility, constantly wondering how this project
would end,'' he said. ``When you're young you only think about how
things will begin; you never think about how they will end. I'm
very happy, very gratified this has ended so beautifully.''

 McCAIN TOPS BUSH IN 4 OF 5 NEW ENGLAND STATES  
 (Eds.: Subs to include unofficial results, new quotes, other
revisions throughout)  
 (bl)

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ While the news looked grim Tuesday night for
Sen. John McCain in much of the country, he defeated Gov. George W.
Bush in 4 of 5 New England states holding primaries. The exception
was Maine, where the Bush family owns a summer home.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the Republican primaries in Massachusetts, Vermont,
Connecticut and Rhode Island, picking up a total of 88 delegates in
the region, according to unofficial results. Bush won Maine's 14
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing in New England was crucial to McCain's hopes of
keeping his presidential hopes alive, especially in light of his
projected losses in most states holding primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these victories, Tuesday's primaries also showed
McCain's enduring inability to capture votes from registered
Republicans. In three of his four victories _ in Massachusetts,
Vermont and Rhode Island _ he won big, by margins of 25 points or
more. But exit polls showed two-thirds of the voters who cast
ballots for McCain in Massachusetts, for example, were Democrats or
independents who changed registration to support him. Democrats and
independents also carried McCain in Vermont, where he captured just
45 percent of registered Republicans, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's narrow victory in Connecticut, home to a historically
moderate and independent electorate, came despite significant
efforts by Gov. John G. Rowland and every Republican lawmaker in
the state on behalf of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very intelligent, capable man. He has our interests at
heart,'' said Hope Whitehead, 78, a retired history teacher, after
she voted for McCain at the Davis Middle School in Guilford. ``He
wants to make big changes in the government, which is why the
Republican Party is not behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other McCain voters said they voted for him as a form of
protesting against Bush. ``I don't trust Bush, I don't like the way
he looks,'' said Fran, an Avon resident who did not want her last
name published. ``He strikes me as very arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he was disappointed in Bush's showing, but he
shrugged off its significance in the national campaign. ``I don't
mind losing a battle if we win the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was able to do well in Connecticut by appealing to
voters' desire for political reform and on the strength of his
image as a maverick. In recent weeks, thousands of Connecticut
voters throughout the state switched their party affiliations to
register as Republicans in time for Tuesday's primary. Exit polling
also suggested McCain won a majority of the state's large number of
Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   They also showed he drew much support in both Connecticut and
Massachusetts from former Democrats and Liberals who recently
switched to the Republican Party. McCain received less than half of
the votes from registered Republicans in both states.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said the turnout of
non-Republicans for McCain bodes well for Bush in the fall. ``I
think it shows dissatisfaction with the Democratic candidates,''
said Cellucci, who noted that the presidential primary showed the
largest turnout in state history.

STARS' GUY CARBONNEAU OUT 2-3 WEEKS WITH WRIST FRACTURE 
HEADLINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Stars center Guy Carbonneau has scored only two goals
since Jan. 20, but he has been indirectly responsible for many,
many more.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you think freed up Mike Modano to score or assist on 30
goals in the past 20 games?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the injuries we had this year, it was evident that we
needed me playing against the best lines and leave Mo a little bit
more free to do whatever he wants,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano had almost all the responsibility for checking the other
teams' top lines until Carbonneau volunteered. Now, someone else
will have to. At least, for two to three weeks. Carbonneau is
expected to miss at least that long with a hairline fracture of his
right wrist suffered Sunday against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The injury couldn't have been worse for the Stars if it had been
to Modano himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said players such as Carbonneau, who
play ``16-17 minutes a night and it's all five on five and killing
penalties...those players, I find as a coach, are more difficult to
replace than sometimes your skill players.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of trying do so will now fall to Aaron Gavey, Kirk
Muller and 20-year-old Roman Lyashenko, who Hitchcock said is being
groomed to one day take over the shutdown role.
</P>
<P>
   A trade for another defensive forward seems unlikely. The Stars
need scoring, and general manager Bob Gainey said Carbonneau's
injury wouldn't make the Stars rethink their strategy as the March
14 trading deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our info on Guy Carbonneau's injury is clearly that
he'll be back long before the playoffs and be ready to play,''
Gainey said. ``I think the number-one need for our team is that we
get healthy before the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said he'll be in a cast for two to three weeks at
which point X-rays will be taken to make sure the fracture is
healing properly. He'll then be suited for a playing cast that
he'll have to wear the rest of the season. He will likely need
surgery in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt, especially this time of year,'' Modano
said. ``This is the time of year Carbo thrives on as a player. This
is the part of the year that runs through his veins probably more
than any player on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau is one of ``those players.'' At 39, he's the oldest
player in the NHL, but his stats don't show it. He has played in 62
of the Stars' 66 games this season, doing all of the little things
and a few of the big ones that win hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest one probably is assuming the responsibility that
once fell to Modano of not allowing the Joe Sakics, Steve Yzermans
and Eric Lindros of the NHL to score. He has been good, too,
posting a plus-9 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing against the best lines all my career, but I
didn't have to score 30, 40, 50 goals,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano did, which is why Carbonneau said he talked to Hitchcock
earlier this season. The Stars weren't scoring. He said he'd handle
the shutdown role. Modano would have more time to score.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 42 games, Modano had 16 goals and 19 assists. In
the past 20, he has 15 goals and 15 assists. Only Calgary's Jarome
Iginla has more points in the recent span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's a lot easier out there than the first three or
four months were,'' Modano said. ``It was a real struggle mentally
and physically to play and to get motivated and get into the flow
of the year. But of late, I haven't found it very difficult to
play. Mentally and physically, this is the best I've felt in a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Carbonneau with a big, fat assist on that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars desperately needed scoring. All he did was free up
their best scorer to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I want it,'' Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three more weeks, and the Stars will be more than happy
to give it back to him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. John McCain was left Tuesday night facing an
agonizing decision: how long and how far to prolong a campaign that
has evolved over 14 months from an underrated candidacy into what
he calls his mission to transform the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   With his rival, Gov. George W. Bush, piling up delegates and
winning many key contests across the nation, including New York,
McCain Tuesday night did not tip his hand, congratulating Bush and
saying, ``we may meet again in primaries a few days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was evasive about what happens now to his candidacy, he
assured the crowd that ``our crusade continues tonight, tomorrow,
the next day, the day after that, and for as long as it takes to
restore America's confidence and pride in the practice and
institutions of our great democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He planned to fly Wednesday to his vacation retreat in
Cottonwood, in the Red Mountain region of his home state of
Arizona, to rest and consider his options, which range from an
immediate pullout this week after his heady 14-month ride, or a
last-stand forward toward the Illinois primary two weeks from now
or even beyond.
</P>
<P>
   He staff, meanwhile, also fought to keep up an undaunted
appearance, releasing a campaign schedule for Colorado and Illinois
for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the question was, to what end? For weeks McCain has argued
strenuously that he and not Bush was the one who would be his
party's strongest standard-bearer to defeat Vice President Al Gore,
because of the senator's suddenly discovered cross-over appeal to
independents and conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night left him lagging in delegates and with a
diminished ability to make that case, failing to meet his own
campaign's best case scenarios. While McCain swept most of New
England, he lost Maine. He won only a relative handful of delegates
in New York. The bellwether state of Ohio went strongly for Bush,
too, leaving McCain unable to say that his Michigan victory two
weeks ago signaled some larger appeal across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   And the all-important state of California looked like it could
well disappoint his hopes of winning the popular vote, with exit
polls suggesting that both Gore and Bush could come in ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has emphatically proclaimed the Republican party his home
and said he would support Bush should he become the Republican
nominee, even as he railed that Bush and his allies were trying to
win the presidency ``in the worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   But so bitter and personal has the struggle with Bush become
that not all of McCain's closest associates were willing to rule
out the possibility that the senator might yet, for all his
denials, follow the lead of his hero Theodore Roosevelt and make
some kind of third party bid.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Khachigian, McCain's senior adviser and California
coordinator, made a more traditional argument Tuesday night,
insisting that with McCain having won some delegates in New England
and New York ``the arithmetic is still open'' in the nomination
fight. While McCain was unlikely to fare well in the southern
primaries on March 14, Khachigian said there was ``still a lot of
opportunity out there'' in the states of Illinois, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   As much as McCain has proclaimed himself on a ``great crusade''
to create a more inclusive, reform-minded Republican Party, fewer
and fewer of his fellow Republicans have been willing to join him
as his campaign has become more aggressively critical of Republican
orthodoxy on tax cutting, on campaign finance law, and on its open
arms to leaders of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The senator himself made an elliptical allusion to the problem
at his last campaign stop in San Diego late Monday afternoon when
he gazed out at a rally in the Old Town section outside a Mexican
restaurant and spotted a woman waving a placard, ``Soccer moms for
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms for McCain,'' he called out. ``Up in Santa Clara
this morning we had carnivores for McCain. In Cleveland we had
Ukrainians for McCain.'' Then he burst out laughing, and added,
``I'm telling you we are assembling a coalition never seen before
in the history of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   All that he lacked was vast numbers of Republicans for McCain.
But Tuesday morning, as he continued to work the phone calling talk
radio host after talk radio host in New York and California, he
proclaimed his happiness at the independents he had brought to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked this kind of
prairie fire out there that's getting people involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans unaffiliated with McCain's campaign said that after
a spectacular showing in New Hampshire, the senator had lost his
way from the moment he delivered a defiant speech after his South
Carolina loss, attacking Bush as a fraud. In the last few weeks his
more uplifting themes of public service, patriotism and great
causes have been nearly drowned out by his appeals to regional and
class resentments.
</P>
<P>
   His closing tactic in the past few days had been to attack Bush
for the fact that a Texas family, which has been a big contributor
to the governor, had poured $2.5 million into last minute attack
ads against McCain. ``We ask Governor Bush to do what he refused to
do,'' he said at rallies across California on Monday, ``tell his
sleazy Texas buddies to stop these negative ads and take their
money back to Texas where it belongs and don't try to corrupt
American politics with your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said: ``The John McCain
people saw since South Carolina is not the same John McCain people
saw in New Hampshire. Disciplined aggressiveness is essential in
politics. Undisciplined aggressiveness gets you in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact one voter Tuesday, Harold Noyes, pastor of the
nondenominational Christian Community Church in Athens, Ga., voted
for Alan Keyes and complained, ``McCain has been kind of whining a
lot lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear whether McCain's fiery speech last week branding
Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, prominent leaders of the
Christian right, as ``agents of intolerance,'' did anything but
backfire against him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of voters in New York showed that those who said the
speech ``affected'' their vote _ about a third of the total
Republican vote _ went 3-to-1 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's aides said that members of the Christian right
would not have supported McCain anyway and that his speech was a
stand on principle, not a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a defining moment for our campaign,'' John Weaver,
McCain's political director, said. ``Our party is at a fork in the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver promised that no matter who wins the Republican
nomination, McCain and his supporters ``are not going to slip
quietly into the night.''

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES and B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nearly five weeks ago, when Gov. George W.
Bush's grip on the Republican presidential nomination looked
tenuous, he indulged in the most controversial symbolism of his
campaign and appeared at Bob Jones University, a conservative
Christian school in South Carolina that still barred interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, as the Texas governor basked in several key
victories that put him in what he clearly felt was a very different
position, he turned that symbolism inside out. He chose to be
introduced at his celebration here by a black female educator from
Houston, Phyllis C. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   More than any exit poll or tally of delegates, that change in
signals illustrated what really happened to Bush and his advisers
Tuesday. They pivoted from flattering the right to courting the
center, from nurturing their most reliable sources of electoral
strength to cultivating new supporters, from traditional tactics to
bolder plans.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they began their general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That shift was also reflected in Bush's speech. It not only
anticipated the nomination, relegating the Republican primary
contest to the past tense, but also sought to woo the independent
and moderate voters who liked Sen. John McCain and to allay any
concerns or speculation that McCain might have been a stronger foe
for Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans must expand our prosperity, and extend it to those
who still struggle,'' Bush said, sounding the centrist theme of
compassionate conservatism that was sometimes lost in his bitter
struggle against McCain. ``We must be a strong nation _ that also
cares for the weak and forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party of principle,'' Bush added. ``We must also be a
party of inclusion a party with a generous heart and an open
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also signaled that he was ready to take on Gore _ and that
he had already hammered out many of the battle lines for that
engagement _ by repeatedly mentioning the vice president and
unreservedly attacking the record of ``the Clinton-Gore
administration.'' That phrase, used like a mantra, tethered Gore
tightly to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is celebrating victory as well,'' Bush told hundreds
of cheering supporters at the Four Seasons hotel here. ``I
congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the
candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough
case to make in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House
where there is no controlling legal authority,'' Bush said, showing
at least one of the cards he planned to play. ``I will repair the
broken bonds of trust between Americans and their government.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, his advisers and his supporters, Tuesday night was
more than a sweet vindication of their tireless predictions that
the governor would win the nomination decisively and early, despite
the surprising potency of McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance to turn their attention in the direction they
had always wanted to: toward November and Gore. Although there had
been something akin to a superstition in the Bush campaign about
talking too extensively about the general election before the
primaries were won, aides were suddenly willing to talk Tuesday
about the need to widen the campaign's circle of advisers, bring
new allies onboard, plot the details of the convention in August
and coordinate efforts more closely with the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They re-evaluated Bush's upcoming travel schedule in the context
of what would be most helpful for the general election, not what
was necessary to secure the nomination, and the details of that
schedule betrayed no sense of urgency. Bush planned to spend most
of the next four days at home in Austin, off the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said that their firmer purchase on the
nomination would allow them, between now and the end of April, to
begin folding more fundraisers into Bush's plans. One aide said
that the campaign would raise another $5 million to $10 million
between now and the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   But, most important of all, Tuesday's results meant that Bush
could focus on the themes he would need and the weapons he would
use to prevail in November, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In various television interviews Tuesday night, Bush
acknowledged that reaching out to the independents and the
moderates who were courted so successfully by McCain was perhaps
the Bush campaign's first and most important order of business. Ms.
Hunter's presence was a clear indication of that.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush simultaneously sought to turn questions about any
repositioning he would have to do into critiques of Gore, and those
critiques demonstrated how Bush planned to go after Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change my message,'' he said at a midday news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some candidates, maybe Al Gore, feels like that's the
way to campaign _ you've got to keep changing message or changing
headquarters or changing suits.''
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Bush identified several issues that he
clearly felt he could address more forcefully and persuasively than
Gore, including strengthening the military, cutting taxes and
improving public education.
</P>
<P>
   But even more obvious, in both Bush's speech and his earlier
news conference, was that he planned to put character and ethics at
the forefront of his general election campaign, to tie Gore to the
moral lapses of Clinton and to invoke the vice president's widely
criticized actions in the course of raising funds for Clinton's
1996 reelection campaign. Bush's senior advisers confirmed this
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years is a long time, and eight years is enough,'' Bush
told supporters, who frequently broke into the chant, ``No more
Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready, and I believe our country is ready, to return
exiled honor to the White House,'' Bush said.

GROSCOST HAS TOBACCO FUND PLAN

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Speaker of the House Jeff Groscost on Tuesday, March 7,
unveiled a plan to spend Arizona's $3.1 billion tobacco settlement
on schools, teacher pay raises and fighting disease.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by House leadership, the plan would pay for a $1,000
salary boost for teachers, raise $600 million to help fix
dilapidated schools through the Students FIRST program and set up
programs to help people quit smoking and fight cancer and
Alzheimer's disease. It would also repay the state's ``rainy day''
fund for construction of the state hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seems to contradict Gov. Jane Hull's wishes to focus
the tobacco money on health care, specifically mental health,
helping the uninsured, and children's health programs. Hull also is
exploring a plan to sell the settlement risk in exchange for $1
billion up front. The money would be invested and interest would be
used to solve health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Brenda Burns also favors putting the money into
a trust, but has also added education to health care as a major
issue to address.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Groscost said that his plan could
accommodate Hull's wishes, and that he is willing to explore
securing a portion of the bond money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a conflicting proposal,'' Groscost spokesman Paul
Senseman said Tuesday, March 7. ``We still believe we can pull
together a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is working on a tobacco plan to counteract two
initiatives on the Nov. 7 ballot that would restrict the money to
only health-related programs such as insurance for the working poor
and preventative care for children. &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12)  
 (af)  
 By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Trout came out of a cold drizzle and into a
nearly deserted midtown restaurant the other day, ordered a bowl of
risotto and a glass of red wine and began to chat amiably, almost
shyly, about broadcasting, cab driving and Warren G. Harding. Trout
is 90, and while osteoporosis has bent his back and skewed his
sense of balance, he is still the very model of the suave, modern
anchorman. And still very much in demand.
</P>
<P>
   After living in Madrid for two decades, he ``pitched up in New
York about four years ago,'' said his friend Peter Jennings, the
ABC newsman, and took a small apartment in the West 50s. The move
came after the death of his wife, Kit, by all accounts a vivacious
woman whom he adored during a marriage of almost 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   And while he maintains the Madrid residence _ he plans to go
back next month _ he was coy about why he would be hanging around
during a New York winter when Spain beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy,'' he said, suppressing a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He was indisputably dapper in a three-piece herringbone suit
from his London tailor, Anderson &AMP; Sheppard. (``Ed Murrow took me
there when I got to London during the war.'') The thin, trademark
mustache he grew in the 1930s to make himself look older is still
there, though gray. But the voice _ the rolling baritone, with its
sense of droll self-deprecation _ is undiminished in strength or
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   It is vintage Trout, worrying to this day that he could be
accused of mumbling. In the hands of a less elegant broadcaster,
such drollness can be a fumbled card trick. Conveyed by the
famously unassuming Trout, it is a moment of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   As millennium fervor ignited an interest in the past, Trout
returned more and more to the microphone he never really abandoned,
in a career that appears to have no retirement clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure whether I'm retired or not,'' he said. ``I guess
I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he and his reporting have been rediscovered through the
abiding interest of the news business in marking anniversaries:
coronations (King George VI, 1937), presidential nominating
conventions (all but one between 1936 and 1996) and wars. As
Jennings said: ``I can never overcome my sense of awe that he has
seen nearly a third of America's political history.''
</P>
<P>
   On the air again, notably on public radio, Trout is still
reporting the news _ not the breaking news of the day but extended,
scripted commentary on the news that broke during his watch decades
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Typical is a recent essay for National Public Radio's ``All
Things Considered,'' in which Trout, who has rarely been at a loss
for words, wryly acknowledged that sometimes he did not have all
the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could reach into an archive somewhere and retrieve
the dramatic moment when I interrupted an evening's entertainment
to announce the onset of McCarthyism,'' he intoned in a preamble on
the red scare. ``It would seem that a moment of such consequence
should exist. But I'm afraid that those of us who pursued
politicians with intent to commit journalism missed this story
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching back a half century to Wheeling, W.Va., and to a
largely unnoticed speech, Trout tried to account for the rise of an
obscure first-term senator named Joseph R. McCarthy. It was in
Wheeling, in February 1950, that McCarthy sounded one of his
earliest unsubstantiated alarms about a government teeming with
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a word of copy about McCarthy or Wheeling that
week, nor would I have expected to,'' Trout said. ``McCarthy's name
rarely made news.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout is perhaps best known for his many years at CBS, which in
the 1930s and '40s fielded the unparalleled team of broadcast
reporters that admirers would come to call Murrow's Boys, for the
network's chief European correspondent, Edward R. Murrow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The names are still familiar to generations of listeners and
viewers: William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Howard K. Smith, Richard
C. Hottelet, Winston Burdette, Charles Collingwood and Robert
Trout.
</P>
<P>
   Murrow and, later, Walter Cronkite would become synonymous with
the CBS brand, but Trout, a master of extemporaneous commentary, is
often acknowledged as having paved the way. Most broadcasters
credit him with creating and perfecting the role of anchorman at a
time when CBS itself was inventing the business of broadcast news.
</P>
<P>
   The moment came in March 1938, when the network produced its
first ``World News Roundup,'' with Trout in New York introducing
live reports from Paris, Rome, Berlin and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Trout moved briefly to NBC in the late '40s, then returned to
CBS. He began reporting for ABC in the late 1970s. In the last
decade, he has collaborated frequently with John McDonough, a
writer, independent producer and news archivist in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had acquired a set of transcription recordings covering the
first 36 hours of broadcast D-Day coverage, the first eight or nine
hours of which were anchored by Bob,'' McDonough said. ``It was a
masterpiece of broadcasting, utterly contemporary in style and
tone, and the first time an emergency had taken over the air
totally.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McDonough produced four hourlong documentaries, ``When
Conventions Were Conventions, With Robert Trout,'' for Public Radio
International. The programs caught the attention of another Trout
admirer, Art Silverman, senior producer of ``All Things
Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard them at home,'' Silverman said, ``and I got in touch
with John and said, `Is there anything you can do for
(italics)us(end italics?'''
</P>
<P>
   As a political reporter, Trout had a distinct home-field
advantage, having grown up in Washington, where his father owned a
shoe store. His political indoctrination came unusually early. At
age 7, he attended Woodrow Wilson's second inaugural in March 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the attraction for me was the parade,'' he said.
``The big feature was always the remnants of the Civil War. They
had a float with the Blue and Gray shaking hands. Everything was
horse-drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s, Trout had graduated from Central High School
(``I got G's, for good. I was lazy''), worked one summer on the
liner President Roosevelt between New York and Bremerhaven and
earned rent money by driving a cab and jerking soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this vague, romantic idea that I wanted to be a
writer,'' he said. ``I thought getting experience was the way to
get material.'' Which is why Trout answered an ad in The Washington
Evening Star for a piano player (although he could not play) at
WJSV, a small radio station just across the Potomac in Alexandria,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   After a few false starts and more taxi driving, Trout went on
the air, officially, in October 1931. The following year, the
fledgling Columbia Broadcasting System, in search of a Washington
license, acquired WJSV _ and Robert Trout.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, he and Franklin D. Roosevelt attended their first
presidential inaugural. FDR sat in an open car heading toward the
Capitol; Trout stood on the roof of the Willard Hotel describing
the pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the assignment, Trout was reminded of an earlier
inaugural, that of Warren G. Harding, whose presidency ended with
his sudden death in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Harding was the first president who went to the
Capitol for the ceremony in an automobile,'' he said. ``From then
on, it was all downhill.''
