<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Expects Bumper Harvest of Cloves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar is expecting a
bumper cloves harvest of 10,000 tons this year amid the rising of
local production prices, Minister for Trade, Industries and
Marketing Khamis Mussa said in Zanzibar Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mussa told the House of Representatives that preparations by
the government to buy all the cloves have been well underway,
including opening a purchase center in every village especially in
Pemba where the spice is mainly grown.
</P>
<P>
Preparations also included availability of picking tools such
as mats, ropes, hurricane lamps and gunny bags.
</P>
<P>
"We are now just awaiting for the picking season to begin next
month," Mussa said, adding that the government has planned to
borrow loans from the People's Bank of Zanzibar to buy the spice
from growers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the producer prices were raised to encourage
the growers to pick the spice.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of first grade cloves will be 450 Tanzanian
shillings (one U. S. dollar equals some 710 shillings) up from 320
shillings.
</P>
<P>
Despite suffering low prices in the world market, the cloves
remain the prime cash crop accounting for more than 44 percent of
the islands' gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Unremitting War against Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said on Friday that the war against drug abuse and illicit
trafficking "is far from won".
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the International Day
against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking which falls on June 26,
he said the United Nations is the most suitable instrument for
waging this war.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the global implications and cross-border
nature of the scourge, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although tangible progress has been made in the fight, with
demand and supply of dangerous drugs markedly reduced, the fact
remains that between 3 and 4 percent of the world's population
still regularly consumes illegal substances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug use is still one the leading causes of the
spread of AIDS, with devastating consequences across the globe,
and the consumption of some new drugs is increasingly widespread,
especially among young people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Criminal organizations are also taking advantage of
globalization and technological advances in transport and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Drugs continue "to destroy far too many human lives" and the
U.N. will continue to join global forces to put an end to the
calamity of drug abuse, said Annan.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Stresses Preventive Education on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government pays much
attention to the preventive education on drugs, the official Ghana
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a consistent drug preventive education in all
spheres of our lives aimed at educating, in particular, parents,
law enforcement personnel and the youth on the harmful effects and
dangers inherent in drug abuse," Ghanaian Education Minister Ekwow
Spio-Garbrah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a function marking the 13th
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in
Accra Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spio-Garbrah said if the legal, social and economic problems
are well- explained and advice on alternatives to drugs are given
to the youth who are predominant users, they would be careful of
drug dealers who would want to entice them into drugs.
</P>
<P>
"That knowledge would also equip them with skills to identify
drug dealers and drug dealing as destructive nation-wrecking evils
and to expose drug dealing and drug dealers in society," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the future of any nation depends on the youth
but the pressures of modern life have exposed them to ravages with
an attendant lack of parental control.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Ghanaian musicians, songwriters and producers
to incorporate anti-drug information in their lyrics and
promotional messages.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritrean War Resumes After One-Week Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Ethiopia and
Eritrea resumed at the Mereb-Setit front Friday after a one-week
lull in hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of Africa neighbors accused each other of
initiating offensive and both claimed to have an upper hand over
the other during the last round of fighting from June 9 to June
17.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in Asmara that Ethiopia
Friday morning opened a new attack on the right flank of the
Mereb-Setit front.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted in its press release that its forces killed
or wounded more than 18,000 Ethiopian soldiers during the
week-long fighting and also destroyed four Mig-23 fighter planes
and a Mi-35 helicopter gunship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Office of the Ethiopian Government Spokesperson
said in Addis Ababa that the Eritrean army initiated an offensive
at the Mereb River "once again" Friday.
</P>
<P>
The office noted in its press release that the Ethiopian troops
had put 24,450 Eritrean soldiers out of action in the border
battles one week ago.
</P>
<P>
War between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in early May 1998
along their 1,000-kilometer border.
</P>
<P>
Although both countries have agreed to the peace framework put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), there is in
sight no immediate resolution to the 13-month conflict.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Air Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday condemned the Israeli
attacks on Lebanon that caused death and injuries of civilians
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the attacks represented the belligerent and
aggressive spirit of the Israeli regime in the region, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched large-scale air strikes on Lebanon since
Thursday night to avenge the Katyusha rocket attacks on its
northern areas by the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people have reportedly been killed and 60
others injured in the attacks. Deploring the death and injury
of innocent civilians in Lebanon, he said that the powers
which supply Israel with the latest in armament are also
responsible for those crimes.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also called on the Muslim nations and
responsible international authorities to pressurize Israel to
abandon criminal perpetration in the future.
</P>
<P>
The recent blitz bombings on Lebanon were also evidence
that the Israeli regime is not committed even to the
documents and pledges that it has signed, he said.

LONDON,June 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced on Friday that it
had decided to send its ambassador back to Sudan and to resume
normal relations with the African country.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to announce that we have agreed to the return
of British and Sudanese staff to (the capital city of Sudan)
Khartoum and London, to carry out the work necessary for a full
normalization of relations," the Foreign Office said in a
statement which had been agreed on by Britain and Sudan.
</P>

"The resumption of normal relations opens a new page of better
understanding on global and bilateral issues, which will be built
on mutual interest, co-operation and respect," the statement said.

Britain announced a temporary withdrawal of all UK-based staff

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Ask Israel to Compensate for Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government is expected to
take legal measures to ask for Israeli compensation for the huge
losses inflicted on Lebanon's infrastructure in the Israeli
biggest air blitz on the country since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Anwar Khalil made the
announcement Friday following an emergency cabinet meeting under
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held hours after Israel launched the bloodiest
offensive on Lebanon since the 1996 "Grapes of Wrath" which killed
at least 240 Lebanese, most of whom are civilians.
</P>
<P>
During the air blitz from Thursday night till Friday dawn,
Israeli warplanes hammered Lebanon's power stations,
telecommunication center and road networks in Beirut, eastern and
southern Lebanese areas.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight Lebanese, most of them civil defense workers,
were killed and 64 others wounded in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"President Lahoud ordered ministers concerned to speed up the
repair of damaged infrastructure and let it to be open soon
for residents," Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
He added Lahoud also asked the government to take legal
measures to demand compensation from Israel for the huge losses
caused by its attacks.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of Jamhour and Bsaleem power plants, both
on a hill overlooking Beirut, plunged many residential
neighborhoods of Beirut and Lebanon's central mountain into
total darkness at the moment.
</P>
<P>
At present, power is being rationed for the capital and
its environs at a six-in-six-out hourly rate.
</P>
<P>
Three bridges linking Beirut and Lebanon's southern biggest
port city of Sidon were also destroyed in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports by Lebanon's state-run electricity company said
the Israeli latest blast caused at least 30 million U.S. dollars
in losses.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government is going to file complaints with the
April Understanding Monitoring Group against Israeli aggression on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising representatives from the U.S., France,
Syria, Israel and Lebanon, was established to monitor the
implementation of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire agreement reached
between Lebanon and Israel after the 1996 Israeli blitz.
</P>
<P>
The deal bars any attacks on civilians or from civilian areas
on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed its strike on Lebanon's infrastructure came in
response to Hezbollah's rocket attacks on northern Israel Thursday
night, killing two Israelis and wounding 12 others.
</P>
<P>
But, Hezbollah said in return that its cross-border bombing
served as retaliation for the wounding of six Lebanese civilians
by Israeli forces in the past five days.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
on a daily basis in a bid to oust Israeli forces and its
proxy South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Sue Israel Over Air Raids: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
said Friday his country would sue Israel before the International
Court of Justice (ICJ) and claim compensations for the damage
resulting from Israel's air strikes against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said at an emergency cabinet meeting that his country
would not bow to the Israeli aggression and would confront it with
the weapon of unity and the resistance option.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud asked the cabinet ministers to speed up the revamp works
of power facilities, bridges and roads that were hit by the
Israeli attacks which began late Thursday and ran into the early
hours of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Salim Hoss told the cabinet that
Israel was once again showing its savagery and the mask of
moderation of the new leadership fell along with the hopes for the
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak had pledged to withdraw
its troops from south Lebanon within one year during his May
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will stand firm and stick to its rights and dignity as
well as the unity between the Lebanese and the Syrian tracks of
talks with Israel, Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Anwar Khalil said that Lebanon had told
its ambassadors in Washington and New York to brief the United
States and the United Nations Security Council on the Israeli
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Lahoud's refusal to raise the issue to the
U.N. Security Council, Khalil said Lebanon would not seek a
Security Council resolution as it had already had the resolution
No. 425 that was in no need of revision.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of resorting to "the April understanding
committee" in dealing with such a largest scale aggression since
1996, Khalil said the committee was the best available means to
Lebanon at present to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon would stick to the committee despite the Israeli
attempts to undermine it, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
Israel reached an understanding in April 1996 after an Israeli
16-day onslaught on Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered agreement bars any attacks on civilians or
from civilian area on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
As for the possibility of stopping the Israeli attacks, he said
Lebanon was fully aware that there were no limits to the attacks,
which were claimed to be launched by Israel in response to the
cross-border rocket attacks earlier by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Israel said the decision to launch
the recent attacks was made by outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak was
informed of its ten minutes after the air raids in operation.
</P>
<P>
Khalil said his government had contacted some friendly nations
to expedite the repair works and received confirmation from Syrian
Minister of Electricity Munib Saem al-Dahr that all the potentials
of his country were at Lebanon's disposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
South Lebanon Army out of the country.

Council demand Wednesday for immediate and unconditional
cease-fire between the two Horn of African nations.
</P>
<P>
From June 10 to 16, the two countries were confronted in border
battles along the central flank of the same front.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said its forces killed or wounded more than 18,000
Ethiopian soldiers during the week-long fighting and also
destroyed four Mig-23 fighter planes and a helicopter gun ship.
</P>
<P>
While Ethiopia claimed that its troops had put 21,000 Eritrean
soldiers out of action in the border battles.
</P>
<P>
War between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in early May 1998
along the 1, 000-kilometer border.
</P>
<P>
Although both countries have agreed to the peace framework put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), there is no
sight for immediate resolution to the 13-month-long conflict.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said on Friday that it had temporarily closed six embassies in
Africa after receiving information they were under surveillance
by "suspicious individuals."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told ABC's "Good Morning
America" that the six embassies shut down on Thursday were in
Gambia, Togo, Madagascar, Liberia, Namibia and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
"We don't take a decision to close an embassy lightly," Rubin
said. "We did develop information that suspicious individuals
were engaged in surveillance of certain embassies ... It was
concrete information or we wouldn't have taken the decision to
close these six embassies."
</P>
<P>
The State Department noted that U.S. embassies in Africa and
the rest of the world have been on a heightened alert status due
to increased security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. embassies in sub-Saharan Africa were ordered closed
for two days in December, following U.S. bombing against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Decision on Air Strike against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Friday defended his decision to order the
broadest Israeli air strike against Lebanon since 1996, saying
the government should do everything to protect the people in
Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept the situation where rockets were launched
in our territories without response," he said in a statement
while visiting the northern border town of Kiryat Shimona,
target of waves of Katyusha attacks from Lebanon late Thursday
night in which two civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see a speedy return to quiet in both
sides, but we should do everything necessary in order to
protect the people here," he was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kiryat Shimona was in atmosphere of tense quiet Friday
afternoon. Residents remained in underground bomb shelters 24
hours after they were first instructed to enter there following
the first wave of Katyusha rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah
guerrillas of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The rockets were fired after Israeli shelling wounded a
Lebanese civilian in a Lebanese village outside the
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Netanyahu ordered the heaviest military offensive
in Lebanon since the "Grapes of Wrath" operations in 1996.
Israeli fighter planes struck power stations, bridges and other
civilian targets, some near Beirut, killing 10 and injuring more
than 60.
</P>
<P>
After making the decision to unleash the retaliatory strike,
Netanyahu warned that Hezbollah is mistaken if it thinks it
can take advantage of the period of government transition to
hit residents of the north.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu retains full power until his successor Ehud Barak,
who dealt Netanyahu a landslide defeat in the May elections,
puts together a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak immediately distanced himself from the decision on the
Israeli air strike. His office made it clear late Thursday
night that he was informed of the decision only after it had
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
His aides said the former army chief was angry over Netanyahu's
decision to hit Lebanese civilian targets in retaliation for
Hezbollah operations, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a war of attrition to oust Israel soldiers
and its local militia South Lebanon Army from a 15-km-deep border
zone in south Lebanon Israel has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon
within a year of office through negotiations with Syria, the
main power-broker in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian parliament adopted a
resolution on permitting NATO troops to Kosovo passing its
territory within the framework of Operation Joint Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The document was backed by 208 of the 213 Members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The resolution specifies that NATO personnel should be under
the obligation to comply with the Bulgarian legislation, guarantee
a safe passage, avoid disturbing the normal civilian traffic and
amend any direct or indirect damage caused by their passage.
</P>
<P>
NATO aircraft and ships will pay no port, airport, navigation

establishment of peace and stability in Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Stefan Gaitandjiev, who against the presence of foreign
troops in the country - both of NATO and Russia, claimed that it

<HEADLINE> British, Irish PMs in N.Ireland to Save Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish Prime Ministers
Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern arrived in Belfast for talks on Friday
to break the stalemate on the Northern Ireland peace deal before
next Wednesday's "make-or-brake" deadline.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Belfast, Blair said he wanted an early
promise from the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and its political
wing Sinn Fein to decommission all their weapons by May 2000,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman told reporters in London that the British
prime minister wanted a "yes" to two fundamental questions in his
meetings with David Trimble and Gerry Adams, the key Ulster
Unionist and Sinn Fein negotiators in the dispute over guerrilla
arms which has blocked formation of a devolved government.
</P>
<P>
"Are you committed to an inclusive executive? And are you
committed to decommissioning by May 2000? Those are the two
questions," the spokesman quoted Blair as asking.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's Protestant Ulster Unionist Party has already said it
is ready in principle to include Adams' Sinn Fein in an all-party
executive, one of the key planks of the April 1998 Good Friday
Agreement, providing disarmament takes place. Leading a 30-strong
delegation to the Belfast talks, Trimble said he was committed to
securing peace.
</P>
<P>
"I really do take exception to anyone doubting our willingness
to work with other people, provided they are committed to peace
and democracy, and that is the critical question," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein vice-president Pat Doherty told reporters that he
remained hopeful that the Good Friday Agreement would not
flounder, calling it "the route map which can bring us forward."
</P>
<P>
But Blair's insistence on a "yes" to disarmament by next year
will pose serious problems for Sinn Fein, which has always said it
cannot deliver an IRA weapons handover.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister warned in an article in The Times on Friday
that the parties were "staring into the abyss" with less than a
week to go before a deadline for rescuing last year's peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He made clear he expected Sinn Fein and the IRA to come up with
"deeds not words" on decommissioning, but he was prepared to be
flexible over timing between now and May 2000.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Building of Holocaust Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament approved a vote
to build a national memorial in the center of Berlin to remember
six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust under the Nazi Third
Reich.
</P>
<P>
The monument, designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman,
envisages a maze of four soccer pitches (fields) filled with 2,700
concrete pillars.
</P>
<P>
German deputies insisted, however, on putting their own mark on
the monument and stipulated the original Eisenman design be
extended with the installation of interpretative texts on the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"The state itself cannot remember but with symbols it can help
society to remember," said German Culture Minister Michael Naumann
in a speech to the Bundestag, or lower house.
</P>
<P>
"This memorial in the center of our capital is a symbol of our
mourning. It is a part of our history. Above all, it symbolizes
memory... of the murder of millions of people. Today in parliament
we kneel in front of the victims...," declared Naumann.
</P>
<P>
The president of Germany's parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, said
the monument would help allow Germans to end the century with
dignity.
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, the leader of the Party of Democratic Socialism,
said the Holocaust memorial was needed as an answer to rising neo-
Nazi sentiment among youths.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament had to choose between two designs for the
monument which will be built on a site the size of two football
fields south of the Brandenburg Gate and near the bunker where
Nazi leader Adolf Hitler committed suicide in 1945.
</P>
<P>
A private initiative for the memorial was set up in 1989. This
was taken on by the German federal government in 1992, which
launched a design competition.

<HEADLINE> Britain Closes Four African Embassies Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain declared on Friday that it
has decided to close its diplomatic missions in four African
countries because of security reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We have information of a possible threat to diplomatic
missions in Gambia, Madagascar, Namibia and Senegal. We...have
taken the precautionary measure of temporarily closing our
missions in these countries," a Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the United States announced on Thursday
that its embassies in Gambia, Liberia, Togo, Madagascar, Namibia
and Senegal would be shut until Sunday because of security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
American embassies have been regarded as especially vigilant
after U.S. intelligence officials revealed that exiled Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden and his followers, blamed by Washington
for two deadly 1998 embassy bombings in Africa, may be close to
launching another attack.
</P>
<P>
But the British spokesman declined to elaborate on the threat
British embassies would face. He also refused to say where the
threat came from.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of the closure of U.S. missions in a number of
African countries, and we do maintain close contacts with the
Americans on security matters," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said no diplomatic staff was being evacuated from
the four countries.
</P>
<P>
Bin laden was accused by the United States of plotting the bomb
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, which
killed more than 250 people.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Hails Trial of Catholic Priest in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government welcomed
the decision by France to try Rwandan Catholic priest, Father
Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, Rwanda's Chief Prosecutor, Simeon Rwagasore
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said more than 45 genocide survivors, both Hutus
and Tutsis, testified about Munyeshyaka's role in the massacres of
Tutsis at Sainte Famille church, in the heart of the capital
Kigali during April-July 1994, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"France appointed a prosecutor to follow up his case and has
ordered him to appear before the court," Rwagasore said.
</P>
<P>
Many human rights organizations have accused France, the
Vatican, Belgium and other Western countries for harboring
genocide suspects.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, at the eve of the fifth commemoration of the
1994 genocide the London-based human rights Watchdog, African
Rights published a report on Munyeshyaka's role in the killings at
Sainte Famille.
</P>
<P>
"However, the French government had kept silent about his
case," African Rights charged.
</P>
<P>
"Over a period of three months Munyeshyaka is said to have
collaborated with the militia in sending Tutsis to be
slaughtered, the majority of them young men,'' it said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
Munyeshyaka is also charged with raping young women, whom he
saved in return for sexual favors, and of depriving the majority
of refugees of water and food.
</P>
<P>
The report further said that Munyeshyaka was seen around by the
 displaced armed with a gun, and wearing a bullet proof jacket. He
had turned himself into a militiaman, the report said.
</P>
<P>
African Rights also accused Munyeshyaka of obstructed the
evacuation of the refugees by the UN peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
After the genocide, Munyeshyaka fled to eastern part of former
Zaire where he was fished out and taken to France where continues
to celebrate mass.
</P>
<P>
All these allegations were rejected by Munyeshyaka calling them
'' malicious gossips'' intended to tarnish his reputation and that
of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
African Rights alleged that all attempt to bring Munyeshyaka to
book were curtailed by intervention of the French Catholic leaders
who had dismissed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
If Munyeshyaka happens to be tried in France, he will be the
second Rwandan genocide suspect to be tried in a European country,
after the trial of Fulgence Niyonteze who was sentenced to life
imprisonment by a Swiss military court.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Shoot Film in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia, the first country to be in
space, plans to make another first in space, this time by shooting
a feature film there.
</P>
<P>
An actor and two cosmonauts to act as cameramen will be sent up
to the Mir space station in February 2000, Sergei Gorbunov, press
secretary for the director general of the Russian Space Agency,
told a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director Yuri Kara, meanwhile, will stay at the mission control
center and direct the filming from there, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has filmed actors in space yet," Kara said. "Even if we
shoot just one frame in space we will be the first to do so."
</P>
<P>
Only part of the film, based on the novel "Cassandra's Brand"
by Kyrgyz writer Chingiz Aitmatov and tentatively named as "A
Prize Space Mission," will be shot in space.
</P>
<P>
In Aitmatov's story, the last cosmonaut on board a space
station slotted for destruction refuses to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
Actor Vladimir Steklov, who will star in the film, is
undergoing a full 900-hour training regime for his space flight,
as is Natalya Khromushkina, a young actress who will play the part
of the cosmonaut's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Footage of her will be filmed either on earth or in a dropping
transport plane to simulate weightlessness. She is undergoing
training for space missions just in case Steklov cannot fly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Does not Support Montenegro's Separation from Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that it does not back Montenegro's independence from
Yugoslavia because further disintegration of the federation is not
conducive to the stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Independence for the republic, junior partner to Serbia in
Yugoslavia, was not necessarily in the interests of Montenegro or
the region, State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The further disintegration of Yugoslavia would not serve to
promote peace and stability in the Balkans," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that independence would not be "a panacea for the
challenges that Montenegro faces."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that working inside Yugoslavia, Montenegro could act
as a force to promote change.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been demonizing Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic and believe he is the root cause of the
instability on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Montenegro's active support is important for implementing the
Kosovo settlement and bringing democracy to all the people of
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States plans to provide economic aid to Montenegro
in isolation from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do our best to ensure that Montenegro doesn't
suffer as a result of the unwillingness of the West to provide
reconstruction assistance to Belgrade," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to ensure that Kosovo and Montenegro are treated
differently than Serbia and the rest of that territory on the
map," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Balkans, U.S. President Bill Clinton
last week met Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic and encouraged
him to keep distance from Belgrade.

Lebanon, this has affected the civilian population as well as
UNIFIL," spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the direct attacks on civilian targets in several areas
of Lebanon and the rocket fire into northern Israel "represent a
serious escalation".
</P>
<P>
"That innocent civilians lost their lives is particularly
deplorable," he added.

News reports said Israeli tanks were rolling along the border
with Lebanon following an outbreak of violence Thursday, leaving
eight Lebanese and Israelis dead.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Fall 4 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Association of
Realtors said Friday that sales of existing homes fell 4 percent
in May as mortgage was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing single-family homes dropped in May to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million units, the
Association said. This is the second consecutive monthly decline
after the sales hit an all-time high in March.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised figures, April sales declined 3.1 percent to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.25 million units. The
Association originally estimated a 3.3 percent drop in April to
5.24 million units.
</P>
<P>
In March, existing-home sales posted a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.42 million units, a record high.
</P>
<P>
May's home-sales figure, the lowest level in six months, was
below the expectations of analysts, who predicted that sales would
either hold steady or decline slightly.
</P>
<P>
According to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, the average
interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 7.15 percent
in May, up from 6.92 percent in April. The rate was 7.14 percent
in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last month all regions experienced a dip in resales, which is
consistent with the recent increase in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The national median existing-homes sales price rose 3.3 percent
to 133,000 dollars in May compared to May 1998. But the median
existing-homes sale price in May was only 1.8 percent higher than
the median price reported in April.

LONDON June 25 (Xinhua) - British and German stocks held on to
modest gains Friday to close slightly higher following a strong
opening on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London had suffered at the outset, weighed down by Wall
Street's 132-point overnight fall, a lack of corporate trading
news and caution ahead of next week's US Federal Reserve policy
meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the UK's benchmark FTSE 100 overcame early losses to
close up 0.3 percent, or 18.7 percent, at 6435.4, pulled higher by
a firmer performance on the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically traded Xetra Dax also climbed out the
red to end 0.24 percent higher, at 5340.63, a gain of 13.03
points.
</P>
<P>
But Deutsche Telekom shares fell 1.65 percent as investors
attempted to drive its share price down ahead of a giant new share
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 25 (Xinhua) - The UK's economic output remained
broadly flat during the first three months of the year, according
to official figures released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said while revised data
continued to show zero growth in the first quarter compared to the
last three months, year-on-year growth had been revised to 0.7
percent from a previous 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the weakest performance for the economy since 1992.
However the figures did show the service sector performing more
strongly than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Scotland economist Neil Parker said the revised
GDP data meant "the economy is well set for strong growth in the
second quarter and for the second half of 1999".
</P>
<P>
But signs of economic recovery are still mixed, with some
measures - notably consumer and business confidence, and house
prices - showing strong increases, while others, such as retail
sales, still weak.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress' Cooperation on Domestic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday called for Congress' cooperation on domestic issues such as
Medicare, Social Security, education, child care and gun control.
</P>
<P>
"Congress should pass it and I will sign it," Clinton said in a
speech at Georgetown University as he ticked down the same list of
initiatives he outlined five months ago in his State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in Congress, who are reluctant to cooperate with
Clinton on these issues, showcased their own agenda calling for
measures to bolster the national security, improve education,
safeguard the Social Security surplus for improving the program
and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is trying to reassert his voice in America's political
debate after the 11-week Kosovo conflict with the approach of the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"I came back to Washington after my trip to Europe with a
renewed energy for the domestic agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for a spirit of bipartisanship and a "season of
progress" on Republican issues while criticizing Republican
leaders for blocking some of his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that ultimately he and the lawmakers would be
judged by "whether we choose to seize this opportunity" or allow
it to be "squandered with petty arguments and animosities in
special interest politics."
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say that the atmosphere in Washington has become
increasingly poisoned by bitter partisanship," he said. "I don't
understand exactly why, since we keep doing better and better
and better in America."

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Report Progress in N.Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Headway was reportedly made in
easing a deadlock in the Northern Irish peace process during four
hours of talks with the province's main parties in Belfast on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Ministers Tony Blair his Irish counterpart Bertie
Ahern said all the parties to the stalled Good Friday agreement
had backed fundamental principles including guerrilla disarmament
by May 2000 and the creation of a power-sharing provincial
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Despite clear gaps between the parties on core issues, sources
close to the talks said the scene was set for a fresh push to end
the impasse in resumed talks next week.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern arrived in Belfast earlier today in a bid to
bridge a gap between pro-British unionists and Sinn Fein
republicans so as to enable the full implementation of the accord
by a deadline of next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair described talks with the parties as "constructive and
good natured," saying they would resume next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political arm of IRA guerrillas, said it had had
"a good meeting" with the prime ministers and denied that it had
changed tack on the need for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But David Trimble, the province's First Minister and leader of
the powerful Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) protested that he had not
yet heard Sinn Fein commit itself to the "decommissioning"
(disarmament) of weapons held by its Irish Republican Army (IRA)
ally.
</P>
<P>
"There can be question of bringing a private army into the
heart of the administration unless it has shown it is going to
turn its back irrevocably on violence, and has demonstrated that
by actions," a Reuters report quoted Trimble as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
In order to kickstart the stalled process, Blair had put forward
a plan that could pave the way for Sinn Fein to enter a ruling
provincial cabinet if the IRA gave and stuck by firm pledges that
it would fully disarm by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that while there were still differences between the
parties "about timing and implementation", they were committed to
vital principles.
</P>
<P>
The parties were committed to "an inclusive executive
exercising devolved powers; decommissioning of all paramilitary
arms by May 2000; decommissioning to be carried out in the manner
determined by the Independent Commission on Decommissioning,"
Blair said, calling it "welcome progress."
</P>
<P>
A row about IRA disarmament has stalled the formation of the
executive, which was the pivotal element of last year's peace
deal. as Unionists refuse to sit with Sinn Fein until the IRA
scraps the weaponry that sustained a 30 year onslaught against
rule from Britain. Both sides accuse each other of reneging on the
pact.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Fight Offshore Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Maritime
Foundation, a non-governmental organization, Friday called on the
government to establish a coast guard unit to curb drug
trafficking on the coastline and offshore islands.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the foundation, Sivili Mushi, told the press in Dar
es Salaam that the sea is a major channel of drug transportation,
adding that loopholes for the booming of the drug dealing should
be stemmed.
</P>
<P>
While the government is taking measures against drug
trafficking on land, most of the drugs are transported through
ship containers, said Mushi.
</P>
<P>
He said as a maritime professional organization, his foundation
is resolved to join the Tanzanian government in fighting the
illegal drug trafficking in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Mushi pointed out that it is necessary for the government to
establish a coast guard unit which will take up the responsibility
of monitoring the sea ferries suspected to be involved in the
transit of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said some small vessels and islands are used as
distribution points or transshipment centers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"A coastline unit will not only spot and report illegal drug
traffickers but also assist in combating illegal sailing in
territorial waters, oil pollution and illegal dumping of wastes,
entry of illegal goods and tax evaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the maritime foundation congratulated the government
for the initiative of observing the World Anti-drug Day which
falls on June 26. It added that the move reflects seriousness in
fighting the drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Anti-drug Day is "Music Against
Drugs" and Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye is expected
to launch the United Nations International Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) country program in the Tanzanian capital Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Encourage Breast-feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The African governments must
continue encouraging breast-feeding irrespective of HIV infection
rates, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said in Harare
Friday.
</P>
<P>
WHO secretariat head Liz Mason told delegates attending the
three-day regional Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
(IMCI) meeting that the actual transmission of the HIV virus from
mother to child through breast- feeding depends on the prevalence
rate in pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official said that chances of transmission of the virus
through breast-feeding are very slim and stand at only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As a general principle and irrespective of HIV infection
rates, breast- feeding should continue to be promoted, protected
and supported," she said.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding is important because it stimulates the
development of an infant's own immune system, giving it an active
protection against infections, she added.
</P>
<P>
Mason noted that most of the substances found in breast milk
are not present in its substitutes which could contribute to
premature deaths of children.
</P>
<P>
She said health workers should come up with effective
strategies to assist infected mothers to make decisions that do
not compromise the health of their children.
</P>
<P>
HIV positive mothers have been faced with a dilemma of whether
or not to breast-feed their babies for fear of infecting them with
the virus.

<HEADLINE> Many African Children Die Due To Medicine Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the three-day regional
 Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) workshop in
Harare expressed their concern Friday that many children die in
Africa as a result of medicine shortage.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about 12
million children die every year in Africa from diseases such as
acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles and malaria, the
Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The experiences in Tanzania, Madagascar and other countries
have shown that essential drugs are always in short supply,
compromising the health of the people especially infants," the
delegates said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had recently been experiencing a shortage of essential
 medicines as well.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said the issue of medicine shortage was supposed
to be resolved seriously when countries implemented reforms in the
health sector.
</P>
<P>
They said other setbacks in tackling childhood illness included
lack of funding by governments and lack of proper training of
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was aimed at improving the implementation of the
childhood illness program through information sharing among
countries.
</P>
<P>
The program was started in Africa some four years ago with an
aim of improving management of childhood illness.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Blames Old Guard for Ruining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday blamed the old guard for ruining the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union by putting their personal ambitions first.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is also president of the ruling party, said it is
disturbing that personal disagreements among the old guard
continue to affect the party in a number of provinces.
</P>
<P>
"If that persists we shall soon be compelled to dub them
witches of the party, in which case it may be necessary to
undertake an exercise of exorcism," Mugabe said when opening the
38th ordinary session of the ruling party's central committee.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the president as saying there
is an urgent need to correct the internal contradictions so that
the party could be able to face the electorate in the year 2000
general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said it is disturbing to note that while contradictions have
been solved in some areas others remain permanently divided.
</P>
<P>
The party is facing factions in most of its provinces which are
 threatening its collapse, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the drafting of the new constitution, Mugabe said that the
party's central committee will meet soon to debate its position on
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the party's legal committee has not yet
provided its ideas for discussion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently appointed a Constitutional
Review Commission with the view of drafting a new constitution to
replace the British-authored 1979 Lancaster House constitution
which is said not to represent the interests of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said after the drafting stage, the government would
undertake a referendum for its approval in which registered voters
would vote for or against it.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have been killed by
flood in southeastern Bangladesh's Chittagong and Cox's Bazar
districts where the flood situation has worsened, reports reaching
here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpour has brought fresh areas under water, and the
situation has been aggravated by water sliding down the hills in
the two districts.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report said at least 4,000 houses were demolished
in the districts by the flood water rendering tens of thousands of
people homeless, and a huge number of cattle heads and poultry
birds perished, with 870 kilometers of unpaved and 105 paved roads
damaged.
</P>
<P>
In Bandarban, one of the country's three southeastern hill
districts, some 20,000 homes have been inundated by water.
</P>
<P>
The BSS news agency reported Saturday that two rivers in the
southeastern region were flowing above their respective danger
levels during the past 24 hours, and the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and
the Padma rivers marked further rise at all points.
</P>
<P>
But all the rivers in the Ganges and Meghna basins were flowing
below the danger level, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Monsoon is now active over Bangladesh, with moderate to very
heavy rainfall recorded at all places in the country during the
last 24 hours, according to the Flood Information Center.

<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The following is economic briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Arabian government adopted a series of
measures to control cigarette smuggling from neighboring Yemen as
the smuggled stuff sell in the kingdom at prices 35 percent lower
than local ones.
</P>
<P>
Saudi trade ministry sources said the smuggled cigarettes
consume 90 percent of the southern kingdom markets, up to Jeddah
on the eastern coast of the Red sea, the Cairo-based Al Alam Al
Yom newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the sources as saying that the 50 cigarette
box gross sells at 1,250 Saudi Riyals (333 U.S. dollars) while the
tax-added prices hit 1,890 Riyals (504 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities impose 100 percent taxes on tobacco
products in a bid to control tobacco consumption for protecting
the public health.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- The current farming season in Sudan is facing
difficulties and challenges as a result of low finance and failure
by farmers to repay their due debts estimated at billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Ministry of Agriculture was quoted Saturday by
the Al Alam Al Yom newspaper as saying that the concerned
organizations are striving to market 600,000 tons of corn and
to find ways to provide cash for the current summer season.
</P>
<P>
As a result, preparations for the new season have been slowed
down despite a good rainy season. Although 38,940 acres (16,354.8
hectares) were planned for growing corn in Gezira, the largest
farming land in the country, only 26 percent of the land is ready
for farming.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The worst drought experienced by Iran in 30 years
this season has damaged 3.3 billion U.S. dollars worth of crops,
said Iranian Minister of Agriculture Issa Kalantari.
</P>
<P>
The low rain precipitation hit hard fruit, crop and farming
production with an estimated loss of 10 billion Riyals (3.3
billion dollars), Saturday's London-based Al Hayat Arabic language
newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rainfalls shrank by 40 percent compared with those of last
year, with the northwestern areas hit the most by the drought.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has authorized digging up 6,500 wells to make up
for the lack of rain water.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The construction of an oil pipeline agreed upon by
Jordan and Iraq last year will be delayed for sometime as a result
of economic problems, said a Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Suleiman Abu Ileim was
quoted by Saturday's London-based Arabic language newspaper Al
Shark Al Awsat as saying that the economic hardships faced by
Jordan at present are well known.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the Jordanian government will maintain an
agreement stipulating for spending 40 million dinnars (75 million
U.S. dollars) annually to cover 72 percent of the total cost of
shipping Iraqi oil to Jordan, with Iraq financing the rest of the
28 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq agreed last year to construct a 750-
kilometer-long pipeline at a cost of 350 million dollars between a
pumping station located at 260 kilometers northwest of Baghdad and
the Zarga oil refinery northeast of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The minister affirmed his country's hopes to contribute to
developing the Iraqi oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq has been providing Jordan with
75,000 barrels of oil per day, almost covering Jordan's total
needs of oil.

BAGHDAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi national assembly
delegation left here on Saturday, heading for Damascus, Syria to
participate in the 34th session of the Arab Parliamentary
Federation's Council (APFC) due to be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ghanim Khadori, head of the delegation, said in a statement
that Iraq will put forward a proposal aimed at achieving Arab
solidarity and confronting the challenges besetting the Arab
nation's security, according to the Iraqi News Agency before
departure.
</P>
<P>
Khadori, who is the deputy speaker of the Iraqi parliament,
said the Iraqi delegation will take part in the discussions on
the declaration of the formation of Arab Common Market
Parliamentary Committee.
</P>
<P>

talks with Arab parliamentarians on the implementation of the
decisions adopted at the session of the Arab Parliamentary Union
(APU) held in Amman, Jordan last year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Passes Budget Bill In First Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's House of
Representatives Saturday passed the government-proposed budget
bill for fiscal year 2000 in the first reading.
</P>
<P>
Some 247 legislators voted in favor of the 860 billion baht
(23.2 billion U.S. dollars) budget bill, while 90 voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
The budget, a 4.2 percent increase from the previous one,
carries a 110-billion-baht (2.97 billion U.S. dollars) deficit, or
2.2 percent of GDP, based on the government's capability to
generate a revenue of only 750 billion baht (20.2 billion U.S.
dollars) from tax collection.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to show the government's resolution to
stimulate the economy by increasing government expenditure at a
time when private consumption is weak.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day debate on the budget bill, the opposition
argued that the government's optimism over the economic recovery
was misplaced, quoting sluggish exports, falling interest rates
and stunted public spending power as the reasons.
</P>
<P>
They also said the investment funding is too meager to spur the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition government, led by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, said significant government spending on large-scale
job-creation, education promotion and public welfare projects will
accelerate the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition holds a 254-seat majority in the
383-strong lower house. Ten seats of the originally 393-member
parliament have been vacant due to deaths and resignations.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill will undergo second and third readings in the
lower house before being presented to the Senate for further
discussions.

healthily under the care of the central government.
</P>
<P>
"This is a forceful counterattack to the splittist attempts by
the Dalai Lama clique and hostile forces in the west, who use the
issue of the last Panchen Lama's reincarnation as a pretext," said
Lama Cering, director of the Democratic Management Committee of
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the main residence of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama baptized lamas and disciples at the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery Thursday, reciting smoothly during the ceremony a
sutra on longevity more than 10,000 words long.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama is regarded as the incarnation of the Buddha
of Longevity, and baptizing lamas and disciples to bring them
longevity is regarded as his special duty.
</P>
<P>
"The 11th Panchen Lama's successful baptism of his followers
convinced them that he is the true reincarnation of the 10th
Panchen Lama," said Lama Cering.
</P>
<P>
He added that the selection of the Panchen Lama through proper
religious rituals and historical tradition fulfills the wish of
lamas and believers in Tibetan Buddhism, and the lies and rumors
spread by the Dalai Lama's separatist clique as well as hostile
forces in the west are believed by nobody.

<HEADLINE> Panchen Lama Presides Successfully at Buddhist Ceremonies: Lamas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama has been warmly received by lamas and
believers in both Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, and Xigaze.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen's teachers voiced similar sentiments as those of
Lama Cering.
</P>
<P>
Widely respected for their great learning, noble character and
high prestige, the teachers expressed their amazement at the young
Panchen Lama's understanding of Buddhist tenets.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke highly of his compassion for all living beings
and his use of religious principles in daily life.
</P>
<P>
While spending most of his time studying Buddhism, the Panchen
Lama is also studying the Tibetan language, mathematics and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He has already learned a large number of sutras, and is able to
recite more than 60,000 words of them.
</P>
<P>
Keen on sports like jogging, cycling, football and ping pong,
the young Panchen Lama also shows a great interest in cameras.
</P>
<P>
Party and state leaders headed by President Jiang Zemin have
shown great concern for the healthy growth of the Panchen Lama,
who, in turn, has expressed his wish to follow the instructions of
President Jiang to become a good Living Buddha who loves the
country and the religion, and who contributes to social progress
and unity between the different ethnic groups in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Now Gets Funds From All Directions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's central government used to
be the only investor in Tibet for decades, but in recent years,
this southwest China ethnic autonomous region has successfully
widened its channels of investment.
</P>
<P>
Between 1959, the year the democratic reform was launched after
a failed rebellion by the Dalai Lama, and 1998, the central
government pumped more than 40 billion yuan into Tibet. This was
mainly used for a large number of capital projects.
</P>
<P>
Since then, inland provinces and cities have been asked by the
central leadership to offer helping hands for Tibet in various
ways. So far, 105 key projects and 1,000 smaller ones have been
jointly funded by the central government and inland areas,
involving a total investment of 2.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibet has been encouraged to use other financial
channels such as getting loans from commercial banks, obtaining
foreign assistance, and floating the stocks of local state-owned
companies on the country's fledgling stock market.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 alone, Tibetan companies, farmers and herdsmen were
granted 7.8 billion yuan in loans by local commercial banking
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Tibet has received 51 million U.S.
dollars in assistance from foreign companies and individuals, and
66 million U.S. dollars in the form of soft loans from foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
Currently, overseas investors are engaged in nine development
projects in Tibet, with a contractual capital of 24 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the investment pluralism policy, government funding
now stands at less than 40 percent of Tibet's total, compared with
68 percent five years ago, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan economy has been growing at a rate of 12 percent
annually, faster than the national average of about nine percent,
for five years in succession. The increase in investment has
contributed to 75 percent of its rapid economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law Preserved in HK: Chief Executive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said here Saturday that he has confidence in the
preservation of the integrity of Hong Kong's legal system and the
rule of law under the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks at a press conference on the
interpretation of the Basic Law provisions concerning the right of
abode (ROA) issue by the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee issued its interpretation earlier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen once again that the central authorities are most
concerned about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. I can say
that with great confidence that under "one country, two Systems",
the integrity of Hong Kong's legal system and the rule of law will
be preserved," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Over a month ago, Tung said, the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government "decided to seek the assistance of the State
Council to approach the NPC Standing Committee to interpret the
Basic Law provisions concerning the right of abode according to
their true legislative intent, and to help us resolve the
difficulties we had encountered in implementing the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
"A problem, which concerns the long-term interests of Hong Kong
people and which has caused widespread public concern, has finally
been resolved in a manner which is entirely legal and
constitutional," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive emphasized that the SAR government "
treasures the rule of law as one of the most important pillars of
Hong Kong's success."
</P>
<P>
"In dealing with the right of abode issue, we have exercised
great care to ensure that every step taken is strictly in line
with the law and complies with applicable procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that it is "understandable" that some Hong Kong
people who do not fully appreciate the situation may be worried
that the rule of law has been affected by this issue.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to assure these people ... we will never permit the
rule of law be compromised. In fact mainstream community opinion
supports the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee. They
have made a realistic assessment of Hong Kong's overall interests,
such as employment opportunities and quality of life, and support
our effort to resolve this matter within the established legal
framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the problem has now been resolved in accordance
with this approach," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that it is "perfectly understandable" that some
problems may arise during the implementation of the "historically
unprecedented "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we keep Hong Kong's best interests at heart, and so
long as we act in strict compliance with the spirit of the rule of
law and the Basic Law itself, we will be able to cope with any
difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Through this effort, we have enriched our experience in
implementing and enforcing the Basic Law, as well as in
safeguarding the rule of law in Hong Kong," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here Saturday that the official meeting to make preparations
for the regional summit on peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) is going on here "extremely well."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to mediate a peace solution to the 11-month war
in the DRC, told a press conference that a good result is coming
out and consultations will continue and are expected to end some
time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After that, ministers will take over to pave the way for the
summit, at which a ceasefire agreement is expected to be signed
for an end to the conflict in the third largest African country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said presidents of the countries concerned are kept
informed about the preparations.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), said the OAU is active
from the very beginning of the conflict in support of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said the consultations here are in the right direction
toward peace.

All the belligerents have been involved for the first time in

final documents have not been ready.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Vice President Christon Tembo said here Friday that the
summit may take place here Sunday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Passers-by in downtown Beijing
were told "Treasure your life by keeping away from narcotics" by
anti-drug campaigners, while Guangdong Province publicly destroyed
drugs today, as parts of activities held across China to mark the
worldwide movement against drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
Apart from publicity activities on major streets, 360
volunteers in Beijing pledged to devote themselves to educational
work for drug prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
As the Internal Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking
fell today, Beijing led other Chinese cities in holding massive
campaigns to ring the alarm bells against rampant drug use and
trafficking among the general public.
</P>
<P>
"The situation (of drug abuse and trafficking in China) remains
very serious, since drug-related crimes are growing increasingly
rampant both at home and abroad," acknowledged Jia Chunwang,
director of the National Narcotics Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who is also the Minister of Public Security, joined anti-
drug campaigners in front of a Beijing shopping center to hand out
publicity materials to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Humen in south China's Guangdong Province, 200 kg
of heroin and 200 kg of the drug "ice" were burned today in front
of some 3,000 locals from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
A total of 320,000 primary and middle school students in
Dongguan participated in a rally to respond a call by Guangdong's
Party Secretary Li Changchun for compulsory education in drug
prevention among local people older than ten years.
</P>
<P>
So far, student narcotics control committees have been set up
in 686 colleges and schools in Dongguan, having some 320,000
student members.

<HEADLINE> Top Iraqi Legislator Briefs Annan on Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament
Saadoun Hammadi told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that over
1.11 million Iraqis have died of shortage of medicines and more
than 10 million others are suffering from malnutrition as a result
of U.N. santions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter intended to brief Annan on the consequences brought
about by the sanctions since 1990, Hammadi also said the embargo
has affected the environment as well as the educational, cultural
and all social aspects in Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The pollution rate for the drinking water has reached 50
percent, the speaker added.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Hammadi slammed the U.N. Sanctions Committee
for blocking the approval of Iraqi contracts signed with foreign
companies under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
He said the oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to export
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its people, have sustained premeditated
troubles incurred by the U.S. and British governments.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British representatives in
the Sanctions Committee of putting on hold its contracts to
purchase oil spare parts and medical appliances under flimsy
pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi also said the Iraqi economy has been greatly damaged by
the continued embargo, adding Iraq has suffered a total loss of
120 billion U.S. dollars since the imposition of U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Must Start Making Profits in 3 Years: Jiang -1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
urged state-owned enterprises (SOE) in east China to start making
profits in three years' time by establishing a modern enterprise
system and optimizing the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a modern enterprise system is a major issue which
has a vital bearing not only on the reform and development of the
SOEs but also on the success of the economic restructuring and the
sustainable and healthy development of the national economy in
China, the Chinese leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remarks at a forum on reform and development
of SOEs in the six provinces and one municipality in east China,
in this scenic port city in Shandong Province Friday and today.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth such forum the president called this year.
How to get the debt-ridden SOEs back into the black is the key
issue in China's development agenda, and the relatively developed
east China is spearheading the reform.
</P>
<P>
"State-owned enterprises must establish a management system
full of vitality to improve their competitiveness, and the modern
enterprise system is the basic enterprise system in a socialist
market economy," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of a modern enterprise system
should center on clearly defined ownership, rights and
responsibilities, separation of government and enterprise
functions, and a scientific management system.
</P>
<P>
He expounded on the issue from eight aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- The respective rights and responsibilities of the state and
the enterprises should be clearly defined and understood, and SOEs
must set up an effective system to manage, supervise and operate
state assets;
</P>
<P>
-- Government should refrain from interfering in the operation
of enterprises, and separation of government and enterprise
functions should be achieved;
</P>
<P>
-- Large and medium-sized SOEs should be restructured into
standard corporations, while small SOEs should be granted more
flexibility in their operations. The legal person corporate
structure which guarantees a balance between owners and operators
is the core of the modern corporate system;
</P>
<P>
-- The building of enterprise leadership should be enhanced to
produce a highly qualified management contingent;
</P>
<P>
-- Scientific measures should be implemented to improve
management;
</P>
<P>
-- A reasonable distribution mechanism should be established to
give more incentives to both managers and workers;
</P>
<P>
-- Full reliance should be placed on staff to handle management.
The legal rights and interests of workers should be properly
protected, and special attention should be paid to laid-off
workers and those facing various kinds of difficulties; and
</P>
<P>
-- The leadership of the Party should be enhanced and improved.
And Party organizations should guarantee and supervise the
implementation of the Party and government policies in the
enterprises.

<P>
A relatively developed area endowed with a favorable
geographical position and the support of state policies, eastern
China has made rapid progress in reform and development, and made
great contributions to reform and development in the country as a
whole, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the region should continue to deepen the
reform, promote the development of high- and new-technology
industries, to transform traditional industries with modern
science and technology, and to expand the opening-up and further
develop overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jiang pointed out, the east China area should
attach more importance to supporting the development of central
and western China by increasing trans-regional economic and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Central and western China, with their rich natural resources
and potential markets, will also help economic growth and social
progress in eastern China," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"Only by working for the common development of whole nation can
China achieve an overall rapid and coordinated economic
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged leading officials to improve their
ideological and theoretical standards and increase their sense of
responsibility in the course of the Party's current education in
theoretical study, political awareness and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
The president made a study tour of Shandong Province before
the forum, visiting local state-owned enterprises, some laid-off
workers, the traffic police, the armed police and the People's
Liberation Army units stationed in Shandong.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Should Do More to Tackle Air Pollution: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's capital should do a lot
more to get rid of its serious air pollution, China's top
environment-protection official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The situation has raised concern throughout society, according
to Xie Zhenghua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Official monitors indicate that the levels of suspended
particles, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the city's air
were on average 89, 100 and 204 percent higher, respectively, than
the good air quality level.
</P>
<P>
And in 1998, Beijing's overall air pollution index ranked the
third highest of all cities in the world, higher even than that of
Mexico city.
</P>
<P>
"As China's political and cultural center, Beijing's
environment shouldn't be like this," Xie told the 10th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, the municipal authorities have taken a
series of measures to tackle air pollution, which has produced
some initial results.
</P>
<P>
"However, the city must make unremitting efforts to solve the
problem, and reverse the trend of environmental degradation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the city and the SEPA are adding the
finishing touches to an environmental protection blueprint, which
is to be submitted to the State Council for approval in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Beijing will make some improvements in
its environment before this October, obvious improvements by the
end of 2000 and national-level improvements by the end of 2002.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Bank Announces Restructuring Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Development Bank of
Singapore Ltd. (DBS Bank), the largest local bank in Singapore,
Saturday announced a proposed scheme to restructure DBS Bank as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of a financial services holding company
proposed to be known as DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBSH).
</P>
<P>
The proposed restructuring will involve the incorporation of
DBSH in Singapore, the cancellation of all the issued DBS Bank
shares in exchange for new DBSH shares on one-for-one basis, the
issue of new DBS Bank shares to DBSH, and the delisting of DBS
Bank as well as the listing of DBSH on the Main Board of the Stock
Exchange of Singapore (SES).
</P>
<P>
DBS Bank expressed its belief that the proposed restructuring
will provide greater strategic, financial and managerial
flexibility in organizing its operations and implementing its
strategy to expand regionally and across product lines in
financial services.
</P>
<P>
DBS Bank expects the restructuring to provide additional
flexibility and ease in structuring acquisitions and new
businesses, to facilitate increased management focus on strategic
goals to maximize shareholder returns and to position the DBS Bank
group to take advantage of potential capital, tax and other
operating efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, DBS Bank also made a proposal to release
the government from its restriction on selling non-voting shares
in the capital of DBS Bank.
</P>
<P>
DBS Bank acquired the respective business undertakings of the
government-owned Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) in September 1998
and in the agreement relating to the POSB transaction between the
government and the DBS Bank, the government undertook that, prior
to January 1, 2002, it would not sell to any person other than a
wholly-owned entity any non-voting shares issued to it or any
ordinary shares converted from the non-voting shares.
</P>
<P>
The proposed restructuring is subject to the approval of the
relevant authorities, including the Monetary Authority of
Singapore. The SES has granted in-principle approval for the
restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law Preserved in HK: Chief Executive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said here Saturday that he has confidence in the
preservation of the integrity of Hong Kong's legal system and the
rule of law under the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks at a press conference on the
interpretation of the Basic Law provisions concerning the right of
abode (ROA) issue by the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee issued its interpretation earlier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen once again that the central authorities are most
concerned about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. I can say
that with great confidence that under "one country, two Systems",
the integrity of Hong Kong's legal system and the rule of law will
be preserved," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Over a month ago, Tung said, the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government "decided to seek the assistance of the State
Council to approach the NPC Standing Committee to interpret the
Basic Law provisions concerning the right of abode according to
their true legislative intent, and to help us resolve the
difficulties we had encountered in implementing the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
"A problem, which concerns the long-term interests of Hong Kong
people and which has caused widespread public concern, has finally
been resolved in a manner which is entirely legal and
constitutional," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive emphasized that the SAR government
"treasures the rule of law as one of the most important pillars of
Hong Kong's success."
</P>
<P>
"In dealing with the right of abode issue, we have exercised
great care to ensure that every step taken is strictly in line
with the law and complies with applicable procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that it is "understandable" that some Hong Kong
people who do not fully appreciate the situation may be worried
that the rule of law has been affected by this issue.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to assure these people ... we will never permit the
rule of law be compromised. In fact mainstream community opinion
supports the interpretation by the NPC Standing Committee. They
have made a realistic assessment of Hong Kong's overall interests,
such as employment opportunities and quality of life, and support
our effort to resolve this matter within the established legal
framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the problem has now been resolved in accordance
with this approach," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that it is "perfectly understandable" that some
problems may arise during the implementation of the "historically
unprecedented "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we keep Hong Kong's best interests at heart, and so
long as we act in strict compliance with the spirit of the rule of
law and the Basic Law itself, we will be able to cope with any
difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Through this effort, we have enriched our experience in
implementing and enforcing the Basic Law, as well as in
safeguarding the rule of law in Hong Kong," he added.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Pak-China Ties Conducive to Regional Peace, Security: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Saturday the friendly relations between his country
and China help reinforce stability and security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully satisfied with our bilateral relations because,
apart of being of mutual benefit, they help to strengthen
stability and security in the region, for China is a great bulwark
of peace," Sharif said while talking to a group of Islamabad-base
Chinese correspondents at the Prime Minister's House.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister, who will leave next Monday for a
seven-day visit to China, expressed his belief that the bilateral
ties between the two neighbors should be further promoted,
particularly in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
"We have much to learn from China in the sphere of advanced
technology," he said. "That is why there is need to add more
substance to our relationship."
</P>
<P>
While speaking highly of the achievements made by China, Sharif
said, Pakistan has been looking "with admiration" at the
"spectacular progress" made by China in the last 50 years,
particularly during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister labeled the reunion of Hong Kong with its
motherland and economic strides of China as "nothing short of a
miracle," which "heralds a new and powerful role for China in the
councils of the world."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "China will emerge as a great
power in the coming century."
</P>
<P>
"This should impart a feeling of security and confidence to the
developing world which has always looked up to China as a champion
of its political and economic interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has visited China several times in his capacity both as
prime minister and as opposition leader. Sharif's forthcoming
visit to China is the second since he resumed his premiership in
February 1997.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mubarak's U.S. Trip Aimed at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Peace in the Mideast and trade will
be on top of the agenda during Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
six-day visit to the United States starting Saturday, which is
aimed at boosting bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
That Egypt is a key Arab ally of the United States in the
Middle East did not stop Cairo and Washington from differing over
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to bridge the gap, Mubarak will expound to
U.S. President Bill Clinton and senior U.S. officials Egypt's
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The election as prime minister of Ehud Barak, leader of
Israel's Labor Party, last month has raised hopes for reviving the
long-stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks. Both Egypt and the U.S.,
key mediators in the peace process, have welcomed the development.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries are in dispute over Arabs' attitude
toward realizing peace with the Jewish state. Washington wants the
Arabs to show greater flexibility to the peacemaking and economic
cooperation with Israel in a bid to encourage Barak, according to
Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, meanwhile, adopts a wait-and-see attitude before Barak
carries out his promises to push ahead talks with the Palestinians
and resume negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, which have been
stalled since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mubarak will reiterate Egypt's position that
the Mideast peace process should be based on the land-for-peace
principle and the relevant United Nations resolutions, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will ask the U.S. to urge Israel to implement the Wye
accord signed last year with the Palestinians, calling for more
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. Egypt opposes the
Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks before the implementation
of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hopes it will yield U.S. understanding and even support
for its stand in an effort to safeguard, to the gratest extent,
Arab's interests in the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another priority in Mubarak's U.S. trip is to strengthen
economic and trade ties with the U.S., Egypt's second largest
trade partner after the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that during Mubarak's visit, Egypt and the
U.S. will sign three agreements on trade, investment and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials of Egypt hope that negotiations will be held
for the establishment of a free trade zone with the U.S. in a bid
to boost Egyptian exports and finally balance the bilateral trade
with Egypt now on the deficit side.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Airforce Bombs Eritrean Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian airforce bombed
Eritrea's Assab airport, a strategic military target, at 10:00 am
Saturday morning, the Ethiopian government spokesman said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
The airport runway was severely damaged as a result of the air
raid, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement claimed that the fighting was
initiated by the Eritrean army in the vicinity of the Mereb River
Friday continued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since Ethiopia's victorious Operation Sunset in late
February, Eritrea has launched a number of offensives on this
front in an attempt to recapture Badme," the release claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea blamed each other for initiating more
fighting in the wake of renewed calls from the Organization of
Africa Unity (OAU) and the U.N. Security Council for immediate and
unconditional cease-fire between the two Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
Friday's offensive comes after a one-week lull in hostilities.
Prior to that, there had been intense fighting around the Mereb
River from June 9 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian defense forces claimed to have put over 24,450
Eritrean soldiers out of action, whereas Asmara said its forces
had killed and wounded more than 18,000 Ethiopian soldiers during
the week-long fighting.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two Horn of Africa neighbors broke out in
early May of 1998 over a disputed stretch of their border.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have agreed to a peace framework put forward by
the OAU, but neither seems to have turned their words into action.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Clash Kills 7 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven were feared dead Friday in
Ibadan, capital of Nigeria's western state Oyo, during a clash
between Hausa-Fulani cattle rearers and traders at a popular
market.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of cows, vehicles and shops were destroyed in
the violence that lasted more than seven hours in the market
called Bodija. The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday,
</P>
<P>
Police said seven persons died, 24 vehicles were burnt while 30
shops were completely razed.
</P>
<P>
Oyo State Governor Alhaji Lam Adesina, in a swift reaction,
visited the market to assess the extent of damage. He ordered an
immediate shift of the cattle market to another location to be
announced soon by the government.
</P>
<P>
The incident started at 8 a.m. Friday following reports that a
young man who was allegedly stabbed by a Hausa man died Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The man, reportedly a load carrier, was said to have been
stabbed in the eye as a result of a misunderstanding over a goat.
The Hausa man was immediately arrested and detained at the Bodija
Police Station.
</P>
<P>
When the traders learnt of the death of the young man, they
went to the police post to inform the police of the development,
but became furious upon the information that the Hausa man had
since been released without further enquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The clash almost degenerated to an ethnic clash between the
ethnic Hausa and the Yoruba.

<HEADLINE> Computers Cheaper, Simpler in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The TCL Group, one of China's
major household electric appliance suppliers, announced here this
weekend that it is to market a personal computer at half the price
of similar products next month.
</P>
<P>
The high-end PC is priced at 4,888 yuan (about 590 US dollars).
Yang Weiqiang, general manager of the TCL Computer Corporation,
under the TCL Group, said that the new household information
product poses a challenge to conventional high-end computers.
</P>
<P>
It has a unique hardware and software arrangement, combining
the functions of TV and computers. The new computer puts stress on
simplicity of use, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
A large number of household electric appliance companies have
diversified their operations into PC manufacturing. They use their
financial strength and extensive networks of procurement and
distribution to compete with PC suppliers for market shares.
</P>
<P>
Though PC sales have reached 4.5 million annually in China, the
penetration rate of computers among households is only 1.7 percent,
much lower than the 55 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The huge potential market has attracted giant electrical
appliance companies to the highly competitive PC arena.
</P>
<P>
Noting that these companies only entered the PC market two
years ago, and only account for around two percent of the total
sales of PCs in the country, Yang said that TCL will expand its
market share rapidly in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the electric appliance giants have gained access to
cheap supplies on the global procurement market by setting up
joint ventures with international companies.
</P>
<P>
TCL set up its computer corporation through a 125-million-yuan
joint venture with Taiwan-based GVC, the number four PC supplier
in the world.
</P>
<P>
It has also obtained billions of yuan in loans from Chinese
banks. With access to the cheapest components in the world and
abundant funding, the company is now able to market high-
performance computers at prices that are acceptable to the average
household in China.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a similar computer produced by Legend, the largest
PC supplier in the country, are priced at around 1,000 US dollars.
Legend accounts for more than ten percent of the country's PC
market.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that it is still too early to say who will be the
winner in the competition. However, he believes that in the next
few years the gap between household electrical appliances and
computers will become much narrower, both in terms of prices and
functions.
</P>
<P>
Now the average prices of household electric appliances are
between 1,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Allows Unemployed Teachers to Work Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Though facing a shortage of
more than 20,000 teachers, Tanzania is forced to allow its
teachers unemployed due to financial difficulty to try to find job
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Juma Kapuya, Minister for Education and Culture, told the
parliament Friday that the government failed to employ all the
teachers because of its thin budget.
</P>
<P>
"Not that the government has become self sufficient in
teachers, but the economy doesn't allow to have them all
employed," he was quoted by local media Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministry said the demand for teachers in
primary, secondary and teachers colleges stood at 129,687 as in
this month, while the existing teachers numbered 106,541, thus a
shortage of 23,146 teachers.
</P>
<P>
They said at least 21,212 teachers, 365 degree holders, 1,884
diplomas and 18,963 certificate teachers, remained unemployed by
June last year.
</P>
<P>
There are 18,059 unemployed teachers this year, however, the
government has given the ministry permission to employ only 1,890
of them for secondary schools and teachers colleges in 1999/2000
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the unemployed teachers were free to seek
jobs in the private sector and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"Those who secure employment outside the country will be
cleared by the ministry," Kapuya said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a World Bank report said Tanzania is among
nine countries around the world with a primary school enrolment
rate of less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest World Bank Poverty Update said Tanzania is only
ahead of Mozambique in sub-Saharan Africa where the world's lowest
enrolment rate is common.
</P>
<P>
The report said the lowest primary school enrolment rate is in
Niger where a mere 24.5 percent of school going children get
enrolled annually, while Tanzania has an enrolment rate of 47.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government has decided to introduce education levy in
the country effective from October this year as a strategy to
improve the sector.

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Rubens Barrichello won the
pole position on Saturday when he topped the French Grand Prix
qualifying times in Magny-Cours.
</P>
<P>
World champion Mika Hakkinen qualified only 14th fastest in his
McLaren.
</P>
<P>
Barrichello set his time early in the session before the rain
intensified at the Magny-Cours circuit and he was able to retain
the best spot ahead of nearest rival Frenchman Jean Alesi.
</P>
<P>
It was the Stewart team's first pole position and came
ironically on a day when Barrichello's former team Jordan saw one
of their drivers, 1996 world champion Damon Hill, fail to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Alesi, celebrating the 10th anniversary of his Formula One
debut at the 1989 French race, showed he had recovered from his
high-speed accident in practice on Friday and will start alongside
Barrichello.
</P>
<P>
Another Frenchman Olivier Panis qualified third in a Prost.

<HEADLINE> NPC Adopts Interpretation To Controversial HK Mini-Constitution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress (
NPC), China's top legislature, adopted here today an
interpretation to two parts of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Basic Law, which, following a
verdict of the SAR's Court of Final Appeal early this year, have
aroused great controversy in Hong Kong over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The two parts are Section 4, Article 22 and Item 3 of Section 2,
Article 24 of the HKSAR Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The first stipulates that "Chinese people in regions other than
Hong Kong must first apply for approval before entering the HKSAR",
while the latter states that permanent Hong Kong residents include
those Chinese nationals who are children of permanent Hong Kong
residents but were born outside Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a ruling it gave on January 29 this year, the Hong Kong
Court of Final Appeal said that all children born to permanent
Hong Kong residents in the interior areas of China, including
those who were born before their parents became permanent Hong
Kong residents, can naturally obtain right of abode in Hong Kong,
and that these children do not need the approval of relevant
departments in the interior areas to enter and stay in the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that this court ruling would grant at least 1.
67 million people in the interior areas the right of abode in Hong
Kong, and that an influx of these people into Hong Kong could
cause serious employment and other social crises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Holding a different view on how to interpret the Basic Law
stipulations, the HKSAR government on May 20 submitted a report to
the State Council in Beijing, asking the Standing Committee of the
NPC to use its authority to explain the controversial parts of the
law.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up System to Deal With Institutional Irregularities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to set up a
system to deal with irregularities and crimes committed by
government departments and institutions, according to Auditor
General Li Jinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 10th meeting of the Ninth National People
's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee on the auditing of the
execution of the previous budget, Li said that grave
irregularities and crimes have been uncovered.
</P>
<P>
Some departments and institutions have embezzled large amounts
of fiscal allocations, some have wasted a lot and others have
defrauded the government for their own benefit, said Li, the top
official at the National Audit Office of China.
</P>
<P>
The current system can deal effectively with individuals who
commit economic crimes, but often proves too weak to deal with
crimes committed by government departments and institutions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the State Council is considering setting
up a new system to prosecute departments that have embezzled
special funds and caused heavy losses and waste, and punish those
responsible as a result of dereliction of duty and bureaucratic
behavior, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women to Greet 21st Century With New Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lo Pak Sam, president of the Women's Federation of Macao, said
at the opening ceremony of the seminar that Macao would return to
the motherland on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is a general topic how Macao women take hold of the
historic opportunity and greet the coming of the new century," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the participants at the seminar
would have thorough discussions, draw on the wisdom from each
other and keep up with the modern era.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation,
headed a 30-member delegation to the seminar. She said that over
the past 50 years, the federation has made marked contributions to
promoting the reunification of the motherland, strengthening
international exchanges and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
"The approaching 21st century poses new challenges, and we'd
like to cement contacts with our sisters in Macao, learn from each
other and develop cooperation in various aspects," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the seminar, many representatives voiced
the view that the development of women in the face of the new
century depends on the women themselves who are ready to raise
their own competence. Only in this way can they achieve progress
while pushing forward overall social progress.
</P>
<P>
Some speakers noted that Hong Kong's return and Macao's
upcoming return to the motherland are a result of the nation's
growing strength. All Chinese women should get better united and
contribute more to the revitalization of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> NPC Adopts Interpretation To Controversial HK Mini-Constitution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The (HKSAR) Court of Final Appeal did not ask the NPC Standing
Committee to offer an interpretation of the controversial part of
the Basic Law before it gave its verdict, and the court's own
interpretation of the law also failed to comply with our original
legislative spirit," said Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy director of the
Ninth NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Committee, at
the Standing Committee's ongoing 10th session.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC interpretation adopted today, the term "
Chinese people in regions other than Hong Kong" used in Section 4,
Article 22 of the HKSAR Basic Law refers to all people living in
various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across
China, including Chinese nationals who were born to permanent Hong
Kong residents in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
"All these people, if they, for whatever reasons, want to enter
the HKSAR, must first apply to the relevant departments in the
places where they live, and wait for approval. And they will not
be allowed to enter the HKSAR unless they hold valid papers issued
by the relevant departments," according to the interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Explaining Item 3 of Section 2, Article 24, the interpretation
says that the precondition for the children of permanent Hong Kong
residents in the interior areas to automatically obtain the right
of abode in Hong Kong is that at least one parent was already a
permanent Hong Kong resident at the time birth.
</P>
<P>
The NPC says that after its release the interpretation should
be applied in relevant cases handled by all courts in the HKSAR.
However, it says, those who have already obtained the right of
abode in the HKSAR as a result of the Hong Kong Court of Final
Appeal's January 29 verdict "will not be affected".

<HEADLINE> Interview: Kashmir Dispute Central to Pak-India Ties:PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Saturday that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is central
to the Pakistani-Indian relations and lasting peace between the
two countries could only come about when the dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a group of Islamabad-based Chinese correspondents
at the Prime Minister's House, Sharif said: "Lasting peace between
India and Pakistan can only come about if and when India adopts a
positive attitude and agrees to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute."
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that it (India) enters into a dialogue with
Pakistan," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also called on the international community to "play an
active role in trying to unravel this tangled knot which continues
to threaten regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the on-going armed conflict in the
Kashmir area between Pakistan and India, Sharif said that "the
current tensions on the Line of Control are nothing but a facet of
the 52-year-old difference of opinion on the future of Jammu and
Kashmir State."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's position on the long-running Kashmir
dispute that the destiny of the Kashmir people should be decided
by themselves in accordance with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has shown tremendous restraint in the current conflict
and wants to defuse the tensions as early as possible, said
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his disappointment over the
failure of the talks between Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz and his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh in New Delhi on June
12.
</P>
<P>
"The visit achieved nothing because India chose to adopt a
rigid position and imposed unilateral demands before even sitting
down to talk," Sharif noted.
</P>
<P>
"It has also escalated hostilities, thereby worsening the
situation on the LoC and undermining regional peace and security,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who assumed office in February 1997, said he has been
keen to normalize relations with India with which Pakistan has a
long common boundary.
</P>
<P>
"My particular attention has been devoted to resolving all
outstanding issues, and more specially the Kashmir dispute which
has soured our relationship for the last 52 years," the prime
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Pakistan for Just, Equitable Int'l Order: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Saturday that his country calls for the establishment
of "a just and equitable international political and economic
order."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, like China, is also of the view that the trend
towards multi-polarization is in the interest of world peace and
stability, Sharif said in an exclusive interview with a group of
Islamabad-based Chinese correspondents at the Prime Minister's
House.
</P>
<P>
"All our energies are therefore directed towards attaining the
ultimate goal of peace and development at home as well as outside,
and this will continue to be the prime objective of our foreign
policy in the years to come," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Sharif said, has emerged as "an independent,
non-aligned, democratic, progressive Islamic State", fully aware
of its responsibilities as a significant actor, both on the
international stage and at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
"And this is the position that I envisage for it at the
threshold of the 21st century," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the development of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Sharif said SAARC
has made "reasonable progress" in the last 14 years and has to
attain the level of mutual understanding that exists among members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
"Unhappily, SAARC's forward march is inhibited by disputes and
disparities among its member states," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"There is an intrinsic link between peace and development,"
said Sharif, adding that "regional cooperation at the level of
SAARC can flourish only if an enabling environment of reliable
security and stability is put into place in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
Without that, the organization cannot be expected to flower and
bloom, Sharif noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's commitment to bringing about such an
environment for "promoting a regional process on security and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that for this purpose he presented to the SAARC
Summit in Colombo last year a Peace, Security and Development
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed the hope that his proposal will be
implemented by SAARC members in a sincere spirit.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic champion Michael
Johnson pulled out of the U.S. athletics championships in Eugene,
Oregon, on Friday after straining his right quadricep in training.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the world 200-meter record-holder, had been scheduled
to meet world 100-meter record-holder Maurice Greene in the 200
meters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal means he can not run the event in the coming
world championships in Seveille, Spain in August, but as a wild
card can earn him a berth in the 400m competitions there since he
was the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
Clyde Hart, Johnson's coach, said Johnson could recover within
a few days or it may take several weeks.

<HEADLINE> HIV Vaccine Set for Trial In Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Human safety trials on the
recently- developed AIDS vaccine will begin in Kenya from next
April, a local researcher has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Omu Anzala, an immunologist at the University of Nairobi, said
here Friday that phase one of the trials will begin after
researchers receive preliminary results from a similar initiative
which starts in August at Oxford University, Britain.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine has been developed jointly by Oxford and Nairobi
universities through a study involving two groups of sex workers
based in Nairobi's Majengo slums, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The groups are: 45 sex workers who are resistant to contracting
AIDS and another 90 low-term non-progressers who do not have AIDS
although having the virus since 1980, Anzala said.
</P>
<P>
Anzala said about 80 volunteers who will meet "certain set-up
criteria" will be involved in both studies, which might last
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank recently announced that it was considering
putting about five billion U.S. dollars into a joint project with
major drug companies to help develop a low-cost AIDS vaccine for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Julius Meme, director of medical services under
the Kenyan Health Ministry, the latest estimates show that 13 to
14 percent of all adult Kenyans were HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
"This means that 1.9 million people are infected, including
700,000 children under the age of five," Meme said.
</P>
<P>
In mid June, Kenya Health Permanent Secretary Philemon Mwaisaka
said more than 200,000 Kenyans would die from AIDS before the end
of this year.

<HEADLINE> 4 Germans Abducted Off Somalia Northeastern Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the northeastern
region of Somalia said that four Germans have been abducted by
militiamen loyal to the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF)
faction two days ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports received through the VHF radios here
in Mogadishu, the Germans were caught off the Alula coasts, about
100 km southeast of the port town of Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
A group of the SSDF militiamen specialized in sea piracy have
attacked the unarmed yacht in which the Germans were travelling
in.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in Bossaso town told Xinhua that the Germans and
their yacht are being held in a small coastal village called
BoliMog, about 40 km northeast of Bossaso town.
</P>
<P>
Unlike earlier cases, the German travelers are not accused of
trespassing into the exclusive water zones of Somalia or of
conducting illegal fishing. However, the businessmen who
contacted the militiamen holding the German nationals said the
gunmen have forwarded their demand of ransom exceeding 50,000 US
dollars for the safe release of the German.
</P>
<P>
The abductors have guaranteed the safety of the hostages and
proper feeding until they are released. The businessmen are taking
the matter to the nearest German diplomatic mission which is in
Djibouti for the handling of the situation.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how the Germans ended up in trying to pass
through the piracy-rich waters of Somalia's northeastern coasts.
But sources coming from the area said the German have traveled
from New Zealand to head probably for the Indian Ocean islands
before they were intercepted by the armed men in northeaster
Somalia now known as Puntland.
</P>
<P>
There is no official word as yet from the local authority of
Puntland over the abduction in their area of control. However,
it is widely known that in earlier times the local authorities
had merely played mediation roles because otherwise any attempt
of use of force would only endanger the life of the abducted
people.
</P>
<P>
The sea pirates in the northeast Somalia often snatch vessels
passing through their water zones. The vessels include both
foreign fishing vessels and civilian yachts as well as commercial
vessels. In both cases a huge ransom is paid for the release of
those vessels.

<HEADLINE> Machine Identifies Fake Invoices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Automation under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a machine which can
tell if a value-added tax invoice is fake or not within five
seconds.
</P>
<P>
The machine, which has already been tested at the State
Administration of Taxation and the taxation department in Jinan,
capital of east China's Shandong Province, has achieved an
accuracy of 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
The machine can deal with about 13,000 invoices a day, and has
greatly improved the efficiency of the taxation departments.
</P>
<P>
No special training is needed to operate the machine.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments can use connected terminals to handle
large numbers of invoices and collect relevant data, and then put
the information into a centralized data bank.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the invention has improved anti-counterfeiting
technology for the taxation departments and will also play a
positive role in combating forgery of bank checks and other kinds
of bills and notes.

<HEADLINE> Peace Cannot be One-Sided: Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- India's Caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee said Saturday that although India wanted
peace with Pakistan, it could not be one-sided.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, but it cannot be one-sided," he said in Pune, a
city 1,400 km south of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Referring to "Pakistan-backed infiltrators" in Kargil sector of
Kashmir along the Indo-Pakistan border, he said: "Initially we
faced some difficulties, but the situation has been tackled. Our
brave soldiers are capturing one height after another."
</P>
<P>
According to another report reaching here, caretaker Defense
Minister George Fernandes Saturday denied that Army Chief Gen V.
P. Malik had suggested crossing the Line of Control (LOC) along
the Indo-Pakistan borders in the Kashmir area to pin down
"Pakistani intruders."
</P>
<P>
"At no point of time the Army chief had suggested crossing the
LOC... Decisions on such vital matters are taken by the Cabinet
Committee on Security and all the three services chiefs are
present there," he told newsmen at Patna airport 1,015 km
southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he perceived the possibility of a full-fledged
war with Pakistan, he said: "At the moment we are engaged in a
limited fight... Indian forces are rapidly gaining control of the
area occupied by the intruders."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Doctors' Strike Hampers Civil War Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The political solution to Sri
Lanka's long-running civil war has run into an unlikely block --
striking doctors who favor centralization instead of devolution.
</P>
<P>
The two-week-long strike masterminded by the Government Medical
Officers' Association (GMOA) has not only incurred public
condemnation, but also run counter to the devolution package
designed to end the drawn-out civil war, analysts here said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of patients have been turned away since June 14 at
state hospitals where only emergency services are maintained.
Routine operations are canceled and out-patient departments remain
shut.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka provides free health services to its citizens, but
the ongoing strike deny treatment to poor families who cannot
afford expensive treatment at private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Anger has been mounting against the striking doctors,
especially following the authorities' confirmation that two
patients had died due to lack of medical care.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they were being subjected to physical attack. At
least one car belonging to a doctor was set on fire near the
capital Colombo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest of the country, fuel pump attendants refuse to
serve striking doctors whose vehicles are identified by a blue and
white cross on the windshield.
</P>
<P>
The strike has continued despite an order by a Sri Lankan court
suspending trade union action over demands that the government
should not decentralize health administration.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA alleged that political involvement in the health
sector will lead to favoritism which will affect the well-being of
the health services.
</P>
<P>
All appointments, transfers and other official matters are
currently decided by the central government's Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that they have no power to agree to the
doctors' demands as it is a constitutional matter. The
decentralization of health service was envisaged in an amendment
to the constitution in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that he could not
scrap moves to decentralize the health administration because the
issue was pending in court.
</P>
<P>
A regional chief minister has filed a court action demanding a
ruling that health services be managed by semi-autonomous
provincial councils established in 1988 which are aimed at ending
the civil war by devolving more powers to regional authorities
including areas with large Tamil concentration.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a civil war since 1983 between
the government and Tamil rebels who demand a separate Tamil
homeland in the north and east of the island nation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance government had proposed a
devolution package before the parliament but fell short of a
two-third majority to make it a law thanks to the uncooperative
main opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
Considering the worsening medical situation, the Sri Lankan
government finally took legal actions against the striking doctors
by issuing arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
Colombo District Judge A.W. Salam Friday ordered the immediate
arrest of the 12 executive committee member of the GMOA, allegedly
for defying the court ruling Tuesday which ordered a halt to the
strike until July 6.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA Friday night requested an urgent meeting with
President Chandrika Kumaratunga to discuss the doctors' strike
issue.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the striking doctors will soon have an answer
given the intervention from the highest level, but innocent
patients hope for an early return to normalcy to relieve their
sufferings.

drug addicts has dropped to 45,000 at present, from 57,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The local anti-narcotics authorities attributed the achievement
to unceasing efforts to crack down heavily on drug trafficking,
while carrying out massive preventive education campaigns, and
establishing highly-efficient monitoring and rehabilitation
networks.
</P>
<P>
Long utilized as a major transportation channel by
international drug traffickers, Yunnan is China's front line in
the battle against narcotics; it also has the biggest number of
drug addicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990-1998 period, the local police dealt with 47,000
drug cases, arrested 66,000 drug traffickers, and seized some ten
tons of opium, 27 tons of heroin and more than 1,300 tons of
chemical materials used in the making of narcotics, according to
the Yunnan Provincial Drug Control Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, educational activities have been held to dissuade
locals, particularly young people, from using narcotics. Schools
throughout the province are providing students with special anti-
drug courses which have helped schools in neighboring Myanmar
create drug-free campuses.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has established a surveillance system to monitor drug
users, as well as more than 90 drug rehabilitation centers to help
addicts to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
Drug users who are undergoing rehabilitation are also
encouraged to recount their experiences as a warning to the
general public to avoid drugs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Face Huge Air Pollution Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cities face a huge task of
improving their heavily polluted air, despite some achievements in
recent years, a leading Chinese legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman Zou Jiahua of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, made the
remark in his report on inspection of air pollution prevention law
enforcement in five major cities.
</P>
<P>
The inspections found some improvements in the air environment
of the five cities, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Lanzhou and
Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
"The worsening of air pollution have been halted, and some
major pollution indices have started to fall," said the legislator.
</P>
<P>
However, the air quality in these and other Chinese cities is
still much worse than that of major foreign cities. "We still have
huge tasks ahead in our fight against air pollution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 10 most polluted cities, seven of them are in
China, and Beijing ranks third, according to a 1998 report from
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain has affected over 30 percent of China's land, and
economic losses caused by environmental pollution reached 187.5
billion yuan (about 22.6 billion U.S. dollars)-worth in 1995,
which was about 3.27 percent of China's GDP for that year.
</P>
<P>
To combat air pollution, China must, first of all, raise
environmental awareness throughout society, and instill in the
people a sense of urgency, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
The country should develop and adopt advanced technologies,
readjust the energy structure and develop clean energy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the current legislation concerning air
pollution should also be amended, so as to lay a solid legal basis
for environmental protection, he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Give Economy More Fiscal Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to enhance and improve
its macro-economic tuning-up, and give more fiscal support to spur
economic growth, according to Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
here today.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 10th meeting of the Ninth National People
's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, the Chinese minister said
that in the second half of this year a more active fiscal policy
will be pursued.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis will be put on increasing fiscal input into the
economy, raising workers' incomes and readjusting tax policies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government will take measures to attract
more foreign investment, and encourage both exports and domestic
consumption, so as to prop up the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, China's total fiscal
revenues reached 415.78 billion yuan (about 50 billion U.S.
dollars), up 24.9 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures reached 352.98 billion yuan, up 17 percent over
the same five months of last year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of revenues was higher than that of the overall
economy, thanks to several special factors, such as higher import
growth, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Yet he warned that revenue growth could slow down in the second
half of the year unless the country takes effective measures to
counter slack domestic demand, shrinking exports and weak capital
spending.
</P>
<P>
On the final fiscal accounting of last year, Xiang said that
the central government's revenues were 548.91 billion yuan, up 13.
6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Its total expenditures were 644.71 billion yuan, up 19.6
percent compared to the previous year. The central government's
deficit is 95.8 billion yuan, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Calls for Efforts to Fight Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Saturday asked the people to make further efforts to combat
trafficking in drugs and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also chief of the National Authority for Combating
Drug (NACD), said in a message to mark the international anti-drug
day that the whole people, especially the young generation, should
not get involved in the drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's future will depend on you," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to NACD Deputy Secretary General Nguon Soeur, drug
abuse among the youngsters has become widespread in Phnom Penh and
some provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Please be happy with music not the drug," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Cambodia is holding anti-drug activities
on International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also appealed to the authorities concerned and the
whole people to join hands in combating drug trafficking and drug
abuse, and urged farmers to stop cultivating marijuana which he
said was criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Just like other Asian countries, the main drugs in Cambodia
include heroin, amphetamine and marijuana, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Prostitutes and night club girls are enjoying using drugs such
as amphetamine and ecstasy," said Nguon Soeur, adding that 70
percent of prostitutes and night club girls now use the drugs,
compared with only 15 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial figures also showed that 26 offenders have been
arrested in Phnom Penh this year, including Vietnamese, U.S., Thai
and Singaporean citizens. The authorities also seized more than
5,000 kilograms of marijuana, 800 grams of heroin, 4,819
amphetamine tablets and more than 1,000 grams of opium.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Condemns Israeli Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
has denounced the air raids by Israeli forces on civilian targets
in Lebanon as acts perpetrated by "forces of extremism" in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
During his telephone conversations with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Lebanese President Emile Lahoud Friday night,
Abdullah denounced the Israeli air raids as "a flagrant violent
violation" of the April 1996 agreement to ban attacks on civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
The king reiterated Jordan`s absolute support for Lebanon and
total condemnation of the attacks targeted innocent civilians and
infrastructure installations, which could build up tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also telephoned Israeli prime minister-elect Ehud
Barak and called on him to prevent a recurrence of the attacks
and to prevent "forces of extremism" in his country from wrecking
hopes of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also called U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
express Jordan`s utmost concern over the Israeli action against
civilian targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At least nine Lebanese civilians were reportedly killed and 57
others injured during the Israeli air raids Thursday on bridges
and power plants near Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabedh also denounced
the Israeli attacks, which he said could damage hopes for the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Sets up Anti-Drug Education Base For Teenagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Province of Fujian in east
China has established an anti-drug education base for the
teenagers in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, which formally
opened to the public today.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the base was aimed to teach the younger
generation to "cherish life and reject drugs", said a local
official at the base's unveiling ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The base will host permanent exhibitions on dangers and harms
of narcotics, as well as efforts made in society at large to fight
drugs. Teenagers visiting the base can also watch anti-drug movies
released by the local government in the form of video compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
The site of the anti-drug education base was a memorial hall
devoted to Lin Zexu, a famous Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) official
who launched a fierce, courageous battle against the opium
smuggling to China by the British colonists in the early 19th
century. Though he failed eventually, Lin has been cherished and
honored by the Chinese people over generations in the past 150-odd
years as one of their country's national heroes.
</P>
<P>
Due to their curiosity and ignorance, some Chinese teenagers
have fallen victim to drugs. A recent survey shows that most of
the nearly 20,000 registered drug addicts in Fujian are young
people under the age of 25.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon not to Curb Anti-Israel Resistance: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
said his government will not be pressured into curbing the
resistance against Israeli occupation in the wake of the bloodiest
Israeli strike against the country since 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Resistance is a legal phenomenon in any country whose
territories are occupied. This is why Lebanon has the right to
resist the Israelis on its own land," Hoss told a news conference
at the premier palace Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Hezbollah, or Party of God, had been asked to
stop launching Katyusha rockets in return for a de-escalation on
the Israeli side, Hoss said "Hezbollah is aware of its
responsibilities and is acting accordingly."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust
Israeli forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 allegely to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel to avenge the wounding of a Lebanese woman by
Israeli shelling in south Lebanon. Two Israelis were killed by the
rockets.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israel launched a 10-hour air blitz on Lebanon's
infrastructure, killing eight people, most of them firemen, and
wounding 64 others.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's power stations, major bridges and roads around
Beirut were destroyed in the heaviest offensive since the 1996
16-day Israeli operation against the country which killed at
least 240 people, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the Lebanese government would rely on the five-nation
monitoring group, which is scheduled to convene Monday, to tackle
the recent situation.
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising representatives from the United States,
France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was charged with overseeing the
implementation of the April 1996 truce agreement reached between
Israel and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Beirut would seek the interference of the United
Nations Security Council only if there are no other means for
solutions.
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect much more than a resolution (from the U.N.),
and there is already one, which is Resolution 425," Hoss said. The
resolution adopted after Israeli first invasion of Lebanon, calls
for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon,
</P>
<P>
Israel has been attempting to alter the resolution for a
pullout on the condition that Beirut provides it with security
guarantee beforehand, a move flatly rejected by Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a main power broker behind Lebanon, has been seeking to
achieve a full Israeli withdrawal which includes its Golan
Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<P>
AMMAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has put
under state control operations of 91 poultry farms across the
desert kingdom which had imported fodder from Belgium, Holland
and France amid fears of contaminations of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Sample of chickens, eggs and fodder had been sent to
internationally recognized laboratories abroad to check whether
they contain the carcinogenic dioxin or not, Jordan`s official
news agency Petra said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Agriculture Ministry also asked the
governments in Holland, Belgium and France to provide a list of
companies which used high concentrations dioxin in
exported-oriented fodder, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Fears over dioxin-contamination poultry feeds have sparked bans
by countries across the world on the import of beef or poultry
feeds from Belgium and other European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
Carcinogenic dioxin is a dangerous chemical substance which
could cause cancer and other serious health problems to human
beings, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan imports large quantities of beef and fodder from EU
countries each year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Complete Privatization In Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will complete its
privatization program by privatizing about 50 public enterprises
within two years.
</P>
<P>
Cephas Msipa, Minister of State for Enterprises and
Indigenization, said Friday at the 27th Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce annual congress, " the speed at which the enterprises
would be privatized will largely depend on how quickly we get
recommendations from the companies and approval from the
government."
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted Saturday by the Herald Daily as saying
that the privatization process would be carried out in view of the
current economic environment. At the moment indigenous people
cannot afford to raise the money required to acquire companies
that are being privatized because of punitive interest rates and
other economic factors.
</P>
<P>
The government has been criticised for slowing down the
privatization exercise, which started about two years ago. The
exercise is seen as the key to reducing the huge budget deficit as
well as opening opportunities to previously disadvantaged black
entrepreneurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has only privatized Dairiboard Zimbabwe
Limited, the Cotton Company, the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, the
Zimbabwe Reinsurance Company and several other companies under the
Zimbabwe Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has done a lot in privatizing
state enterprises, something which was not being appreciated.
</P>
<P>
He urged small and medium-size enterprises to take advantage of
the opportunities brought about by privatization exercise, saying
they could play a crucial role in the privatization exercise.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people have been
killed and seven others seriously injured in the past three days
following heavy fighting between the herdsmen and raiders in the
remote northwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The raiders stole 300 cattle, 8,500 goats, 200 camels and 37
donkeys, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fight started Tuesday when about 1,500 raiders from
neighboring West Pokot district attacked a village named Katilia
in Turkana district.
</P>
<P>
The dead included 13 raiders and two herdsmen, local district
officer Alois Otieno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday another cattle-rustling case in Marakwer district
caused the deaths of three people while 20 schools were closed
over fears of cattle-rustling.
</P>
<P>
Cattle-rustling is a rampant crime and a headache to the Kenyan
 government. In mid June, police chiefs from east African
countries considered it as one of four crimes which required top
priorities in the anti-crime operations.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Spend $1 Billion on Debt Servicing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will spend at least one
billion U.S. dollars, or about 40 percent of its
180-billion-shilling (about 2.5-billion- U.S. dollar) revenue to
service its debts this year, according to a Kenyan economic
researcher.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Saturday quoted Joseph
Kimura, director of the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research,
as saying that 80 percent of the service goes to domestic debts
and the remaining to foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The east African country's overall debt stood at 479.2 billion
shillings (about 6.7 billion dollars) by the end of March,
representing 67.4 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP),
official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Of the total debt, domestic debt makes up 31.7 percent and
foreign debts 68.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debts have posed a major obstacle to Kenya's economy, which
has been in a recession in recent years.

<HEADLINE> New Expressway In East China Passes State Quality Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A new expressway in east China's
Zhejiang Province today passed a state quality appraisal and was
formally accepted by the Ministry of Communications after two and
a half years of trial operation.
</P>
<P>
The 145-km, four-lane Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway, which links
the provincial capital of Hangzhou to Ningbo, a coastal port city,
was completed at the end of 1996 after four-year construction. It
cost a total of 3.86 billion yuan (about 480 million US dollars),
including a loan of 180 million US dollars from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Builders of the road say that it is the first expressway China
has ever built in a coastal region covered with a chessboarded
network of rivers. Such regions have a very soft ground base,
which makes road construction extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the expressway have earned good profits during the
period of trial operation. And they collected 390 million yuan in
tolls in 1997 and are expecting to earn 900 million yuan this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Leaves E. Timor For Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General's special envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, left
Dili, capital of East Timor, on Saturday for Jakarta after ending
a three-day visit to the territory.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Indonesian government, the military and the
police have a good intention to settle the East Timor case through
the direct ballot, as stated in the May 5 agreement," Marker said
before boarding a commercial plane at Dili's Comoro airport.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between Indonesia and Portugal on May
5, the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and
order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival factions
that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Assessment Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) is ready to
team up with all sides to achieve a just and peaceful solution for
East Timor," Marker was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Marker said officials he met in meetings both in Jakarta and in
East Timor had shown their commitment to a peaceful solution for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
After arriving in East Timor on Thursday, Marker met with East
Timor Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares, regional commander Col.
Tono Suratman and head of the regional police office Col. Timbul
Silaen.
</P>
<P>
He also visited Baucau, Liquica and Lospalos districts in East
Timor to inspect logistical supplies and to observe the security
situation in the run-up to August's direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The August ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, a second group of 30 U.N. civilian
policemen arrived in Dili on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-arrived U.N. personnel consist of three Argentinians,
a Swede, a Zimbabwean, six Filipinos, 15 Australians and four
Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
They are joining 41 unarmed U.N. civilian policemen and 70 U.N.
volunteers who have been dispatched to all regencies in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
All the U.N. poll officers have been tasked to help Indonesian
policemen during the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the U.N., which still considers Portugal as
the administering power of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Indonesia announced that it would grant East
Timor independence if the people there rejected Indonesia's offer
of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Northern Wheat Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to allocate some 60
million yuan to develop 66,700 ha of high quality winter wheat
bases in northern provinces such as Hebei, Shandong and Henan,
according to Vice-Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the establishment of the winter wheat
bases will facilitate efforts to improve the quality of Chinese
wheat."
</P>
<P>
China's current demand for high-quality winter wheat outstrips
supply and the country is forced to import 10 million tons of
wheat annually. Wheat accounts for 90 percent of China's grain
imports and 10 percent of worldwide wheat imports.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the next three years call for establishing wheat
production bases in the aforementioned provinces and developing a
comprehensive production, processing and quality control system.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces turn out 55 million tons of
wheat, or 47 percent of the national total, annually.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the production of high quality winter wheat
will be spread to neighboring areas bases and similar bases will
be developed in southern China if the initial project proves
successful.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Daily Calls for Iran's Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian conservative daily on
Saturday called on the country to withdraw from the World Bank
after the bank refused to grant a 200-million-U.S.-dollar loan to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Blasting the World Bank decision, Tehran Times said in an
article that Islamic countries should withdraw their funds from
the World Bank and invest them in the Jeddah-based Islamic Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank recently rejected to provide the loan to two
Iranian development projects in a protest to the arrest of 13
Iranian Jews on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Israel and some European countries have
expressed concern over the issue after Iran confirmed the arrest
of Iranian Jews for spying for the U.S. and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Terming the arrest as politically motivated, both the U.S. and
Israel denied any links between their intelligence services and
the Iranian Jews, and called for their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, which is believed to be close to the powerful
conservatives who dominate the country's main state organs,
underlined that the World Bank should "make their decision free
from political influence of the arrogant powers."
</P>
<P>
The daily said the World Bank move indicates that the arrogant
powers are not only opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, but
are also against the welfare and development of the Iranian
nation.

<HEADLINE> Sex Knowledge Being Spread in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Knowledge about sex has been
considered part of the young people's basic cultural development,
and Beijing is promoting such knowledge through varied means.
</P>
<P>
Articles about sexual knowledge are now quite common in
magazines, and books such as Handbook of Sexual Knowledge are
available on almost every bookstand on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The TV program named Life and Childbirth, jointly made by the
city's family planning departments and the Beijing TV Station a
decade ago, has won widespread endorsement. Its main contents
cover reproduction health, and biology, including interviews with
professionals, lectures, knowledge contests, and telling stories
of daily life.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Telecommunications Bureau has also held
quizzes and offered hotline consultation on sex for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Courses on sexual knowledge in many high schools in Beijing
have helped teenagers to form appropriate attitudes to love,
marriage and family life, which have been welcomed both by the
students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Chunxiang, head of a publicity center of the family
planning program in Beijing, said that most of local residents are
now able to deal with sexually-related problems correctly and
properly thanks to scientific guidance.

<HEADLINE> 5 Tons of Narcotics Burned in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Marking the international anti-drug
day on Saturday, five tons of narcotics were burned in Iran's
central Kerman province on Friday, local daily Jomhuri Islami
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 tons of drugs are to be burned in Tehran Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deputy secretary of the anti-drug headquarters at the Iranian
Presidential Office, who was only named as Heshmati, said at the
ceremony that the country allocates some 7,000 billion rials
(about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars) annually to fight against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He said some 270 Iranian anti-drug personnel have been killed
in anti-drug campaigns since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The official put the number of addicts in Iran at 1 million,
adding that there are 210 million addicts throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched large-scale anti-drug campaigns after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 and the
number of confiscated narcotics increased drastically in recent
years, with 195 tons in 1998 alone.

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealers Ordered to Leave UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A newly formed anti-drug
fieldwork team has ordered drug dealers to quit the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) or face dire consequences, the Gulf News daily
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If they fail to leave they will be handed over to overseas
authorities they are claimed by even if there is no extradition
treaty with that country," warned Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, police
chief of Dubai Emirate and head of the Fieldwork Team, which was
officially formed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the team is to knock out drug dealers
who spoiled the country's image by staying here, the police chief
said, adding that the team will issue administrative orders to
cancel their visas and deport them as well.
</P>
<P>
"Asking the drug dealers to leave the country is our present
to them on the occasion of the World Drug Fighting Day which
falls on June 26," Dhahi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Intensive efforts to combat major drug dealers are being made
for the first time throughout the UAE. As a result, the Interior
Ministry decided to form the anti-drug team on April 28.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of anti-narcotics officers from various
emirates in the UAE, the team will try to follow up drug dealers
and stop all related activities in the next two years, according
to Dhahi, who will head the team for two years starting from
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that between 1995 and 1998, 15 tons of
narcotics were seized in the UAE, 80 percent of which was
hashish. During the same period, 8,607,717 hallucinatory pills
were also confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Gems to be Export to Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Sri Lankan
businessmen have entered the gem market in Madagascar following a
successful business visit by an official delegation, informed
sources here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankans have out-numbered Thai gem businessmen who
dominated the Madagascar gem industry, Sri Lankan National Gem and
Jewelry Authority Chairman R. Dharmaratne was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dharmaratne led a 19-member gem and jewelry trade delegation to
Madagascar recently to explore business possibilities there.
</P>
<P>
He told the sources that the country is contemplating
establishing diplomatic relations with Madagascar to further
develop gem business.
</P>
<P>
When they visited Madagascar, senior government officials of
Madagascar offered an opportunity for Sri Lankan gem
industrialists to involve in large-scale gem mining and exports
while developing infrastructure facilities there, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the Madagascar government is keen on doing gem
and jewelry business with the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is known as an "island of gems" and historical
evidence shows that gems were an important product of trade during
early times.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign exchange earnings from gem and jewelry export
last year were less than one-tenth of the total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seizes 41,000 Kilos of Drugs in 11 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized a
total of 41,011 kilos of narcotic drugs, including 4,301 kilos of
heroin, 29,037 kilos of opium and 6,728 kilos of marijuana, in the
11 years from 1988 to May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also seized 33,970 liters of phensedyl and
33.61 million tablets of stimulant drugs and punished 73,803
persons during the period.
</P>
<P>
The figures were disclosed here Saturday by Colonel Tin Hlaing,
Myanmar minister of home affairs, in his opening address on the
occasion of the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Tin Hlaing, who is also chairman of the Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control, emphasized that the main
activities to realize the objectives of Myanmar in fighting
against narcotic drugs are the elimination of the cultivation of
opium poppy by improving the standard of living, developing the
cultivating areas and reducing the dependency on poppy cultivation
of the ethnic people living in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government has been implementing a 15-year
plan for opium eradication and implementation has been started in
the priority areas of 51 townships under five-year periods
beginning 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
To assist in this work, a baseline data collection on poppy
cultivation and addicts has already been completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Much money is needed to implement the said 15-year plan, he
said, adding that if international organizations help by providing
the necessary funds, the work can be completed in a shorter
period.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Claim NBA Finals by Beating Knicks 4-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- "Twin Towers" Tim Duncan and
David Robinson led the San Antonio Spurs to their first NBA
championship, obliterating any glimmer of hope for the New York
Knicks with their size, strength and skill here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs defeated the Knicks 78-77, wrapping up the NBA Finals
in five games. In a fitting end, they won with defense as Duncan
and Robinson cast their imposing shadow over Knicks guard Latrell
Sprewell, whose last-second shot was an airball.
</P>
<P>
The miss silenced Madison Square Garden, a familier sound for
the Spurs. They clinched all four of their playoff series on the
road, becoming the first team since the 1989 Detroit Pistons to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Duncan, the second-year superstar, was named the Most Valuable
Player. He finished with 31 points and nine rebounds and was
absulutely unstoppable throughout the series, averaging 27.4
points and 14 rebounds as he affirmed his status as the best
player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, the 10-year veteran superstar who reduced his
offensive role to accommodate Duncan, contributed 15 points and 12
rebounds as he finally won an elusive championship, reminding
everyone that sometimes, nice guys finish first.
</P>
<P>
"It was a long ways," Robinson said. "Achieving that goal has
been met. If it was easy, it really wouldn't be worth the journey.
That's what makes it so special."
</P>
<P>
"It feels great," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "It's kind
of stunning. You wonder if it's really true. You wonder what you'
re doing here. You just feel grateful to have a great group of
guys."
</P>
<P>
The winning shot was an 6-meter ball from the left corner with
47 seconds left by Avery Johnson, the diminutive point guard who
answered the critics who said he could not lead the Spurs to a
title. But as they did all season, San Antonio won with its
intimidating defense, holding New York scoreless for the final 3:
12.
</P>
<P>
After a 6-8 start, the Spurs went 46-7 over the final four
months. That included a sparkling 15-2 in the playoffs that
matched the second-best record in NBA history and featured a
record 12-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks put up a tremendous fight tonight, using the
spectacular play of Sprewell and Allan Houston to push the Spurs
as hard as they could. As the first eighth seed to reach the
Finals, they just did not have enough size or strength to topple
the "Twin Towers."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell scored a game-high 34 points while Houson added 16.
Robinson and Duncan combined for 15 rebounds over the opening 24
minutes, matching New York's total.
</P>
<P>
As they did in Game Four, the Knicks stumbled at the outset of
the third quarter, going 4 1/2 minutes without a basket. After
trailing 38-47 with 9:06 left, the Spurs went cold and the Knicks
regained the lead with a 10-0 run. Sprewell took over, making five
straight shots over the rest of the period with a variety of
strong drives, headfakes and spin moves.
</P>
<P>
After a nine-minute delay caused by a malfunctioning shot clock,
Houston hit a jumper to give the Knicks a 54-50 lead.

2003.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim highly valued the last election and the achievements
made by the new government in the short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim cited the three main achievements made in the foreign
affairs as the resumption of Cambodia's seat in the United
Nations, obtaining of more than expected sum of assistance at
donor Consultative Group meeting in Tokyo and full membership in
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chea Sim reaffirmed that the CPP will
continue to support the political policy of the government to
maintain political stability, integrate Cambodia into the
international community and normalize the influx of foreign
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim also set forth the CPP's position to further enhance
the cooperation with the FUNCINPEC party in order to achieve
greater success.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members and delegates attended the opening
session and they included Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is also the
party's vice chairman, and some foreign diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Experts to Serve China's Procurators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Striving to ensure judicial
fairness, the Chinese Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) Friday
set up an expert consultation committee to advise procurators,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The committee's 26 members, all of them China's leading experts
in specialties of law, economics, finance, securities and natural
sciences, are expected to discuss procuratorial issues and offer
advice on them. Issues may include major and complicated cases as
well as SPP-drafted judicial interpretations and major regulations.
</P>
<P>
They are also responsible for informing SPP personnel on
professional matters.
</P>
<P>
The practice was tried in local procuratorates before being
brought to the SPP.
</P>
<P>
It has played an important role in improving procurators' work,
said China's top procurator Han Zhubin at a meeting marking the
establishment of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The nation's procurators, when handling cases, are increasingly
faced with problems requiring professional knowledge because of
fast-paced social, economic and scientific developments.
</P>
<P>
Not only should the procurators work to improve their quality,
but they should also resort to professional resources in the
society, Han said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Has No Fuel to Start Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Army has taken the bite
of the economic crisis as its Second Cavalry Division has no fuel
to get its 300 tanks started due to an 80-percent cut in its fuel
budget, the Bangkok Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Also suffering are the 200 horses of the division, which have
been short of feed, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Major General Chalermpol Busayakul, commander of the
division, which is assigned to protect Bangkok, the newspaper said
the division is struggling to maintain war readiness.
</P>
<P>
The division usually starts the tanks every other day, but now
only once a week.
</P>
<P>
"We start the engine to warm them up but hardly drive them,"
the commander was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The best way to save on maintenance cost is to strip the tanks
down, grease the parts and put them in store. However, the
commander said they would not do so for fear of unexpected
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The division also takes care of 200 horses used in royal
ceremonies but faces a 20-percent cut in the feed budget.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the horses are too old for any active service.
But they have to be kept in service since the division lacks the
270,000 baht (7,300 U.S. dollars) needed to buy and ship a new
recruit from Australia or New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Cash problems have also affected the division's four Cobra
helicopters, of which only two can fly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Seek Punishment For False Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators are hoping
that mounting punishments against those who keep false accounts
will help retard the trend, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
During discussions of the 10th session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, legislators expressed a
unanimous view that they support the State Council's proposed
amendments to the 14-year-old Accounting Law, the English
newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
Many of the legislators also expressed the hope that the
punishments for keeping dishonest accounts could be more severe,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Keeping false accounts seriously distorts economic order,
undermines the basis for making macro-economic policies and helps
finance the corruption of officials, said the legislators.
</P>
<P>
"Because so many people are doing it, people get the impression
that making untruthful accounts is no big deal," Gao Yibin, an
official from the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1998, the ministry began to seek ways to remedy the
problem. It set up a set of guidelines to strengthen the checks
and balances on accountants, modernize accounting procedures and
increase punishments. This plan was adopted by the State Council
in May and was presented to the NPC Standing Committee for
adoption as a law this month, said Gao.
</P>
<P>
However, the current Criminal Law, which states that only
activities defined as crimes by the law can be punished, did not
define concealing, destroying and making false accounts as crimes,
according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To solve this dilemma, it said, the State Council has decided
to ask the NPC Standing Committee to adopt a draft resolution on
the punishment of false accounting as a complementary document to
the Criminal Law.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Misuse of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The illegal occupation and rampant
misuse of land in China must be stopped, today's China Daily
quoted a senior legislator as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made at the ninth National Land Day which was
observed Friday with the theme "rationally using the land, and
acting in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), said that the per capita amount
of arable land in the country is only 43 percent of world levels.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that most arable land in the country is rather poor
in quality.
</P>
<P>
More than half of China's 130 million hectares of arable land
is without irrigation, two-thirds of the farmland is not fertile,
and soil erosion affects nearly one-third of the land.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the sustainable management and
protection of arable land is an important, but difficult
undertaking for the government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 414 people were punished in 1998 for
illegal land occupation or use.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 cases involving illegal land occupation or use
have been checked out by the Ministry of Land and Resources during
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang said, the newly revised State Land Management
Law, which took effect early this year, should be strictly
enforced; arable land should be protected from illegal occupation
for non-agricultural use. Land rehabilitation work should be
carried out to improve the rural ecology and farm land's
productivity, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Top Brazilian Banker Supports Common Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian central bank
President Arminio Fraga on Friday expressed optimism over the
possible introduction of a common currency for the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
At a seminar during the summit of Latin America, the Caribbean
and the European Union, the top banker admitted that obvious
obstacles exist in the short term for the creation of a regional
common currency for the bloc comprising Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
"We do not plan to adopt the U.S. dollar as our common currency,
and Argentina and other countries do not want to adopt the real,
which seems to me to be an incompatibility in the short and medium
term," said Fraga.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mercosur member countries must learn from the
experience of the euro, the single currency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Chile and Brazil are associate members to the Mercosur.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government Friday
rejected any possibility of setting up a U.S. military base or
base for anti-drug traffic fight in the country as negotiations
are underway on joint patrolling by Costa Rican and U.S. forces

foreign ships armed with cannons in the country's national waters
without the approval of parliament.
</P>

Costa Rican Security Vice Minister Rogelio Ramos confirmed
Friday that Wilhelm had explored the possibility of using the
Liberia City airport, some 250 kilometers north of San Jose.
</P>
<P>

must respect our constitutional norms and be appropriate to the
uniqueness of a people who abolished its army half a century ago."

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala and Central America
have "big expectations" of the Latin America-EU summit to be held
next week, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala City quoted Stein as saying that the
programs of cooperation of the EU with the subregion countries
will be "consolidated" during the June 28-29 summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The summit "validates the political importance Latin America
and the EU give to their relations," Stein said, adding that with
the meeting of their leaders, a level of dialogue "never before
seen" will be established.
</P>
<P>
Stein said this first summit should result in "agreements that
will promote an economic and commercial integration between the
parts," and at the same time, give more emphasis to the political
aspects.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the summit between both regions
"is for us a privileged space which we expect to consolidate."
</P>
<P>
The EU, made up of 15 nations, is the main donor for Central
America, including Guatemala, a country that receives some 550
million dollars for several programs.
</P>
<P>
Part of the assistance, some 200 million dollars, is aimed at
backing up the Guatemala peace process, signed in 1996, and also
to finance a series of regional projects.
</P>
<P>
The EU is launching some 117 projects in Guatemala in social
and productive matters to reduce the poverty that affects at least
80 percent of the 11 million Guatemala residents.
</P>
<P>
Over 16 percent of Guatemalan exports goes to the European
Union.

LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Croatian 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic
scored her biggest victory by toppling fourth-seeded former
finalist Monica Seles in two tiebrekers, sailing to the last eight
at the Wimbledon tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lucic who ranked 134th in the world, stunned Seles who won all
Grand Slam titles except Wimbledon, by winning the tiebreakers 7-6
(7/4), 7-6 (7/4) in nearly 100 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Seles, 25, a finalist in 1992, lost her golden chance to
establish a 4-2 lead in the opening set when she held a triple
break point as Lukic saved all three and held for 3-3.
</P>
<P>
After forcing the first tiebreak with an ace, the tall Croatian
promptly surged into a 6-2 lead before wrapping it up on her third
set point.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Seles, who has nine Grand Slam singles
titles to her name, broke first in the seventh game for a 4-3 lead,
only to be clawed back in the next game for a 4-all deadlock.
</P>
<P>
With all pressure upon herself, Seles came within two points of
defeat before holding for 5-5 and squandering her two break points
to allow Lucic a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
Seles served an ace to force another tiebreak which saw Lucic
moved from 2-0 to 4-2 and 5-4 before the Croatian putting away

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Volkswagen, China's
leading car producer, is now busy developing new models in order
to maintain its superior status amid increasing market competition.
</P>
<P>
One of them, according to the corporation's general manager
Hong Jiming, is the Passat, a sedan car based on the overseas
Passat B5. It is able to reach a top speed of 206 km per hour at
times but can travel approximately one hundred kilometers on only
5.8 liters of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Mass production of the Passat is to commence next March and its
sales price will be around 220,000 to 250,000 yuan (26,500 to 30,
000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another model, an economy car targeting Chinese families, will
be available in two to three years. Its price will be pegged at
around 100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Volkswagen was jointly established by Germany's
Volkswagen and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in
1984, and has since manufactured more than 1.2 million Santana
cars. It has a 46 percent share of the Chinese car market.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Top Hong Kong Official Refutes Allegations in Cox Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Secretary of
Administration Anson Chan on Friday refuted allegations in the Cox
Report that Hong Kong is being used as a staging post for the
acquisition of U.S. sensitive technology for China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are totally unfounded," she said in a speech
at a business luncheon in New York, referring to a report released
a month ago by a special committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives chaired by Republican Christopher Cox on China's
so-called spying on U.S. military technology.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she said, an examination of the four cases detailed in
the report "simply serve to prove our point that Hong Kong
operates a highly autonomous and very stringent system of control
over strategic commodity trade."
</P>
<P>
"We are a separate customs territory; and we maintain a
separate physical boundary with the rest of China that is policed
by our own enforcement agencies. Our system is legally color blind
and politically tone deaf."
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that selling faster computers to Hong Kong is
the same as selling it to the PLA (the People's Liberation Army)
is complete nonsense," she said. "Our control and enforcement
system will stand comparison with the best anywhere, and its
effectiveness was acknowledged in the recent report of the
Congressional Task Force on Hong Kong and even by Mr. Cox himself.
"
</P>
<P>
Chan said "no one should doubt our commitment to protecting the
integrity of our control regime." Hong Kong is deeply conscious
that only by maintaining an effective control system and the
closest possible cooperation with the U.S. can it secures access
to higher technologies and technological products which are
essential to its economic and trade developments, she added.
</P>
<P>
She told the U.S. businessmen at the luncheon, "We in Hong Kong
have a mutual interest with U.S. business in this trade and would
like to work with you in conveying that interest and the efficacy
of Hong Kong's control system to those in doubt."

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Scrutiny of WB Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials said Friday that
they welcome the scrutiny of its use of a controversial World Bank
loan whether by foreign politicians, journalists or bank officials.
</P>
<P>
 A Finance Ministry official in charge of administration of
World Bank projects told China Daily that observers will find that
the loan will help improve the lives of its beneficiaries in every
ethnic group involved.
</P>
<P>
The bank's 24-member Board of Executive Directors on Thursday
approved the China Western Poverty Reduction Project, which is
expected to benefit 1.7 million of the poorest people in China,
the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The bank's biggest shareholder, the United States, and the
third biggest, Germany, voted against the project.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to block the 311 million US dollars project,
of which 160 million US dollars will be funded by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the board agreed that the so-called
Qinghai component, at the center of the controversy surrounding
the loan, will not be implemented until the board reviews an
independent inspection study of the project.
</P>
<P>
Before the executive board meeting, China's representative at
the World Bank pledged the Chinese government's full support for
the review.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of transparency. Transparency brings to light
facts and scorches rumors," the Chinese government said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Qinghai component of the project, which would use 40
million US dollars in World Bank loans, 58,000 people from six
impoverished counties in eastern Qinghai Province would relocate
to relatively wealthier Dulan County in Haixi Mongolian and
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of west Qinghai, on a voluntary
basis.

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- One billion yuan (120 million US
dollars) has been set aside for investment in technology-intensive
small and medium enterprises in China, the English newspaper China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The funds, expected to be disbursed among as many as 1,000
start-up firms, could result in the creation of 100,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Deng Nan, vice-minister of Science and Technology, said that
state money, jointly managed by the Ministry of Finance and
Ministry of Science and Technology, will be used to help selected
firms in the next three years achieve breakthrough in
technological innovations valued, potentially, at as much as 10
billion yuan.

Small and medium technological enterprises began emerging in
China during the early 1980s. Most were self-financed, independent

<HEADLINE> Courier Wins Marathon Match in Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Jim Courier won a marathon match
that lasted nearly four hours, advancing to the fourth round of
the Wimbledon tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Couier overcame two match points to beat Dutchman Sjeng
Schalken 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 13-11, after outlasting Carlos
Moya in five sets in his previous match.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Courier to advance to the fourth
round since 1993 when he eventually lost the final to Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
The English soil again brought out the best in 29-year-old
Courier as he rejuvenated his career by two thrilling five-set
victories to help an underdog U.S. Davis Cup team beat England at
Birmingham in April.
</P>
<P>
"That's Jim's strongest quality -- his heart," Sampras said. "
He's going to lay it on the line and fight as hard as he can.
Today was the perfect example. It's good to see him playing well
again."
</P>
<P>
Schalken looked tired in the latter stages of the match. The 1.
90 meters Dutchman double-faulted twice in his final service game,
then hit a backhand long on break point to give Courier a 12-11
lead.
</P>
<P>
The overflow crowd roared as Courier closed out the victory at
love, then punctuated it by gleefully punching the air with his
fists.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Building China's Longest Undersea Optical Fiber Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The construction of China's
longest undersea optical fiber cable has started in the eastern
coastal province of Zhejiang, local authorities announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The building of the cable, with a length of 99.3 km and at an
estimated cost of nearly 50 million yuan (6 million US dollars),
is intended to improve telecommunications in Zhoushan, an island
city in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
With an area of some 540 sq km, Zhoushan is China's fourth
largest island and Zhejiang's largest. The island's external
telecom service has long depended on microwave transmission, which
is quite unstable and lags far behind the needs of the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
The starting point of the new cable is Ningbo, a coastal port
city opposite to Zhoushan island. The whole project is scheduled
to be completed in late July this year.

annually, serving as a large reserve force for software research.
</P>
<P>
At present, Xi'an has a total of 500 software companies and

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of Angolan Police Helicopter Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some wreckage of the helicopter of
the Angolan national police force, which crashed in Angola's
northern Namibe Province, has been found, the Angolan government
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the whereabouts of the senior government officials on
board including Deputy Interior Minister Jeronimo Marcolino remain
unknown, the Interior Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the search and rescue team has
found two seats, a piece of a baggage and a landing lamp from the
helicopter at the coast along the Bay of Tigres in the south of
Namibe.
</P>
<P>
The team comprising rescuers from the Army, Navy and Air Force
will go on searching, it added.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Namibe provincial government, a team of
South African technicians is expected to leave Angolan capital
Luanda for the crashing site to help with the search and rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has ruled out the possibility that the
helicopter might be downed by the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), as they have hardly found
any UNITA military activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
Also on board the helicopter were high-level officials
including Deputy Director of the Angolan Intelligence Agency
Baltazar Gourgel, Director of the State Prison Administration
Fernando Coelho da Cruz Sobrinho, Police Commander of Namibe
Province Antonio Victor Teixeira da Cunha and Commander of the
National Police Air Force Pedro Brito Cavita.
</P>
<P>
Benjamim Bimbi, a correspondent from the Angolan Public
Television, was also among the missing.
</P>
<P>
They were heading for Bentiaba City Tuesday to attend the 20th

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Be Reformed for 21st Century </HEADLINE>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The African Regional Hearing
on the Millennium Assembly Friday urged that the United Nations
should be reformed, strengthened and refocused so as to be
adequately equipped to meet the regional and global challenges of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The call has brought to a close the two-day intensive
discussions in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, which was organized
by the U. N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Office
of the Coordinator of the Millennium Assembly headquartered in New
York.
</P>
<P>
According to an ECA press release issued here, the hearing
recommended that the U.N. Security Council need to be reformed to
reflect as wide a geographical distribution as possible.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the need for the U.N. to address the problem
of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the need to
develop a system for financing global programs through corporate
taxation which would empower the world body and at the same time
ensure its impartiality.
</P>
<P>
In his closing remarks, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Miles
Stoby, who is coordinator of the Millennium Assembly process,
urged governmental participants to take some of the issues raised
here to the forthcoming summit of the Organization of African
Unity in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The two-day hearing was the second in a series of five regional
hearings organized as part of the consultative process leading to
a Millennium Summit of Heads of State and Government to take place

<HEADLINE> WWF Appeals to Save Mediterranean From Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Friday appealed to the tourism industry to safeguard the
Mediterranean Sea and its coast from the pollution and other
ills inflicted on it by holiday-makers.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is a double-edged blade," said WWF-Italy Chairman
Fulco Pratesi adding that "it is in danger of destroying our sea,
but it could also be decisive for its conservation if we choose
the path of sustainability."
</P>
<P>
The WWF estimates that this summer 165 million people will
visit beaches and resorts along the Mediterranean coastline.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems is the strain these visitors put on
local water supplies. "Mediterranean tourists consume an average
of 300-350 liters of water a day if you count showers, swimming
pools and so forth," says Grazia Francescato of WWF International.
</P>
<P>
She adds that this figure is clearly excessive when you
consider that within a few years experts says 35 percent of the
Mediterranean population will have water supply problems.
</P>
<P>
The WWF is launching a campaign this summer to ask hotels and
restaurants all around the Mediterranean rim to cut wastage of
water.
</P>
<P>
It suggests a series of measures such as installing flush
regulators on toilets and only using dishwashers with full loads.
</P>
<P>
It also wants hotels and other tourist facilities to use less
polluting detergents when cleaning.

<HEADLINE> Seles Becomes Casualty on Day 5 of Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles once again failed to
realize her dream of Wimbledon tennis title when the American
fourth seed lost to Croatian Mirjana Lucic 7-6, 7-6 in the third
round on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seles has won at all other three Grand Slams of Australian Open,
French Open and U.S. Open, but the Wimbledon is the only one that
elude her.
</P>
<P>
The American player was one of three top women to fall by the
wayside as 13th seed Sandrine Testud of France lost 6-2, 1-6, 6-3
to Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand and South Africa's Amanda
Coetzer, seeded 12, went down 6-2, 6-4 to 16-year-old Kim
Clijsters.
</P>
<P>
However, second seed Steffi Graf brushed aside American Corina
Morariu 6-1, 6-3 while Venus Williams, last year's finalist
Nathalie Tauziat and Anna Kournikova also scored easy wins.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the French Open champion, said she felt good about the
way she was playing but was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
"There's still so many good players out there," she said.
</P>
<P>
Williams, seeded sixth, dropped just two games against Sarah
Pitkowski of France as did Tauziat of France against Seda
Noorlander of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Williams now plays 17th seed Kournikova after injury forced
Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina to retire with the Russian leading
7-5, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
"I'm improving all the time and I've found my rhythm," said
Kournikova. "Grass is not her (Williams's) favourite surface but
she's still got a big serve and I will have to outthink her and
play smarter."
</P>
<P>
Williams was looking forward to the match. "Me and Anna are a
great match-up. She's likes the grass and I know she'll get lots
of support from the British crowd, but that doesn't bother me. She
's got lots of strengths, but so have I."
</P>
<P>
Clijsters, the youngest women in the singles draw, was the
runner-up in the Wimbledon junior event last year and has yet to
drop a set in her senior debut in a Grand Slam tournament.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Bust Bank Fraud Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Police in Italian north city of Milan
Friday busted a gang specialized in bank fraud and arrested four
people, a fifth is still at large, believed to had taken upwards
of 10 billion lire (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) from seven
banks and some 300 companies.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the gang set up fake companies that were
given significant credit lines from the banks. When they reached
the maximum amount of their overdraft, the company would simply
disappear.
</P>
<P>
The 300 companies which were defrauded sold merchandise to the
fake companies but never received payment. Several of the 300
companies went bankrupt because of this.
</P>
<P>
The investigation which led to Friday's arrests began after
police in January 1998 seized a container that had arrived from
the United States with 7 tons of contraband cigarettes, valued at
over 2 billion lire (about 1.1 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- As three seeded women players fall
victims in the Wimbledon, the men's draw was also robbed of one of
its biggest names when Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov was forced to
retire on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, the third seed, retired because of a thigh injury
in the third set of his match with Frenchman Cedric Pioline, a
finalist here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, winner of the Australian Open and world number one

in the fourth game of the first set, which he won.
</P>
<P>
"I think I made the right decision not to continue," he said. "
It's a big disappointment."
</P>
<P>
Pioline, who won the second set, said: "I wasn't playing as
well as I have done in previous matches so this was fortunate for
me."
</P>
<P>
But it was business as usual for top seed Pete Sampras, bidding
for a record sixth title, as he swept past British part-timer
Danny Sapsford 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to reach the last 16.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion plays Canada's Daniel Nestor next and he
is feeling very relaxed about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty much where I want to be right now," Sampras said.
"I am playing well... not playing great but playing well and
winning my matches convincingly.
</P>
<P>
"Next week is a different situation. The competition gets
tougher."
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Mark Philippoussis used his power to crush Spain's
Francisco Clavet 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 and Karol Kucera reached the fourth
round for the first time in six visits to the All England club by
beating Daniel Vacek in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Local hero Tim Henman lost concentration in the second set
against France's Sebastien Grosjean, giving the patriotic centre
crowd a jolt, but the sixth seed recovered to win 6-1, 6-7, 6-3, 6-
2 and book a showdown with Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded American showed the guts that took him to the top
of the tennis rankings in 1992 by outlasting Sjenk Schalken of the
Netherlands 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 13-11, but he needed an
intravenous drip afterwards to ease dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Courier's first round match took just over two hours, his
second - another five-setter - just over three hours but his
battle against Schalken took nearly 4-1/2 hours - the longest so
far this tournament - and had the crowd howling for more.
</P>
<P>
"When the going gets tough, he seems to pull through and that
is the sign of a great player. I shall look forward to Monday,"
Henman said of his match with Courier.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Reopens Airport to Intern'l Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Russian T-154 passenger plane
landed at the Belgrade airport on Friday and it took off for
Moscow again the same day, as the Yugoslav capital reopened its
airport to international flights.
</P>
<P>
The Aeroflot flight was the first after the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia resumed international flights on Friday, with a flight
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav national flag carrier JAT resumed its
Belgrade-Moscow-Belgrade flights three times a week until mid-July
while the Aeroflot would fly Moscow-Belgrade-Moscow flights four
times a week.
</P>
<P>
JAT has planned to introduce two more flights for a week after
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav airlines, however, were not yet given permission
by European Union countries to land their flights in those
countries. The EU countries banned JAT flights last year after
they decided to tighten sanctions against the Balkan nation.

<HEADLINE> SADC States Urged to Map Out Common Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma Friday called on the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to map out a common strategy to fully utilize the
enormous potential in the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting of SADC mining ministers in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha, Juma said it is necessary for the 14
members of the regional group to "maximize mining resources and
meet global changes."
</P>
<P>
He told the ministers that the mining industry is crucial to
the economy of the SADC countries as it contributes to some 10
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously a sector which cannot be ignored," reports
reaching here quoted Juma as saying.
</P>
<P>
Twelve ministers responsible for mining attended the meeting.
Ministers from South Africa and Malawi were absent because of the
elections in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also urged the SADC countries to
collectively solve problems in the industry, noting that it is of
vital importance for all member states to ratify the protocol of
cooperation in the mining sector signed in Blantyre, Malawi, some
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
So far only seven SADC member states have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
On small-scale mining, the Tanzanian leader said that numerous
problems including a state of disorder and lack of proper
equipment and technology need to be tackled, but the sector needs
support as it is a big source of employment.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian vice-president blasted environmental destruction
in mining, stating that environmental impact assessment should be
made before the launching of any new projects.
</P>
<P>
He said large-scale operators must invest in upgrading
equipment for the sake of mining safety, especially in avoiding
using of mercury and cyanide in recovery of gold.

for export to the middle east.
</P>
<P>
A Egyptian delegation led by Sayed Soliman, Egyptian Consultant

Egypt wants to invest more in Zambia because it is a safe
destination for any investment, Soliman said when calling on
Zambian Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Suresh Desai
here Friday, .
</P>
<P>
"Zambia has been stable since independence and we consider it
safe for our investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Zambia has the potential to grow various
grain which can be exported and earn the country foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Desai said the Zambian government would ensure that
the Egyptian investment is safe.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that his government would also put
measures in place to ensure that small-scale farmers who will
benefit from the Egyptian support pay back their loans on time.
</P>
<P>
Desai noted that small-scale farmers in Zambia have usually
defaulted on loan repayments, adding that this has to be stopped
if agriculture is to develop.

Zambian capital Lusaka may take place Sunday, Zambian
Vice-President Christon Tembo said here Friday.

Tembo said that the summit will only take place after the
