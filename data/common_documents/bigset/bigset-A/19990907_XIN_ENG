<HEADLINE> Tightened Budget Hurts Zimbabwean Cops: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Reduced Budget has compromised
the efficiency of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) in carrying
out its duties, Zimbabwe Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dagenwa said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Low morals among police officers, coupled with reduced
efficiency and effectiveness is a recipe for corruption,"Dagenwa
said when officially opening an institutional security management
and crime prevention seminar.
</P>
<P>
The police has been allocated only 2.4 billion Zimbabwean
dollars (US$63 million) for the fiscal year ending December, which
falls far short of the force's demands with the spiralling
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the harsh economic conditions in the country
characterized by massive retrenchments had also resulted in
increased criminal activity as most people were failing to get
decent jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said the cessation of hostilities in the region had resulted
in a large number of fire arms finding their way into Zimbabwe and
these were being used to commit crimes like armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
The strategic location of Zimbabwe, he said, while being an
attractive destination for tourists, had also seen an upsurge of
criminal activities like drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop was being attended by security
representatives from Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Interpol
and observers from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Monday announced a major cabinet reshuffle, cutting the number
of ministries from 27 to 15, in an effort to streamline his
government and to recover the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Chris Okemo, who was appointed on August 18,
remains his new role, and Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana still
retains his post, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Former Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi has been moved to
the ministry of Information, Transport and Communications, and his
post is replaced by Chris Obure, former minister for Cooperative
Development.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister Nicholas Biwott of East African and Regional
Cooperation becomes the Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry,
and George Saitoti remains the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said he made the changes in the cabinet in a bid
to "put in place the right conditions for our economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the rearrangement of the cabinet and
civil service meant Moi would sacrifice those who are in the
cabinet purely because they are political allies or because
political reasons demanded their communities be represented in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Some economists widely considered the reshuffle was made under
pressure from the World Bank and international donors to trim the
government, curb corruption and improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, Moi has made several cabinet reshuffles, major
or minor,
</P>
<P>
in order to stop the plunged economy and build confidence in the
economy and overseas investors and donors.
</P>
<P>
In July, Moi appointed Richard Leakey as the head of civil
service and cabinet secretary, and several private sector
technocrats to government posts in a bid to revamp the economy.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Moi ordered unpopular Finance Minister Francis
Masakhalia and Energy Minister Chris Okemo swapped portfolios.
</P>
<P>
As Okemo, a Canadian-trained economist, became new Finance
Minister, some analysts said that the Kenyan government was
trying to strengthen its commitment to restoring relations with
donors, especially with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
which suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy is declined rapidly after the IMF cut all loans
to the country in July, 1997 on grounds of widespread corruption
and poor governance.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth dropped from 4.6 percent in 1996
to 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1.8 percent in 1998. It is expected to
be even lower this year.

<HEADLINE> Old Differences Won't Affect Jordanian-Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein told the press here Monday that past differences will
not affect the development of relations between Jordan and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival for a two-day official visit, Abdullah also said
the visit was "the start of a new page in the history of the long
and deep relations between the two states, and will develop in the
interests of both the Kuwaiti and Jordanian people."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, the first Jordanian monarch to visit Kuwait in more
than nine years, is scheduled to hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and other senior officials on bilateral
ties as well as a number of other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Although Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah had
ruled out any specific agenda for the bilateral talks, earlier
local reports said issues such as the Jordanian labor,
compensation claims might be touched upon.
</P>
<P>
Since Jordan showed sympathy with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf
War triggered by Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, Kuwait
estranged its ties with Amman after the war, thus resulting in the
forced return of tens of thousands of Jordanian workers who used
to work in the Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait appears not to be ready to accept Jordanian workers
in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials also denied allegations that Jordan had made
official compensation claims for the Jordanian laborers.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan have been improving their relations over the
past two years, which was marked by a number of medium and
high-level exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah
went to Amman last February to attend the funeral of the late
Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Amman reopened its embassy in Kuwait last March, when Jordan's
Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib paid an official visit here,
marking a restoration of ties.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Jordanian cabinet approved Mohammed Al-Mufdhi
Al-Qaraan as Jordan's new ambassador to Kuwait, the first since
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
While Abdullah is widely believed to be here to crown the
current rapprochement between the two countries, political
observers here have not ruled out that "Kuwait aims to further
isolate Iraq by warming up its ties with Jordan, Baghdad's
long-time ally."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Claims Strikes No Threat to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Last year's strikes,
which caused the loss of 3.8 million work days, should not be seen
as a threat by investors, Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Labour Relations Act is making sure there is certainty in
the labour market. There is certainty for investors in South
Africa." Membathisi said when speaking here at the release of the
Labor Department's annual report on industrial action.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was focusing on maintaining
existing jobs and short-term job creation projects.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration
(CCMA) annual report was also released on Monday, and Vincent
Mntambo was announced as the new chairman.
</P>
<P>
The minister commended the CCMA for improving dispute
resolution, saying that "faced with a 35 percent increase in its
caseload in this period, the CCMA was nevertheless still able to
achieve a settlement rate of 71 percent. "
</P>
<P>
It had also made a broader contribution to labor market
stability, he said, adding that 58 percent of mutual interest
disputes that could have resulted in strikes were settled through
conciliation by the CCMA.
</P>
<P>
A total of 527 strikes took place in South Africa last year,
involving 3. 2 million workers with the lost wages estimated at
48.3 million rands (8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most of these strikes were over wages, followed by disputes
over retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector lost the most work days, followed by
the financial services industry and mining.
</P>
<P>
The average strike was seven days long and the longest was 86
days.

HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South African High Commissioner
to Zimbabwe Azwindini Ndou Monday called for regional networking
of police forces to stop the increasing flow of fire arms.
</P>
<P>
He told a security workshop here that increasing flow of fire
arms into South Africa is being used to commit violent crimes in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that the high levels of illegal immigrants had also
resulted in increased violent crimes in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ndou dismissed the theory that since independence crime in
South Africa had gone uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
"It is only that during the apartheid era some crimes in Soweto
went unreported, but now the system is more transparent, resulting
in those crimes being exposed," he said.

Luanda, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will provide Angola with
a humanitarian aid worth some 20 million U.S. dollars, to help
the country out of the penury caused by long-term civil war,

<HEADLINE> Turkey Must be Included in Balkan Reconstruction Plans, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Development Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said Monday that Turkey must be included in
the Balkan reconstruction plans in order to heal the wounds caused
by last month's devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a conference on international conflicts in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Venizelos said that
reconstruction must include the entire southern Balkans, of course
including Turkey, but the neighboring country's inclusion in these
plans had to be under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece could play an active and very important
role not only through the community or in partnership with other
countries, but also with its own unilateral initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) leaders decided late June to base its
agency for the Balkan reconstruction in Thessaloniki, the largest
city in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a tense relations with Turkey over their
disputes in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, has repeatedly
said that it will not lift its veto on the more than 1-billion
U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Ankara unless the latter improves
its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To ease its strained ties with Turkey, Greece Sunday welcomed
acceptance by the EU foreign ministers of its proposal that Turkey
should receive reconstruction aid after the earthquake from the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The aid was reported to be nearly 200 million euros in the form
of grants and another 600 million euros in loans from the European
Investment Bank.

<HEADLINE> UNEP to Assess Environment Impact in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) and U.N. Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) will send
a new group of task force for Serbia and Montenegro Tuesday for
technical assessment of the environmental impact caused by the
Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
The mission of five scientists from Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark,
Norway and Slovakia will assess the damages to biological
diversity in the protected areas in the region, said a release
issued by UNEP and Habitat in Kenyan capital Nairobi Monday.
</P>
<P>
The experts are scheduled to visit Fruska Gora National Park
near Novi Sad, Kopaonik national park, Zlatibor, and Lake Skadar
in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the conflict may have had a direct
impact on plant and animal populations in these protected areas
with possible negative consequences for the region's biological
diversity.
</P>
<P>
The release said the new mission will gather relevant
information on the pro-conflict status of these areas and visit
selected sites for assessing first-hand the current situation.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, UNEP and Habitat sent their missions of
international experts to Yugoslavia and Serbia to assess the
environmental damages at selected industrial sites and the
possible impact on the River Danube.
</P>
<P>
At present, a Balkans Task Force mission is working in Kosovo
on issues of urban management and rehabilitation, housing law,
property registration and environmental management, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
UNEP said a final report on the work of the Balkans Task Force,
 containing all the scientific findings and some possible
proposals, will be submitted to the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The Balkans Task Force was established by Klaus Toepfer, U.N.
Under Secretary-General, and the head of UNEP and Habitat in May,
aiming at assessing the environmental and human settlements
impacts of the Balkans conflict.

<HEADLINE> Nominating U.S. Envoy to Sudan "Unsound": Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Nominating a U.S. envy to
Sudan is a "unsound" way in solving problems facing the north
African nation, a Sudanese government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said that the U.S. move
disturbs the the ongoing efforts to organize the life-line relief
program between the Sudanese government and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Reports saying Sudan was not against the nomination of a
U.S. special envoy were inaccurate, said the official, adding that
his country was reserved on the way of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
It also goes against the peace initiative of the
Intergovernmental Authority of Development (IGAD) in which the
United States itself takes part through the IGAD partnership, the
official asserted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Sudanese government was not consulted
but simply informed. Thereby it will keep an eye on and assess the
situation before making a decision on dealing with the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Sudanese Human Rights Organization Ahmed Al-Nasri
had expressed, according to press reports Sunday, his country's
readiness to receive and cooperate with the U.S. envoy in case his
agenda did not infringe on Sudan's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and the Khartoum peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has criticized the U.S. move as an
"arrogant" decision.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton appointed Harry Johnston as special
envoy to Sudan in August. Johnston was Chairman of a subcommittee
on Africa when he served in the Congress. He is assigned to push
Sudan to improve its human record and try to end the 16-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has imposed
economic and military sanctions on it.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Opposition Calls for Political Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian opposition parties,
human rights organizations, politicians and professionals launched
a campaign Monday calling for political and constitutional reforms
to turn Egypt into a parliamentary republic.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the country's four leading opposition parties
submitted an appeal to President Hosni Mubarak, demanding the
reforms, the campaign's preparatory committee said in a news
conference held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The appeal called for an "end to the state of emergency,
release of political detainees and pardoning of all political
prisoners held on nonviolent charges."
</P>
<P>
The appeal also called for providing safeguards for free
elections, the freedom to set up political parties, freedom to
establish and possess newspapers and guarantees for the
independence of trade unions and professional syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they will begin a campaign to collect
signatures in support for their demands and will hold a public
meeting on September 22 to garner support from the people.
</P>
<P>
They said their reforms are aimed at transferring Egypt into a
parliamentary republic in which "the people would be the source of
all power."
</P>
<P>
The planned September 22 gathering will come four days before a
public referendum to formally approve Mubarak's June 2 nomination
by parliament for a fourth six-year term in office.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's constitution, the People's Assembly (Parliament),
which is dominated by Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party,
nominates presidential candidates. Egyptians are then asked in a
referendum whether they support the candidate, and can vote only
"yes" or "no."
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties consider the nomination of a single
candidate undemocratic because it leaves Egyptians with no choice
in electing their president.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who was vice president of late President Anwar Sadat,
was first elected president in 1981 after Sadat's assassination by
Islamic radicals. He was re-nominated unopposed by the parliament
in 1987 and 1993 and secured an overwhelming number of "yes" votes
in the referendums.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Organized crime is on the
increase in Britain and there are not enough funds to fight it,
the head of a national law enforcement agency warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
John Abbot, director general of the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (NCIS), said some 25 million pounds (about 40
million U.S. dollars) are needed over the next three years to
combat the growing threat from increasingly professional gangs.
</P>
<P>
He said criminal intelligence helped closed heroin and crack
cocaine factories, with 350 million pounds (560 million dollars)
of illegal drugs seized last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts at NCIS also warned there were indications that
organized criminal gangs were beginning to operate in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ian Morrison, head of NCIS's south-east region, warned that the
growing number of asylum seekers from the Balkans could help the
gangs target Britain.
</P>
<P>
NCIS said organized criminals were already deeply involved in
people-smuggling, because it provided high profits with little
risk compared with drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S. Allegations of Developing Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday dismissed as
lies the U.S. allegations that it is still developing weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi Information Ministry said in a
statement that the U.S. allegations written in the six-page report
of the White House "do not stand on solid bases."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.S. government recently submitted
a six-page report to the Congress, which accuses Iraq of
continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all the information in the U.S. report
is old and taken from previous reports of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) in charge of destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The timing of this report and the publishing of parts of it in
Washington Post and New York Times coincide with the feverish
media campaign waged against Iraq by the U.S., said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the U.S. waged this political and media
campaign against Iraq in order to blur facts and prepare the
ground for the British-Dutch proposal which had been rejected by
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands in June proposed to the Security
Council that the sanctions on Iraq be lifted after Iraq fully
cooperates with an enlarged body of weapons inspectors which will
replace UNSCOM and carry out more intrusive inspections of Iraq's
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. report tried to deceive the
international community that all Iraq's weapon files are still
open which will lead to the resumption of weapons inspection and
the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of weapons inspections will mean the resumption
of espionage activities for the CIA, said the spokesman, adding
that this attempt will be totally rejected by Iraq.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo
on Monday shot dead three ethnic Serbs who attacked Albanians in
the Yugoslav province, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian patrol heard shots coming from Korminjane village,
northeast of Gniljane, on Monday morning and rushed to the scene,
Tass said, quoting the press center of the Russian military
contingent in Pristina, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The three serbs had attacked a car with three Albanians. The
Russian peacekeepers, when they arrived, found that the Serbs had
already killed one Albanian and were beating the other two
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Russians ordered the Serbs to stop beating the Albanians,
but they responded by firing, and in accordance with the KFOR rule
of engagement, the Russians opened fire, killing all the three
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
None of the Russian peacekeepers was hurt in the incident, Tass
said, adding that the international U.N. police and the KFOR
military police are conducting an investigation.

<HEADLINE> S. African States Urged to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Ali Juma Monday called the southern African countries to
protect environment, as problems arising from the sector have
caused heavy social and economic loss in the region.
</P>
<P>
Juma made the remarks in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam
while opening the Third Regional Training Session for Cohort 7 of
the Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD) Southern
Africa Chapter.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read on his behalf by Permanent Secretary in the
Vice President's Office Peter Ngumbullu, Juma said the process of
dealing with environmental problems must involve all stakeholders
through national and regional capacity mobilization.
</P>
<P>
There exist direct links between poverty and environmental
degradation, he said, adding that poverty is a habitual cause of
environmental degradation as it undermines people's capacity to
manage resources prudently.
</P>
<P>
"Problems of poverty, ill health and others that plague the
majority of the people in Tanzania and the southern African region
are as much environmental as they are developmental," he said.
</P>
<P>
LEAD is an international organization aimed at safeguarding
environment and promoting sustainable economic development that is
environment friendly.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this training session is "Challenge and Options
for Sustainable Development."
</P>
<P>
It draws mid-career professionals from six Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries, namely, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Promote Tourism Amidst Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola will work hard in the
coming decade to make it an attractive destination for foreign
tourists despite the ongoing decades-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The southwest African country will pay more attention to
"specialized" tourism such as cultural tourism, sports tourism,
fairs and exhibitions, while continuing to promote the tourism of
natural scenery, parks and reserves, the Ministry of Hotel and
Tourism said in a document available on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, Angola hosted only 52,000 tourists
in 1998 due to the recrudescence of civil war between the
government and the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA); even so, it was seven times the number of the
previous year which was only 7, 000.
</P>
<P>
Main hotels registered some 24,000 arrivals, earning 3.4
trillion readjusted kwanzas (about 4 million U.S. dollars) to the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tourists came from Portugal, South Africa, the
United States, Brazil and France, who are mainly for business and
family visits.

<HEADLINE> British Thinktank Urges EU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A thinktank close to Britain's
Labor government called on Monday for sweeping reforms in the
European Union, noting it needs a new look for the next century
but should abandon attempts to become a superstate.
</P>
<P>
The pro-European Foreign Policy Center, known to have been set
up with the blessing of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, said there was a need for a fresh approach
which would "escape the ghost of federalism" and allow national
identities to flourish.
</P>
<P>
In a new pamphlet, entitled "Network Europe: the new case for
Europe," Author Mark Leonard of the Center said both a federal
superstate and a simple free trade area, favored by British
eurosceptics, were both outdated ideas.
</P>
<P>
Leonard, an intellectual whizz-kid in his mid-20s, became well
known two years ago with an influential pamphlet which called for
the "rebranding" of Britain, a Reuters report said. said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of increasing the powers of the European parliament or
electing the European Commission, the bloc should hold
cross-border referendums and should set up a new council of deputy
prime ministers to run its business, it said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the EU is good at representing countries and
special interests, but not citizens," Leonard wrote, arguing that
the six-month rotating presidency should be scrapped in favor of
an presidency of three states elected by all members.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Doctors Sentenced for Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 6 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented move,
Lebanon's military court Monday sentenced three doctors each to
prison terms of five days on charge of negligence, an action
which stirred uproar among the country's medical community.
</P>
<P>
The military tribunal headed by Brig. Gen. Maher Safieddin said
that the three doctors from two hospitals were held responsible
for the death of Khalil Hamad, a 33-year old army sergeant and
father of three.
</P>
<P>
It said that their negligence during the work caused his
death.
</P>
<P>
The trial was the first of its kind in Lebanon's military
court history because the country does not have laws that pertain
specifically to medical malpractice and dissatisfied patients or
their families usually have to resort to the civil courts.
</P>
<P>
The trial sparked strong protest and criticism from the
country's medical associations.
</P>
<P>
Ghattas Khouryt, the head of Medical Syndicate for Beirut and
North Lebanon, said, "we are not against doctors facing up to their
responsibilities, but we don't accept that they be treated like
criminals."
</P>
<P>
"We're against their arrest, because we know this will create a
crisis between doctors and patients," he added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Tiptoes Through Moral Minefield Over Teen Births </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government,
torn between its strong views on morality and fears of repeating
its predecessor's mistakes, tiptoed carefully on Monday around the
explosive issue of how to stop teenage pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Observer newspaper on Sunday, Prime
Minister Tony Blair called for a "new moral purpose" following two
reports of 12-year-olds becoming pregnant, one of them by a
14-year-old boy who blamed too much sex education at his school.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman on Monday denied that Blair was trying to launch
a new moral crusade to rival the ill-fated "back to basics"
initiative of his Conservative predecessor John Major, the Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted the government had a responsibility to get
involved in cutting Britain's rate of teenage pregnancies, the
highest in Europe. "Call it a moral question if you like," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a real issue which is damaging British society," the
spokesman said, referring to Blair's concern over teenage
behavior. "It is something that has been part of his political
agenda the whole way through."
</P>
<P>
But he denied Blair, whose government is lowering the age of
consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, wanted to turn the clock
back and reimpose a Victorian moral order, as demanded by some
rightwing commentators.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw also rejected the idea of the
government preaching sexual morality, stressing that it wanted to
protect and help children rather than lecture adults.
</P>
<P>
Blair's government has toughened the law to make parents take
responsibility for their children and allow local authorities and
police to keep young criminals off the streets with curfews.
</P>
<P>
But the new legal powers have only rarely been used, leaving
the government apparently powerless to change behavior patterns
through exhortation alone.

PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A 200-kilogram giant turtle,
discovered injured on Sunday in the English Channel by French
yatchmen, has been brought to France, reported Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The two meter long turtle, which is of the Luth race and an
adult, was first sighted off the beach of Chausey islands and
police Monday brought it to Granville, where a veterinarian is
treating it.
</P>
<P>
But experts said that the turtle does not have any chance to
survive because of its injured flippers and infection from the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
The Luth race turtles live in Guiana in south America and move
in the Atlantic in summer migrant season.
</P>
<P>
This turtle could have been pushed by the sea currents to the
English Channel.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Announces L&AMP;G Takeover Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The UK's National Westminster
Bank Monday announced a 10.75 billion pounds agreed bid for
British life insurer and fund manager Legal &AMP; General Plc,
creating a new British financial giant.
</P>
<P>
The bid is the second big UK bank-assurance takeover. Less than
three months ago the UK's largest bank, Lloyds TSB, said it would
buy mutual life and pensions group Scottish Widows for 7.0 billion
pounds.
</P>
<P>
David Rowland, chairman of NatWest, called it a "vital
strategic move by NatWest", saying that "Legal &AMP; General was a
group with "strong management, a great record and excellent
prospects."
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of at
least 130 million pounds a year by the end of 2002, largely
through integrating NatWest Life operations into L&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
After the deal NatWest shareholders would own about 75 percent
of the enlarged group and L&AMP;G shareholders would own the remaining
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rowland and his Chief Executive Derek Wanless will retain their
positions in the enlarged group. L&AMP;G's chief executive Prosser
will become deputy chairman, responsible for retail banking, life
assurance, pensions and fund management.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to spark a fresh wave of merger activity
with fellow potential targets, such as Norwich Union, seeing share
prices rising sharply on the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Finance trade union said it feared the takeover would mean job
losses and demanded immediate talks with management.

<HEADLINE> NATO Continues Aggression Against Yugoslavia After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to the
United Nations Office Branko Brankovic on Monday accused NATO of
continuing its aggression against Yugoslavia by other means such
as an economic war, a war of propaganda and an underground war
through subversive actions after the end of the military
aggression.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, speaking to reporters here, said that the crime
against peace and humanity "is the greatest crime committed by
NATO and its member states."
</P>
<P>
During the 78-day bombings against Yugoslavia, NATO, under the
leadership of the United States, Brankovic said, over 2,500 people
were killed and the majority of them were women, children and the
elderly, as well as mothers and newborns.
</P>
<P>
"There had been a very loud outcry in the world against NATO
aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Yugoslav ambassador said that even citizens of
the aggressor countries had demanded action, before national or
international courts, against war crimes committed by NATO against
the population of Yugoslavia, such as a group of lawyers from
Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an Independent Commission of Inquiry Hearing to
Investigate the United States and NATO War Crimes against the
People of Yugoslavia, presided over by former U.S. Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, was established to collect evidence and
indict the 19 leading personalities of the NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Brankovic introduced a white book
entitled "NATO Crimes in Yugoslavia, Documentary Evidence"
released recently by the Yugoslav foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav ambassador said that the book, now in two volumes,
covers the period from March 24 to April 25, 1999 and the period
from April 25 to June 10, "was a brutal demonstration of the
attempt to implement the so-called 'new world order'".

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Optimistic about Palestinian-Israeli Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
expressed optimism about the deal signed by the Palestinians and
Israel in Egypt Saturday night on the implementation of the Wye
accord.
</P>
<P>
In its meeting in Jeddah, the Saudi cabinet voiced hope that
the deal will be turned into tangible results so that the
Palestinian state could be established with Jerusalem as its
capital, the Saudi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet hoped also that the deal will push forward the
peace talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks from where they
broke off to ensure the achievement of permanent and comprehensive
peace and to fully protect the Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak signed a memorandum on the
implementation of the Wye River Accord in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo, Israel would complete the troops withdrawals
stipulated by the Wye agreement by January 2000, rather than by
mid-November under the original Wye timetable.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Israel and the Palestinians are supposed
to have entered an advance stage of permanent talks by early 2000,
which would help reduce the potential risk of confrontation
between the two sides raised by the troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The deal also provides for the release of 350 Palestinian
prisoners from the Israeli jails by next October, of whom 200
prisoners will be released within days as a first patch.
</P>
<P>
Early October, the Gaza seaport will be launched and safe
passages for the Palestinians between Gaza Strip and the West bank
will be opened according to the deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An International Labor
Organization (ILO) official said on Monday the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU) must separate labor business from politics.
</P>
<P>
ILO regional director Ullrich Flechsenhar told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that there was nothing unusual in the labor movement
turning into a political par4$0f -7\:$0f):zj-%9reference to the annoement by the
 ZCTU that it
was for
4ng a political party to be launched on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Organizations and individuals had also raised concern that the
labor body would not represent the workers fairly when it turned
into a political party.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions, a rival to the ZCTU,
had on different occasions called for the resignation of the ZCTU
leaders saying they had failed to represent workers.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a clear direction for the leaders of the labor
movement to take. It is either politics or labor," added
Flechsenhar.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda told the news agency that the
labor union leadership would resign if they were elected into the
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
</P>
<P>
The labor body was due to launch the MDC which it described as
a mass political movement in the country next weekend.
</P>
<P>
On the labor systems in southern Africa, Flechsenhar said there
was need for governments to show political will to implement fair
labor practices.

<HEADLINE> Vendor Shot Dead For Attempting Mubarak's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Hussein Mahmoud Solaiman, a
clothing vendor, was shot dead by presidential guards on Monday
when he was attacking Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak with a
sharp tool, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was inspecting industrial projects in Port Said, 180
kilometers northeast of Cairo, at the northern end of the Suez
Canal. On the way to a meeting, he was waving through his car
window to people along the road, a statement released by the
president's office said.
</P>
<P>
Solaiman approached Mubarak's car and attacked the president
with a sharp tool, inflicting a light wound in his arm, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The president's guards fired at Solaiman and killed him, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian Interior Ministry official later told the news
agency that Solaiman, better known as Al-Arabi Solaiman, was a
graduate of an industrial institute and a resident of Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Solaiman, 40, "had no political affiliations" but "was known
for his impulsive behaviors and recklessness," the official said.
</P>
<P>
After being treated with a disinfectant, Mubarak went on to
deliver a speech in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian television later showed videotape of crowds on the
streets of Port Said cheering Mubarak, but cut away as shots rang
out and did not show the attack.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has survived at least three attempts on his life. The
most serious attack on him came in June 1995 when Muslim militants
fired at his limousine after it was driving out of Addis Ababa
airport of Ethiopia to a summit of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's predecessor, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated
in 1981 by Muslim extremists angered by his signing of a peace
treaty with Israel in 1979. Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice
president, became president after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak plays an active role in mediating the peace talks
between Arab countries and Israel, and cracks down severely on the
Muslim extremists who attempt to topple the secular Egyptian
government and install a strict Islamic rule.

HARARE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- African countries need to
review their industrial relations systems to meet new challenges
posed by changing information technology in the continent,
Malawian High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Jutilan Chizumila said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chizumila was opening a five-day regional workshop on
strengthening the dispute settlement machinery in Southern Africa
attended by labor officials and employers representatives in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
She said the new information technology had removed physical
barriers at workplaces and consequently left both employees and
employers well informed about their labor rights.
</P>
<P>
"The worker, business and government are now better informed
and this I believe calls upon us to review our labor systems to
meet the new challenges," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said fair labor standards based on equity, social justice
and the rule of law promoted industrial peace and harmony which
was important for higher productivity and economic growth of any
country.
</P>
<P>
"With industrialization and development of trade unions and
collective bargaining, the problem of industrial relations has
become increasingly complex," she said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar aimed at equipping participants with a better
understanding of the dynamics of conflict mediation and
arbitration in labor matters.

<P>
The delegates from Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, Seychelles, Swaziland and Zimbabwe attended the workshop.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab and Israeli leaders
enquired after the health of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
after he was injured in an assassination attempt Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was slightly injured by a clothing vendor in Port Said
when he was on his way to inspect industrial projects in the
Mediterranean port city at the northern end of the Suez Canal.

The clothing vendor, whom the Egyptian Interior Ministry later

The president's body guards fired at Solaiman and killed him.

<P>
After being treated with disinfectant, Mubarak went on to a

</P>
<P>
Following the speech in Port Said, Mubarak left for the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in southern Sinai, where he received
telephone calls from Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, Jordanian King
Abdullah and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. The Arab leaders
enquired after his health after the attack, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak received a similar call from Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, it added.

airport of Ethiopia to a summit of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's predecessor, President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated
in 1981 by Muslim extremists angered by his signing of a peace
treaty with Israel in 1979. Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice
president, became president after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak plays an active role in mediating the peace talks
between Arab countries and Israel, and cracks down severely on the
Muslim extremists who attempt to topple the secular Egyptian
government and install a strict Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> South African Team Gears up for African Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's huge
sports machine for the All Africa Games rumbled into motion on
Monday with the 560 athletes lining up for the team photo shoot
after which they moved into the Games Village in Alexander.
</P>
<P>
The collective spirit was high after a marathon two days of
queueing up for accreditation, undergoing last-minute fitness and
medical tests and being kitted out in the green and gold.
</P>
<P>
The logistics in terms of assembly, catering and accommodation
for athletes whose total equals the strength of an infantry
batallion has been run at military proportions.
</P>
<P>
The accommodation on the East Bank of Alexander township
received the thumbs up from team members.
</P>
<P>
"The units are cool and clean," said Panda Nelson of women's
hockey. "It's going to be a unique experience. I reckon we could
have a lot of fun staying there."
</P>
<P>
All the sporting codes reported that their competitors were
ready for the continental showpiece that gets under way on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony takes place at the Johannesburg Stadium on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the organisers will officially release the names of
top contenders from all over Africa, followed by the team dinner
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy withdrawal is that of Ethiopia's Haile
Gebrselassie, the world 10,000m record holder who won the IAAF
World title in Seville in stunning fashion.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie has badly blistered feet and is on a downward
curve after a tough European season.
</P>
<P>
Paul Tergat of Kenya, who won the silver medal in the 10,000m,
indicated after his arrival in Seville that he would make the trip
to Johannesburg, but he registered some doubt after his race.
</P>
<P>
Top flight athletes competing in the final two IAAF Golden
League meetings in Berlin and Munich next week may be jaded and
opt out of the track and field action.
</P>
<P>
Hezekiel Sepeng, silver medallist in the 800m at Seville who
broke his SA record in 1 minute 42.69 seconds in Brussels last
Friday when he finished second to world champion Wilson Kipketer,
will have to draw from deep reserves for the Games, as will Johan
Botha and high jump record-holder Hestrie Storbeck.
</P>
<P>
There are those, however, who find themselves under less
pressure in terms of commitment and it would be interesting to see
if they arrive in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
These include Mozambique's Maria Mutola, Zambian Samuel Matate
and Kenyans Christopher Kosgei and Japheth Kimutai.
</P>
<P>
Hendrik Ramaala came fourth in the 10,000m in Brussels in 27:43,
68 -- but his tail could be up for a medal in the absence of
Gebrselassie and Tergat.
</P>
<P>
The gymnasts certainly had their tails up for the Games, with
their international season about to get on the boil.
</P>
<P>
They take to the gymnastics hall at Wits University with
Algeria and Egypt their main challengers.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a vital stepping stone to the world gymnastics
championships in China in October," said national coach George
Hriston.
</P>
<P>
"Our performance in China will mean everything -- that's our
only chance of qualifying for the Sydney Olympics next year
because the Africa Games don't count."

in the South East Asia region, the prime minister called for
according highest priority to alleviate the curse of diseases,
disabilities and premature deaths. This calls for urgent policy,
increased budget and pragmatic initiatives from the governments
and close collaboration from developing partners, she said.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Reviews N. Irish Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
said on Monday that his review of the Good Friday agreement will
only focus on forming a power-sharing government and on arms
decommissioning in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senator is at Stormont, near the Northern
Ireland capital Belfast, for talks with the main political parties
in the province.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that there was no question of renegotiating
the accord -- it was now up to Northern Ireland's politicians to "
seize the opportunity for peace."
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed that the review could end the
political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell arrived in Northern Ireland on midnight Sunday, trying
to revive the peace process after it reached deadlock two months
ago over the disarmament of Catholic and Protestant guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senator, who helped mediate the original Good
Friday accord last year, is expected to carry out a review and see
whether it is now possible to work out a timetable for
disarmament and to appoint a Northern Ireland cabinet including
the main rival parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no sign of an easing of the mutual suspicion
that clouds hopes of implementing the Good Friday pact signed in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is due to meet the main parties on Monday and Tuesday,
and the British and Irish governments on Wednesday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He will try to mediate between David Trimble's Protestant, pro-
British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republic Army (IRA) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The UUP said it will not share power with Sinn Fein unless the
IRA is disarmed.
</P>
<P>
No finishing date has been set for Mitchell's talks, which will
reopen next Monday, but participants hope they will be over soon.

<HEADLINE> Congo Peace Efforts Suffer Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Peace efforts in the
war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) suffered a major
setback on Monday when a rebel leader accused President Laurent
Kabila of violating a peace accord brokered last week.
</P>
<P>
Bazima Karaha, chief negotiator of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD), issued a veiled warning that hostilities could
resume.
</P>
<P>
The RCD, which has been fighting to depose Kabila since August
1998, has objected to his decision to appoint Lt. Gen Sylvestre
Luesha as head of his armed forces. The decision was announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Luesha is an ethnic Mai Mai, who make up one of the groups
meant to be disarmed under a peace deal brokered in Lusaka last
week, Karaha said in an interview published by South African Press
Association. The loose-knit group has clashed with the rebels
during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Karaha warned that if Luesha were not removed from his post,
"We will carry on and disarm him".
</P>
<P>
A letter voicing the objection was sent to the Joint Military
Commission, which is overseeing the Congo ceasefire, but no reply
had been received, Karaha said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a threat. It is a violation. This man must be disarmed."
</P>
<P>
Karaha added that the ceasefire appeared to be holding.
</P>
<P>
"The guns are silent. We believe this should be the end of the
war in the Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karaha, who flew in to South Africa on Saturday to hold talks
with President Thabo Mbeki, was Kabila's former foreign minister.
He joined the rebels after accusing Kabila of nepotism and
corruption and failing to chart a clear political course.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the former Zaire, which erupted a year after
Kabila overthrew its former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, has drawn
in forces from five other countries. Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola
have been propping up Kabila's regime, while Uganda and Rwanda
have been supporting the rebels trying to overthrow him.

international community to send troops to the territory as there
is "a faction in the Indonesian army who were behind the carnage
there.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the U.N. Security Council, the international
community, the United States in particular, Australia, take
concrete action to bring in an international force into East
Timor," the Nobel laureate told CNN in an interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
Last week, East Timor held a referendum and the result showed a
majority of residents there favored independence. But right after
the release of the referendum result, there was eruption of
violence in the area and hundreds of people were thought to be
killed.
</P>
<P>
Ramos-Horta accused the faction in the Indonesian army of being
behind the violence, saying "there is a faction in the Indonesia
army, the army intelligence and the special troops loyal to
(former) president Suharto (who) have economic and financial
interests in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
He called them "hardliners" who "opposed President B.J.
Habibie's policy toward independence."

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Accord Between Israel, Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Monday that it
welcomes the agreements between Israel and Palestine on the
implementation of the accords concerning a transitional period for
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Moscow duly appreciates "the Palestinian and Israeli leaders'
constructive approach, as well as the efforts made by the American
co-sponsor, by Egypt and personally by President Hosni Mubarak,"
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak met in the Egyptian city of Sharm el
Sheikh to sign a memorandum on the implementation of the mutual
obligations on these accords.
</P>
<P>
This memorandum also envisions "the initiation of talks on a
final status of the Palestinian territories to be completed by
September 2000," the Russian statement said.
</P>
<P>
"On our part we energetically promoted rapprochement between
the sides and strengthened their determination to implement the
assumed commitments," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the hope that "a consistent implementation of the
agreements reached in Sharm el Sheikh will ensure steady progress
on the Palestinian track and have a positive impact on the
peaceful settlement as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"Talks on the complicated problems of final settlement, the
results of which will largely determine the future of the region,
will be of special importance," the Interfax news agency quoted
the statement as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's President Luis
Gonzalez Macchi named Monday Jose Felix Fernandez as the new
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez is member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the
largest opposition political figure and the governing Colorado
Party's main ally, according to reports reaching here from
Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Abdon Gonzalez Saquier was
removed from office last Saturday for failure to obtain the
extradition of two former military leaders who were granted asylum
in Argentina and Uruguay,
</P>
<P>
Argentina last Thursday rejected a request by Paraguay to
extradite failed coup leader former army chief Lino Oviedo, who is
accused of instigating Vice President Luis Maria Argana's
assassination in March. Oviedo requested political asylum in
Argentina on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay last Wednesday also turned down Paraguay's extradition
request for former Defense Minister Jose Segovia, alleged to be a
close associate of Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's government accuses Oviedo and Segovia of being
involved in the shooting of Vice President Argana on March 23 in

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Resume Early Warning Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Monday that it is
ready to resume talks with the U.S. on creating missile attack
early warning centers, the Interfax new agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will raise the question with his
U.S. counterpart, William Cohen, when the latter visits Moscow on
September 12, Interfax said, quoting a high-ranking Russian
military official.
</P>
<P>
"The time and very possibility of resuming Russian-American
consultations on early warning centers will depend on the outcome
of the talks between the heads of the defense agencies," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998 President Boris Yeltsin and President Bill
Clinton agreed to exchange military experts: to send Russians to a
center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Americans to a center
near Moscow. The sides were expected to exchange 10 experts.
</P>
<P>
The move was designed to strengthen confidence and prevent
possible unauthorized launches of intercontinental ballistic
missiles related to the Y2K problem, when computers mistaken the
year 2000 for 1900.
</P>
<P>
Military experts from the two countries are to monitor all
intercontinental ballistic missile launches not only in Russia and
the U.S. but in other countries having such arms, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Early warning centers were supposed to be set up before the end
of this autumn, but talks on this issue were frozen by Moscow
after NATO started the 78-day bombing campaign on Yugoslavia on
March 24.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Culture Brings Sensation to Parisians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of the
month, many Parisians have found a small change has taken place in
themselves -- their eyes dazzled by unfamiliar Chinese colors and
their ears resounding with Chinese music tunes.
</P>
<P>
As tens of thousands of people have visited the China Culture
Week in the first half time of its display, the Parisians are
re-discovering a great civilization which they mistakenly thought
that they already knew.
</P>
<P>
Few of the French listeners found the courage to pose a
question to Professor Ma Chengyuan, the Dean of the Shanghai
Museum, when he gave a lecture on Monday on the Golden Age of
Bronzes in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties of China.
</P>
<P>
Listening with great interest, most of the 400-strong audience
found that the stately, elegant and mystic bronze cups, bowls,
music instruments and wine containers are of a too far away
culture from a too far away age.
</P>
<P>
When the visitors saw the set of chime bells from the Warring
States period 2,400 years ago, they realized that Chinese were one
of the earliest nations in the world to discover music.
</P>
<P>
Older than most European treasures on display in the Louvre
Museum, the chime bells can even today produce any cosmopolitan
and modern tunes from every country of the world.
</P>
<P>
The two concerts given by the China Chime-Bell Orchestra from
Hubei Province in central China have caused a real sensation among
their French listeners.
</P>
<P>
Most of the listeners discovered for the first time such a set
of ancient music instruments can play in concert with other modern
Chinese music instruments, such as flutes, pipa and eulhou.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ballet given by the dancers from Dance Institute of
Beijing has also been a great success.
</P>
<P>
Combining ancient themes with modern dancing techniques, the
artists showed the French a panorama of Chinese dances ranging
from the Dun Huang Silk Road Murals to the folk peasants of the
Loess Plateau border the Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
They also let their audience enjoy the Chinese version of
Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliette'' -- ``The Liang Zhu'' love
tragedy, with symbolic dancing language familiar to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Opera is the field widely revisited by the French
this time, because of its fame abroad and its gorgeous masks and
costumes.
</P>
<P>
Behind a real Beijing Opera stage constructed in the exhibition
hall of UNESCO, a dressing table on which the actors and actresses
make up their faces with heavy color sticks has become the focus
of attention.
</P>
<P>
Some children have their faces painted like the Monkey King, a
story their fathers and grand fathers already knew thanks to a
successful tour of a Beijing Opera troupe in France in 1956.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Calls Back Ambassador in Paraguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's government Monday
called back its ambassador in Paraguay, Rodofo Olavarria, in the
diplomatic tension arising between both nations.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's Foreign Minister Didier Opertti rejected before the
press the notion that Ambassador Olavarria's summons is a matter
of the eventual break of relations.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between both countries worsened after Uruguay denied
last week the extradition of Paraguay's Defense Minister Jose
Segovia.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's government called for consultation for an indefinite
period of time its ambassadors in Uruguay, Julia Velilla, and in
Argentina, Leila Rachid.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Argentina also rejected Paraguay's request of
extradition of ex-chief of the army Lino Cesar Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Segovia went into exile on April 29 in Uruguay and Oviedo on
March 28 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's authorities alleged Segovia and Oviedo as
instigators of Vice President Luis Maria Aragna's killing on March
23 of last year. Oviedo is furthermore accused of heading a
proposed coup d'etat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan government recalled for an indefinite period of
time its ambassadors to Uruguay and Argentina last Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Never to Allow Independence of Taiwan: Cheng Siwei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Chinese Official
said here categorically that China will never allow independence
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Siwei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China, stressed that to safeguard
national reunification and unity is the highest goal of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a banquet Sunday after the conclusion
of the 1999 International Symposium on "21st Century China and the
Challenge of Sustainable Development" which was co-sponsored by
Western Returned Scholars Association and 33 overseas Chinese
professional organizations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made its position on Taiwan very
clear, that is no independence, no "Two Chinas" and no "One China,
One Taiwan", Chen Siwei said.
</P>
<P>
Chen reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory and the Chinese people will never tolerate
separation of Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chinese government's consistent policy on the
Taiwan question is peaceful reunification on the basis of "One
Country, Two Systems", but China will not renounce the use of
force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy on Taiwan has not changed, but if Lee Teng-hui and
the Taiwan authority go far and far on the road of separation,
Taiwan will possibly become a powder keg," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Situation in the Taiwan Straits has grown tense after Lee
Teng-hui made his "state-to-state" doctrine on July 9th this
year.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Leader Disapproves New Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The second rebel leader
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Monday voiced
misgivings about the new army chief as the fledgling peace process
in the war-torn central African country got underway.
</P>
<P>
"General Sylvestre Luesha is very close to (DRC President)
Laurent Kabila. He is more of a Mai Mai organizer than a military
man," South African Press Association quoted Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, head of the Goma faction of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD), as saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Kabila announced Luesha's appointment as new head of the DRC
armed forces on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who held talks with President Thabo Mbeki on Sunday,
said he would not go as far as the Kisangani RCD faction to demand
the removal of Luesha to avoid a resumption of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"Although I have reservations about the general's competence, I
am not an advisor to Mr. Kabila to tell him whom he should appoint
and whom not. His government is in any event an outgoing one."
</P>
<P>
Chief negotiator for the Kisangani RCD faction Bazima Karaha
earlier in the day said Luesha's appointment was a violation of a
recent peace accord to end the DRC civil war.
</P>
<P>
"It is a threat. It is a violation. This man must be disarmed,"
Karaha said.
</P>
<P>
Karaha's objections stemmed from Luesha's close ethnic links
with the Mai Mai, one of the groups meant to be disarmed under the
peace deal, including a cease-fire, brokered in Lusaka. The Mai
Mai has clashed with the rebels in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Wamba earlier told reporters he was optimistic that the
cease-fire would succeed in bringing an end to the year-long
conflict in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was to make sure that hostilities between
political adversaries also came to an end, Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
Wamba on Monday described the RCD's endorsement of the peace
accord as a great event, and expressed the hope that small
problems would not be allowed to derail the process.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Joint Military Commission, which is
overseeing the cease-fire, went without a hitch. Only the number
of representatives each group should have still had to be sorted
out, Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
The accord calls for a cease-fire, the creation of a united
army after a 90-day dialogue on the DRC's political future, and
for international peacekeepers to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said he hoped South Africa would continue to play a
central role in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis in the DRC has shifted from fighting to
negotiation, an area in which South Africa has rich experience. We
expect South Africa will do what it can in terms of resources,
expertise and maybe personnel," Wamba said.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Lift State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President
Festus Mogae is to end the four-day state of emergency on Tuesday
when he signs into law an amendment to include about 60,000
registered voters on the voters' roll, a presidential spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, which was declared last Thursday, was
for the sole purpose of being able to recall the parliament to
amend the act, under which the aforementioned voters could not be
included on the roll because of a writ issued for the October 16
election before their names were published for inspection.
</P>
<P>
The parliament met Monday and made the changes, reports
reaching here quoted the unnamed spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
There has been widespread apathy ahead of the election in the
diamond- rich country and only about 400,000 out of 900,000
eligible voters initially registered.
</P>
<P>
Another 60,000 voters signed up in a supplementary registration
period.
</P>
<P>
Their inclusion on the roll will mean that 51 percent of
eligible voters have registered for the election.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, Botswana Congress Party, has been
accusing Mogae and the electoral commission of incompetence.
</P>
<P>
"While we appreciate that the (60,000) people must vote, we are
 concerned about the state of emergency that was imposed," said
party leader Michael Dingake.
</P>
<P>
"The state of emergency was unprecedented and it shows lack of
consideration, carelessness and negligence on the part of the
president," he charged.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Trying to Break Stalemate in N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
held a day of meetings Monday with the main rival parties in
Northern Ireland at the start of a review of the Good Friday
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell arrived in Northern Ireland at mid-night Sunday,
trying to revive the peace process after it reached a deadlock two
months ago over the disarmament of Catholic and Protestant
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who helped mediate last year's peace accord for the
British province, has been called in by Britain and the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Neither I nor anyone else has a magic and that will wave away
these problems. But I believe it can be done. Whether it is done
is up to the political leaders," the former U.S. senator told
reporters before the meetings.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the problem is an ambiguity in the peace deal
about disarmament which set May 2000 as the deadline but gave no
starting date for the process.
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of an easing of the mutual suspicion that
clouds hopes of implementing the April 1998 peace pact.
</P>
<P>
The province's main Protestant leader David Trimble still
insists that Sinn Fein should be barred from government until its
Irish Republican Army guerrilla allies disarm. The IRA is as
attached to its weapons as ever.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein official Pat Doherty said the review could be
successful, but it should conclude that the executive be set up
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is due to meet smaller parties Tuesday and the British
and Irish governments Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday he also met the other two parties with seats on the
planned executive -- the moderate SDLP, the main Catholic party,
which supports the peace deal, and Ian Paisley's Democratic
Unionists, who fiercely oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell stressed that his review would focus strictly on
devolving power and on achieving disarmament by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell will take a break after Wednesday pending publication
of a report on reform of Northern Ireland's police force.
</P>
<P>
No finishing date has been set for Mitchell's talks, which will
reopen next Monday, but participants want them over soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 6 (Xinhua) - London's stock market ended in
the black Monday after a strong rally by US stocks on previous
session and positive gains from telecom stocks.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed up 43.6 points at 6375.7 on provisional
volume of 676m shares and the FTSE 250 rose 50.8 points, or 0.8
percent, to a record 6173.2.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone Airtouch was behind the bulk of gains on the UK blue
chip index. The stock closed 3.6 percent higher after the world's
largest cellular network operator confirmed it is talking to Bell
Atlantic about linking up their US mobile networks.
</P>
<P>
Rival Orange also made strong gains to finish 2.2 percent
higher. UK cable operator Telewest soared more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The major corporate development of the day was confirmation of
the 17.2 billion US dollars takeover of insurer Legal &AMP; General by
NatWest Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, market reaction as muted after stocks in the sector
had rallied last week when the two companies confirmed they were
in talks.
</P>
<P>
Natwest closed 0.8 percent lower on the session amid fears the
company was overpaying for L&AMP;G, which dropped 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The electronic Xetra Dax in Frankfurt put in the strongest
performance of the main bourses in Europe, closing 1.2 percent
higher at 5400.55, a rise of 64 points.
</P>
<P>
Paris's CAC 40 ended down 4 points at 4668.04, shedding the
mild gains it had held on to for most of the session. Retail and
automotive stocks led the way down.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. Envoy of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry on
Tuesday accused the U.S. representative at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee of hindering approval of its electrical contracts
signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry told the Iraqi News Agency that
the blocked contracts with Spanish, French and German companies
involved equipments and spare parts for the electrical sector.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said the continued U.S. impediment of
approval of Iraq's contracts reflects the U.S. administration's
hostile trend toward Iraq and its efforts to harm Iraqi people who
have been suffering under the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to export limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars in previous phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Blind Chinese Benefit from Massive Eye Surgery Campaign (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale eye surgery
campaign will help China reduce the number of cataract sufferers,
as the disease now deprives some 400,000 Chinese of their sight
each year, making China the country with largest blind population
in the world.
</P>
<P>
SightFirst China Action (SFCA), which is described as the world
's biggest blindness prevention and treatment campaign, has helped
nearly one million people with cataracts and other eye diseases
regain their sight, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Health, the China Disabled Persons
Federation, and Lions Clubs International, who jointly launched
the SFCA program in 1997, told the press that the five-year
program is being carried out smoothly and has so far yielded
noticeable results.
</P>
<P>
Out of nine million eye patients in China, four millions have
cataracts. This condition, which is mainly associated with
increased age, has become rampant as a result of the increasing
population of the elderly in China.
</P>
<P>
Health experts warn that if the country's eye-surgery capacity
is limited to only 200,000 operations a year, that, along with a
regional imbalance in ophthalmologic services, will make the task
of overcoming cataracts almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
However, the SFCA program will help raise the country's surgery
capacity to 450,000 operations annually, which will in turn bring
down the number of cataract patients gradually by the year 2001,
said Vice Minister of Health Wang Longde.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 92 medical teams were sent to 761 remote,
underdeveloped and poor counties to offer them operations at
greatly reduced fees, Wang told the press.
</P>
<P>
"Among those who regained their eyesight, the oldest was 103
and the youngest was only four months old," he said.

<P>
In a bid to achieve the final goal of performing 1.75 million
operations in five years, the SFCA program has dispatched 250
medical teams while focusing on the establishment of new
ophthalmologic departments at local hospitals, training programs
for rural ophthalmologists and assistants, and expanded health
awareness among the population.
</P>
<P>
"About 6,000 eye doctors and assistants in rural areas have
received training and ophthalmologic departments have been opened
in 36 counties in 20 provinces since 1997," Wang said, adding that
a recently established national database network for the
prevention and treatment of eye diseases is the world's first.
</P>
<P>
The massive program will cost a total of 180 million U.S.
dollars, with over 15 million dollars provided by Lions Clubs
International and the rest coming from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
James Ervin, president of Lions Clubs International, said that
so far the program results have been "truly remarkable," and that
the SFCA could be used as a model by other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Since its inception in 1997, SightFirst China Action has been
a flagship initiative with the SightFirst program," stressed
Ervin, who led other members of the organization at a meeting of
the SFCA Steering Committee and the ongoing Sixth General Assembly
of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Orders Harsh Actions Against Rebels in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on Tuesday ordered "rapid and harsh" actions against armed
rebels in the southern republic of Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described the rebels as terrorists when he chaired
Russia's top security body in the Kremlin to discuss developments
in Daghestan, where armed forces and police units are fighting
Islamic extremists, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
"A week ago there was confidence that the large-scale armed
operation against the international terrorists was over,"
Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as saying. "But the bandits have
undertaken new sorties and are organizing barbaric acts of
sabotage."
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities have accused foreign forces of
supporting the armed incursions in the Caucasus republics.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin urged troops and police to act "quickly and harshly,"
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Yeltsin blamed "careless" generals for
allowing a devastating car bomb attack on a Russian military
apartment block and the loss of an entire district of Daghestan to
Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which demolished a five-story apartment in the town
of Buinaksk in a southern region of Daghestan Saturday, has left
64 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the blast, hundreds of Islamic militants invaded
Daghestan from neighboring Chechnya and seized several villages.
Russian forces, facing their toughest security challenge since the
1994-96 Chechnya war, are still trying to repel the incursion.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry officials estimated that around 1,000 Muslim
rebels have crossed into the Novolaksk region of western Daghestan
on Russia's southern rim and seized six villages.

<P>
PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletics Federation (IAAF) insisted on Tuesday that the athletics
timetable for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games "was not valid" and is
subject to change.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said at Monte Carlo that the timetable had not been
approved in accordance with the Olympic Charter before the Sydney
organizing committee (SOCOG) released tickets to the public.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said "the best interests of the athletes and their
health" must be considered before the timetable is finalized
though they "understands the frustration this will provoke among
the Australian people".
</P>
<P>
"Such a motivation could certainly not be considered any less a
priority than selling tickets," the IAAF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG members criticized the IAAF last weekend, saying that
they could throw the athletics timebatle into turmoil by asking
for amendments to the published schedule.
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF said it had advised SOCOG that no timetable should
be made public until it had been agreed.

<HEADLINE> Major Points of Agreement Between FIFA and AFC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Federation Internationale
de Football Association (FIFA) and the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) have reached the agreement on the allocation
of places in the 2002 World Cup, according to a FIFA press
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by FIFA President Sepp Blatter and
AFC President Sultan Ahmad Shah at FIFA headquarters in the Swiss
city of Zurich, Asia will have half the slot from UEFA made
possible by the efforts of the FIFA president and the UEFA
president, this making the Asian allocation to 4.5, including the
two host associations.
</P>
<P>
FIFA in cooperation with the confederations concerned will
decide on the play-off status for 2002 before the draw in December
1999. The FIFA president will then propose to the FIFA Executive
Committee to decide before the kick-off of the 2002 World Cup
Preliminary Competition, the seats for the different
confederations for the FIFA World Cup 2006.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned proposals will be submitted to the FIFA
Executive Committee at the meeting on October 1 and 2 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
In view of the above, the AFC has decided to cancel the AFC
Extraordinary Congress which was scheduled for October 10 in Kuala
Lumpur. Furthermore, the member associations affiliated to the AFC
have been requested to submit their entry to FIFA to participate
in the FIFA World Cup South Korea/Japan 2002.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA said that the agreement was made after the AFC has
expressed its regrets regarding the walk-out of the Asian
delegates from the FIFA Extraordinary Congress on July 9 in Los
Angels.
</P>
<P>
"Unity in football has been restored and remains our priority
objective in the future," Blatter said. "We can look forward to
the FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea being a resounding
success."
</P>
<P>
AFC President Sultan Shah said, "I am happy to have been able
to resolve the differences between FIFA and my confederation
regarding the number of seats for the 2002 finals."
</P>
<P>
"Now we can move forward together for the good of the game in
Asia, and devote our full attention to the success of the World
Cup, which will be held in our continent for the first time at the
start of the new millennium," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will stage a
Chinese arts festival to showcase Chinese music from October 22 to
November 13, an official from the Provisional Urban Council (PUC)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The festival, jointly sponsored by the PUC and the Provisional
Regional Council, will feature an exciting mix of music

</P>
<P>
"Since 1991, the PUC has been presenting biennially a theme
festival respectively on Chinese drama, music, dance and opera,
all of which were well received," said Pao Ping-wing, chairman of
the PUC's Culture Select Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the turn of the century, the festival provides
a unique opportunity to rediscover the gems of traditional music,
review masterpieces of the century as well as explore contemporary

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Intensify IP Education in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Intellectual
Property Department (IPD) Tuesday urged more efforts to strengthen
education in intellectual property in Hong Kong, following a
survey featuring residents' lower awareness on the work.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies of
the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the recent survey showed that
most of the respondents had a relatively little knowledge of the
works of the IPD and the Intellectual Property Investigation
Bureau of the Customs and Excise department.
</P>
<P>
"The general awareness of intellectual property among
respondents was far from inadequate, but a relatively high
percentage of people said they did not know what intellectual
property referred to, or held mis-conceptions about it," said
Stephen Selby, director of the IPD.
</P>
<P>
Respondents agreed that it is immoral for a consumer who knows
that it will infringe the intellectual property rights of others
to buy counterfeit or pirated articles. Yet, they admitted that
they themselves have also engaged in these activities, Selby said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the public in Hong Kong believe
that heavier punishment, more effort on combating trademark
counterfeiting and copyright piracy and more education are the
solutions to deal with intellectual property rights infringement.
</P>
<P>
The foundings of the survey will set the benchmark for IPD to
formulate its forth-coming promotion and education programs, Selby
said, adding that the department will spend eight million HK
dollars over the next three years on intellectual property
education and promotion.

ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation fell from
2.1 percent in July to 2.0 percent in August, the National
Statistics Service (NSS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this, the NSS said that the real inflation in August
was 1.98 percent, the lowest rate in Greece since February 1970.
</P>
<P>
The NSS said that the recent measures taken by the Greek
government to curb price inflation would result in a 0.6 percent
drop on year-on-year inflation.
</P>
<P>
A drop in the consumer price index in August reflected a fall
in food and non-alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
Greek Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou forecasted that the
inflation would continue falling.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is the only country of EU members failing to join
the the euro zone, needs to hold inflation below 2 percent to
qualify for entry into the singly-currency euro zone by 2001.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China will open some ten
sectors more widely to overseas investment, including finance and
insurance and telecommunications, a senior Chinese official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on the number of overseas-funded insurers and
their locations will gradually be eased, said Wen Zaixing,
spokesman for the 3rd China Investment and Trade Fair which opens
tomorrow in Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Overseas insurers will also be allowed to provide a wider
variety of services and hold larger shares in joint ventures, Wen
added.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunications sector will first experiment with
overseas investment in its value-added business, and then open the
market to overseas capital step by step, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese airlines will be encouraged to use overseas funds
and cooperate with overseas counterparts in establishing
engineering subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The business scope for overseas-funded investment companies in
China will be enlarged, Wen said. For example, they will be
allowed to sell products made by their plants in China and open
research and development centers.
</P>
<P>
According to Wen, China will also extend its experiment with
overseas investment in areas such as accounting, assessment,
quality control and management, and legal counseling.
</P>
<P>
Wen also revealed plans to further open commerce, foreign trade,
tourism, and several other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Doctors to Stage Strike in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's doctors will stage a
nation-wide strike Wednesday to protest against a verdict by a
Beirut military court that sentenced three doctors for negligence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Lebanon's Medical Syndicate called on all
doctors in the country to stop work on Wednesday and deal only
with urgent cases.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of physicians in white robe will picket the Lebanese
parliament in downtown Beirut to demand a legislation that
immunizes the medical profession against prosecution without
scientific evidence, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The military tribunal Tuesday night sentenced the three accused
doctors to five days in jail each for their negligence which led
to the death of an army sergeant.
</P>
<P>
Since the three doctors had spent more than one week in custody
during the investigation, they were released after the trial.
</P>
<P>
The trial was the first of its kind in Lebanon's military court
history because the country does not have laws that pertain
specifically to medical malpractice and dissatisfied patients or
their families usually have to resort to the civil courts.
</P>
<P>
The case sparked strong protest and criticism from the
country's medical associations.
</P>
<P>
Ghattas Khouryt, the head of Medical Syndicate for Beirut and
North Lebanon, said "we are not against doctors facing up to their
responsibilities, but we do not accept that they be treated like
criminals."
</P>
<P>
"We are against their arrest, because we know this will create a
crisis between doctors and patients," he added.

MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered starting public consultations nationwide on
his proposal to amend the constitution in a bid to determine
people's true sentiments on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent cabinet meeting, Estrada voiced his
willingness to listen to public ideas on the issue, the Philippine
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Commission on charter change is charged with
collecting the results of the public consultation, according to
the president.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed the commission to conduct wide-ranging
consultations to determine the true feelings of all sectors of the
society on the issue. I am ready to abide by the results after a
thorough study," he said at the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the economic reforms proposed in the charter
change, which aim to relax the constitutional restrictions on the
entry of foreign capital into the country, are vital to the
economy's survival under a rapidly changing world order.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution bars foreigners from owning land and gaining a
 controlling stake in local business ventures.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of our proposals is to remove the barriers that hold
back our economy as the rest of the world races to the new
millennium," Estrada stressed.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Two factions of the major
rebel group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
still at loggerheads over representation on a commission set up to
oversee the cease- fire, South African Deputy Foreign Minister
Aziz Pahad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some differences as to who of the RCD
(Congolese Rally for Democracy) factions should be represented on
the Joint Military Commission," he told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"The matter as it stands has not been resolved," he said. "We
think that the two factions are in discussion... and we hope they
come to an agreement. "
</P>
<P>
Pahad said representatives of the two factions were currently
meeting in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The DRC peace process got under way last week after an RCD
leadership dispute caused a six-week delay in putting into action
the July 10 peace accord to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Opposing factions of the rebel group were at odds over who
should sign the agreement on the RCD's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Both factions endorsed the peace accord on August 31, adding
their signatures to those of another rebel group and the six
countries involved in the year-long DRC conflict.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologist Couple Trace Chinese History in Ancient Tombs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Since Liu Qingzhu and Li
Yufang married 30 years ago, they have spent most of their time
digging in ancient old gloomy tombs and searching through desolate
ruins.
</P>
<P>
The couple are well-known Chinese archaeologists now in their
50's who have specialized in studying tombs of Chinese emperors
and ancient cities, and are credited with discovering China's
earliest central archives, from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC -
24 AD).
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, people are asking themselves '
Where do we go from here?' To answer that question, we have to
trace our history, and make it clear where we came from," said Liu
Qingzhu, director of the Institute of Archaeology under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The 50 years since the founding of New China is only a flash
in the history of the human race, but these years have brought
qualitative changes to China," said the archaeologist, adding that
these changes have been greater than those in all of the 2,000
years of Chinese feudal history.
</P>
<P>
After the couple graduated from the Department of Archaeology
of the prestigious Beijing University in 1967, they were drawn
ever closer together by archaeology.
</P>
<P>
Their thought always lingered in the tombs of the Qin and Han
dynasties of more than 2,000 years ago, and through the years,
many ancient swords, jade pieces, coins, and tiles and bricks
which were buried in oblivion came to light, thanks to the efforts
of the couple.
</P>
<P>
Liu recalled that when China's archaeological research resumed
in 1973 after a halt during the so-called Cultural Revolution, he
took part in the excavation of the palace of Qin Shihuang, the
first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221- 206 BC) near Xi'an in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"Every day I rode my bicycle for more than 50 kilometers to the
site, and walked through the high wild grass. I felt excited." Liu
said.

WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Tennis Association
is expected to name John McEnroe captain of the U.S. Davis Cup
team later this week.
</P>
<P>
Asked Monday night about replacing Tom Gullikson next year,
MeEnroe said:"Noboody has said anything to me. But I hope you're
right."
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi and Jim Courier had urged the USTA to name McEnroe
captain in 1993 before Gullikson got the nod.
</P>
<P>
USTA President Julia Levering said she had talked with Agassi
and Davis Cup team members about naming the new captain.
</P>
<P>
"That the players having a complete say-so in who the captain
is is rather important to us," Agassi said. "Based on the last few
weeks of conversation, it seems to me like, so far every time has
been made really aware of the concerns, she has managed to take
steps toward remedying any particular concern."
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, 40, holds several U.S. Davis Cup records: years on
team (12), team matches won (30), singles matches played (49),
combined matches played (69) and won (59).

Liu, honored as a correspondent academician of the Deutcher

excavation have been greatly improved, and they are now equipped

In the eyes of the archaeologist, tools are the most important
artifacts representing social development. "From the Stone Age to
the Bronze Age, from the Iron Age to the ages of the steam engine

encourage Taiwanese investment in the mainland and further promote
economic and trade exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We'll stick to what President Jiang Zemin said, that economic

However, Wen said, cross-Straits economic and trade exchanges
will keep on progressing as long as the Chinese on both sides join
hands in this efforts.

believes that most peace-loving Taiwan people welcome the sound
development of cross-Straits economic, trade and cultural
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The businessman added that most Taiwan people are looking
forward to the visit to Taiwan this autumn of Wang Daohan, head of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, and
expecting that it will push ahead cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the "two-states" remarks and the idea of "Taiwan
Independence" are the political plot of a small number of people
in Taiwan with ulterior motives, and do not represent the will of
the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The businessman said that as a native of Taiwan, he has been
focusing his investment in inland areas since the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits began economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
His ventures have grown from a small processing factory for
imported materials to a multinational corporation.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening policy of the inland areas and cross-
Straits exchanges have brought him great opportunities and much
benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said business people with investments in inland areas are
expecting early reunification of the motherland and prosperity for
the entire Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Keen on Developing Jordanian-Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein on Tuesday asserted his keenness on promoting
relations and cooperation in all fields between his country and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In a cable of thanks to Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah
after his two-day visit here, Abdullah said he was delighted with
the Kuwaiti leader's keenness to end almost one decade of
estrangement between the two countries, saying the decade was "a
past exceptional experience in their relations."
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that bilateral ties between Jordan and
Kuwait will remain as a model of honesty, trust and sincerety, as
well as fruitfull cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdullah assured that Jordan will support Kuwait
to achieve a positive result concerning the issue of Kuwait's
prisoners of war, allegedly detained in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Abdullah also invited
the Kuwaiti Emir to visit Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was the first Jordanian monarch to visit Kuwait in
more than nine years. Ties between Jordan and Kuwait worsened
after the 1990 Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
during which Jordan was blamed for siding with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait began the rapprochement process more than
two years ago, after Kuwait voiced its desire to improve ties
with all Arab nations except Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Amman reopened its embassy in Kuwait last March during an
official visit by Jordan's Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah
Al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian cabinet recently appointed its new ambassador
to Kuwait, as part of the preparation for Abdullah's visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait is still represented in Amman by a charge
de'affairs.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st BOT Project Transferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's first BOT (Build,
Operate and Transfer) project, a large thermal power plant, was
transferred Tuesday by its Hong Kong investor to the local owner
in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held at the Shajiao No.2 Power Plant attended by
senior officials including Wang Guangying, a vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Wang said the project shows that the
Chinese government allows overseas investors to earn legal profits,
and they are always welcome.
</P>
<P>
The power station went into use in 1987, and by the end of this
July it had generated 46.2 billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The plant has been hailed by experts as a successful BOT
project, since its operation has not only benefited the local
economy, but also the Hong Kong company that financed, built, and
operated it before the transfer.

Brussels, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said

<HEADLINE> Charter Change Enhances Economic Nationalism: Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The proposal to introduce
economic reforms through charter change will enhance, instead of
violate, the principle of "economic nationalism," Philippine
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official made this clear as he stressed the need for a new
approach to achieve economic nationalism in response to changing
economic realities, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said, "what will be changed is the method or the approach to
attain this objective. What we want to change is the method."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada is presently pushing
economic reforms through the charter change to remove the
constitutional barriers that slow down economic growth and prevent
the country from catching up with its more progressive neighbors
in the region.
</P>
<P>
These reforms include relaxing the restrictions on the foreign
ownership of land and local businesses, including public
utilities.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said economic nationalism is as important a principle
in the ongoing charter change process as it is in the present
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He added that the issue of the control of ownership being
transferred to foreigners, which some critics are protesting, is
merely a method to attain the new concept of economic nationalism
under a borderless trade environment.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu quoted Estrada as saying that the new nationalism
means bringing in the foreign capital needed to sharpen the global
competitiveness of domestic industries.

ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Tuesday accused France of providing political and military
support to the country's northern-based opposition alliance.

The Taliban-run Radio Shariat said a French delegation recently
paid a secret visit to the Panjsher valley, the stronghold of the
opposition forces loyal to former defense minister Ahmad Shah
Masood.

"Unfortunately such self-interested circles allow for the
continuation of fighting here with their subversive moves. They
also help the outcast groups to live a bit longer thanks to their
financial offers," the broadcast monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
The radio urged the international community to "handle things
responsibly" and help the Islamic country maintain the present
order instead of undertaking "illegal trips."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition claimed that its troops had inflicted
heavy losses on Taliban troops to the north of the capital of
Kabul.

</P>
<P>
Opposition sources said the fighting was heaviest along the Old
Road about 50 kilometers north of Kabul and at Nejrab 60 some

DAMASCUS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq El-Sharaa discussed the European role in the Mideast peace
process and the Syrian-EU ties with European Union (EU) Special
Envoy to the Middle East Angle Mauratinus on Tuesday .
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mauratinus, who arrived here earlier in the
day, said the talks dealt with the peace process on the Syrian
track in view of a recent visit by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the revised agreement for the Wye
Accord, or the Sharm El-Sheikh memorandum, signed Sunday between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel begins to pull its troops from
another 11 percent of the West Bank within 10 days and completes
the process by January 20 next year. And the long-overdue final
status talks will start on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Mauratinus pointed out that he will continue the joint efforts
with the Syrian and U.S. officials to resume the peace talks on
the Syrian track, which have been stalled since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Damascus welcomes the European role to push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Sharm El-Sheikh deal, Syria questioned the
seriousness of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in making a
substantial progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa has expressed disappointment after meeting with
Albright because she failed to bring Israeli assurances which
Syria seeks as a basis for resuming talks. Syria wants the talks
to be resumed from where they were left off.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
developed a hi-tech gadget which scans printed characters of two
of the most popular Indian scripts, corrects all errors and
automatically translates the written text into speech.
</P>
<P>
The first bi-script, bilingual Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) system of its kind developed in the country, is capable of
working effectively on Bengali and Devnagari scripts, according to
the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Envisioned by a team of four computer wizards headed by Dr.
Umapada Pal of the Indian Statistical Institute based in Calcutta,
the OCR system is expected to be of immense help for the blind,
who can now "hear" any printed text in these two languages.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kuwait Defense Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian held talks here today with visiting Kuwait Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, said that China and Kuwait are both developing
countries, share the same interests and hold a consensus on major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Chi voiced his appreciation of the Kuwait government's
adherence to the "One-China" policy and its support for China on
such issues as human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Recent years have witnessed fine progress in military
relations between both countries," Chi said, adding that the
Chinese army hopes to increase exchange and cooperation with the
Kuwait armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi also reiterated China's consistent stand toward the
remaining issues of the Gulf War and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Salem made assurances that the Kuwait government will
continue to stick to the "One-China" policy. The successful
running of Hong Kong after its return to the motherland has spoken
for the success of the policy of "One Country, Two Systems", he
commented, adding that Kuwait hopes that Macao will also return to
the motherland at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Salem also expressed his wish of further enhancing ties with
China. "We hope that China will play greater role in international
affairs, particularly in the Middle East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait guests are here for a 10 day official visit to China
at the invitation of Chi.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fruit Exporters Urged to Register for Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Exporters of durian, longan
and orchid in Thailand were urged to register for export licenses
and be ready for all relevant information printed on their
packaging, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Department has set September 10 as the deadline to
get tough with the export, TNA quoted a senior official from the
Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ananta Dalodom, chief of the Agriculture Department, said some
100 exporters have registered for licenses to date, most of which
are orchid exporters, followed by durian exporters.
</P>
<P>
Longan exporters are permitted to use the existing licenses
they have registered with the Export Promotion Department as a
relaxation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation by the Customs Department is part of its
efforts to help the shipment of fruits as customs officials will
not unseal packaging for inspection again if such goods have
licenses issued by the Agriculture Department, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The registration and information printed on the packaging will
also help the Agriculture Department trace back where the goods
are from and when the buying countries rejected their products.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Security Adviser in London for Looted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar disclosed Monday that his government has dispatched its
National Security Adviser to London to try to retrieve some of the
country's stolen money stashed in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that he did not know the total amount
expected to be retrieved until the money was finally in the
government's vault, the government-run Daily Times newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"When we came in, we found out that the immediate past
administration conducted a lot of investigation into corrupt
practices with a view to first of all recovering the loot," said
Abubakar
</P>
<P>
"They have done a pretty good job and we are continuing from
where they stopped. I have been personally involved in
negotiations to recover some of this loot and we have made
progress. We have made a number of recoveries which we will
announce shortly, " he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the National Security Adviser Mohammed Gusau has gone
to London for the issue, said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
"It is when you make these recoveries that you take a decision
whether it is worthwhile to go to court as part of the terms of
the recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, if you just try and say 'look, what we are after is
the punitive aspect of the thing', you may never recover any penny
and really succeed in prosecuting because that is much more public
and difficult to prove," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president asked the press to practice patient and
allow the government to conclude the recovery process before
talking about prosecution of those involved in the looting.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt. Promises 5 Million New Jobs for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Five million jobs are to be
created in the next year while about 5,000 housing units are to be
built yearly among other goals to be reached in the next four
years, Nigerian Vice- President Atiku Abubakar has said
</P>
<P>
Taking stock of the Olusegun Obasanjo administration's 100 days
in office at a press briefing in Abuja Monday, the vice-president
said that the Federal Government has released 100 million naira
(one U.S. dollar equals some 90 naira) as motor vehicle and
motorcycle revolving loan for officers and men of the Nigerian
police to combat rising crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspapers Tuesday quoted Abubakar as saying that
the administration was determined to create a conducive
environment for the generation of new employment opportunities
through private sector involvement.
</P>
<P>
"Plans are underway to generate five million jobs in the next
one year through vocational skills acquisition and entrepreneurs
development program in all the local government councils of the
federation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the housing program, the vice president said the National
Housing Program would be revived soon, adding that "over the next
four years, the government intends to build 5,000 housing units
annually throughout the federation."
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 410 housing units are in practical
completion stage and work has already commenced on the
construction of expandable one- and-two bedroom housing units in
Lugbe, Abuja and Lagos".
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of security of life and property was top on
the priority list of the administration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ministry of Police Affairs has finalized
a five- year development plan that would address the provision of
adequate security for citizens.
</P>
<P>
This included yearly recruitment and training, detailed
equipment handling for the recruited personnel and setting out
educational standards for new entrants into the force, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also disclosed that the Federal Ministry of
Works and Housing has revived the stalled highway projects
especially those under- funded or abandoned by past
administrations, such as Benin-Asaba dual carriage-way,
Otta-Abeokuta road, Kano Ring Road Phase II, Maiduguri-Dikwa-
Gamboru and Kano State border-Gumel-Maigatari road, among others.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants Internet Contents Regulated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday called
for a global consensus to regulate offensive contents in the
Internet to protect the public from their adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
No single country in the world could come up with its own
effort to tackle the problem which could damage the culture of
many countries especially developing ones like Malaysia, Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said here.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult unless a common understanding among countries
worldwide is reached on the need to restrain unwanted contents in
the Internet," he told reporters after opening the three-day 30th
Annual Conference of the International Institute of Communications
themed "The Knowledge Society - Commerce, Culture and Communities
in Development."
</P>
<P>
Moggie said the issue should be raised as often as possible in
international fora.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Malaysian government has a duty to
protect the public from adverse contents in the Internet
especially the exposure of minors to pornography.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that in the context of the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) where the government has guaranteed the free flow
of information, there would be no censorship on information posted
on the Internet and it would be accessible to everyone.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Internet sales in Malaysia were
projected to grow from 46 million U.S. dollars this year to 1
billion dollars by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the minister also called on developing
countries to work together to establish a common news network to
promote fair and accurate news reporting.
</P>
<P>
He said many of these countries do not have their own news
agencies and rely on the services of major news groups, thus
exposing them to negative reporting.
</P>
<P>
Moggie said many investment decisions were made on the basis of
news and reports published by major news organizations and as
such, commercialization together with an open market environment
had resulted in news being exploited mainly for economic benefits
and financial considerations.
</P>
<P>
To counter this monopoly on information communication
technologies and narrow the disparity between the
information-rich and information-poor countries, there is a need
for the developing countries to adopt technologies that are able
to provide equal access and empowerment for them, he said.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Adopts New Direction in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- DuPont China Co., Ltd. will
enhance its investment in the hi-tech fields in China as an effort
to cater to the U.S.-base multi-national company's new corporate
direction and new positioning as a science company.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its new policy, the company has substituted its
65 year old slogan of "Better Things for A Better Life" with "The
Miracles of Science."
</P>
<P>
"The new positioning is aimed at shifting the 200 year old
company's emphasis from a chemical to a science base," said
Kathleen Forte, Vice President of DuPont.
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, the company has withdrawn from the energy
sector and adjusting the level of its chemical business while
increasing investment in life science.
</P>
<P>
"The last two years have witnessed DuPont's investment of over
14 billion U.S. dollars in life science sectors such as
pharmaceuticals, food ingredients and agricultural biotechnology,"
said Forte, adding that the investment is more than half of the
company's total sales today.
</P>
<P>
She noted that DuPont is now expanding its investment to areas
of biology, agronomy, genetics and catalysis.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, DuPont also appointed a new vice president in
charge of its internet section, she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, DuPont China is expected to set up more
technology development branches and it is exploring cooperation
with China's Agriculture Ministry on the agricultural
biotechnology research," said Li Qing, general manager of DuPont
China.
</P>
<P>
Li also said that DuPont China will help to sponsor a seminar
during a science and technology festival taking place in Shanghai
this October.
</P>
<P>
The company is preparing the launch of the DuPont science award
together with the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Proposed EAEC in Better Position to Help Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The East Asian Economic
Caucus (EAEC) proposed by Malaysia would be in a better position
to set up the proposed Asian Monetary Fund to help Asian countries
overcome their financial problems, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EAEC is better suited to take care of financial problems
faced by Asian countries, Mahathir told a news conference in the
eastern state of Pahang at the end of his two-day visit to the
state, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said aid presently offered by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has a lot of strings attached.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said Japan could help the EAEC by giving loans or
investing directly to help the economies in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that when Japan helps the economies of East
Asia, East Asian countries will be a better market for Japan and
therefore what Japan invests in East Asia will actually help
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on calls for APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) to act on the second speculative attack on the Thai
baht, Mahathir said, "I don't think APEC is capable of doing
anything about the currency situation. That is left to the big
powers, the Group of Seven."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has called for formulating a new financial
architecture which will regulate currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has announced that he will not attend the APEC
leaders' informal meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, later this
month.

CAIRO -- The flow of direct foreign investments to Egypt has
increased from 200 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to 1 billion
dollars in 1998.

<P>
Tuesday's Arab daily Alam Al Yom quoted a report as saying that

AMMAN -- Jordanian Minister of Agriculture Hashem Shbul has
denied the existence of agricultural ties between Jordan and
Israel, pointing out that the two countries are currently engaged
in talks to put into effect agreements in the field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Alam Al Yom quotes Shbul as saying that agricultural
cooperation is directed towards Arab states.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan is making contacts with Qatar and Saudi Arabia
in a bid to lift their ban on Jordanian agricultural and poultry
products, now that tests have proven that Jordan is completely free
of dioxine infections.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The annual petrochemical production potentials of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are expected to reach some
41.5 million tons by the year 2003, as compared to their current
level of 19 million tons, with an annual rate of growth of 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a study worked out by Gulf industrial investment

TEHRAN -- The Iranian government approved Sunday an ambitious
five-year (2000/2005) economic plan which would provide about
750,000 job opportunities, though it would largely depend on
petroleum revenues.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Arab daily Al Hayat quoted Deputy Chairman of the
Iranian Planning and Treasury Organisation Mohamed Ali Najafi as
saying that the plan stipulates the provision of 750,000 job
opportunities as well as an annual rate of growth of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The plan is due to be submitted to the Consultative Council
next week for endorsement, he said.
</P>

<P>
The funds were approved at the conclusion of the 187th

projects and promote inter-Islamic trade in the 53 member states.
</P>
<P>
The bank, with a capital of 9 billion dollars, has extended 20
billion dollars for over 2,450 development projects since it
started operations in 1976.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 7 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwe Republic police
will abolish 12 senior posts to improve efficiency, Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri said the restructuring exercise will improve efficiency
by decentralizing the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
A special unit will also be established to deal with the
police corruption which he said had reached "alarming levels".
</P>
<P>
He said corruption was taking root because of the current harsh
economic conditions coupled with the low salaries of members of
the police. He said they are earning far less than they deserve.

<HEADLINE> HK, ROK Sign Reciprocal Bilateral Linkage Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) and the Korea Securities Depository (KSD) signed
agreements here Tuesday to set up a reciprocal bilateral linkage
between the HKMA's Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and the KSD.
</P>
<P>
The linkage will provide clearing and settlement services for
public and private debt securities in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
The CMU Membership Agreement and the KSD Depository Agreement
were signed by Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA and Dong-
kwan Kim, chairman and chief executive officer of the KSD at a
ceremony held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The link between the CMU and the KSD will commence operation on
September 8. This is the third bilateral linkage the CMU has
established with central securities depositories in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition to promoting the development of the regional debt
market, these bilateral linkages will also help reduce settlement
risk by facilitating cross-border delivery versus payment.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent establishment of links between the CMU and
the securities depositories in Australia and New Zealand, this
link between the CMU and the KSD marks another major step forward
for cross-border securities linkages in the region, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
This forms part of the on-going effort to develop the Asian
debt market by facilitating cross-border securities transactions
in a safe and efficient settlement mode, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The linkage we have now established will encourage the
development of a larger investor base in both ROK and Hong Kong
and provide greater cost-efficiency," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
Once the prepared system goes live, investors from these two
places will no longer have to go through separate custodian
networks but will have a direct contact to the KSD and HKMA, by
using direct accounts, Kim said. This will greatly improve the
safety and efficiency of their investment activities, he added.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) will hold the Thailand Health Mart on September 9
to demonstrate the country's growing line of medical and health
rejuvenation facilities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 102 buyers, mainly global travel agents
specializing in health and recreational packages, have already
arrived in Bangkok and are now touring the country's spas, herbal
treatment centers, meditation retreats and hospitals, a TAT press
release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mart, the first of its kind in the country, is in line with
the emphasis on niche-markets that the TAT has been concentrating
on all through the 1998-1999 Amazing Thailand campaign. Other
specialized product marts organized so far by the authority have
focused on Thai food, golf and adventure travel.
</P>
<P>
Patpong Abhijatapong, the TAT's market development director was
quoted as saying that the authority is quite optimistic that the
mart will help attract people all around the world to come to
Thailand and get medical treatment at a fraction of the price in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The mart will also help promote the home-grown traditions of
Thailand, such as Thai massage, herbal treatment and various other
forms of preventive and curative treatment, he said.

HARARE, September 7 (Xinhua) - Leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the country's largest national labor
organization, said the union-sponsored political party, the
Movement for Democratic Change, will be launched in Harare on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference Monday in Harare, ZCTU President
Gibson Sibanda said the country was facing social and economic
crises that had made the formation of an alternative formidable
political movement imperative, the daily Herald reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the incumbent government had failed to offer solutions
to the problems afflicting Zimbabwe and alleged that there was
growing corruption among top government officials.
</P>
<P>
"The Movement for Democratic Change calls on all Zimbabweans
living in the country and abroad to reclaim their power from those
who have misused it, to put in place a new leadership and
political system which will work in the interest of the people and
the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new party will represent the interests of people from all
walks of life, he added.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the new party and the ZCTU, he said
although there would be distinctions on the operations of the two,
the party would continue to draw its power from the workers'
movement.
</P>
<P>
"The ZCTU will retain its autonomy but, remember, it is the
workers who decided that we go this path. The relationship
between the two will be that of a strategic alliance," he said.

<HEADLINE> AFC Withdraws World Cup Boycott Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) formally withdrew its threatened boycott of
the 2002 World Cup finals on Tuesday after reaching an agreement
with FIFA on the allocation of teams for the finals.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released here by AFC and FIFA,
following a meeting in Zurich, Asian teams would participate in
the tournament to be held in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Asia's boycott threats were dropped after the AFC agreed to
accept a playoff berth offered by European governing body UEFA.
The berths for the Asian teams will remain as four and a half but
FIFA said in a statement it will reconsider the allocation of
Asian places for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy about the outcome of this meeting with His
Royal Highness. Unity in football has been restored and remains
our priority objective in the future. We can look forward to the
FIFA World Cup in Japan and Korea being a resounding success,"
Sepp Blatter, FIFA chief said in a statement from Zurich released
through the Asian Football Confederation here.
</P>
<P>
AFC President Sultan Ahmad Shah said: "I am happy to have been
able to resolve the differences between FIFA and my Confederation
regarding the number of seats for the 2002 finals. Now we can move
forward together for the good of the game in Asia, and devote our
full attention to the success of the World Cup, which will be held
in our continent for the first time at the start of the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
Asian members had subjected the boycott threat after being
handed only four berths at the tournament with a play-off chance
against a team from Europe. The four berths included the two co-
hosts Japan and South Korea. The AFC had demanded five automatic
berths.

<HEADLINE> Fixed-Asset Investment Boosts Growth of China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's Ministry of Finance has recently announced a 60-billion-
yuan (about 7.25 billion U.S. dollars) special bond issue to fund
spending on fixed assets to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the move is necessary to consolidate and
continue the growing trend of the national economy, which rose a
7.6 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China also issued an additional 100-billion-yuan
special bonds to prime-pump fixed-asset investment, which is
estimated to have pushed the growth of the national economy up by
1.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that
from 1950 to 1998, China spent a total 17.7993 trillion yuan on
fixed-asset construction, which laid a solid foundation for the
rapid growth of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has set up, from almost nothing,
a relatively comprehensive industrial complex, with its output of
iron and steel as well as coal currently ranking the first in the
world.

Currently, the nation's annual output of crude oil stands at
160 million tons, ranking the fifth in the world, while its annual
power output has reached 1.167 trillion kwh, ranking second in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a number of modern automobile works,
including the No.1 Automobile Works, No.2 Automobile Works and
Shanghai Volkswagen Corp., has greatly boosted China's auto
production capacity. China's auto output hit 1.63 million units in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the rapid development of traditional industries, new
industries such as electronics are also on a constant rise.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the output of micro-computers exceeded 2.9 million
units, and that of many home-appliances such as TV sets,
refrigerators and air-conditioners were also among the highest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-asset investment has greatly boosted the construction of
water-conservancy facilities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had built 85,000 large- and medium-
sized reservoirs, which can hold more than 450 billion cubic
meters of water.
</P>

By the end of last year, the total transport system of the
country, including highways and railways, totaled 2.975 million
kilometers, 15.4 times the figure in 1949 when the New China was

Meanwhile, the capacity of telephone exchanges reached 138

From 1979 to 1997, China spent more than 3.24 trillion yuan on
housing construction, and 16.1 billion square meters of floor
space were completed, raising the per-capita livable space of
urban residents to 9.3 square meters in 1998 from 3.6 square
meters in 1978 and that of rural residents to 23.7 square meters
from 8.1 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China's fixed-asset construction has
gone through various stages.
</P>
<P>
During the "First-Five-Year-Plan" period (1953-1957), China
spent 61.2 billion yuan in fixed assets, with which a batch of
basic industrial projects necessary for the country's
industrialization were completed.
</P>
<P>
In the following 20 years, fixed-asset investment experienced
ups and downs due to the "leftist" influence.
</P>
<P>
When reform and opening up policies were introduced in 1978,
China mapped out an economic development strategy focusing on
agriculture, energy, communications, education, and science and
technology, and fixed-asset investment enjoyed rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, fixed-asset investment has become a major factor
for boosting the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, fixed-asset investment jumped 14.1 percent over the
previous year, contributing more than 60 percent to GDP and
accounting for 4.8 percentage points in the 7.8-percent economic
growth.

BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's early rice output in
1999 reached 40.95 million tons, up 1.1 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the total
acreage of the crop this year dropped by 180,000 hectares, down 2.
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the unit output of early rice rose to 5,368 kg per
hectare, up 3.4 percent, due to relatively favorable weather
conditions and optimized production mix.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Chinese Government raised the purchasing price
for quality grain while abandoning the protection price for poor-
quality grain, a move that has prompted farmers to reduce the
acreage of poor-quality early rice.
</P>
<P>
Instead, farmers increased the acreage of quality early rice.
In central China's Hunan Province, for example, the acreage of
early rice acreage jumped more than 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Actively Pursues Int'l Cooperation to Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese procuratorial bodies
are pushing for international cooperation in the fight against
corruption and have initiated global contacts as one important
step for stopping embezzlement and bribery, Chinese senior
prosecutor Zhao Dengju said here today.
</P>
<P>
China has signed bilateral treaties of judicial assistance
and extradition with more than 20 countries and are negotiating
such treaties with additional countries, said Zhao, deputy
procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, at the
ongoing annual meeting of International Association of Prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation involves investigations, obtaining
evidence, freezing bank accounts, search and seizure, delivery of
litigation documents, and the arrest of criminal suspects, Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese anti-corruption officials have effectively curbed
the spread of embezzlement and bribery through decades of effort,
but new developments in recent years have contributed to more
difficulties in the fight against such crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed these new developments as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Modern financial settlement and operation methods have
changed the way bribery is carried out, and in many cases this
crime has become even more covert;
</P>
<P>
-- New cases perpetrated by making use of modern scientific
and technical knowledge, specifically electronic and special
knowledge about futures and securities are on the increase, which
is often difficult for prosecutors; and
</P>
<P>
-- Globalization of commerce also gives rise to
transnational crimes of bribery and embezzlement, and joint
efforts for cross-border assistance in combating such crimes still
lag behind, creating many difficulties for prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Zhao urged prosecutors from all countries to join hands in
sharing their anti-corruption experience, circulating and
delivering anti-corruption information and data, and training.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Suicides can cost the society
multi-million dollars a year, according to a study published
Tuesday in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The country's Globe and Mail newspaper said that the average
cost of each suicide reached 849,877.80 Canadian dollars (about
569,424.29 U.S. dollars) in the eastern province of New Brunswick
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total 96 suicide cases cost the society 80 million Canadian
dollars (about 53.6 million dollars) in the province that year,
the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The figures, billed as the first in Canada, were released in
the current issue of Chronic Diseases in Canada written by two
researchers Alberta Barcelo and Dale Clayton.
</P>
<P>
Suicides cause direct costs for health care services, autopsies,
funerals and police investigations, as well as indirect costs from
lost productivity and earnings, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barcelo said in an interview that the study was done to
show the importance of measures to prevent suicide.
</P>
<P>
"Economic studies are a way to raise awareness of a health
problem. That way you can show people the importance of prevention
in that area," the newspaper quoted him as saying.

ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Share prices of the Karachi
Stock Exchange (KSE) fell Tuesday amid heavy selling in blue chip
stocks owing to shaky confidence of investors after the general
strike held country wide last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 index closed 18.97 points, or 1.63 percent lower to

The total volume of the trade on Tuesday stood at 99.511
million shares against last Friday's 150.848 million shares.
</P>
<P>
"The high carry over transaction (COT) charges on Friday
coupled with the Saturday's strike in the country particularly in
Karachi depressed the mood of the investors as they fear that
unification of opposition would weaken the government and create
political uncertainty in the country," said Faisal Abbas, a dealer
with Ali Husain Rajabali Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said the investors were reluctant to take new positions
and in addition the local institutions were also keeping
themselves to the sidelines due to lack of interest which
encouraged the sellers to take control of the market.

Of the 156 active issues, losers beat gainers 72 to 34 while 50

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia hopes that the
result of the ballot in East Timor will be accepted in good faith
by the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We want the result to be accepted because the Indonesian
government decided to give the East Timor people a choice of
remaining within Indonesia as an autonomous region or being
independent. Now that they have chosen to be independent, the
parties concerned have to accept the result," Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir gave his view at a press conference at the end of his
two-day visit to the eastern state of Pahang, when asked to
comment on the latest developments in East Timor which had plunged
into disorder following the United Nations-organized ballot held
on August 30, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced last Saturday that 78.5 percent of East
Timorese had opted for independence from Indonesia and rejected
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Jakarta Tuesday said Indonesia had declared
martial law in East Timor by presidential decree following
continued rioting and killings in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges Major Powers to Arrest India's Nuke Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday
categorically appealed to the international community, especially
the major powers to refrain India from nuclear operationalization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing foreign reporters and diplomats here, Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad said the international community
needs to respond "in a coherent and determined way" to arrest
India's "dangerous plans for nuclear and conventional arms
escalation."
</P>
<P>
His speech presented at the Institute of Strategic Studies of
Pakistan was the first comprehensive response to India's nuclear
doctrine announced last month.
</P>
<P>
The doctrine envisages all-round nuclear capability to ensure a
first strike survival and nuclear revenge which has met fierce
criticisms from many countries including Pakistan and some major
powers in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Shamshad, the international community,
particularly those major powers, need to press India to assure
that it will not conduct further nuclear tests, operationally
deploy its nuclear weapons or build hundreds of nuclear warheads
as envisaged by its nuclear doctrine.
</P>
<P>
He put forward 10 requirements for India which include India
should not produce or possess large stocks of fissile materials,
create sea-based and submarine-based nuclear forces, acquire,
develop or deploy anti-ballistic missile system and others.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also stressed that India should seriously address and
resolve the outstanding issues with Pakistan, specially the Jammu
and Kashmir dispute, and enter into negotiations with Pakistan to
elaborate a "strategic restraint regime" for South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has alerted the major powers and other members of the
international community to the danger posed by India's nuclear
doctrine which graphically sets out New Delhi's political and
military ambitions, nuclear as well as conventional," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary blamed India for the conventional and
nuclear arms race in the sub-continent, saying India aims to build
offensive, and not defensive, military capability.
</P>
<P>
He warned against India's additional nuclear tests. "If India
does conduct further nuclear tests, this will, once again, oblige
Pakistan to respond."
</P>
<P>
India exploded its nuclear devices in May 1998, which was
ensued by Pakistan's similar tests in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad noted that "certain preparations made by India last
year to conduct additional nuclear tests have not been reversed so
far."
</P>
<P>
He called on the world to press India to sign and ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and reverse "the preparations
it has made for further nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
India had agreed to sign the treaty by this September, but it
broke the promise on grounds of the upcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
Certain major powers have been repeatedly beguiled by India's
ambiguous assurances in its history of nuclear programs despite
Pakistan's cautionary advice, said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
Turning a blind eye again to India's "dangerous plans and
contentions" will have "grave implications," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad pointed out that India's nuclear doctrine envisages
some 400 nuclear warheads and the acquisition of other advanced
weapon systems including high-performance fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will not follow India's militaristic example," he
said. "Pakistan will find ways and means to maintain credible
nuclear deterrence against India without the need to match it bomb
for bomb, missile for missile."
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the increasing imparity in conventional
fields with the continuous acquisition of sophisticated weapons by
India will oblige Pakistan to rely more on its nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the foreign secretary hinted that
Pakistan probably will not sign the CTBT by September, saying the
circumstances free of coercion and pressure, or a complete lift of
the economic sanctions on Pakistan imposed by western countries,
have not yet been realized.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the regional situation has drastically changed after
the Kargil conflict and especially the announcement of India's
nuclear doctrine, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not keep unmindful of the changed situation," he
added.

<HEADLINE> China Indignant at Landing on Diaoyu Island: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China calls on the Japanese side to take effective measures to
punish those responsible for the incident and stem such action,
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at a routine press
conference here, in response to a journalist's question.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that three members of Seinensha, a Japanese
rightist group, landed on the Diaoyu Island on September 5. Sun
described the move as seriously infringing on Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the Diaoyu Island and adjacent isles are
universally acknowledged to be an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory, for which there is indisputable historical and legal
proof.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the important consensus that the Chinese and
Japanese governments had previously reached and the solemn
commitments the Japanese side had made, the Japanese government
maintains a laissez-faire attitude towards these right-wing
activists and their actions which infringe Chinese sovereignty, he
commented, expressing China's grave displeasure over the incident.
</P>
<P>
China demands that the Japanese government take immediate and
effective measures to punish those responsible for the incident,
wipe the slate clean, and keep its word that no such incident will
happen again, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: Martial law in E.Timor Temporary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said here Tuesday that the state of military emergency
proclaimed in East Timor could be temporary, and could be revoked
if the situation returns to normal.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said peace and order could not be restored in the
territory if the violence continues.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Armed Forces declared a state of emergency in
East Timor Tuesday morning following serious violence occurred in
the territory after the announcement of the direct autonomy ballot
on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Reports said dozens of people have been killed in the clashes
between the pro-integration and pro-independence groups in the
last three days.
</P>
<P>
The clashes also forced more than 100,000 people to flee to
some provinces in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the government will fulfill the responsibility of
maintaining security and carry through an orderly governmental
transition to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The government respects and accepts the ballots' result that
78.5 percent of East Timorese voters have turned down Indonesia's
offer of autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie also called on all parties in East Timor to restrain
themselves and to end the bloodshed. Without having support from
all layers of society, it will be impossible to restore peace and
order, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Minister and Commander of the Armed Forces
Wiranto said the conditions will be worse if the state of
emergency is not proclaimed in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the security situation remains tense, as brutal actions
such as killing and burning keep occurring. Economic activities
and public service are paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
On the presence of a U.N. peace-keeping force, Wiranto
reiterated that the government can get its own security forces to
restore law and order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the United Nations as a non-self-governing
territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Portugal
Tuesday signed an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation
and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Finance Richard Hu and Portuguese
Minister of Finance Antonio Luciano Pacheco de Sousa Franco signed
the agreement on behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will enter into force after it has been
ratified by both countries, is the 42nd comprehensive tax treaty
which Singapore has signed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will serve to prevent double taxation of income
earned in one country by a resident of the other and the document
will make clear the taxing rights between Singapore and Portugal
on all forms of income which arise as a consequence of
cross-border economic activities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for reduction or exemption of tax
at source on certain types of income.
</P>
<P>
These provisions are expected to bring about greater cross-flow
of trade, investment, technical know-how and expertise between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Poor Students Offered Special Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- As a way of helping poor
college students complete their studies, China's Ministry of
Education has continued its 700 million-yuan loan scheme across
eight major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was first introduced in 1994 and the ministry says
it has strived to perfect it ever since, even by issuing
instructions for education departments at all levels to make real
efforts to ensure students who are financially-strapped can
continue studying.
</P>
<P>
In June this year the ministry re-issued the memo, asking local
governments and universities to deduct ten percent of the tuition
fee as a help for students.
</P>
<P>
As a further help, Chinese universities have also set up a
system which incorporates fellowships, loans and other funds for
helping students, all of which have helped towards the goal of
ensuring every college student can complete their studies.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will import school
uniform materials worth 10.2 million U.S. dollars from China under
an intergovernmental trade agreement, a senior Chinese diplomat
here confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Education and Higher Education Ministry of Sri Lanka will
buy the 11.3 million meter-long materials for the year 2000 from
China at a concessionary price, said Dong Jiang, the first
secretary of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry could save 210,000 dollars for the price is two
percent less than the usual price in response to a request made by
Minister Richard Pathirana, she said.
</P>
<P>
The two governments signed the agreement last Friday, Dong
said, adding that there is almost a 50 percent increase in trade
volumes on the uniform materials over last year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka imported 7.8 million meters uniform material at a
cost of 6.89 million dollars from China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government carries out a free education policy.
It spends more than 30 million dollars each year to provide free
uniform materials, textbooks and concessionary travel facilities
for students.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of free uniform materials was first initiated
in 1993. The new materials will be distributed among school
children within the first term of the year 2000.

LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Tuesday that Britain would be "heavily involved" in
trying to bring peace to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look with our colleagues at ways in which we can
restore order as quickly as possible.... Britain will be heavily
involved," Cook, who is currently on a visit to Japan, told BBC

"We have got a ship in the area which could be of assistance if

</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary cut short a visit to Tokyo to
join foreign ministers from the region for the crisis summit in
Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The emergency talks will seek ways to end the escalating
bloodshed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the talks must aim to find a way of bringing
independence to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unlikely martial law would work in East Timor in
the face of the Indonesian army's failure to restore order.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Science Foundation Cracks Down On Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A crackdown on scientists who
cheat when applying for research and other related funds is to be
strengthened in a bid to ensure that the system is not abused in
the future and used properly.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been launched by the supervising committee of
the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) and an
official said today that fraudulent practice will be strictly
punished.
</P>
<P>
Examples of such activities include a teacher at a university,
referred to only by his surname Xia, who has lost the right to
apply for funds from the NNSFC forever because he lied about
academic titles and honors using counterfeit certificates.
</P>
<P>
Another teacher is to be denied access to funds over the next
four years for plagiarizing articles, publishing them in foreign
journals and then claiming his research was supported by the NNSFC.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two other applicants who tried to secure funds by
using undeserved titles such as "associate professor" or
concealing pre-doctoral status, would be excluded from applying to
the national natural science fund for next year.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official said that the healthy development of the
science fund project must be based on truth, and scientific
professionalism should be stressed in China's academic fields.

MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Air
Transportation Office (ATO) has allocated 55.6 million pesos (1.37
million U.S. dollars) to deal with the Y2K computer problem,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and Communications Secretary Vicente River was
quoted as saying that the Y2K problem in the aviation sector is
being addressed in earnest by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past months, the ATO has successfully
completed the end-to-end Y2K testing of its aeronautical fixed
telecommunications network system with its counterpart on the Hong
Kong's Civil Aviation Authority.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the ATO's mainframe computer has been declared Y2K
compliant after a series of tests and validations.
</P>
<P>
Y2K is a problem referring to computers' inability to reset
their internal clocks for the year 2000. Without adaptation, they
will reset to 1900.
</P>
<P>
The target time for the ATO to make its facilities Y2K ready is
September 30, the significant end of the Y2K Conscious Month
declared earlier by Philippine President Joseph Estrada.

PARIS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The city of Saverne in Bas-Rhin
of east France will host an exhibition on the great German poet
Wolfgang Goethe to mark his 250th birthday, the Agence France-
Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
With 450 objects, many of which are previously unpublished
documents, the exhibition is organized by the German government
and will move on to Bologne, Italy.
</P>
<P>
One of the rare curiosities to be presented in Saverne is a
letter written by Goethe to the daughter of the pastor of
Sessenheim, Frederik Brion.
</P>
<P>
The display also follows the trail of the tours made by Goethe
across Europe during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be held from September 18 to October 31.
</P>
<P>
Goethe is regarded by France as one who has spread the French
culture to Germany, but he missed two chances of visiting Paris --
once by declining an offer of a diplomat's post there, another
time by turning down an invitation from Bonaparte Napoleon.

KAMPALA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Some Ugandan members of
parliament (MPs) have signed a new motion to investigate the
army's activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and especially the list of those soldiers killed in recent clashes
with Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
More than 28 MPs have signed the motion moved by Aggrey Awori,
an outspoken MP, the Monitor daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Awori was quoted as saying on Monday evening that he was
confident that over 60 legislators would sign the motion by the
end of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These MPs said that the report of Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni on the DRC issue on August 30 did not touch the essential
issues and they demanded the accountability of the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told parliament that a total 38 Ugandan soldiers
including one captain had been killed in clashes with Rwandan
troops in Kisangani, a northern town of the DRC, in mid-August,
the largest ever shoot-out between these two traditional allies
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni and Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame met
in time to stop the escalation of the war in Kisangani.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Diamond Miner Could Become Sector Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibian diamond miner
Namco could edge out De Beers as the world's biggest marine
diamond producer within two years, The Star's Business Report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Namco confirmed last week that it would take effective control
of the Ocean Diamond Mining Holdings (ODM) by buying more shares.
</P>
<P>
The combined production from Namco and ODM could top 360,000
carats in the financial year of 2000 and reach 650,000 carats in
2002, a diamond analyst, Hilton Ashton, estimated Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they can surpass De Beers Marine (Debmarine) as the
biggest marine diamond producer in the world... depending on just
how much Debmarine's production grows," Ashton w
</P>
<P>
Another industry source, who wished to remain anonymous, was
more bullish in a prediction that the combined Namco/ODM operation
could generate nearly 500,000 carats next year and 780,000 carats
in the financial year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
"By using Namco's technology on ODM's concessions and
upgrading ODM's production methods, the combined group could see a
marked increase in production in the next two years," he said.

<HEADLINE> CDB Vows Effective Use of Loans Supporting T-Bond Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The China Development Bank (
CDB) will give strong support to projects invested by the state's
newly issued 60 billion yuan treasury bonds and will ensure safe
and effective use of loans channeled to these projects.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CDB said today that it will continue to
support infrastructure projects including highways, railways,
power supply networks and urban infrastructure construction, and
major support will also be given to technology and environmental
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CDB will adhere to the principle of choosing
projects that are profitable, capable of repaying the principal
loan and interest and enjoy good market potential. No support will
be given to construction redundant projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August this year, the CDB had promised to invest
in 52 projects and had looked at 50 of them, with the promised
amount of loans totaling 50.48 billion yuan, of which 11.4 billion
yuan will be extended this year.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure safe and effective use of these loans, the CDB will
speed up project appraisal procedures and facilitate capital
allocation," the spokesman said, adding that the bank will
strengthen its supervision on the use of the loans and project
quality.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the CDB granted loans of 31.9 billion yuan to support
project investments following the state's issuance of 100 billion
yuan in supplementary T-bonds, accounting for 32 percent of such
loans by all commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Boost Investment in Rural Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Estrada
will soon launch a program to boost private investors' infusion of
capital and technology into joint ventures in the countryside, a
senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agrarian Reform Secretary Horacio Morales said the joint
venture scheme will not only encourage the private sector to
inject capital and technology in the agricultural sector, but also
boost the government's poverty alleviation and food security
programs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the guidelines are basically intended to
protect the rights and interest of farmer beneficiaries contrary
to the allegations that these would only favor the landowners,
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, these guidelines will redound to the benefits of
farmer beneficiaries. Without them, we may have joint venture
agreements that are unfair and disadvantageous to farmers and
farmworkers," Morales explained.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, he said, DAR will not allow the transfer or
sale of land titles or certificates of land ownership award. Only
the "use of the land" will serve as the farmer-beneficiaries'
equity in the joint venture enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Morales said a major condition for the approval of any
arrangement between farmers' groups and the investor is the
retention of land ownership by farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This means the farmers' equity in the venture consists only
of the use of the land and not the land itself, which cannot also
be used to settle obligations of the joint venture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, farmers' ownership of the land is secure even if
farm operations are jointly managed," he added.

<P>
PYONGYANG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A commentary of the Korean
Central News Agency on Monday urged South Korea to recognize the
west sea border line declared by Pyongyang last week, saying it
will take firm actions in self-defense against any violations.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South
Korea ran into naval clashes on June 15 over the disputed waters
along the two countries' west sea border. In the wake of the
incident, the DPRK and the United States held six talks in
Panmunjon on the demarcation of a maritime boundary between the
two Koreas but failed to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK then rejected further talks and on September 2
declared its maritime military control zone which covered all
waters contiguous to five South Korea-controlled islands in the
area with a population of 6,900.

his contribution to marine conservation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Magnus Ngoile, Director General of the Tanzanian National
Environment Management Council, won the Pew Marine Conservation
Fellowship from the United States Pew Charitable Trusts, The
Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's largest and most prestigious awards for sea
 preservation, the fellowship is in recognition of Ngoile's
dedication and professional approach in marine conservation.
</P>
<P>
Ngoile's Pew Fellowship resource will be utilized in
establishing a marine reserve in Kilwa, a pristine coastal
district south of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The district has a coastal strip of about 150 kilometers long
which is full of reefs and historical areas.
</P>

The Pew-funded project, he said, will not only establish a
marine park but also become the guiding light for future
development and contribute toward a more dynamic economy.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Up in Kenya's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners invested 1.06
million U.S. dollars in Kenya's stock market in August and only
took away 412,446 dollars, according to the Nairobi Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the bourse with a net foreign
capital inflow after 11 straight months of a downward spiral, the
East African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But brokers noted that it did not mean that foreigners'
appetite for Nairobi stocks was on a rise, nor did it signal an
end to the market's recent misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
They said foreign investors bought heavily in only one company,
the East African Breweries Limited, which accounted for 97.4
percent of the total foreign inflows.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi stock market has struggled to recover since 1997
when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a loan
package to Kenya on grounds of runaway corruption and poor
governance in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The country's retreating economy and poor corporate profits
have weakened Nairobi's main 20-share index to its lowest level in
six year, with a drop of 15.9 percent since the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Local brokers expected that in the coming few months it was
mainly the Breweries company to lure foreign investors to the
market.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts pointed out that a rise in treasury bill
yields showed the government was not cutting down on its
expenditure, encouraging investors' focus on the money market.

<HEADLINE> China to Check Enforcement of Compulsory Education Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide campaign is to be
launched by China's highest legislature to check how the law on
compulsory education for all has been enforced in a bid to ensure
that the nine-year compulsory education is basically realized by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
Five inspection teams, each headed by a vice-chairman from the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, will set out
in September and October to visit five provinces, autonomous
regions and the municipalities of Henan, Chongqing, Hubei,
Xinjiang and Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problems in the education field at present are the
shortage of funds and teachers as well as the low proficiency
level of teachers in poverty-stricken areas," said Peng Peiyun,
vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee who stressed that
these issues will top the inspection teams' agenda.
</P>
<P>
Since the law was enacted in 1986, it is estimated that its
target of providing education for all eligible youngsters by the
end of 1998 has, in most areas, reached a 73-percent success level.
And nine provinces and the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai report a 100-percent implementation.

However, according to Peng, in poverty-stricken areas only two
percent of the counties had fully met the standards up to last
year, which she insists is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of investment in education, 23 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities have failed to spend enough money
according to the law," she said, explaining that it strictly
stipulates that the annual increase of educational funds shall be
more than the increase of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The situation in poor regions of China is graver than others,
because local governments have a certain reputation for delaying
the payment of teachers' salaries or merely writing them IOUs.
</P>
<P>
Peng also called for special attention to be paid to the still
large number of girl dropouts in poor areas. "The educational
background of girls will determine to some extent the professional
standards of Chinese citizens in the 21st century."

<P>
The other four vice-chairmen heading the inspection groups are

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Enhanced Sino-Australian Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin called for efforts to strengthen economic and trade
cooperation between China and Australia in several areas at the
Sino-Australian trade and investment Summit held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Jiang said, it is important to constantly explore new
areas for trade while continuing to develop trade in the
traditional areas. For example, Australia may take a more active
part in the market competition in China in such areas as energy
and environmental protection while some Chinese industries such as
household electric appliances and telecom also have opportunities
for big development in the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, China has identified the infrastructure and pillar
industries as its priorities for development and Australian
business community is welcome to invest in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, China and Australia have their respective advantages
in science and technology and have accumulated rich experience.
This has afforded the two countries an opportunity to draw upon
each other's useful experience and make up for each other's
deficiencies to the benefit of their common progress.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, China and Australia should increase consultation and
cooperation in APEC and international financial institutions and
make joint efforts for Ecotech and the reform of the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed the participants at the seminar on China's
opening up and modernization drive and reviewed the development of
Sino-Australian economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the past two decades or so have witnessed a rapid
development of the economic and trade relations between China and
Australia. Especially since the beginning of the 1990s, the
development of this relationship has picked up momentum. The
economic cooperation and two-way trade have expanded further in
terms of the areas they cover and the bilateral trade volume has
kept growing for seven years in a run.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Jiang's speech, Premier of the State of Victoria
Jefferey Kennett and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia John
Anderson also addressed the summit.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Australian officials and representatives from the
Australian industrial and commercial circles attended the summit.
Also present were Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen and other
members of Jiang's entourage.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president held separate talks earlier in the day
with Governor of the Victoria State James Gobbo and Premier
Kennett, who extended cordial welcome to him.
</P>
<P>
Jiang thanked the government and people of the State of
Victoria for their warm hospitality accorded him since his arrival
in Melbourne. The Sino-Australian relations have witnessed
considerable development thanks to the joint efforts of both
sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of the sisterly relationship between the State of
Victoria and China's Jiangsu Province. He hoped that the two sides
will continuously expand the mutually beneficial cooperation into
new areas.
</P>
<P>
Also in the morning, Jiang visited a research institute on
bionic ears, and met with members of the Chinese general consulate
in Melbourne, representatives from China-funded institutions as
well as representatives of Chinese students studying in Australia,
ethnic Chinese and Chinese nationals living in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches "Love Your River Month" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday launched
the national level "Love Your River" Month as part of its efforts
to ensure ultimately all rivers in the country are clean and free
of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beautification and cleaning-up works on 423 of the 1,800 rivers
in the country have been intensified by the Drainage and
Irrigation Development (DID), an official of the Agriculture
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched by the Agriculture Ministry's
Secretary- General Annuar Ma'aruf in the northeastern state of
Terengganu, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to keep the rivers clean, local authorities should
provide proper garbage disposal sites for people in riverine
settlements, the official said, adding however, the most important
aspect of keeping the rivers clean is public awareness and
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the pollution level of the country's
rivers was under control and so far there was no river which was
beyond redemption.
</P>
<P>
Last year 20 rivers in Malaysia were categorized as "very
polluted" but some of them had been cleaned up, he said.
</P>
<P>
The DID spends 5 million ringgit (about 1.315 million U.S.
dollars) annually on river cleaning-up and beautification works
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
During the "Love Your River" campaign, activities to be carried
out include river adoption, river watch, education and lectures,
river expedition and river beautification.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Press Highlights Visit of Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein's ongoing visit to Kuwait is being felt strongly here
Tuesday morning, especially in the local press.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's major newspapers, both Arabic and English, carried
front-page headline stories and big photos concerning the trip by
the Jordanian monarch and his wife Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, who
was brought up in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It seems that old memories have given way to the new desire of
both sides to turn "a new page in the history of the long and deep
relations" between Jordan and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was quoted by the newspapers as saying upon his
arrival for the visit on Monday that "passing difference will not
affect the development of relations between the two Arab states."
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Kuwaiti links were all but broken as King Abdullah's
late father, King Hussein, failed to stand by Kuwait during the
1990 Gulf crisis resulted from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait began the rapprochement process more than
two years ago, after Kuwait expressed its desire to improve its
ties with all Arab states except Iraq, which was meanwhile
distanced by Amman itself.
</P>
<P>
As Queen Rania was born in Kuwait 29 years ago to a Jordanian
family of Palestinian origin, her whirlwind trip Monday to
Kuwait's New English School, Rania's alma mater, and the house she
used to live in arrested no less attention than her husband's
encounter with Kuwaiti officials.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Queen, once a successful and popular student,
was overwhelmingly greeted by school teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
Since Kuwaiti officials had ruled out any specific agenda
during Abdullah's two-day stay, analysts here believe that
sensitive issues that could revive the old unpleasant memories
may not be touched upon in bilateral talks.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Receipts Hit Lowest Rate in 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's gross metal receipts
have steadily been reducing, with the latest figure hitting the
lowest in the past six years, according to the July macroeconomic
indicators available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures for copper receipts for the first six months
of this year closed at 156.9 million U.S. dollars compared to
272.4 million dollars during the same period in 1998. Cobalt
results were at 194.4 million dollars for January to June this
year, while the amount accrued during 1998 was at 331.6 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The results from the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM),
the major player in the country, have been slumping, both for
copper and cobalt.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM, for the first half last year had receipts amounting
to 194.8 million dollars, dropping to 131.6 million dollars as at
June since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The receipts for the past six years show copper starting with
790.3 million dollars in 1992, reaching 578.6 million dollars in
1995 and 533.89 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at Barclays bank said in their latest quarterly report
that the continued degradation in earnings from the mining sector
is severely impacting on the national economy, and replacement
economic activity will not be created in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Observers also said Zambia's mining industry should have taken
advantage of the rise in copper prices experienced at the London
Metal Exchange, closing at 74.29 U.S. cents per pound as at July
this year.
</P>
<P>
The lowest recorded was at 62 cents per pound in March this
year, and has since being going up, with analysts saying this
could be as a result of the up-looking international market,
especially in East Asia.

<HEADLINE> China's High-Tech Zones Producing Wealthy Ventures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's high-tech development
zones have 68 ventures with annual incomes of more than a billion
yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) after 8 years of development.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan says that her
ministry is pushing for the adoption of a high-tech development
zone law and is encouraging several of them to become major high-
tech parks.
</P>
<P>
China's 52 industrial high-tech development zones have 9
corporate groups with annual incomes above 5 billion yuan, 7 of
which are solely Chinese, like Legend, Haier, Changhong Hisense,
and Beida Founders.
</P>
<P>
According the state development plan, the annual incomes of 52
state-level high-tech development zones is expected to reach 500
billion yuan by the end of 2000, or about a fifth of the country's
increased industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoying, who is in charge of high-tech development zones,
says that the rapid development has depended on high-tech
developments of Chinese scientists and improvements of foreign
technology. By the end of 1998, 76 percent of their products were
developed by Chinese scientists and they had over 16,000 ventures
making 480 billion yuan in all.
</P>
<P>
Per capita output value of the high-tech development zones was
240,000 yuan, much higher than the average of the country's
industrial ventures. About 80 percent of the zones focus on
electronics, information, bio-tech products, new materials, new
energy, energy saving devices, and environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Pro-Independence Leader Xanana Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's pro-independence
leader Xanana Gusmao has been released based on an amnesty granted
by the Indonesian president on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty was signed by President B.J. Habibie and Minister
for Justice/State Secretary Muladi as the government's
representative at the office of the Justice Ministry Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"Xanana was released today and now I hand him over to UNAMET
(United Nations Mission in East Timor) ... I hope Xanana can
participate actively in settling problems in East Timor," Muladi
said after signing the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Although Xanana has been handed over to UNAMET, the Indonesian
government is still responsible for his safety and security as he
is still in the Indonesian territory, Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
On where Xanana would be freed, Muladi said Xanana would not be
brought to Dili, capital of East Timor, or another area in East
Timor before the situation in the former Portuguese colony is
safe.
</P>
<P>
"But one day he must be there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, president of the East Timor Resistance Council (CNRT),
was arrested by Indonesian troops in East Timor on November 20,
1992. He was imposed a life sentence by Dili court on May 21, 1993
for illegal arms possession.
</P>
<P>
Then, his sentence was commuted by former president Soeharto to
20 years and three months after a Dili court's decision.
</P>
<P>
He was in Cipinang prison for five years before being
transferred to a detention house near the Salemba prison in
Central Jakarta in February 1999 as part of the government's
effort to help the peaceful process of solution to the East Timor
issue.

<HEADLINE> World Ancient City Conference Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Ancient City
Conference, which was scheduled for mid-September in the capital
of Shaanxi Province, northwest China, has been postponed because
of the recent earthquake in Turkey that prevented the mayor of
Istanbul from coming on time.
</P>
<P>
And the new date of the meeting has not yet been set, an
official with the organizing committee said today.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to gather mayors of the world's five
ancient capitals: Athens, Istanbul, Cairo, Rome, and Xi'an. A
proposal of Xi'an last year called for mayors and representatives
to meet regularly in the five cities to discuss urban protection,
construction, planning, and cultural heritage protection.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to organize cultural, academic and information
exchange programs when they meet.
</P>
<P>
The five are the birthplace of Eastern and Western culture and
have a great deal of historical significance and large numbers of
cultural relics and, therefore, face similar tasks in protecting
their cultural heritage.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Former Rebel Leader Plays Down Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Foday Sankoh, Sierra Leone's
former rebel leader Monday played down a growing rift in his camp
and promised a quick solution to the present hostage drama when
visiting Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Iovire.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said he planned to go to rebel-controlled territory to
smooth differences between his Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
and renegade soldiers allied with it, according to reports
available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for trouble. But this is proof to the world
that RUF has not been the problem in Sierra Leone," Sankoh added.
</P>
<P>
The renegade soldiers demanding a better deal under a July
peace accord to end the nine-year civil war in Sierra Leone have
kidnapped two RUF commanders preparing Sankoh's return home.
</P>
<P>
The ex-soldiers, who control towns and territory north of the
capital Freetown, had abducted scores of foreign hostages for
about a week early last month to press for similar demands.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said he was directing negotiations with the abductors
and expected his commanders to be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said he expected to be in Cote d'Ivoire for a
few more days for a possible meeting with President Henri Konan
Bedie and Foreign Minister Essy Amara.
</P>
<P>
Both men were in Libya Monday for a special summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OUA) after attending a meeting of
heads of state of the Francophonie movement in Canada. From
Cote d'Ivoire, Sankoh plans to go first to Liberia to meet
President Charles Taylor, who is close to both the RUF and the
former soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Because of renewed tension in Sierra Leone, Nigeria at the
weekend suspended a pullout of its 12,000 troops spearheading a
regional force defending the Freetown government since 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, the chief of
General Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), in talks here
today with his Guinean counterpart Ibrahima Diallo, pointed to the
deep traditional friendship between the people and the military
services of their countries, which has developed more in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his gratitude to the Guinean government for its
adherence to the "one China" policy and its support on issues like
human rights, and said he believes that the friendship and
cooperative ties between the two countries and their armed
services will be further developed through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Fu also explained China's views on the international situation,
its defense policy and military development, and reiterated China'
s stance on the Taiwan issue, emphasizing that the PLA is
determined, confident, and able to safeguard the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country and maintain unity.
</P>
<P>
Diallo said that because China is an important force in
maintaining world peace and stability, Guinea hopes that it will
have an even greater role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Guinea is grateful for China's long-term support and aid, he
said, expressing his hope that the two countries will further
expand cooperation and exchanges. He also reiterated the Guinean
government's firm commitment to the "one China" policy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Czech Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian has told Jiri Sedivy, visiting chief of the General Staff
of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, that his trip will
undoubtedly enhance the existing bond of trust and friendship
between the two countries and military services.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and a State Councilor, said the Chinese government and
its armed forces attach considerable importance to the growth of
ties with its Czech counterparts in every aspect.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what has occurred in the international arena,
both the bilateral state and military relationships have kept
steady growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Chi pointed out that national unification
is the common aspiration of the 1.2 billion Chinese people, as
well as those living in Taiwan, stressing that the Chinese people
oppose any attempt to create "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan"
or "independence for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The malicious "two states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui is a ploy to
divide China, he said. The expected reunification will be realized
by peaceful means under the policy of "one country and two systems
" as expounded by the Chinese government, Chi declared.
</P>
<P>
"However, China will not commit itself to abandon the use of
force in this issue, for it will not target the Taiwan people but
those hostile forces working both on and outside the island of
Taiwan to split China," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed Sedivy and his party on China's current
domestic situation and the army's construction.
</P>
<P>
Sedivy extended his congratulations for the forthcoming 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He
expressed his belief that as developing countries, Czech and China
could explore new areas of cooperation in terms of the military
and in general.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Lowering Import Tariffs: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to lower
its import tariffs for industrial products to 15 percent next year
and to 10 percent before the year 2005, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Tuesday in a speech delivered at the Australia-
China Trade and Investment Summit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China will, as always, actively participate in
international economic cooperation and improve its all-direction,
multi-dimension and wide-range opening-up pattern.
</P>
<P>
China has opened more areas for foreign-funded banks to deal in
RMB business and for pilot projects of Sino-foreign joint ventures
in foreign trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, we will provide opportunities for trade in
services such as foreign investments in the banking, insurance,
tourism, retail, foreign trade and legal services, while stepping
up opening-up efforts in the energy, transportation,
communications and other infrastructure industries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also promised to improve the country's legal
system to create a better environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"We will further improve the system of laws and regulations on
foreign investment, protect the rights and interests of foreign-
funded enterprises in strict compliance with law, protect
intellectual property rights and improve service for foreign-
invested enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the steady progress in economic and social development,
Jiang said, the enormous potentialities of the Chinese market will
be further tapped.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China is expected to import 1.5 trillion U.
S. dollars' worth of goods during the coming seven years.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the first decade of the next century, the
Chinese economy is expected to maintain a relatively high growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for economic cooperation and trade between China
and the rest of the world will be "even broader," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Researcher Says Educational TV Needs To Be More Appealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Very few primary and middle
school students in China watch educational TV that is directed at
them, according to a recent survey by the China Juvenile Research
Center (CJRC).
</P>
<P>
The study of 6,742 students and their parents from the cities
of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai municipalities, and Liaoning,
Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan, Sichuan and Guangdong provinces
finds that only 1.1 percent of the senior middle school students
watch educational TV and 2.9 percent of junior middle school
students and 9.6 percent of primary school students do.
</P>
<P>
Senior and junior middle school students favor series (34.6
percent and 27.1 percent respectively), while primary school
students love cartoons (36.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
China's educational TV mainly focuses on English, math, and
physics, according to CJRC's deputy director Sun Yunxiao, and
these programs are often pedestrian and not visually appealing,
with rigid presentation. They are simply a copy of classroom
teaching and lack creativity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese students are burdened with hard work and are certain to
want to change the channel when the programs are no different from
the classroom, Sun says. The quality of educational TV needs to be
improved and its presentation as well. TV programs, as a form of
entertainment, should help students in a more relaxed way observe
society and broaden their outlook while providing information.
</P>
<P>
Educational TV needs to make use of the advantages of modern
communications techniques, he says. Over 90 percent of the parents
polled said that they limit the amount of TV their children watch
because they worry about unsuitable programs affecting their study
habits or excessive watching ruining their eyesight. Many of them
however, while encouraging their children to watch educational TV,
are not satisfied with the programs.

PHNOM PENH, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference on
gender and development in Cambodia opened here Tuesday to help
improve the status of Cambodian women and to push for social,
economic and political changes.
</P>
<P>
The first such national conference was opened by Queen Norodom
Monineath Sihanouk at Le Royal Hotel. More than 200 women leaders,
government officials and NGO representatives attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is scheduled to review the achievements made by
Cambodian women since the Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing in 1995 and to put forward the action plan of the Royal
Government of Cambodia for the advancement of women in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also feature 10 panel discussions on such
topics as health, education, prostitution and human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
While significant progress has been made in drafting and
passing legislation to protect the rights of women, law
enforcement is weak. Discrimination and violence against women
remain a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Mu Sochua, minister of women and veterans' affairs, told
reporters that the ministry will focus the priority in the next
few years on the publicity and education among women, the
protection of women's rights and the enhancement of women's
training.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian women play an active role in the country's economy
and civil society, and constitute 53 percent of the active labor
force.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang Zemin's Speech in Melbourne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at the Australia-
China Trade and Investment Summit in Melbourne Tuesday.
The Honourable John Anderson, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia,
The Honourable Jefferey Kennett,Premier of the State of Victoria,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
First of all, I would like to thank the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade of Australia, the Government of the State of
Victoria and the Australia-China Business Council for their kind
invitation which has given me the opportunity to attend the
luncheon hosted by the Australia-China Trade and Investment Summit.
Over a long period of time, friends from the business communities
of our two countries have done a lot of effective work in
promoting Sino-Australian trade and economic cooperation and
enhancing the friendship between our two peoples. I would like to
take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks and best
wishes to you and, through you, to the business communities of our
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of Sino-Australian diplomatic relations,
our bilateral economic relations and trade have maintained a good
momentum of development, which has injected great vitality to the
development of Sino-Australian relations. Today, at the approach
of a new century, it is of great significance for people from the
business communities of out two countries to meet here in
Melbourne and discuss the cross-century development of our
bilateral economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Now, with your permission, I would like to brief you on the
reform, opening-up and modernisation drive in China.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up have been going on in China for more
than 20 years. During this period, China has enjoyed a sustained,
rapid and healthy economic development and an all-round social
progress. Its GDP grew at an average annual rate of 9.7% in the
period from 1979 to 1998. It is the seventh largest economy in the
world in terms of the economic aggregates. Its foreign trade and
economic cooperation have been expanding continuously. It has
established economic and trading ties with 220 countries and
regions and it is now the eleventh largest trading nation in the
world. The social productive forces in China, its aggregate
national strength and its people's living standards have all
improved by leaps and bounds. All undertakings have registered an
all-round development. We have withstood the test of the impact of
the Asian financial crisis, devoted much of our attention to the
tackling of the new problems that have cropped up in the course of
development and maintained the overall stability for economic
growth and social progress. China will enter the 21st century with
a thriving economy and vigorous modernisation endeavour.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, we are implementing a pro-active fiscal policy
and expanding domestic demand. We have worked to stabilize and
strengthen agriculture, step up the development of infrastructure,
deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, adjust economic
structure, expand urban and rural markets, increase export and
absorb foreign capital. Work in all areas is progressing orderly.
As a result, in the first half of this year, the economic growth
rate was kept at 7.6%. State-owned enterprises started to have
better economic returns, state revenue increased, the financial
sector was operating smoothly and the RMB exchange rate remained
stable. In the second half of this year, we will make better use
of such means of macro regulation and control as fiscal, monetary
and investment policies, so as to stimulate consumption,
investment and export. All the development objectives set for this
year will be attained.
</P>
<P>
The period from now to 2010 will be crucial for China's reform
and development. In this period, we expect to establish a
relatively full-fledged socialist market economic system and
maintain a sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy. To this end, we will stick to and improve the basic
economic system with the public ownership as the mainstay and
other economic sectors developing side by side. We will actively
introduce all those forms of business operation and organization
that reflect the law of the social production, including joint
stock system. We will continue to stabilize and accelerate the
agricultural development, unswervingly carry out the reform and
development of state-owned enterprises and gradually establish a
modern enterprise system. We will continue to make strategic
adjustments to the economic structure, accelerate the process of
optimising industrial structure, vigorously promote coordinated
development of regional economy, spare no efforts in developing
new- and high-tech industries, and develop an IT-based economy at
an accelerated pace. We will continue to implement the strategy of
sustainable development and that of rejuvenating the country
through science and education so as to continuously beef up the
sustainable economic and social development in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has a population of over 1.2 billion and a huge market.
With the steady progress in the economic and social development,
the enormous potentialities of the Chinese market will be further
tapped. The total import volume for the coming 7 years is expected
to reach US$1.5 trillion. In the first decade of the next century,
the Chinese economy is expected to maintain a relatively high
growth rate. The prospects for economic cooperation and trade
between China and the rest of the world will be even broader.
</P>
<P>
The past two decades or so have witnessed a rapid development
of the economic relations and trade between China and Australia.
Especially since the beginning of the 1990s, the development of
this relationship has picked up momentum. The economic cooperation
and two-way trade have expanded further in terms of the areas they
cover and the bilateral trade volume have kept growing for seven
years in a run. By the end of 1998, it rose to over US$5 billion.
Now China is Australia's fifth largest trading partner, seventh
largest export market and biggest purchaser of its wool. And
Australia is China's ninth largest trading partner, fourth largest
export market and the largest recipient of China's investment. By
the end of the first half of this year, there were 3687 Australia-
invested projects in China, with a contractual investment of over
U.S. $ 5.6 billion. China's investment in Australia has increased
year by year, and the number of Chinese enterprises and agencies
in Australia have amounted to 170 now. Our two countries have
conducted extensive cooperation in such fields as agriculture,
forestry, animal husbandry, energy, mineral resources,
transportation, textile, building materials and urban renovation,
and this cooperation has produced good results. Four Australian
banks have opened offices and branches in China and one has
established a joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai. The
Chinese Government has recently approved the application by two
Australian law firms to open offices in China, which is another
progress in the economic cooperation and trade between China and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Australian economic cooperation and trade have expanded
from bilateral to regional and multi-lateral fields. In the wake
of the Asian financial crisis, China and Australia held effective
consultations and cooperation with each other on how to dissolve
the crisis, stabilize regional economy and promote the reform of
the international financial system. Our two countries have since
maintained good coordination in APEC and international financial
institutions, and made efforts for economic development in the
Asia-Pacific and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
An important reason for the steady development of Sino-
Australian economic relations and trade lies in the strong
complementarity of our two economies. China has abundant human
resources and a vast market. It has also made major headway in
science and technology. We can provide Australia not only with
labor-intensive products but also with such technology-intensive
services as satellite launching. Australia has abundant natural
resources. The iron ore, aluminum, grain and wool that Australia
produces are in great demand in the Chinese market. Australia also
has fairly developed high technologies, so there are huge
potentials for cooperation between us in the scientific and
technological field.
</P>
<P>
For the next period, China will focus on the development of
such infrastructure and basic industries as water conservancy,
energy, transportation, telecom, raw materials, environmental
protection, high-tech industries and major equipment. Take
environmental protection as an example. The annual output value of
China's environmental protection industry is expected to grow by
15-20% on an average in the next decade and to reach over U.S.$35
billion by 2010. Melbourne and the state of Victoria, Australia,
have a competitive edge in terms of capital and technology in the
above-mentioned fields and there is a broad prospect for
cooperation between our two sides in these areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- In addition, China will step
up the development and opening-up of its western and central areas.
These regions are vast in area and rich in natural resources. They
have thus got great potentials for development. To accelerate the
development of the western and central areas is a major strategic
objective that is vital to the implementation of China's trans-
century development program. We hope that the business community
in Australia will make good use of your rich experience and
advanced technologies in the development of resources to
participate in China's development of its western and central
areas.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, I believe it is important for us to
strengthen cooperation in the following four areas.
</P>
<P>
1. To constantly explore new areas for trade while continuing
to develop trade in the traditional areas. For example, Australia
may take a more active part in the market competition in China in
such areas as energy and environmental protection while some
Chinese industries such as household electric appliances and
telecom also have opportunities for big development in the
Australian market.
</P>
<P>
2. China has identified the infrastructure and pillar
industries as its priorities for development and Australian
business community is welcome to invest in these areas.
</P>
<P>
3. China and Australia have their respective advantages in
science and technology and have accumulated rich experience. This
has afforded the two countries an opportunity to draw upon each
other's useful experience and make up for each other's
deficiencies to the benefit of their common progress.
</P>
<P>
4. China and Australia should increase consultation and
cooperation in APEC and international financial institutions and
make joint efforts for Ecotech and the reform of the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
To develop Sino-Australian economic relations and trade, a
sound and stable political relationship between our two countries
is required, and the growth of the former will in turn help
promote the development of the latter. A virtuous pattern of
interrelated and interactive political, economic and trade
relationship is in the common interests of our two peoples. It is
our hope that the far-sighted businessmen and entrepreneurs from
both sides will view and conduct our bilateral economic relations
and two-way trade on a long-term basis and make joint efforts for
continued progress of Sino-Australian friendly relations and
mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, I would like to wish the Australia-China Trade
and Investment Summit a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's industrial
production index (IPI) for July 1999 strengthened by 7.6 percent
against that in the same month last year, according to the
Statistics Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly induced by the growth in the indices of
the manufacturing and electricity sectors by 11.6 percent and 6.9
percent respectively, it said in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the overall IPI for the first seven months of 1999
rose by 2.9 percent over that recorded in the same period of 1998,
also mainly attributed to the growth of the manufacturing and
electricity sectors.
</P>
<P>
The IPI is the measure of the rate of change in the production
of industrial commodities in real terms and the commodities
comprise manufacturing, electricity and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, the index of the mining sector decreased by 7.9
percent in July this year from that in the same month last year
and by 3.8 percent for the first seven months this year from that
in the same period of 1998, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy to Grow 3 Percent in 2000: State Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy is expected
to grow around three percent next year with the help of a series
of economic stimulus measures, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) said
at a weekly meeting of economic ministers Monday that the
projected growth in 2000 would be a product of various stimulus
measures implemented by the government in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The state agency said that the baht would trade in the range of
36 to 37 against the greenback next year while inflation is likely
to increase slightly to three percent.
</P>
<P>
On the external accounts, Thailand would have a trade surplus
next year equal to 5.5 percent of GDP and a current account
surplus of 8.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government launched three stimulus packages in a
one-year period. In August last year, the government unveiled a
package to help banks recapitalize, in April this year a 3.5
billion dollars plan on extra fiscal spending and in August this
year a 3 billion dollars package aiming to boost investment in the
productive sector of industry.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Complete Internet-Based Life Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese volunteers
spent 72 hours connected only to the Internet in an experiment
that ended on Monday and found it is still a difficult thing to
use electronic currency for on-line payment in China.
</P>
<P>
The experiment brought together 12 people from the three cities
of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. One of the 12 was taken out of
the program half-way through because of a lack of on-line
experience. The other 11 lived in closely-monitored conditions
with only the Internet to communicate with the outside world and
used it to get their daily food, clothing, bedding, cosmetics, and
toiletries, as well as more frivolous items.
</P>
<P>
None of the volunteers was able to persuade people to accept
their electronic currency as payment and had to pay cash for
everything. One person tried five or six websites to pay with
electronic currency, but failed.
</P>
<P>
One analyst says that the test is a good way to check on China'
s networks and the IT industry.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was sponsored by a dozen media organizations.
More than 5,000 people applied via the net to take part and the
final people were chosen by psychologists. They were then given 1,
500 yuan in cash and 1,500 yuan in electronic currency for the
test.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Information Industry, Chinese
networks have been developing at a surprisingly rapid pace. In
1998, there were 2.1 million net users. That figure went to more
than four million by the first half of this year, so the Ministry
is eager to learn how the network will affect people's lives in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The three-day experiment got people's attention nationwide. One
elderly man in Shanghai said that he used to think of the computer
as something only for engineers and scientists and something that
had nothing to do with ordinary people, but he now finds it
closely linked to people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that people may entirely depend on it, some day,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Novotna to Retire from Tennis at the End of 1999 (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Wimbledon champion
Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, a standout in women's tennis
throughout the decade, Monday announced she is retiring at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who will turn 31 on October 2, made her announcement
Monday at the U.S. Open. Bothered by an ankle injury, Novotna was
seeded eighth at the U.S. Open but lost 6-3, 6-3 in the third
round to Anke Huber of Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to finish this year, fulfill my obligations for
this fall and then not to play any more next year," Novotna said.
"I think I have been thinking about the decision for a very long
time. I just felt that the timing for it is right."
</P>
<P>
Novotna's retirement announcement comes less than a month after
her long-time rival Steffi Graf of Germany announced her
retirement.
</P>
<P>
The sight of Novotna sobbing on the shoulder of the Dutchess of
Kent at the awards ceremony after blowing a third-set lead and
losing the 1993 Wimbledon final to Graf is one the most pognant in
tennis history.
</P>
<P>
She lost to Martina Hinigs in the 1997 final but defeated
Nathalie Tauziat at the All-England Club the following year for
her only Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who joined the WTA Tour in 1987 and has been ranked as
high as second in the world, won 23 singles titles and stamped
herself as one of the greatest doubles players in history with 73
titles, including 12 in Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
The fact that her retirement comes so close behind Graf's was
not lost on Novotna.
</P>
<P>
"It was an under 14 and I happened to play Steffi Graf in the
opening round. She's been there for a very long time. It is pretty
ironic and incredible that we are retiring at the same year
basically."
</P>
<P>
Novotna noted she and Graf were leaving a women's tennis tour
that is peaking in popularity with the emergence of a number of
talented young players.
</P>
<P>
"I just feel that the women's tour nowadays is strong than ever.
I think that the younger players and the new generation is ready
to take over. As we will see maybe next year, some of the older
players will retire. The new generation is ready to take the step
ahead and be at the top and just lead the way."

and the films have proved to be quite popular among Tibetans in
the province, according to Yang Jijia, the dubbing studio's
director.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's High-Tech Zones Producing Wealthy Ventures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China's high-tech development
zones have 68 ventures with annual incomes of more than a billion
yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) after 8 years of development.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan says that her
ministry is pushing for the adoption of a high-tech development
zone law and is encouraging several of them to become major high-
tech parks.
</P>
<P>
China's 52 industrial high-tech development zones have 9
corporate groups with annual incomes above 5 billion yuan, 7 of
which are solely Chinese, like Legend, Haier, Changhong Hisense,
and Beida Founders.
</P>
<P>
According the state development plan, the annual incomes of 52
state-level high-tech development zones is expected to reach 500
billion yuan by the end of 2000, or about a fifth of the country's
increased industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoying, who is in charge of high-tech development zones,
says that the rapid development has depended on high-tech
developments of Chinese scientists and improvements of foreign
technology. By the end of 1998, 76 percent of their products were
developed by Chinese scientists and they had over 16,000 ventures
making 480 billion yuan in all.
</P>
<P>
Per capita output value of the high-tech development zones was
240,000 yuan, much higher than the average of the country's
industrial ventures. About 80 percent of the zones focus on
electronics, information, bio-tech products, new materials, new
energy, energy saving devices, and environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Germany Provides Rice to Sri Lanka for Food Security Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany has agreed to provide
Sri Lanka 1,000 tons of rice towards a food security project in a
civil war-ravaged district, the German Embassy here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rice worth 26.4 million rupees (365,000 U.S. dollars) will
be donated to the Integrated Food Security Project (IFSP),
launched in the eastern Trincomalee district in August 1998, the
embassy said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Germany sends rice to Sri Lanka for
the IFSP. The German government arranged to supply 500 tons of
rice towards the project in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IFSP is implemented by the Ministry of Plan Implementation
through the District Planning Secretariat with the German Agency
for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) as co-partner.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the project is to redevelop and reconstruct
the lives of persons displaced until 1995 by the ethnic conflict
and were resettled by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
Sinhalese majority dominated government and the Tamil minority
rebels who demand a separate homeland in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The IFSP also seeks to diversify and intensify the nutrition
base and income opportunities of the conflict affected target
groups at food risk to improve their nutrition habits and health
care.

<HEADLINE> State of Emergency Declared in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency was
declared in East Timor on Tuesday morning, chief of the
Information Center of the Indonesian National Defense Forces (TNI)
Brig. Gen. Sudrajat said here.
</P>
<P>
He said the period of emergency started from 00:00 local time
Tuesday (17:00 GMT Monday) until the situation returns to normal.
</P>
<P>
The situation in East Timor has become tense since the
announcement of the direct ballot result on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Reports said dozens of people have been killed in the clashes
between pro-integration and pro-independence forces in the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian National Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi said here
Monday night the situation in Dili, capital of East Timor, was
grim.
</P>
<P>
"The region is not yet calm. It is still out of control. The
government there is not functioning," he said.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 direct ballot showed that 344,580 voters or 78.5
percent chose independence against 94,388 voters or 21.5 percent
preferring wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the United Nations General Assembly as a
non-self-governing territory.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Calls for Comprehensive African Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi
Monday called for a fully comprehensive African unity to bring
about freedom to the African continent.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the opening of a preparatory meeting of the
Council of Ministers held here, Ghaddafi expressed his belief that
"there should be unity" in the African continent in order to face
the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting will pave the way for the fourth
Extraordinary Session of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
to be held in the Libyan city of Sirte Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of African countries are eager to see Africa free and
united to realize development and liberation of their countries,
"an objective" as termed by the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is uniting before us," and there have been contacts and
discussions among African heads of state and government to lay out
the guidelines for "the United States of Africa," said Ghaddafi.
</P>
<P>
It will be possible for the OAU Charter to be amended with
unanimous approach and common determination, Ghaddafi added.
</P>
<P>
The Charter of the 53-member OAU has not been revised since it
was signed in Addis Ababa by 31 heads of state and government on
May 25, 1963.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Arab League Ahamed Meguid and
Secretary General of the OAU Salim Ahamed Salim and foreign
ministers and their representatives from 32 African countries
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, the heads of state and government of
the OAU will discuss ways and means to strengthen the 36-year-old
continental organization to make it more effective to keep pace
with the social, political and economic developments taking place
within the context of globalization.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Innwa Bank Opens One More Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Innwa Bank Ltd., a
financial institution of the semi-official Myanmar Economic
Corporation, has opened one more branch in Myitgyina, northern
Kachin state of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fifth branch of the bank was inaugurated Monday, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Innwa Bank earlier opened one branch each in Yangon,
Taunggyi, Mongshu and Mandalay townships, and is planning to set
up more branches in other townships.
</P>
<P>
Apart from providing local services, the bank also plans to act
as a corresponding bank of international banks with strong
financial power.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are 19 private banks
and three state-owned banks in Myanmar, providing domestic
commercial banking services.
</P>
<P>
The private banks in Myanmar hold about 45 percent of savings
deposits of the banking sector, while their loans account for
about 48 percent of the sector's loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, there are about 70 private bank branches throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar embarked on market-oriented economic policy in late
1988 and reformed its banking system in 1990, allowing private
banks to operate again after they were nationalized in 1963.

the incident will not affect the stability and safety of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
All the offices, enterprises, airports and railway stations in
the area of Osh are operating,it added.
</P>

<HEADLINE>   Indonesia's Sports Council to Intensify Drug Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Sports Council (
KONI) will intensify the dissemination of information on drug
testing rules, following an announcement that national pencak
silat martial art athlete Ni Made Wahyuni failed a drug test
recently.
</P>
<P>
Ni Made, who won a gold medal in the women's wiralaga in pencak
silat discipline in Brunei Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in August,
was later declared as testing positive and she now stands to lose
her medal.
</P>
<P>
Wahyuni denied the allegation that she used banned substances,
but admitted that she used a spray medication for asthma when she
experienced asthma-related breathing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
KONI deputy chairman Arie Sudewo said KONI will defend Wahyuni.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend her at the hearing. But, we are to bow to
whatever outcome they may conclude," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudewo stressed that athletes should recognize the banned
substances in the banned drug list issued by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) and the types of medications which
contained banned substances.
</P>
<P>
"We might know the substances which are banned by the IOC, but
here, the athletes also consume traditional herbal medicines,
which could also contain the substance listed in the illegal drug
list, "Sudewo was quoted by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sudewo also said many athletes and coaches were unwilling to
read the pocket-size booklet on illegal drugs, which were
distributed prior to the SEA Games.
</P>
<P>
"They accepted the booklet but do not read it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Yugoslavia Insist on Strict Observance of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Yugoslavia
insisted Monday that the U.N. Security Council resolution 1244
must be strictly observed and the state sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must
be respected.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic
after their meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press afterwards, Avdeyev noted that the
biggest problem at present is attempts to split Kosovo from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Certain peace-keeping operations in Kosovo by western nations,
he added, in fact work to split Yugoslavia, by violating the
resolution and other international principles.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Jovanovic noted that only on the basis of
respecting the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia, only through the comprehensive participation of the
United Nations and other international organizations, could the
relevant U.N. resolutions on Kosovo be fully carried out.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the task for U.N. in Kosovo now is to protect
residents of all ethnics, end terrorism, crimes, anarchism and
disarm the "Kosovo Liberation Army."
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev, who arrived here Sunday, is the first high-ranking
Russian official visiting Yugoslavia since NATO ended its bombing.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution 1244, adopted on June 10, the U.N. mission
entered Kosovo on June 15.

"It is a great challenge and will probably be the last classic
sporting record to be broken this century," he said on joining U.S.
skipper and adventurer Steve Fossett's crew for the bid by the
maxi-catamaran Playstation.
</P>
<P>
They will attempt the crossing in October from the United
States. The current record of 6 days 13 hours three minutes and 32
seconds was set by Frenchman Serge Madec in 1990.

Branson, who made his millions from records through his Virgin
trademark, made several attempts to take the balloon record but
earlier this year was pipped by Swiss Bertrand Piccard and Briton
Brian Jones.
</P>

Fossett and Branson, long rival balloonists, teamed up for
their last bid to break the round-the-world balloon record but
were forced by bad weather to ditch in the Pacific Ocean on
Christmas Day last year.
</P>
<P>
Whether his family will be pleased with the new project is
unclear. After being pulled out of the shark-infested Pacific
after a high-speed plunge, Branson conceded he may have used up
all of his nine lives.

<HEADLINE> Christie Drugs Clearance Sparks IAAF Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christie, the men's 100 meters champion at the 1992 Olympics,
has been freed from the suspension imposed on him when it was
revealed he had tested positive for nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
But while the 39-year-old sprinter was celebrating the verdict
of the three-man disciplinary committee, the IAAF, world governing
body of the sport, made it clear the case is far from closed.
</P>
<P>
Istvan Gyulai, IAAF general secretary, said: "It's written in
this UK Athletics press release that it has not been proven beyond
reasonable doubt that the substance present in the sample was
derived from the prohibited substance.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the IAAF says that if it is in your organs
and in your body it doesn't matter where it's coming from. It is
the athlete's duty to prove that it is there for natural reasons
and produced from the body.
</P>
<P>
"If it is coming from a prohibited substance or anybody who's
trying to manipulate something, it just doesn't make any
difference.That is the problem and this will probably be taken
into account by the IAAF doping commission.
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody who loves athletics hopes that it is, but it
is possible that it is not the end of the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christie, currently filming a new television series, was
delighted to hear the result of Friday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I was always confident of this outcome having maintained from
the outset that I had done nothing wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved that the disciplinary committee in their findings
has shown that they totally support me in this. I should like to
pass on my thanks to the public, my friends and colleagues who
have given me their full support during this distressing time. I'm
looking forward to getting on with my life and with the
broadcasting career I've enjoyed since retiring from athletics,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Becomes China's Leading Energy Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China has been transformed into the country's leading
energy base after a series of high profile projects were launched
in the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest, runs through the 60,
000-square-kilometer region, bringing the potential of three
million kw of water energy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the region is estimated to have probable coal
reserves of 200 billion tons, ranking fifth in China. The newly
opened Lingwu Coalfield alone has a proved coal reserve of 27
billion tons, equivalent to the total reserves of the three
provinces in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is also rich in oil and gas. The Shaanxi-Gasu-Ningxia
Gasfield is the country's largest of its kind with a gas reserve
of 40 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the rich energy resources there were unable to be
developed and utilized in old China. The region had only one power
plant 64 years ago. It was equipped with a 75-kw generator which
used to serve the needs of the Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911) and which was later carried to Ningxia on the back of a
camel. All the electricity the plant produced was supplied to a
tiny number of people at the upper levels in those days.
</P>
<P>
By 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded,
Ningxia could only produce 20,000 tons of coal and no more than
100,000 kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The central government invested heavily through the 1960s and
1970s in building three large mineral production zones, the
Qingtongxia Water Control Project and the Shizuishan Thermal Power
Plant in Ningxia, laying a solid foundation for a state-class
energy base there.
</P>
<P>
More infrastructure projects were built in this ethnic area
when China began to put its emphasis of economic development in
the central and western parts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ningxia churns out 17 million tons of coal a year,
850 times the figure of 50 years ago while its annual electricity
production averages 11.5 billion kwh, with the present daily
electricity production 314 times more than its annual output in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The region has now set up an industrial system which includes
metallurgical, chemical and coal sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Ningxia will also build a number of key projects including two
water control projects across the Yellow River and a thermal power
base at the turn of this century," said Xiang Zongxi, director of
the Regional Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese economists believe Ningxia will play a
bigger role in the national economic development upon full
operation of the newly built and expanded projects in the next
couple of years.

<HEADLINE> Kelly Acknowledges Shearer Jibe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shearer said after the Wembley game that he did not "need to
answer to anyone, least of all discredited people," when asked if
his goals had been the perfect riposte to his critics.
</P>
<P>
Kelly acknowledged the comment could have been a response to
his biography in which he exposed Shearer's alleged ultimatum to
quit the 1998 World Cup if he had been charged by the FA over a
kicking incident involving Leicester's Neil Lennon.
</P>
<P>
Former Newcastle star Malcolm Macdonald also hit out at Shearer
in a newspaper last week, claiming he was unfit to captain his
country.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said: "It is highly likely he was talking about me. He
said journalists and discredited people. I suppose it's me or
Malcolm Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
"I don't regard myself as discredited but if he regards the
fact that I resigned from the FA as bringing discredit upon myself
then that is his opinion. It doesn't cause me any unrest."
</P>
<P>
Kelly quit Lancaster Gate last year after a vote of no
confidence from the executive committee followed allegations of a
cash-for-votes deal reputedly struck by Kelly and FA chairman
Keith Wiseman with the Welsh FA.
</P>
<P>
Now Kelly's book "Sweet FA", which lifts the lid on a number of
controversial goings-on behind the doors of the FA's headquarters,
has been launched in the week England face their two crucial
qualifying games for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Kelly, speaking on Talk Radio, claimed he had no control
over the timing of the launch or the book's serialisation in a
national paper.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't appear to do Alan Shearer any harm and there are far
bigger things that are going to rock the boat if the boat is going
to be rocked," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate if in some respects it caused some upset
during an important time but it is outside my control," he added.

<HEADLINE> Anelka Threats to Quit Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anelka was substituted 10 minutes into the second half of his
country's Euro 2000 qualifier with the Ukraine over the weekend
which finished goalless.
</P>
<P>
"If I continue not enjoying myself out on the pitch, then maybe
it is time to stop playing football," said the 23 million pounds
striker.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better to do that. Perhaps too much is expected of
me.
</P>
<P>
"I am only 20 and I should be enjoying myself out there on the
pitch. But that is not happening, and I am very sad about that,"
he told the Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
Anelka, who had a torrid relationship with the English press,
claimed he will no longer speak to the Spanish media if they
continue to hound him.
</P>
<P>
His tempestuous nature caused bust-ups with his Highbury team-
mates, most notably Dutchman Marc Overmars, who he claimed never
passed him the ball. The Frenchman has already started on the
wrong foot at the Bernabeu.
</P>
<P>
He has still not scored for Real and to make matters worse the
"enfant terrible" has levelled the same criticism at Spanish
internationals Raul and Fernando Morientes.
</P>
<P>
"They know each other really well. They are not great players,
but players who always give each other the ball," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Anelka was honest enough to admit his performance in Kiev
was not up to scratch, and he has not netted for his country since
he struck twice against England at Wembley in February. "There are
no excuses, none," he said.

<HEADLINE> China, Neighbors Jointly Prevent Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- In recent years there have
been no reports of forest fires along the border between China and
two of its neighboring countries, Laos and Myanmar, according to
local officials in south China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July this year, the Sino-Lao border had had no
forest fires for seven years, and there had been none along the
Sino-Myanmar border for four years.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture,
which shares a 784-kilometer-long border line with the two
neighbors, attribute this to the joint efforts of the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past, forest fire control was quite loose in these
border areas, and there were dozens of fires every year, according
to the officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 and 1995, local governments in Yunnan reached
agreements with their counterparts in Laos and Myanmar,
respectively, on forest fire control.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the agreements, local governments in all
three countries have worked together to heighten fire-prevention
activities and create public awareness among the peoples of the
border areas.

<HEADLINE> Remote Part Of Northwest China Getting Closer To Modern World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Ma Qizhi told Xinhua recently that
the remote region is getting closer to the modern world after 50
years of efforts, since the new China was established in 1949.
</P>
<P>
When the American journalist Edgar Snow, the author of Red Star
Over China, visited China in 1936, it took him over 30 days to get
here from northern China, Ma says, but he could even get here from
the United States in just one day, now.
</P>
<P>
When the new China was established, there was not a single
railway line in Ningxia and roads were only used by horse carts
and people on foot, he recalls. Humans and horses were beasts of
burden. Ningxia now has several railway lines and expressways
being built to link Ningxia's cities with each other and with
northern China, and eight big bridges across the Yellow River, to
overcome geographical disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
It used to take much longer than a year for a Moslem to make
the pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia's holy city of Mecca. Hedong
Airport in the capital Yinchuan now handles jumbo jets and the
eight airlines here now make it possible to reach major Chinese
cities in less than half a day.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region was established in 1958. Since then the
Central Government has adopted preferential policies for it and
allocated large sums to assist construction work, Ma says. Annual
state subsidies amount to as much as a billion yuan, making a
great contribution to modernization.
</P>
<P>
Communications cables stretch for more than 1,000 kilometers to
all cities in the region and connecting up with more than 150
countries on the information highway. With the rapid development
of infrastructure, more enterprises in the region have opened
their doors to foreign markets and more foreign investors have
come to the region, Ma says.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia now has economic and trade relations with over 60
countries and regions and trade worth more than 300 million U.S.
dollars. Tourism is also developing, and 1.9 million people
visited the region in 1998, bringing in 480 million yuan in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
To cut the distance between this formerly remote part of China
and the rest of the world's economic development, Ningxia has
decided to spend more than 10 billion yuan annually on
infrastructure to provide a solid foundation for 21st century
development, Ma says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Loans to Help Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A loan system for financially
strapped college students has kicked off in eight cities with the
start of the autumn school term, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes an official from the Ministry of Education as
saying that a total of 700 million yuan (about 84 million U.S.
dollars) is set aside to help cash-poor students in 136
institutions of higher learning. The colleges and universities are
affiliated with 39 ministries and commissions under the State
Council or bureaus and corporations adjoining ministries.
</P>
<P>
The system will begin in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing,
Wuhan Shenyang, Xi'an and Nanjing, which have the greatest number
of institutions of higher learning. The program will enter more
areas within the next few years, with the goal of helping poor
students complete college careers.
</P>
<P>
The loan system will offer students a 50-percent discount on
interest repayment, with the state picking up the tab for the
remainder. They are required to repay loans with discount
interests within four years of graduation.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China have worked out regulations for implementing the
system.
</P>
<P>
In principle, each student can apply for loans once a year
during a college study career.
</P>
<P>
Students' loans may vary with tuition fees of different
universities and regions. Generally, a student can obtain a
maximum of 8,000 yuan (about 960 U.S. dollars) each year.
</P>
<P>
An average of 20 percent of college students in China have
financial problems, says the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that he and Indonesian
President Habibie agreed on the need for further urgent measures
to restore law and order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with the five members of a
Security Council mission which goes to Jakarta Monday night to
seek ways of halting violence in East Timor following the
announcement of the August 30 vote which favors its independence.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that such steps will have an immediate positive effect,
for it is essential that militia violence and intimidation be
brought under control," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The present chaos in East Timor cannot be allowed to fester
any longer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from reporters, the secretary-general said
the world community would have to consider other measures to
assist Indonesia in meeting its obligation to keep order in East
Timor if the violence continues.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for martial law there "is on the table," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "extremely concerned" over recent and current
developments in East Timor. He condemned "in the strongest
possible terms" the attack on a Red Cross compound in Dili,
capital of East Timor, Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also outraged that internally displaced persons
were being forced by militias into trucks and taken away against
their will.
</P>
<P>
Annan has been in phone contact several times with President
Habibie on the matter and discussed the situation over the phone
with leaders of the United States, Australia, Portugal and others
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission, initiated at a Security Council meeting
Sunday night, would "relay its (the council's) serious concern to
the government of Indonesia regarding current developments."
</P>
<P>
Led by the permanent representative of Namibia to the U.N., the
team is composed of the permanent representatives of Malaysia,
Slovenia and Britain as well as the deputy permanent
representative of the Netherlands to the U.N., it was announced

<HEADLINE> Romanian Shipowners Bar Danube Navigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Romanian shipowners and
river harbor operators Monday blocked navigation on the Danube
river for all vessels as a protest against the delay of restoring
traffic on the international river.
</P>
<P>
According to Mihai Razi, president of the Trade Union
Federation of Romanian Navigators, shipowners and harbor operators
will bar the Danube till September 8. They made the move also in
hope for getting financial support from the Romanian state to pay
wage arrears, as well as the suspension and/or rescheduling of
debts the commercial companies afflicted with the Kosovo war owe
to the budget, Mihai Razi added.
</P>
<P>
Unless the government gives no sign, by September 9, concerning
their claims, shipowners and river harbor operators will block the
Danube for an indefinite time-span, warned Mihai Razi.
</P>
<P>
According to the Association of Shipowners and river harbor
operators, almost 85 percent of the Romanian river commodities
freights are bound to Hungary, Austria and Germany and use the
Yugoslav Danube waters. The current navigation is completely
paralyzed, in this sector, in response to the deistruction of four
bridges out of which two in Novi Sad and one in Backa Palanka and
the fourth in Sombor, by the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
Romanian shipowners and river harbor operators score monthly
losses ranging between 100,000 and 600,000 U.S. dollars, besides
that they must cancel several contracts which brings penalties,
extra taxes and expenditure to the vessels and crews blocked in
several Danube harbors.
