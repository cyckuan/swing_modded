<P>
	MARTIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Robert Allen reads Homer's ``Iliad'' for  
fun before flipping on a rerun of ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' and 
tackling a stack of freshman English papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, he lived in a shack in rural West Tennessee  
and upholstered couches and chairs for a living. His front teeth 
were missing, and his clothes were tattered. Townsfolk assumed he 
was retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, at 50, he has a Ph.D. and teaches English literature at  
the University of Tennessee-Martin. He is a published author and an 
aspiring playwright. ``It has been an interesting journey,'' he 
muses. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Allen prefers an unassuming life, he is an unmistakable  
presence on campus, with unkempt red hair, lilting voice, affinity 
for bad puns and passion for classical literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Miller, who heads the English department, calls him a  
``free-spirited teacher who came from a background of cultural 
retardation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kind of a strange, weird guy, but I say that in a  
positive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raised by elderly relatives who kept him out of school, Allen  
had only books for playmates. He devoured most every volume at the 
library in nearby Huntingdon. 
</P>
<P>
	In his late 20s -- an age when most people are working and  
starting families -- Allen had never ridden a bike or gone to a 
movie. His only social interaction came at yard sales, where he 
rifled through boxes of still more books. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30, his upholstery business hit by recession, Allen took a  
high school equivalency test with aspirations of a steadier job. He 
scored so well that he decided to ``give education a fling.'' He 
aced the entrance exam at Bethel College in McKenzie, Tenn., and 
skipped freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced that his classmates were smarter, Allen was surprised  
when many dropped out with bad grades. He recalls launching a 
conversation on the theology of John Milton, author of ``Paradise 
Lost.'' ``Milton who?'' the other sophomore responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just assumed everyone else had read the book, too,'' Allen  
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Professors called Allen a genius. When he graduated summa cum  
laude, the faculty bought him his first suit and paid to replace 
his front teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen pursued graduate work at Vanderbilt. His first question  
upon arriving on the Nashville campus: ``Where's the library?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years after earning his doctorate, Allen is still reading  
-- magazines, comics, anything he can get his hands on. But mostly 
the classics. 
</P>
<P>
	A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in his cramped university office is  
lined with the works of Homer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Joyce, 
Yeats, Sophocles and other literary heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shadow of their titanic writings, Allen yanks at his  
suspenders and fields questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Your ambitions? ``At the moment, lunch.''  
</P>
<P>
	After that? ``Supper.''  
</P>
<P>
	Friends and colleagues typically mention this humor first. ``A  
very playful mind,'' says Neil Graves, a professor with an office 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen calls himself ``a bit of a wiseacre'' and is quick to turn  
into Groucho Marx, complete with imaginary cigar, to tell a 
favorite joke. Though he's told it hundreds of times, he still 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	That lightheartedness punctuates an evolving classroom  
personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen landed a job teaching freshman English at Bethel in 1989  
and quickly moved on to an adjunct position at Murray State 
University in Kentucky. He took his current post in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His first few semesters were unnerving. ``If I knew where my  
first students lived, I would write lengthy apologies to them 
all,'' he confides. 
</P>
<P>
	He's steadier, and entertaining, now. ``I'm still Robert Allen,  
the shy introvert who sits around and reads books all the time. But 
before I go into the classroom, I turn on the act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fascinated sophomore Cameshia Lofton. ``When he read a speech  
from a book we were studying, he made you feel like you were 
there,'' she says. ``I like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drawn to old things, Allen drives a '79 Oldsmobile, listens to  
Beethoven and Schubert, likes to collect classical albums and study 
genealogy. His fascination with family led to his first book of 
poetry, published in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simple Annals'' chronicles his family history, from  
Revolutionary War to modern times, passed orally from Allen's 
elderly relatives, particularly his blind Aunt Ida. 
</P>
<P>
	Invoking a West Tennessee dialect -- ``hippin'' for diaper,  
``haint'' for joint -- the book tells of heroes and tragedies, God 
and graveyards, hoop snakes and farm life. About half of the 3,000 
imprints have sold -- ``a pretty strong showing for poetry today,'' 
says agent George Schnitzer of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has no one to call family. His childhood home was empty,  
overgrown with weeds when he last visited 10 years ago. Relatives 
who raised him -- his grandfather, three great-aunts, a great-uncle 
-- have long since died. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, a waitress who ran off with a traveling shoe  
salesman when he was 6, is dead. He never knew his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen finally connected with a half-brother on his father's side  
and two half-sisters on his mother's side. But they have either 
died or moved with no forwarding address. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way it goes,'' Allen says.  
</P>
<P>
	But his autobiographical poem ``Purple'' exposes a longing. It  
describes the birth of a boy, ``helpless as a seedling and wailing 
purple,'' into his grandmother's knobbed hands: a ``stray/Mistake 
of a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Roulston, a colleague at Murray State, says Allen is  
anything but a mistake, though. She quotes one of his favorite 
poets, William Wordsworth, to describe her friend as a ``marble 
index of a mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought, 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes,'' she adds, ``I don't think Robert knows just how  
wonderful he is.''

<HEADLINE> Vermont Town Keeps Painting 'Home' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR, Vt. (AP) -- How the painting made its way to the lobby  
of a small-town bank is quite a tale. How it stayed there is even 
more remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting is called ``New Hampshire: Thy Templed Hills.'' It  
depicts a classic, woodland scene, with a sky of electric blue -- 
the trademark of Maxfield Parrish, the great painter and 
illustrator who died in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Parrish gave the painting to a bank's tellers, in  
gratitude for their help. Over the years, the bank would move 100 
yards north on Main Street; it would merge with larger banks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the electric-blue sky and shimmering hills remained.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, apparently, the bank suddenly realized that a valuable  
asset was hanging on its wall. Word got out that the painting would 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless ...  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The past still lives in Windsor. Main Street features the Old  
Constitution House, where the Vermont Constitution was ratified in 
1777. And the Old South Church, two centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's a row of stately homes, several of them once owned  
by branches of the Evarts family. Its most illustrious member, 
lawyer William Evarts, defended President Andrew Johnson during his 
impeachment trial and went on to serve as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	On Mill Brook, at the old Robbins and Lawrence Armory, mass  
production got its start in the mid-19th century with the 
manufacture of guns with interchangeable parts easy to replace on 
the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	But Windsor has lost a lot over the years.  
</P>
<P>
	The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. shoe sole plant, the town's  
biggest employer just downhill from Main Street on the banks of the 
Connecticut River, closed a decade ago. The other pillar of 
Windsor's mid-20th century economy, the Cone-Blanchard Machine Co., 
recently went through temporary shutdown, sale, downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor is feeling less self-contained, longtime residents say.  
``So many people work out of town and just come home to go to bed 
or watch their videos at night and leave for work in the morning,'' 
says Joyce Pierce, a lifelong resident. ``You lose that sense of 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor County National Bank once stood on Main Street. In 1967,  
Vermont National Bank, a statewide operation based in Brattleboro, 
took over. Intent on expanding, the bank hoped to demolish the 
Windsor House hotel next door. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the hotel became the state's crafts center, and the  
bank moved to a small, single-story building with a pitched roof 
and brick facade. When it moved, it took along the Parrish 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish had lived nearby, in Plainfield, N.H. He was part of the  
Cornish colony, artists and writers who, starting in the late 19th 
century, migrated from New York and elsewhere to New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many artists, Parrish crossed the covered bridge over the  
Connecticut River to do his banking and business in Windsor. There, 
his ``girls,'' as Parrish called them, helped balance his 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very, very nice man,'' recalls Pierce, once a Parrish  
girl, now a retired bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling was mutual. ``You girls kept my records straight.  
Here's a painting for you,'' he told them, one day in the early 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, Parrish's son, Maxfield Jr., would write of his  
dad's ``good will'' for those ``who over the years helped him so 
much with that side of life most artists have difficulty with, the 
handling of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Originally titled ``Summer in New Hampshire,'' the painting had  
been reproduced internationally. For nearly a half-century, it has 
been a fixture here, like the white clapboard of Old South Church. 
</P>
<P>
	For a view, just walk up to a teller's window and turn slightly  
to the right. Though it's not on Historic Windsor Inc.'s walking 
tour (``It's not a historic building,'' says one employee), many 
antiques dealers and art lovers willingly direct visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	So it came as something of a shock to the people of Windsor when  
they learned that Maxfield Parrish's gift was leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bank was merging again, this time with the Chittenden Bank,  
based in Burlington. Someone decided the painting should be sold; 
the Currier Gallery of Art in Manchester, N.H., wanted it for a 
national exhibit due at its doorstep later this year, and agreed to 
pay half its assessed value of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees learned of this by accident: A notice arrived by fax  
at closing time early last month. The Currier staff was due at 8 
a.m. the next day, an hour before opening, to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Word spread, and outrage, too. Offers of help poured in. ``I may  
be 75, but I can still picket,'' volunteered Moll Spencer of West 
Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were threats: ``I've had people who have hundreds of  
thousands in that bank call me up and say, 'If that painting comes 
down, my account does, too,'' reported Wes Hrydziusko, a former 
bank teller who once served as a state representative from Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour before the transfer, someone -- no one will say who --  
went to the police with copies of a letter that Parrish's son wrote 
in 1967, a year after his father's death. ``Dad intended this 
picture to stay where it is,'' he wrote, ``no matter whether 
Vermont National Bank and all its merged branches get absorbed by 
J.P. Morgan or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Vincent Jordan headed to the bank, armed with the  
question: Who owns Parrish? At first, bank officials hoped to build 
community support for the sale. Then, they backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will stay in Windsor and stay in the branch,'' pledged  
Robert Hain, the bank's vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was us who needed to be educated,'' conceded Robert Soucy,  
the bank's executive vice president. ``We really messed up. We 
should have done a much better job taking into account the feelings 
of the employees and the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired employees have set up a charitable trust to ensure that  
the painting remains in Windsor. No matter how many times the bank 
merges, they insist that ``New Hampshire: Thy Templed Hills'' will 
stay right here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't theirs to sell,'' says Pierce, still one of  
Parrish's girls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ark. Homecoming Said Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arkansas' Democratic faithful were finished  
paying tribute to retired Sen. Dale Bumpers. Dinner long had been 
eaten. The hugs and handshakes tapered off and the clock ticked 
ever closer to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, President Clinton, set to fly back to the White House  
after the festivities ended, lingered among his friends late 
Saturday night, joking that he hung out so long, ``we've doubled 
the price of rice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So long that the crowd had dwindled from several hundred to just  
nine, and the lights began going out in Little Rock's cavernous 
Statehouse Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ventured near the television cameras, getting more hugs  
that create the warm-fuzzy footage associated with the private 
moments of legendary people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello guys,'' Clinton called to the TV crews waiting to  
accompany him to Washington. ``Let's GO, Mr. President!'' came the 
reply from a lone voice in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bittersweet weekend return to his roots, full of rain  
and solitude, for a man whose visit was built around the dedication 
of his birth home in Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother and childhood pals were there, but his wife and  
daughter were not, and Clinton looked a little lonely. The visit 
was cut short by a day, and the nearly constant rain left Clinton's 
schedule loose and somewhat aimless. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather was sad, but otherwise it was OK,'' was Clinton's  
assessment of the trip, as he ambled back to Air Force One's rear 
galley for a beverage during the flight to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's daughter Chelsea, a sophomore at Stanford University,  
remained at school. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was in 
Washington, sidelined still, the president said, by the back injury 
that also led her to skip his Central American trip last week. She 
needs the rest so that she and Chelsea can tour North Africa later 
this month, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted to go to Central America, she wanted to go to  
this,'' Clinton said. ``I've got to make sure, she's got to make 
sure, she's a little bit healthier for Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After capping his Friday stop in Hope by paying a water-sogged  
visit to his mother's grave, Clinton went to Texarkana, Texas, to 
help raise money for Rep. Max Sandlin, a supporter during 
impeachment. He spent the night on the Wamba, Texas, cattle ranch 
of businessman Truman Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, it was too rainy and cold for him to play golf so  
Clinton lounged at Arnold's home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, Clinton flew to Little Rock, got off his plane  
in a gust of wind and a layer of rain on the tarmac -- ``Cold!'' he 
shouted -- and went directly to the home of his mother-in-law, 
Dorothy Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
	He watch his beloved Arkansas Razorbacks take on Iowa in the  
NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then attended a $200,000 Democratic National Committee  
reception before the Bumpers event, and mingled with folks who told 
him their confidence in him was never shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Bumpers dinner, Arkansas' politicos worked to make up for  
Clinton's lack of immediate family. Sen. David Pryor called Clinton 
before he left Arnold's ranch, and Clinton asked Pryor to fill him 
in on the crowd he would be addressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Mr. President, this is your family. These are your  
people, and these are the people who love you,''' Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A somber tone in his voice, Clinton said he understood that -- it  
was evident in the spirited defense summation that Bumpers 
delivered before the Senate at Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they have long known each other, Bumpers and Clinton were  
not considered extremely close. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first Senate primary in 1974, Bumpers defeated Clinton's  
mentor, Sen. William Fulbright. During his first presidential term, 
Clinton turned more often to Pryor for advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and Bumpers had been through ``all kinds of  
adversity'' together, and that he would miss being able to reach 
out across town to Bumpers ``when I get real low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, I may not be your best friend in the Senate,''  
Bumpers said Saturday night. ``But you're the best friend I've had 
in the Oval Office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, Clinton and Bumpers put their heads together in  
conversation as the lights dimmed for a video tribute. Suddenly, 
the president stopped talking and nodded in time with a song 
playing over a montage of images from Bumpers' long career: 
</P>
<P>
	``Count on me and I'll count on you ... Now and always we will  
be good friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the song ended, Clinton turned to Bumpers and resumed their  
chat.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Takes Leave From Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Dennis Rodman show with the Los  
Angeles Lakers has become a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was granted an indefinite leave of absence for  
unspecified personal reasons just as the team began a road trip of 
six games in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers confirmed Sunday that the eccentric rebounding  
champion missed practice the day before. He took his leave before 
the team's flight to Sacramento for Sunday night's game against the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to freak out about it,'' Lakers coach Kurt  
Rambis said after a brief talk with Rodman following Saturday's 
practice. ``It's just something we're going to have to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis said ``nothing got resolved'' in his conversation with  
Rodman. He declined further comment on possible reasons for 
Rodman's move. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's representatives did not immediately return calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Rambis does not know if Rodman will join the team on the road  
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' Rambis said. ``You're asking me hypothetical  
questions for which I have no answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis added: ``If he's there, great; if he's not, then I just  
have to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis took over as coach of the Lakers last month on the same  
day Rodman began playing with the team. Following the firing of 
coach Del Harris and the signing of Rodman, the Lakers ran off 10 
straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said Saturday that team executives  
Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak would not comment on Rodman's leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, accompanied by two bodyguards, arrived at the Lakers'  
training site Saturday as practice was ending. He spoke briefly 
with Rambis behind the gymnasium at Southwest College and then 
drove off in his white Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal knew Rodman had missed practice  
but did not know he was leaving the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You work as hard as him (in games), I don't give a damn what  
you do in practice. ... I think you guys (reporters) want it to be 
a problem more than we do,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played on two championship teams in Detroit and three  
more with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He has averaged 10.3 rebounds in nine games with the Lakers, but  
he sat out the second half of Friday's game against the Golden 
State Warriors because of a sore elbow. He also missed practice 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really seems to worry about where Dennis is or what  
he's going to do,'' guard Derek Fisher said. ``We all knew what he 
was like before he signed. ... If he can afford to continue to pay 
the fines for missing or whatever, then that's his choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, delayed signing with the Lakers  
last month. He was upset at his relatively low salary under the 
NBA's new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were unable to sign him for more than the veterans'  
minimum of $1 million, prorated to $600,000 for the shortened 
season and further reduced to $500,000 because of the 12 games the 
team had already played. 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the terms of Rodman's contract with Converse is that  
he receives $3 million if he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's exceptional basketball skills have been accompanied by  
years of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are his electric hair colors, multiple tattoos and body  
piercings as well as his cross-dressing inclinations. He also has 
been suspended while playing for Chicago for head-butting a referee 
and kicking a courtside photographer. He's infuriated coaches and 
teammates with missed practices and other antics. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the court, Rodman married actress Carmen Electra last  
November and split with agent Dwight Manley.

<HEADLINE> La. Church Empty After Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- The little white church where three people  
died in a hail of bullets last week was empty Sunday, while 200 of 
its members shook off the winter chill and bad memories in a civic 
center miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Clarence Stephens likened the sudden violence that  
interrupted the New St. John Fellowship's Bible study on Wednesday 
to a storm sent by God as a test. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pre-warned storm shows how well you can prepare,'' Stephens  
shouted Sunday. ``But an unexpected storm -- follow me now -- an 
unexpected storm will show your true strengths and weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shon Miller, who is in his 20s, is accused of bursting into the  
church and opening fire, killing his wife, Carla Vessel Miller, 24, 
and son, Shon Jr., 2. He is charged with first-degree murder and 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-year-old church member, Vaniaro Jackson, also was killed in  
the gunfire and police later found Carla Miller's mother, Mildred 
Vessel, 53, shot in her car near the church. Miller is accused of 
ambushing his mother-in-law before heading into the church. Four 
people were wounded in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders decided last week they will hold no more services  
at the church. They are raising money to complete electrical work 
and other interior details on a new building nearby, but that could 
take months. In the meantime, decisions on where to worship will be 
made week to week. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of the four people wounded was present for Sunday's  
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Rideau, 16, hobbled along on crutches.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize I was shot at first,'' he said. Then, he  
said, he began sweating profusely and feeling dizzy. And ``my mama 
noticed there was a hole in my pants.''

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The FBI is investigating whether former  
federal transportation inspector general Mary Schiavo violated any 
laws when she checked a suspicious bag at an airport here to test 
security measures, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo, a former inspector general of the Department of  
Transportation, checked a bag Friday at Port Columbus International 
Airport as part of a story WCMH-TV was doing on airport security. 
</P>
<P>
	The station showed the contents of her bag, which included what  
appeared to be a tape recorder, an alarm clock and wiring. Ms. 
Schiavo said the bag contained several items, including a cellular 
phone wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials said a suspicious bag had been spotted and was  
not placed on the flight, but it declined to say whether the bag 
belonged to Ms. Schiavo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently we're investigating to determine if any law was  
violated,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Takemoto, FAA spokesman, said that the Federal Aviation  
Administration was looking into whether its regulations were 
violated in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	The bag's discovery led to a shutdown of a runway for four hours  
Friday, but no flights were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo said Sunday that she bought a ticket to Washington,  
D.C., and checked her bag with America West Airlines, but did not 
board the flight. She said she was hoping to determine whether the 
bag would be allowed to take off with the flight even though its 
owner was not on board. 
</P>
<P>
	As a security measure on international flights, bags are matched  
to passengers. Such checks are not required for domestic 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that is indeed what happened, then I'm glad. That's an  
improvement,'' Ms. Schiavo said when told the bag was held from the 
flight. ``I'm very sorry that people were inconvenienced, but I did 
not cause that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the FAA on several occasions. Since then she has 
published a book accusing the FAA of sloppy inspections, lax 
airport security and disregard for bogus airplane parts.

	Report: Baptist Leader To Resign  
</P>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, convicted of  
swindling $4 million as head of the National Baptist Convention, 
U.S.A., is sorry for bringing shame to the church and indicated he 
will resign, according to ABC's ``20/20 Monday.'' Lyons said that 
he will step down even if the church group's board of trustees does 
not ask him to resign. ``I think it's best,'' Lyons told Connie 
Chung in an interview scheduled to air Monday. Lyons was convicted 
last month of racketeering for swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the convention.

	Fleet Deal To Create 8th Largest Bank  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group Inc. is planning to  
acquire BankBoston Corp. for $16 million in stock, but the move may 
force the loss of 5,000 jobs. The deal will give Fleet a stronger 
investment banking arm while giving BankBoston the muscle it needs 
to compete against bigger financial institutions. The combined bank 
will be named Fleet Boston Corp., and it will be the dominant 
lender in New England. But overlapping branches and administrative 
operations will force the loss of jobs.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are insisting on answers following  
the Clinton administration's admitting today that China gained 
valuable information about nuclear technology allegedly stolen from 
a Los Alamos lab. Senior GOP senator, Dick Lugar of Indiana, 
recommended a ``very serious review'' of the country's China 
policy. Lugar also said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that the United 
States should make clear to China that it will defend Taiwan from a 
Chinese missile attack.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of adult prisoners in the United

surpass Russia as the country with the highest rate of 
incarceration. The Justice Department said today that at mid-1998, 
jails and prisons held an estimated 1.8 million people, according 
to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. At the end of 1985, the 
figure was 744,208.

the Hornets 94-86. Before the game Van Gundy tried to make light of 
the report, but also admitted that he had spoken to Knicks brass 
after it aired. ``Let's face it, until they fire you, they're never

<HEADLINE> US Women's Team Ties Sweden 1-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Tiffeny Milbrett's goal 15 minutes into  
the game was all the favored United States could manage Sunday in a 
1-1 tie with Sweden in the opening round of the Algarve Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The international women's soccer tournament, a tuneup for this  
year's World Cup in the United States, features six nations that 
will participate in the World Cup, starting June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had defeated Sweden nine consecutive times dating  
back to November 1991. And they got off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Foudy, who played a slick and creative match in midfield,  
sent a perfect pass to Mia Hamm on the right side. Hamm drove to 
the net and sent a hard cross on the ground through the goalmouth. 
Shannon MacMillan caught a small piece of the ball, but Milbrett 
sliced her shot into the left corner from 8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was Milbrett's first of 1999 and 48th of her career.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team paid for its inability to finish in the 76th  
minute when Sweden tied it. Malin Mostrom got loose on the right 
wing on a counterattack and crossed to the far post, where 
substitute Linda Fagerstrom volleyed the ball in from 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite more than doubling Sweden's shot total, 19-8, the U.S.  
team could not punch in another goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a lot of things well and we were unfortunate to give up  
that goal on what was really just one of two chances they got in 
the second half,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. ``But we didn't finish 
our chances and I'm disappointed at that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Ulrika Karlsson once again made several world-class saves  
and I think she was responsible for the result that they were able 
to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. veteran Michelle Akers came on at halftime, marking her  
first action since she broke her left cheekbone against the FIFA 
World Stars last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, China beat Portugal 4-0, Denmark and  
Australia tied 1-1, and defending world champion Norway downed 
Finland 1-0.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Group, BankBoston To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group Inc. announced plans  
Sunday to acquire BankBoston Corp for $16 billion in stock, the 
latest in the wave of consolidations in the global banking 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which will create the nation's eight-largest bank,  
will give Fleet a stronger investment banking arm while giving 
BankBoston the muscle it needs to compete against bigger financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank, to be named Fleet Boston, will initially be  
headed by Fleet chief executive officer Terrence Murray. After two 
years, Murray, 59, will step down as chief executive but stay on as 
chairman, succeeded as CEO by current BankBoston chief executive 
Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford, 56. The following year, Gifford will 
also take over as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the latest in a number of combinations between  
global banks that have occurred over the past year. Recent deals 
include the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. to 
form Citigroup, the country's largest bank, and the purchase of 
NationsBank Corp. by BankAmerica Corp. to form the country's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	A combined Fleet-BankBoston, with assets of about $180 billion,  
would surpass eighth-largest Bankers Trust Corp, which itself is in 
the process of being acquired by German bank Deutsche Bank AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Any kind of deal would likely require each bank to make  
significant divestitures to comply with antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet has about $104 billion in assets and non-banking  
businesses that include credit cards, discount and on-line stock 
brokerages, asset management and market-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston has $74 billion in assets and recently expanded its  
investment banking division, purchasing San Francisco-based 
Robertson Stephens last year for $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston stock prices have suffered over the past several  
months because of uncertainty over earnings in Latin America, where 
it obtains one-fifth of its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, BankBoston shareholders will  
receive 1.1844 shares of Fleet for each BankBoston share they own. 
The transaction values BankBoston shares at $53.00, a 13 percent 
premium over Friday's closing stock price of $46.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Fleet closed Friday at $44.75, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Baseball Players in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Three Gonzaga baseball players and a  
trainer were injured when a car plowed into the group as they 
walked to their game at Fresno State, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Jill Peterson, 40, a Gonzaga trainer, sustained a broken  
right leg in the Saturday accident, officer Julian Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga outfielder Brent Church was in serious but stable  
condition Saturday night, hospital officials said. Infielder Kevin 
Cave and outfielder Richard Urdahl were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The team canceled its Saturday game against Seton Hall and a  
Sunday game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were walking from their hotel to Beiden Field for  
the game, school officials said. A motorist stopped to let the 
players cross a driveway, but a driver behind lost control, jumped 
the curb and plowed into the team, Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver was identified as Adam Charles Perry, 18. He was not  
injured and was not cited, police said.

<HEADLINE> Report: N.J. Gov. To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman has decided to run  
for U.S. Senate in 2000, according to a newspaper report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unnamed Republican sources, The Trentonian reported that  
Whitman will seek the GOP's nomination for the seat being vacated 
by retiring Democrat Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough denied that the governor has  
made definite plans. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said Whitman's decision will depend on how quickly she  
can reach the three main objectives of her second term: a 
billion-dollar property tax rebate program, a million acres of 
open-space preservation and whole-school reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question now is whether or not she could get these  
accomplished before she would have to depart for Washington should 
she run'' for Senate, McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said Whitman will announce her intentions within a few  
weeks after her trip to South America, where she is heading a 
10-day New Jersey trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg unexpectedly announced his retirement last month.  
Republican leaders in New Jersey and nationwide have urged Whitman 
to run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision may set up a rematch with former Gov. Jim  
Florio, a Democrat whom Whitman unseated in 1993. Florio is 
expected to seek the Democratic nomination to succeed Lautenberg.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Protests His Innocence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Samoan International Olympic  
Committee member Paul Wallwork, who has been recommended for 
expulsion, arrived in Auckland on Sunday protesting his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork flew to Auckland from Apia on his way to Lausanne,  
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board has recommended expulsion for his part  
in the Salt Lake City corruption scandal. The full membership will 
vote on it this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago, Wallwork's wife was reported to have taken a  
$30,000 loan from the chief executive of the Salt Lake City bidding 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wallwork said Sunday he did not know about the loan, as he  
and his wife were separated at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not involved in it, did not know anything about it. So  
how can you implicate somebody who knew nothing about it?'' 
Wallwork told One television network Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's been a total injustice committed by certain  
people of the IOC. I just feel very, very bad about it. I feel 
badly treated by the powers that be in the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have already resigned or been expelled in the  
worst corruption scandal in the Olympics' 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has recommended that eight members be severely  
reprimanded, including Australia's Phil Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing himself with Coles, Wallwork said: ``Of course, he  
comes from a major country with a city organizing the Olympic Games 
for next year. How can you possibly remove a person like that? 
</P>
<P>
	``To clear some people and penalize others, I find that  
inexplicable in my view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Auckland-educated Wallwork works at the Ministry of Sport in  
Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators have recommended severe censure for Coles and  
the highest-ranking member implicated in the corruption scandal, 
South Korea's Kim Un-yong, both of whom narrowly escaped a 
recommendation that they be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were told they would be kicked out of the IOC if ``similar  
facts ever occur again.''

<HEADLINE> Kjus Wins World Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- The friendship between Lasse Kjus  
and Kjetil Andre Aamodt couldn't be closer. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup roommates for 10 years, they're both 28 and, along  
with retired Marc Girardelli, they've each won a record 13 Olympic 
and World Championship medals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the World Cup year ended Sunday, they were together again,  
separated by only 23 points in the overall standings -- one of the 
tightest men's finishes on record -- with Kjus claiming the coveted 
season title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today there will be a great party, and I'll drink everyone  
under the table,'' Kjus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is congratulate Lasse,'' Aamodt said.  
``He has been the best skier all season. For what he did here and 
what he did in the Worlds (last month), I can only take my hat off 
to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who underwent sinus surgery two years ago and has coughed  
and wheezed all winter with a chest infection, sped to a quick 
second leg in Sunday's giant slalom to grab seventh -- after being 
15th after the first -- to clock a combined 2 minutes, 5.48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing a second place to earn enough points to overtake Kjus,  
Aamodt got only fifth in 2:05.13. Kjus finished with 1,465 points 
and Aamodt 1,442 in a season that spans three-dozen men's races 
over 4 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus won six World Cup races -- five in downhill and a combined.  
Aamodt won only a combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Vail, Colo., Kjus became the first man to win five  
medals in a World Championships, including gold in super-G (shared 
with Hermann Maier) and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unbelievable to get this title,'' said Kjus, who won the  
same one in '96. ``It was great fun to have this close fight with 
Kjetil. I felt a lot of pressure in the second run because I had 
made so many mistakes on the first. But I risked it all because I 
had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt said he stopped rooming with Kjus on the World Cup  
circuit last year ``because we got like an old married couple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd said about all two people could to each other in that  
time,'' said Aamodt, who won the 1994 World Cup overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kjus-Aamodt 1-2 was the closest men's overall finish since  
1991 when Girardelli nipped Alberto Tomba by 20 points. But that 
was under a scoring system that awarded many fewer points -- as was 
the 1980 title when four points separated the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system begun in the 1991-92 season, the closest men's  
finish prior to Sunday's near-dead heat was in 1993 when Girardelli 
edged Aamodt by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to deciding the overall, the season giant slalom  
title was also settled Sunday with Michael Von Gruenigen of 
Switzerland winning the race and season title. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen won in 2:04.33, followed by fellow countryman  
Steve Locher in 2:04.40 and Heinz Schilchegger of Austria in third 
in 2:04.44. Von Gruenigen finished with 483 points to 410 for 
Austrian Stephan Eberharter and 371 for defending champion Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who said he aggravated a back injury in Saturday's slalom  
and needed painkiller injections to ski Sunday, went out five gates 
from the finish on the first leg, losing his right ski -- and temper 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	He stormed by reporters and spoke only briefly to Austrian  
television. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending overall World Cup and giant slalom champion, Maier  
was eliminated from the chase in Saturday's slalom, finishing 
behind Kjus and Aamodt with 1,307 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed about the situation and just didn't feel  
very coordinated,'' said the two-time Olympic champion. ``When I 
went out, I didn't even realize what had happened. My back was even 
worse today than it was yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus' title Sunday ended a World Cup season dominated by  
Austrian women. They won all five titles -- a feat last accomplished 
in 1987 by the Swiss women. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer took the overall, downhill and super-G  
with Renate Goetschl taking downhill and Sabine Egger the crystal 
globe in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer clinched super-G and Egger her slalom when the two  
races were canceled last week by high winds and snowstorms in 
Europe's southernmost ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's side, the Austrians -- after sweeping all five last  
season -- got a super-G title from Maier and a slalom title from 
Thomas Stangassinger, at 33 the oldest skier on the circuit. Kjus 
won both overall and downhill with Von Gruenigen taking giant 
slalom.

<HEADLINE> Missionaries Accused in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Missionaries or mercenaries?  
</P>
<P>
	An Indianapolis-based group wrestled with those contradictory  
public perceptions of itself Sunday after the arrest of three of 
its members in Zimbabwe with a cache of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvestfield Ministries stands accused by prosecutors in  
Zimbabwe of sending mercenaries to fight or deal arms in the 
Congolese civil war, but its leader said it did nothing more than 
deliver Bibles, medicine, clothing and seeds -- plus shoot off some 
guns for fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Wallace said members of his tiny group had pulled up  
stakes from their mission in Lubumbashi, Congo, because fighting 
around them had grown too fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We preached, we drilled water wells, and did lots of other  
missionary work there ... We now have hundreds of Christians and 
preachers there,'' Wallace said 
</P>
<P>
	He said the three men, including his son-in-law, arrested in  
neighboring Zimbabwe had traveled to the Congo two weeks ago to pay 
bills, settle accounts and pack up belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	As the three boarded a flight for Switzerland on March 7, a gun  
activated an airport metal detector in Harare, Zimbabwe. A 
subsequent search of their GMC pickup truck at the airport turned 
up assault and sniper rifles, shotguns, a light machine gun, hand 
guns, firearms, telescopic sights, knives, camouflage cream, 
two-way radios and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all loved to hunt,'' Wallace, 43, explained during an  
interview at his home in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He readily acknowledged members of his group had shipped guns  
when they moved there from Canby, Ore., and built their mission in 
late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	They carried weapons for protection, but never fired them in the  
Congo, he said. ``We shot at gun ranges in Zimbabwe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's son-in-law, Joseph Wendell Pettijohn, 35, and two  
other members of Harvestfield Ministries are being held without 
bail in Zimbabwe on charges of espionage, terrorism and sabotage. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Nursing a Sore Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A day after his 1999 debut, Kerry Wood woke  
up with a sore elbow Sunday and headed back to Chicago for an 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, a key to the Cubs' pennant hopes,  
threw 26 pitches Saturday against Anaheim, just 10 for strikes. 
During one stretch in the second of his two innings, he threw 10 
consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, with catcher Tyler 
Houston leaping up to catch some. He didn't strike out anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was after the first inning,'' Wood said Sunday. ``My first  
warmup pitch, Tyler hardly got a glove on it. I felt it a little 
bit but kept going. The velocity was still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who didn't mention any pain when he spoke with reporters  
after the game, was to be examined later Sunday by Anaheim team 
physician Dr. Lewis Yocum, then have an MRI Monday and get looked 
over by Cubs physician Dr. Micheal Shafer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago hopes the pain resulted from scar tissue and that the  
exam will show no ligament damage. Wood missed all of September 
last year because of a sore elbow, then returned for the Cubs' 
final game of the season, a loss to Atlanta in Game 3 of the NL 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just being conservative,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said Wood threw about 96 mph  
Saturday. It was Lynch who made the announcement, saying Wood 
``felt significant discomfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago knows that elbow pain probably will always be an issue  
with Wood, as it is with most power pitchers. Cubs pitching coach 
Marty DeMerritt has been working to alter Wood's delivery this 
spring, trying to lessen the strain on the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of pitches, he got across himself a little bit,''  
DeMerritt said. ``Last year, he was throwing across his body all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, a 21-year-old right-hander, was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and  
233 strikeouts in 166 2-3 innings last year. On May 6, in just his 
fifth career start, he struck out 20 against Houston, tying Roger 
Clemens' record for a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago didn't make any big additions during the offseason. If  
Wood is sidelined for any lengthy period, it will damage the Cubs' 
chances to win a pennant for the first time since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood already was getting a late start following two  
hospitalizations this spring to treat an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it is, it has got to be taken care of,'' DeMerritt  
said. ``The sooner the better.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Smoking, Adult Crime Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies whose mothers smoke during pregnancy could  
be at a higher risk of growing up to be criminals, new research 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say a study published in this month's Archives of  
General Psychiatry is the first to examine the relationship between 
mothers who smoke and their children's adult behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers -- from Emory University in Atlanta, the  
University of Southern California and the Institute of Preventive 
Medicine in Denmark -- found that more a quarter of the men whose 
mothers had the highest levels of smoking and delivery 
complications were arrested for a violent crime as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results support our hypothesis that maternal smoking  
during pregnancy is related to increased rates of crime in adult 
offspring,'' the authors wrote, adding that the results ``suggest 
an additional critical reason to support public health efforts 
aimed at improving maternal health behaviors during pregnancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, David Fergusson, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the  
Christchurch School of Medicine in New Zealand, said there is not 
enough research to add prenatal smoking to the list of established 
risk factor for adult crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fergusson, who wrote an editorial accompanying the article, said  
the study did not rule out the possibility that genetics -- not 
smoking -- caused behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mothers who smoke during pregnancy are often young women who  
have previous misconduct problems and there is quite an 
inheritability of misconduct problems,'' Fergusson said in a 
telephone interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Patricia Brennan, the study's lead author and  
a researcher at Emory's Department of Psychology, did not return a 
page Sunday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers based their findings on data for 4,169 males  
born in Copenhagen between September 1959 and December 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cigarettes their mothers had smoked during the  
third trimester of pregnancy affected the men's arrests for 
nonviolent and violent crimes as adults, even after factoring out 
other possible causes such as alcohol use, divorce, income and home 
environment, researchers said in the study, which was released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other risk factor -- delivery complications -- was found  
to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
	While stopping short of saying that babies whose mothers smoked  
while pregnant will become criminals, researchers say their 
findings are significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study should be aimed at determining the effects of  
smoking on the brain of developing fetuses and to see if specific 
agents in tobacco smoke can be more directly linked to antisocial 
behavior, they said.

<HEADLINE> Credit Lyonnais Privatization OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French government has authorized the  
privatization of the ailing Credit Lyonnais bank, the French 
Finance Ministry said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais lost $3.7 billion between 1992 and 1994 and a  
state bailout package approved earlier this year cost French 
taxpayers nearly $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected announcement comes at a time of great turmoil in  
the French banking sector. Last week the Banque Nationale de Paris 
made a surprise $37.2 billion takeover bid for rivals Paribas SA 
and Societe Generale SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the privatization plan, the French government  
would maintain a 10 percent stake in Credit Lyonnais. Ten percent 
of the bank's shares already have been floated. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree calls for the creation of a core shareholder of  
institutional investors, who will be allowed to hold less than one 
third of the bank's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	After consultations with unions and employers, a ``significant  
share of capital'' of Credit Lyonnais will be made available to 
them. A subsequent stock offering will take place in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A limited number of potential partners for Credit Lyonnais are  
available, given the ongoing battle among Banque Nationale de 
Paris, Societe Generale and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Credit Agricole said Friday it will seek to participate in  
the privatization of Credit Lyonnais. French insurance company AXA 
and the German insurance company Allianz -- via its French 
subsidiary AGF -- also have expressed interest.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Nuke Plant Key for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Anybody want to buy a nuclear reactor?  
Surprisingly, some people do, at a bargain price, undeterred even 
by a neighbor with a troubled history. 
</P>
<P>
	An eager buyer is snapping up Three Mile Island's healthy  
reactor, in the first sale in U.S. history of a nuclear power plant 
in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor, still churning out electricity, sits next to the  
shell of its twin, TMI's No. 2 reactor, the site of the country's 
worst nuclear power accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks a dramatic shift in the industry as it faces its  
biggest challenge since that accident 20 years ago this month: how 
to survive with high-priced nuclear reactors against coal and 
modern natural gas plants in the competitive electricity market. 
</P>
<P>
	GPU Inc. of Morristown, N.J., is selling the plant to AmerGen, a  
partnership of Philadelphia-based PECO Energy Co. and British 
Energy. Analysts are watching this deal, as well as others to 
follow, to see if they are profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Entergy Corp., based in New Orleans, is expected soon to  
complete the purchase of the Pilgrim plant in Plymouth, Mass., from 
Boston Edison. Like GPU, Boston Edison is getting out of the 
electricity generation business, and Entergy is pushing to become 
``a national nuclear company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bottom-line dollars and cents realism'' determines the  
viability of a nuclear plant, says Roger Gale, an analyst at the 
Washington International Energy Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The consulting firm predicts 37 to 40 reactors of the 103 now  
operating in the country will not survive in the new electricity 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts cite several factors that help plants to  
compete: shedding huge indebtedness stemming from their high 
construction costs; a reputation for good management; and avoiding 
trouble with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of utilities, most with just a single nuclear plant, are  
looking to sell while others are leaving the electricity generation 
business to concentrate on power distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to buy are industry executives convinced they can get a  
bargain and make money by operating reactors for the next few 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general you're able to buy nuclear for next to nothing ...  
and that could bring a renaissance'' to the industry, says Robert 
Rubin, an analyst for Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Corbin McNeill Jr., chairman of PECO Energy Co.: ``There  
will be a continued consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says some uneconomical plants will shut down while others  
that are attractive will make money -- at the right price. McNeill 
predicts fewer than 10 of the current 43 nuclear operators will 
remain in five or so years. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as Amergen, Entergy, and Duke Energy in  
Charlotte, N.C., think that by consolidating and becoming 
``national nuclear companies'' they can operate many of these 
plants profitably and safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Because reactor fuel is about a third cheaper than fossil fuels,  
nuclear plants compete in producing electricity, the industry 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 it cost 2 cents a kilowatt hour to produce electricity  
from some of the most efficient nuclear reactors. That is a bit 
more than from coal but below the overall average of 2.13 cents 
from all fossil fuel plants. The average cost for all nuclear 
plants was 2.48 cents, according to the federal Energy Information 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	AmerGen, the PECO joint venture, will get the TMI reactor for  
less than 20 cents on the dollar: $23 million plus another $77 
million for the fuel already contracted. The seller will put up the 
money to pay for the eventual shutdown of the reactor, whose value 
on GPU's books is $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a phenomenal deal,'' analyst Rubin said. Not counting the  
fuel purchase, the TMI reactor is selling for about $30 per 
kilowatt of generation. By comparison, GPU recently sold its fossil 
fuel generation plants at 2.5 times their book value at $510 per 
kilowatt. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the TMI reactor, industry analysts say AmerGen  
had pursued -- and then rejected -- purchase of the Maine Yankee 
reactor in Wiscasset, Maine; recently indicated an interest in the 
Vermont Yankee reactor in Vernon, Vt.; and may have interest in 
GPU's other reactor at Oyster Creek in Lacey Township, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	GPU's chairman, Fred Hafer, believes the TMI sale helps his  
company, which foresees its future as electricity distributor, not 
power plant owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, too, provides relief for GPU by freeing the company  
from ``the overhanging liability'' and uncertainties of nuclear 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the nuclear industry you can't be successful with being  
just a dabbler in the business,'' Hafer said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other utilities executives agree.

<HEADLINE> Ford Fined in Recall Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has agreed to pay a civil fine  
of $425,000 in a settlement with the federal government for failing 
to recall vehicles promptly and withholding information during a 
safety agency's investigations into fires in Ford cars and light 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials said  
Ford was too slow in recalling and fixing 8.6 million vehicles in 
1996. The safety agency also said Ford failed to provide complete 
and accurate information in four investigations into fires in Ford 
vehicles between 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement did not require Ford to acknowledge any  
wrongdoing. Company officials deny the automaker violated the law 
or that the recalled vehicles were unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 recall of cars and light trucks from model years  
1988-93 was the largest recall by a single automaker in U.S. 
history. There had been more than 1,100 reports of fires from 
faulty ignition switches and in some cases fires occurred even when 
the vehicles were parked and shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached late last week and NHTSA officials  
were set to make a formal announcement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine against Ford is the largest civil penalty ever paid by  
an automaker to the safety agency for ``failing to provide timely 
notice of a safety-related auto defect,'' according to an agency 
statement obtained Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The topic is a sensitive one at the agency because federal  
officials looking into auto defects rely on company officials to 
turn over documents and any consumer complaints for a complete and 
accurate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement shows the great importance that NHTSA places  
on complete, thorough and accurate responses by manufacturers to 
the requests we make for safety-related data,'' the statement said. 
``It also highlights the need for swift, timely recognition of 
safety-related defects, coupled with prompt recalls to remedy 
safety problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford acknowledged in the settlement that it did not provide some  
documents covered by government information requests but said that 
was inadvertent. The company denies that answers to information 
requests were inaccurate or incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, State Farm Insurance sued Ford for reimbursement of  
millions of dollars in claims it paid on vehicle fires, contending 
the automaker and a supplier hid problems with the ignition switch 
that caused vehicles to catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Ford recall covered 1988-90 Escorts; 1988-92 and some  
early 1993 Mustangs, Thunderbirds, Tempos and Mercury Cougars and 
Topazes; 1988-89 Crown Victorias and Mercury Grand Marquis; 1988-89 
Lincoln Town Cars; 1988-91 Aerostar minivans; 1988-91 Bronco 
sport-utility vehicles and F-series pickup trucks; and 1988 EXPs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time in the past year that Ford has been  
rebuked by the agency for failing to provide information in 
government safety investigations. The other cases involved vehicles 
prone to stalling or rollover.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Time Is Right for Oil Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The success of an agreement  
to cut oil production and raise prices depends on all countries 
doing their share -- something Gulf oil analysts said Sunday is 
likely given the costly effect quota-busting has had on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulf states have seen their revenues hit hard by the slide in  
oil prices, which until recently had been hovering near its lowest 
levels in 20 years -- about $10 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Major oil producers announced Friday a plan to cut production by  
more than 2 million barrels a day, which could lift prices to $15 
per barrel by year's end ``if the producers remain committed to the 
agreement,'' according to a former Saudi oil minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope oil producers have learned a lesson from the drop in  
oil prices,'' Ahmed Zaki Yamani told the Qatar News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the planned cuts has pushed oil prices upward. On  
Friday, the price for April delivery of light, sweet crude rose 18 
cents to close at $14.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, after hitting an intraday high of $15.11 -- the highest 
since early October. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil rose 42 cents to  
$12.60 per barrel at the International Petroleum Exchange, after 
hitting an intraday high of $13.19. Brent crude last settled above 
$13 per barrel in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Aziz Dagastani, a Saudi economics expert, is among those  
analysts who are confident that the pain caused in part by some 
nations' quota violations will strengthen producers' will to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The low level of prices will be a great motivation for the  
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
commit themselves to the deal. They realize that commitment 
achieves their mutual interests,'' Dagastani said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an independent Saudi study, oil revenues of six  
Gulf nations -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, 
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar -- fell from $90 billion in 1997 to $55 
billion in 1998, a 39 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism, however, often has followed production agreements,  
then faded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Iran and Venezuela have reportedly been the  
biggest OPEC quota-busters. Other OPEC members privately have 
accused Iran of overproducing an average of 300,000 barrels per day 
and Venezuela, 100,000 barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran has denied violating its quota, and the dispute over the  
baseline for Iran's oil production cuts was resolved last week, 
though at what level wasn't clear. Venezuela generally hasn't 
commented on reports that it is cheating, though the nation's new 
government has said it will respect its quota. 
</P>
<P>
	Jassem al-Saadoun, an independent Kuwaiti economist, said the  
latest agreement would be ``worthless'' without compliance, but 
noted it had the ``blessing of very strong parties, including the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington fears low oil prices will produce political and  
social instability in the Gulf region, al-Saadoun told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Saturday  
that the agreement calls for production cuts of 2.029 million 
barrels per day, including 140,000 barrels per day from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown of the deal, which takes effect April 1 as the  
industry heads into the season when oil demand lessens, is to be 
announced at the March 23 OPEC meeting in Vienna. Analysts agree 
the key to its success is compliance with set quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The password is compliance,'' said Abdullah al-Dabbagh, a  
member of the financial and economic committee in the Saudi 
consultative council.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Practice Art of Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less is more for George W. Bush. The early  
favorite for the Republican presidential nomination is saying as 
little as possible, whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion? ``That's a hypothetical question,'' the governor of  
Texas says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo? You will get his opinion ``as I leave the state and move  
across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade policy? ``Let me have a chance to get out there,'' Bush  
protests. ``You're trying to force me to jump the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly.  
</P>
<P>
	Political reporters are eager to get Bush on the record, and  
presidential rivals predict his remarkably high poll ratings will 
tumble as soon as he stakes ground on leading issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's today's trend,'' Democratic strategist Dane Strother  
says. ``Nobody knows George Bush other than he's this day's Pet 
Rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While polls give Bush a wide lead over the GOP field and a  
slight edge over Vice President Al Gore, at least one survey has 
shown that one in five respondents confuses him with his father, 
former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, second in most GOP surveys, is the former  
president of the American Red Cross, but she is better known as the 
wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gov. Bush, she speaks in vague terms about such popular  
Republican themes as improving education, tax relief, national 
security and illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategists predict Dole and Bush will wait as long  
as possible to get specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we know is the best day of your campaign is often  
the day before you announce and start rumbling,'' said GOP media 
consultant Alex Castellanos. ``As soon as you start to run, you get 
pot shots from other people and the press starts picking you 
apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The candidate who starts last starts best,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Gaylord, another GOP strategist, said a presidential  
candidate should not take the bait from reporters seeking comment 
on the issue of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to tell the country what they will do when they're  
president. The Republican Party ought to be forward looking with 
solutions people care about. I don't think it's any presidential 
candidate's interest to get caught up in the minutia of the day,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Dole already have learned that lesson the hard way.  
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives jumped on Bush after he was drawn into the  
abortion debate. He told reporters he thought there should be a 
``pro-life tenor'' in the party but that America was not ready to 
ban abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	In her first trip to New Hampshire, Mrs. Dole kept carefully to  
her script during a brief encounter with reporters. ``I'm so happy 
to be here. I'm encouraged by the reception,'' she said time and 
time again to each television camera. 
</P>
<P>
	She varied only once, letting slip with the fact that ``checks  
are coming in.'' It was news that Mrs. Dole was accepting 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	When discussing details, the candidate should take care to get  
them right. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of an unusual blitz of interviews, Gore told CNN  
last week that he helped create the Internet. Republicans reacted 
with spasms of sarcasm; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott declared 
tongue-in-cheek that he invented the paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that once this thing gets going that somebody will  
be tripped up,'' said Democratic consultant Dane Strother. ``There 
will be some skinned knees by summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being vague is in vogue among all presidential hopefuls.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore rival Bill Bradley is mind-numblingly careful with words.  
Republicans Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander and Bob Smith, all 
running full-fledged campaigns, are not exactly mired in details. 
</P>
<P>
	But they are more specific than Bush. While the Texas governor  
dodges the Kosovo question, for example, Alexander can provide a 
lengthy discourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Bush cannot begin staking out his ground until  
after he completes his work with the Texas Legislature in June and 
produces an agenda that will speak for itself. They are not eager 
for him to leave the safe confines of his state capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice to him is very simple: Pace yourself,'' said  
Republican Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut. ``If he could have a 
couple special legislative sessions, that would be even better.''

<HEADLINE> Parental Kidnapping on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Experts say the number of reported cases of  
missing children has been holding steady in virtually every 
category with one big exception -- children taken by their own 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the increase in the number of breakups in marriages, so  
naturally as that occurs there's going to be a custody issue 
involving children,'' said Ben Ermini, director of the missing 
children's division at the Virginia-based National Center for 
Missing &AMP; Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ermini said while the number of runaways, stranger abductions  
and kids who are lost has remained relatively unchanged, parental 
kidnaps have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent national study, published in 1990, showed that  
163,200 children are abducted by relatives each year, the center 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FBI, there were 932,000 missing persons  
reported last year. That number included both adults and children, 
but the FBI said that between 85 and 90 percent of those were 
missing juveniles, most of whom were runaways. 
</P>
<P>
	In the majority of parental kidnapping cases, revenge against a  
former spouse is a primary motive, said Trooper Sarah O'Leary, who 
works out of the state police's Missing Child Clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the child is well taken care of, the long-term  
psychological effects can be devastating, said Geoffrey Greif, 
associate dean at the University of Maryland School of Social Work, 
who has written a book on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who are taken by their parents may be told the other  
parent died, or that the parent doesn't love them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The children are frequently given new names, haircuts and  
clothing. They can't see their friends. They can't return to their 
school. They might even be discouraged from excelling in academics 
or sports because a star student athlete might have his or her 
picture in the local newspaper, Greif said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents act thinking that they're doing things in the best  
interest of their kids,'' Greif said. ``But they're not looking 
down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Excellent Meeting Wins Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Excellent Meeting, a 1-10 betting  
favorite who might run next month in the Santa Anita Derby, held 
off a late rally by Tout Charmant to win the Santa Anita Oaks by 
just a neck Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the $250,000 race for 3-year-old fillies came  
under the urging of jockey Kent Desormeaux in the time of 1:43 1-5 
over 1 1-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, who might be pointed toward the Kentucky  
Derby if she has success against the colts in the Santa Anita 
Derby, passed Tout Charmant at the half-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead was 1 1/2 lengths before jockey David Flores and Tout  
Charmant made for a driving finish through the final sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleefully, a 57-1 shot, finished third, 6 1/2 lengths back in a  
field of six. Each carried 117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tout Charmant had two previous wins and three seconds in five  
starts with earnings of $100,200 going into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the victory, Excellent Meeting's trainer, Bob Baffert,  
made no commitments for either the April 3 Santa Anita Derby or the 
Kentucky Derby on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's victory brought her record to 6-3-1 in 10 starts. The  
winner's share of $150,000 made her a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting paid $2.20, $2.20 and $2.10. Tout Charmant  
paid $2.60 and $2.10 as the 8-1 second favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner John Mabee said he was a little disappointed in Excellent  
Meeting's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was gutty enough to win, but I was disappointed in the  
fact that she wasn't able to handle that other filly in the last 
eighth-of-a-mile,'' he said. ``They've touted her as being a super 
filly, but all horses are inclined to have an off-day once in a 
while. So let's hope this was her off-day.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Faces Murder Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano moved in exclusive  
circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest son in a wealthy family, he became a lawyer who fit  
in easily among Delaware's social, political and legal elite. He 
advised a mayor and a governor, even toying with the idea of 
running for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	But Capano had a dirty, little secret: multiple mistresses and  
an obsessive need to control them. 
</P>
<P>
	When one of those mistresses -- the governor's scheduling  
secretary -- tried to break away, he killed her. On Tuesday, the 
former state prosecutor could join another exclusive circle: death 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Capano's execution seemed almost fantastic to  
those who knew him, considering the 49-year-old lawyer's standing 
in the community. But reality is sinking in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, having wealth gives an arrogance that you can  
control things and get away with things and cover them over,'' said 
Thomas Maloney, a former Wilmington mayor who has known Capano for 
years. ``And as long as he didn't have a breach, he would have been 
safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing judge has two choices: the death penalty or life  
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in January convicted Capano of the murder of Anne Marie  
Fahey, although prosecutors never found the body. Jurors voted 10-2 
to recommend that Capano be executed -- a strong recommendation that 
a state judge would seldom disregard. 
</P>
<P>
	During his three-month trial, Capano showed little of the acumen  
that helped him become a trusted adviser to former Wilmington Mayor 
Daniel Frawley and legal counsel to former Gov. Michael Castle. 
Rejecting his lawyers' advice, he took the witness stand when he 
could have remained silent. He lost his cool more than once, 
exploding at prosecutors and pouting when the judge reprimanded 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors offered no theory about how Ms. Fahey died on June  
27, 1996. They instead set about proving that Capano had planned 
her death and then gotten rid of the body by stuffing it in a 
cooler and dumping it in the Atlantic Ocean from his brother's 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
	After 2 1/2 years of silence about what happened that night, Capano  
stunned the courtroom by admitting that she died at his house and 
he got rid of her body. But he blamed another mistress, Deborah 
MacIntyre, whom he said accidentally killed Ms. Fahey in a jealous, 
suicidal rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied the accusation. And the jury rejected his  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Capano killed because his mistress wanted to  
end their secret, three-year affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano had been the jealous one, according to Ms. Fahey's diary.  
After she started someone else, Capano became ``a controlling, 
manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The controlling nature extended to others close to him who later  
worked with prosecutors. A brother, Gerard Capano, testified about 
helping get rid of a body. Another brother, Louis, said Thomas 
asked him to get rid of potential evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre said Capano had her buy him a gun before Ms. Fahey  
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	From prison, Capano wrote letters and made calls to Ms.  
MacIntyre demanding her loyalty. When those failed, he wrote up 
plans for her house to be burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was like a guy controlling the puppets,'' Maloney said.  
``But all the strings broke.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Target of Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The California businessman who helped  
lead successful initiatives to end affirmative action in California 
and Washington state says he will make Florida his next 
battleground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida is going to be a target for our national movement,''  
Ward Connerly told the St. Petersburg Times in a telephone 
interview Saturday. ``I have concluded there is a problem in 
Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Connerly had the support of Republican Gov. Pete  
Wilson in California, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called Connerly's 
movement divisive and said he will not support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's press secretary, Nicolle Devenish, said the governor is  
opposed to ``quotas and set-asides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``we don't want to have a divisive political  
debate waged at a time when the governor's priority is improving 
schools and improving the lives of children, the elderly and the 
developmentally disabled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly, a black conservative, is a member of the University of  
California Board of Regents, which in 1995 voted to end racial 
preferences in college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pushed for Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot measure  
approved by voters that eliminated race and gender preferences in 
state hiring, contracting and education. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll commissioned by Connerly within the past three weeks  
shows 80 percent of Floridians support his belief that college 
admissions and the awarding of state contracts should be 
colorblind, Connerly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly said he plans to lead a ballot initiative drive in  
either 2000 or 2002, but he faces opposition from many prominent 
black leaders who complain he has become a tool of whites who want 
to tear down affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	His movement appears to be gaining momentum. In November,  
Washington became the second state to ban racial or gender 
preferences in government hiring and contracting or in college 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly helped plan and finance the Washington campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mob Comedy Rubs Out Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Neurotic gang boss Robert De Niro and his  
therapist Billy Crystal held off a flood of new movies as ``Analyze 
This'' remained atop of the box office chart for a second week. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to older audiences in a market full of teen fare,  
``Analyze This'' collected an impressive $15.7 million, down just 
15 percent from its debut weekend, according to industry estimates 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That placed the mob comedy far ahead of the second-place film,  
the belated horror sequel ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' which opened with 
$7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' a mean tale of love games starring Sarah  
Michelle Gellar, tumbled 46 percent in its second week to finish 
third with $7 million, according to studio estimates for gross 
receipts for Friday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Final numbers were scheduled to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rage,'' a follow-up to the original ``Carrie'' in 1976, led a  
whopping list of five new films that opened in wide release over 
the weekend. But with a tepid per-location average of $3,237 and 
the usual short shelf life for horror pictures, ``Rage's'' days may 
be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, all the newcomers opened to fair to lackluster business,  
and the box office overall was once again down -- this time 6.3 
percent -- from the same weekend last year when ``Titanic'' was 
sailing into record grosses. 
</P>
<P>
	One mild surprise was ``Baby Geniuses,'' a critically panned  
film about scientists who find that baby-talk is more than it 
seems. Apparently taking advantage of a lack of children's movies 
in theaters, ``Geniuses'' far exceeded Sony's modest expectations 
to open with $5.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other new movies, the police buddy film ``The  
Corruptor,'' pairing Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat with Mark 
Wahlberg, debuted with $5.9 million for fourth, the Michelle 
Pfeiffer kidnapping drama ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' opened with 
$5.6 million for sixth and the movie version of the popular 
computer game ``Wing Commander'' had $5 million for seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdovers rounded out the Top 10.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Other Sister,'' a love story about a mentally challenged  
couple, had $3.9 million for eighth, the disturbing thriller 
``8mm'' with Nicolas Cage continued its free-fall after a big 
opening with $3.6 million for ninth and the rocketry story 
``October Sky'' continued to do steady business with $3.1 million 
for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the contenders for best picture Academy Award on March 21,  
``Shakespeare in Love'' had $2.8 million and ``Life is Beautiful'' 
had $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated three-day weekend grosses at North American  
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' $15.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Corruptor,'' $5.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Baby Geniuses,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' $5.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Wing Commander,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Other Sister,'' $3.9 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Olympic Boycott Said Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German Interior Minister Otto Schily  
says a European boycott of the next Olympics is possible if the IOC 
doesn't deal satisfactorily with the current bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olympic games in which the European countries don't  
participate would be a hard blow for the IOC,'' Schily told the 
business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to appear Monday. 
``Such a step naturally would be dependent on the unity of the 
European states. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm sure that we will form a clear opinion, also with the  
corresponding solidarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, are next on the schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany currently holds the European Union's rotating  
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Schily, whose ministry is responsible for sports, called on the  
IOC to rethink its structure, including making the selection 
process more transparent, introducing term limits, and being more 
open about its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should very clearly recognize that the organization  
has to be really cleaned up after the scandal of the past years,'' 
he said. ``The member states of the EU will throw their entire 
political weight onto the scales for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC general assembly convenes Wednesday and Thursday after a  
two-day meeting of the executive board to deal with the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Bor Wins L.A. Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Simon Bor of Kenya won the Los Angeles  
Marathon in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 25 seconds Sunday, beating 
countryman James Bungei and breaking the 11-year-old course record 
in only his third marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Irina Bogacheva of Kyrgyzstan sped past Svetlana Zakharova of  
Russia with about five miles remaining to win the women's division 
in 2:30:32. 
</P>
<P>
	Bor, who ran a 4:56 mile pace, bettered the old mark of 2:10:19  
set by Martin Mondragon of Mexico in 1988. Bor's time was slower 
than his personal best of 2:08:46 for 26.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bor earned $60,000, including a $25,000 bonus for the record,  
and a new car in continuing the trend of Kenyans dominating in Los 
Angeles. They took six of the top 10 spots in last year's marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you go and do something good, it means you have done  
something good for your country,'' Bor said. ``To my fellow Kenyans 
back at home, they are very happy. I have managed to do what they 
were expecting from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bungei, who trains in Albuquerque, N.M., completed his first  
major marathon in 2:10:43. He won three half-marathons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was just to finish,'' Bungei said. ``I knew it was  
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bor ran with training partner Christopher Cheboiboch of Kenya  
for more than half the race before moving in front at the 19-mile 
mark, just before the course reached its highest point in a series 
of hills. Cheboiboch said he had malaria for the past 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my friend was trouble, it was the time I was gaining  
momentum,'' Bor said. ``I had to go without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bungei passed Cheboiboch for second place after 23 miles.  
Cheboiboch finished at 2:13:49. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogacheva, who won marathons in Belgrade and Honolulu last year  
and finished second at Los Angeles in 1997, trains part-time in 
Gainesville, Fla. She earned $40,000, including a $5,000 bonus for 
going under 2:32:00, and a new car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy,'' she said. ``Today is my lucky day.''  
</P>
<P>
	Zakharova, who ran alone on the lead for several miles, was  
timed at 2:32:54, followed by Alla Zhilayeva of Russia at 2:33:41. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thought was finish the race, no matter how difficult  
it is,'' Zakharova said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
	Lornah Kiplagat of Kenya failed to win for a third straight  
year, dropping out after 10 miles. She was later diagnosed with a 
lung infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the start, I was feeling OK,'' she said. ``After four  
miles, it was very hard to breathe. When I was at six miles, I 
started coughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said there were about 20,600 participants.

<HEADLINE> Students Sued Over Smoky Bathroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, N.Y. (AP) -- Not only is smoking in the bathroom not  
allowed in school, it might get you sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Philips, a math teacher at Liverpool High School, has filed  
a lawsuit against 11th-grader Brian Parrillo. Philips says Parrillo 
was smoking in the boys bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is seeking $57 for a doctor's visit and allergy  
medication he says he needed after he was exposed to the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher also is seeking an unspecified amount for punitive  
damages for pain and suffering, according to the complaint he filed 
in small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parrillo family was upset when it got the news on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair,'' said Parrillo's mother, Carol.  
</P>
<P>
	Philips, who has taught school for more than 30 years, said he'd  
had enough when the cloud of smoke coming from the bathroom left 
him with a sore throat, a headache, watery eyes and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fed up with getting sick,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Philips said any money he wins would go to charity -- or back to  
Parrillo's father.

<HEADLINE> Report: Smart Car Production Slowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler is slowing production  
of its mini Smart car because the cartoonish-looking two-seater 
isn't selling as well as planned, a newsmagazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2-yard long car takes up just about half of a standard  
parking spot and runs on around a third less gas than its compact 
rivals. With its mix-and-match, brightly colored replaceable parts 
and all-plastic body, the car is aimed at a young market. 
</P>
<P>
	A Smart car spokesman said the production schedule changes were  
due to the planned introduction of a 35-hour workweek at the plant 
in Hambach, France, on July 1, in accordance with a new French law. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to reach the required average working time in France,  
production will be stopped entirely for two weeks before Easter, 
said spokesman Wolfgang Riecke. After Easter, production will run 
with only one shift to prepare the assembly line to install more 
extras in the cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel newsmagazine said the production slowdown was due to  
slower than expected sales. It said estimates for this year have 
been scaled down twice, from 140,000 to 100,000 and then to 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Riecke said the company still expected to sell 100,000 this  
year. A $280 price cut for the basic model to $9,000 is expected to 
spur demand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not giving up on the Smart,'' DaimlerChrysler board  
member Dieter Zetsche was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel said the company also plans a new advertising  
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bapist Leader To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, convicted of  
swindling $4 million as head of the National Baptist Convention, 
U.S.A., is sorry for bringing shame to the church and indicated he 
will resign, according to ABC's ``20/20 Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons said during an interview with Connie Chung that he will  
step down even if the church group's board of trustees does not ask 
him to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's best,'' Lyons told Chung in an interview  
scheduled to air Monday. ``The emphasis now must be on the church, 
on the convention, on the programs and mission and ministries of 
the convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, was convicted last month of racketeering for  
swindling more than $4 million from corporations seeking to do 
business with the convention. He also was convicted of grand theft 
for stealing nearly $250,000 donated by the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'Nai B'rith to rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that there's any one reason I did not give it  
out,'' he said of the $250,000. ``I don't think I'll ever recover 
from that mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lyons and his co-defendant Bernice Edwards  
duped companies into paying for a membership mailing list that did 
not exist, then went on lavish spending sprees -- buying a huge 
diamond ring, waterfront home, several luxury cars and expensive 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was acquitted of racketeering. Lyons will be  
sentenced March 31 and faces three to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate federal case, Lyons faces 54 charges of extortion,  
tax evasion, conspiracy and fraud. Jury selection in that trial is 
scheduled to begin next month, but Lyons has reportedly been 
discussing a plea agreement with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent the last 18, 19, 20 months, uh, repenting,  
repenting, repenting ... over and over again,'' he told Chung. ``I 
have said to my god: 'I am sorry.' You gave the opportunity of my 
life, one that I sought for all my life. You blessed me and I 
cursed you back.''

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld Special Aired in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Television viewers still in withdrawal  
over the end of ``Seinfeld'' could have gotten a quick fix -- in 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	The hugely successful American sitcom also is this nation's most  
popular comedy program, and private station ProTV aired a five-hour 
special Sunday to mark more than a year of broadcasting the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people competed as lookalikes of the Seinfeld characters  
Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer. One, a 31-year-old sketch artist, 
won a trip to New York for his resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Seinfeld's jokes have struck Romanians' funnybones. Friends  
often gather to watch the show and many of the expressions, 
including the famous ``yada yada yada,'' have become hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seinfeld's kind of humor is different. It's for people with  
brains and I consider it the best comedy show ever made,'' said 
Ilie Vornicu, 24, a geology student.

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Moves Across East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A storm that dumped nearly two feet of snow in  
Missouri and claimed several lives in Oklahoma moved to the East 
Coast Sunday, lashing states with snow, sleet and rain. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a foot of snow fell in areas of Maryland by early  
Sunday night, while most of the state was getting a slushy mixture 
of snow and rain. New Jersey and New York were seeing small amounts 
of snows. 
</P>
<P>
	The same storm system hit the Midwest hard over the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, about 23 inches of snow fell from Saturday into  
Sunday morning in the southwestern part of the state, stranding 
many motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, 18 inches of snow fell in some spots, causing  
dozens of traffic accidents in the northern part of the state 
Saturday. At least 13 people were killed in weekend traffic 
accidents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the weather was blamed for a pileup on Interstate 70  
in Maryland involving more than 20 vehicles -- including buses, 
tractor trailers and at least 15 cars and trucks. None of the 
injuries was life-threatening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the buses were carrying high school band members from St.  
Louis. The band was returning to Missouri after performing in the 
Baltimore and Washington areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow emergency plans were in effect in several counties. Despite  
the conditions, the St. Patrick's Day Parade went on as scheduled 
in downtown Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Beeman, 21, a server at the Tombstone Cafe in Frostburg,  
in western Allegany County, said the storm was worst so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, there wasn't any time that people got snowed into  
their houses. Pretty much no one's getting their car out,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, where as much as 10 inches of snow was forecast,  
the storm arrived early Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people forget you can get significant snow in  
March,'' said Anthony Gigi, a meteorologist with the National 
Weather Service's Mount Holly office. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, snow and sleet caused havoc on the roads. About a  
half-foot of wet, heavy snow fell in northern Kentucky, near 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hensley, a roads foreman for the Kenton County Department  
of Public Works, said the wintry blast didn't deter people from 
getting out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still going to the mall. They're still going to the  
store,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police reported numerous accidents but no major traffic  
tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, several inches of snow and rain fell throughout  
the state. Nearly two feet fell in Somerset County in southwestern 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, more than a foot fell in the southern part of the  
state, which was the heaviest snowfall of the season in some 
communities. Numerous flights were delayed at the 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia saw heavy snowfall in some areas: Morgantown saw  
10 inches and about a foot fell in Preston County, which was 
expecting as much as 18 inches. Dozens of accidents were reported.

<HEADLINE> Chicago U. Sued for Alleged Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The federal government has accused the University  
of Chicago of purposely overbilling Medicare and Medicaid claims 
for its medical center. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court alleges the university  
made a habit of ``upcoding,'' or billing at a higher rate than was 
warranted by the procedures performed. 
</P>
<P>
	It contends that about 40 percent of the university's most  
expensive Medicare claims between 1991 and 1997 were upcoded, the 
Chicago Tribune reported in its Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges the abuse was blatant and not accidental.  
</P>
<P>
	``We deny any allegations of improper billing to Medicare or any  
other payer,'' hospital spokesman John Easton told the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, the U. of C. Physicians Group and the University  
of Chicago Hospitals are named as defendants in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit does not set an amount for damages. But private  
attorneys involved in the case have told the Tribune it could cost 
the university as much as $100 million.

<HEADLINE> EU Faces Tough Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Even without their controversial  
chairman, European Union finance ministers face a tough meeting 
Monday when such treasured European institutions as duty-free 
shopping and farm subsidies come under renewed attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise resignation Thursday of outspoken German Finance  
Minister Oskar Lafontaine left the Monday's meeting leaderless. It 
was unclear if Lafontaine's successor Hans Eichel, Economics 
Minister Werner Mueller or another German official will hold the 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's departure came at a crucial moment in Germany's  
six-month presidency of the EU, as the Union grapples with plans to 
overhaul its finances ahead of a planned expansion into Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance ministers will grapple with a tangled dispute over  
sharing out the EU's $93.5 billion annual budget ahead of a March 
24-25 summit in Berlin, where EU leaders have to thrash out an 
accord on EU spending for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Central to that debate is a reform of EU farm spending which  
currently eats up half the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture ministers from the 15 nations clinched an outline  
deal Thursday that cuts subsidized farm prices by up to 20 percent, 
but provides compensation for farmers that in the short term will 
inflate farm spending. Under this plan, the EU agriculture bill 
would be about $344 billion from 2000 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	That has angered some belt-tightening finance ministries.  
``There will be serious pressure for agriculture spending to come 
down again,'' said one national treasury official involved in the 
negotiations. ``The agriculture ministers will not have the final 
word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials warned hopes of reaching an agreement in Berlin  
will be jeopardized if finance ministers or the leaders themselves 
start to pick holes in the farm deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, Germany and France also will have another go Monday at  
saving duty-free shopping within the EU, but officials from those 
nations acknowledge time is running out for the popular traveler's 
perk. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 EU nations voted eight years ago to abolish duty-free  
shopping for travelers crossing between EU nations. It goes into 
effect June 30. Most governments have since changed their minds but 
they need unanimity to overturn the decision and Denmark refuses to 
grant a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	If the finance ministers fail to agree on a stay of execution  
for duty free, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to 
make a last ditch attempt to save it at the Berlin summit.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Singer Trisha Yearwood got a special  
gift after she was inducted as the newest cast member of the Grand 
Ole Opry. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a full house Saturday, Opry star Porter Wagoner  
introduced the Georgia-born singer as ``the best I've ever heard''

``Sweet Dreams,'' a signature song of the late Patsy Cline. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Cline's widower, Charlie Dick, and daughter Julie  
presented Yearwood with a glass-encased silver necklace that 
belonged to Cline. ``I want to tear it out of there and put it 
on,'' Yearwood said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ford Fined in Recall Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay the government  
$425,000 to settle what safety regulators say was a failure to 
promptly recall vehicles and provide information during federal 
investigations into fires in Ford cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Ford was  
not timely in recalling and repairing 8.6 million vehicles in 1996. 
It also said the automaker failed to provide complete and accurate 
information in four investigations into fires in Ford vehicles 
between 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement did not require Ford to acknowledge any  
wrongdoing. Ford officials deny the company violated the law or 
that the recalled vehicles were unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 recall of cars and light trucks from the 1988-93 model  
years was the largest such campaign by a single automaker in U.S. 
history. There had been more than 1,100 reports of fires from 
faulty ignition switches and in some cases fires occurred even when 
the vehicles were parked with their engines off. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached late last week and NHTSA officials  
were set to announce it today. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine against Ford is the largest civil penalty ever paid by  
an automaker to the safety agency for ``failing to provide timely 
notice of a safety-related auto defect,'' according to a NHTSA 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The topic is a sensitive one at the agency because federal  
officials looking into auto defects rely on the automakers to turn 
over documents and any consumer complaints for a complete and 
accurate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement shows the great importance that NHTSA places  
on complete, thorough and accurate responses by manufacturers to 
the requests we make for safety-related data,'' the statement said. 
``It also highlights the need for swift, timely recognition of 
safety-related defects, coupled with prompt recalls to remedy 
safety problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford acknowledged in the settlement that it did not provide some  
documents covered by government information requests, but it said 
that was inadvertent. The company denies its answers to information 
requests were not accurate or complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, State Farm Insurance sued Ford for reimbursement of  
millions of dollars in claims it paid on vehicle fires, contending 
the automaker and a supplier hid problems with the ignition switch 
that caused vehicles to catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third time in the past year that Ford has been  
rebuked by NHTSA for failing to provide information in government 
safety investigations. The other cases involved vehicles prone to 
stalling or rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Ford recall covered 1988-90 Escorts; 1988-92 and some  
early 1993 Mustangs, Thunderbirds, Tempos and Mercury Cougars and 
Topazes; 1988-89 Crown Victorias and Mercury Grand Marquis; 1988-89 
Lincoln Town Cars; 1988-91 Aerostar minivans; 1988-91 Bronco 
sport-utility vehicles and F-series pickup trucks; and 1988 EXPs.

<HEADLINE> Gore Finally Steps Out on His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is kicking off his  
White House bid with the first official political trip of his 2000 
campaign, hoping to begin stepping outside President Clinton's 
shadow and prove his worth against potential Republican rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was visiting New Hampshire and Iowa on a one-day swing  
today to address supporters in states that are critical to winning 
the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only announced opponent for the nomination is former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, although civil-rights activist Jesse 
Jackson is considering the race. Opting out in recent weeks were 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and three senators who could 
have offered stiff challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a Hall of Fame basketball player, says he can beat Gore  
one-on-one and win the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to capitalize on Democrats' concern about Gore's poll  
numbers. Although the vice president is maintaining a healthy lead 
over Bradley among Democratic voters, he is not fairing as well 
against Republican favorite George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of Democratic voters have ruled out voting 
for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of independents and 
53 percent of Democrats say they would consider voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore says he's not worried about polls conducted ``four  
lifetimes'' before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic operatives say Gore's two biggest challenges are  
showing that he can be a leader after years as Clinton's understudy 
and convincing Americans that he cares about their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	With those goals in mind, Gore planned to roll out a new stump  
speech to promote initiatives not necessarily part of the 
administration agenda. Promising to make ``revolutionary changes in 
our schools,'' he was calling for reduced class sizes in all 
grades. Clinton had focused on elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also wants to make preschool available  
everywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is staking out territory in poll-tested health care issues,  
promising more preventive care options. ``Instead of more breast 
cancer tomorrow, let's have more mammograms today. Instead of more 
low-birthweight babies tomorrow, let's have more prenatal care 
today. Instead of more sick children tomorrow, let's have more 
immunizations today,'' his stump speech says. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Washington to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the disease that all vice presidents have: You cannot  
be seen as a strong, decisive leader when you're the second man on 
the totem pole,'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's biggest advantage, the support of a popular president,  
was being put on display today as he continued to collect 
endorsements from party stalwarts. Bill Shaheen, husband of New 
Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, will formally join the Gore team. In 
Iowa, 70 prominent Democrats are set to side with the vice 
president. Gov. Shaheen and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. ``A lot of problems that slide off of 
Clinton stick to Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that is prone to gaffes of his own. He  
claimed that he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to 
howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has done political chores on previous trips, but this is  
the first one in which his campaign organization will pick up part 
of the tab.

<HEADLINE> Lankford, Renteria May Be Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Last spring, the St. Louis Cardinals were  
burdened with pitching problems. This year, they're looking a bit 
shaky up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Edgar Renteria and center fielder Ray Lankford, two  
key players who figured to have healed from injuries a long time 
ago, may not be ready for opening day. Renteria is supposed to be 
the leadoff hitter and Lankford will bat cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria, acquired from the Florida Marlins in the offseason,  
hasn't played this spring because of a knee bruise that first 
sidelined him last August. The physical exam he took in January 
after the trade appeared to show he was on the mend, but when he 
arrived at training camp in mid-February the knee was worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we're concerned about it,'' general manager Walt  
Jocketty said. ``Our doctors are still trying to determine exactly 
what the course of action should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals began last season without starting pitchers Matt  
Morris, Donovan Osborne and Alan Benes, and a team that was 
supposed to contend in the NL Central never recovered. As for this 
year's most pressing problem, Manager Tony La Russa said he didn't 
know which player was closer to being ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good question,'' La Russa said. ``They both may be tied for  
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game plan calls for Renteria, 23, who hit .282 with 41  
steals last season, to begin playing sometime next week. But that's 
only if the knee comes around. Right now there's no pain but he's 
unable to run with his normal gait, which leaves the team to wonder 
what happened the month after he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI last week showed only a knee bruise.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out,'' Jocketty said. ``We don't have the answer  
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria has remained optimistic about his situation, at least  
outwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting a long time and I'm getting stronger,'' he  
said. ``I'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Cardinals do know is they have no complaint with  
the Marlins over the trade, despite giving up right-hander Braden 
Looper, left-hander Armando Almanza and shortstop prospect Pablo 
Osuna. 
</P>
<P>
	Looper is expected to make the Marlins as a setup man, Almanza  
could make it as a left-handed reliever and Osuna is considered one 
of the jewels of the Florida system and will start the season at 
Double-A Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not receive damaged goods,'' Jocketty said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lankford, coming off a career-best 105 RBIs, angered team  
officials in January when he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery on 
his own to clear up what was believed to be a minor problem. The 
team allowed him to recuperate on his own program until the last 
few days, when it was evident things weren't moving as swiftly as 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave him as much flexibility as we could to let him follow  
his program, his course of action,'' Jocketty said. ``It's not 
working and he's on our program now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Lankford has played only two games this spring and both  
have been as a designated hitter against American League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not able to play defense yet, and that's what concerns  
us,'' Jocketty said. ``He can't start and stop the way he should.''

<HEADLINE> Segregation Memos May Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY TIMOTHY R. BROWN   	
</P>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The long-secret files of Mississippi's old  
segregation spy agency were unsealed with much fanfare. Reporters 
converged from all over for a chance at boxes of reports and 
yellowed newspaper clippings collected by the once-feared 
Sovereignty Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiasm quickly fizzled with the realization someone had  
gotten there first -- the agency's censors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the anniversary of the files' release nears, a federal  
judge is considering whether to unseal a final batch of 7,200 pages 
held back at the request of individuals who argued their privacy 
would being violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the release of the first collection of documents on March  
17, 1998, speculation had risen that the files might contain 
secrets of Ku Klux Klan killings or names of civil rights figures 
thought to have been on the commission's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	While some documents raised eyebrows -- in 1964, the watchdog  
agency dispatched one of its ``spies'' to Philadelphia, Miss., to 
sketch a map of the muddy site where the bodies of three murdered 
civil rights workers were found -- there were no major revelations. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Mississippi journalist Bill Minor, himself a target of  
commission spying, says many of the damaging files likely were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a real extent, the damage this group did will really never  
be known,'' Minor says. ``To fully understand what the Sovereignty 
Commission did, you had to live through the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minor says a lot of the agency's activities were never written  
down, but rather were simply shared by word of mouth. Many of its 
dirty deeds were never recorded, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sovereignty Commission was created in 1956 to ``protect the  
sovereignty of the state of Mississippi and her sister states'' 
from federal interference. In practice, it worked to preserve 
segregation. In secret, the commission harassed and spied on 
activists, branding many of them racial agitators and communist 
infiltrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission disbanded in 1977 and the Legislature promptly  
sealed its files. The American Civil Liberties Union sued to force 
the files open. The case stretched 21 years before the ACLU's 
arguments prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ingebretsen, executive director of the ACLU-Mississippi,  
says he ``really regretted it took so long because many of the 
people are dead and they can't seek justice for what was done to 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minor speculates the documents yet to be released will also do  
little to expose racism's secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The files already released reveal a ``Keystone Cops'' approach  
to keeping track of anyone and anything even remotely considered a 
threat to white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, some just scribbled on scraps of paper or  
newspaper clippings, show the commission's spy tentacles reached 
into almost all areas of Mississippi life, from small black church 
gatherings to college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently nothing was too innocent or too obvious to escape  
commission scrutiny. The license tag numbers of cars parked outside 
NAACP meetings were written down. Even after the bodies of civil 
rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney 
were unearthed in Neshoba County, the commission sent a 
representative to sketch a crude map of where the bodies had been 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission records also suggest a motive for the 1959 murder of  
Mack Charles Parker, a black truck driver who was dragged from the 
Poplarville jail by a mob, two days before he was to stand trial 
for the alleged rape of a pregnant white woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported in 1959 that Parker may have been  
killed because the mob believed a jury would free him. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Sovereignty Commission files, agent Zack J. Van  
Landingham offered another view, writing in a memo to himself: 
``One of the main contentions of those who defended the mob action 
at Poplarville was that the Negro attorney, Jess Brown, was to 
question the white woman victim of the rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``This the mob sought to prevent by lynching Mack Parker.''  
</P>
<P>
	The commission also kept an eye on celebrities and entertainers,  
including Elvis Presley, B.B. King, James Brown, the Rolling 
Stones, Sammy Davis Jr. and Harry Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
	Folk singer Joan Baez drew the commission's scrutiny when an  
informant reported she was scheduled to perform at a festival at 
Tougaloo College, a predominantly black private school. The 
commission had targeted the school because of its racially mixed 
faculty.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Drops the Gloves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Not tough enough? In one of their biggest  
statement games in years, the Philadelphia Flyers waited only 40 
seconds to try to fight themselves out of their 10-game winless 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid criticism from the owner's box to the locker room that the  
Flyers have lost their toughness, captain Eric Lindros dropped the 
gloves in the opening minute of Philadelphia's game against 
NHL-leading Dallas on Sunday night. The Flyers were trying to avoid 
tying a franchise-record 11-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, one of the best fighters in the NHL who rarely fights,  
put a rattling check on Stars captain Derian Hatcher. They fought 
and skated to the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the puck was dropped for the ensuing faceoff,  
Philadelphia's Colin Forbes and Pat Verbeek of Dallas took swipes 
at each other and were sent off for high-sticking. Reflecting the 
importance of this nationally televised game, the First Union 
Center roared to life as a breathless Lindros put his gloves back 
on in the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a minute later, Philadelphia's Roman Vopat fought  
Grant Marshall in the Philadelphia zone. With three minutes left in 
the first period, Lindros was in the middle of a multi-player 
scuffle at the side of the Dallas net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, 0-7-3 in their last 10 games, have been in an  
inexplicable freefall since dropping out of the Eastern Conference 
lead last month. They haven't won since beating Pittsburgh 2-1 
three weeks ago Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have had two 11-game winless streaks in franchise  
history -- in 1968-69 and 1970-71 seasons, going 0-9-2 both times. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke had a closed-door meeting with the  
team a few hours before game time. The meeting came days after team 
chairman Ed Snider questioned the Flyers' toughness and said, ``I 
think this team has had a complete mental collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes a different voice telling them the same thing  
helps,'' said Clarke, adding that coach Roger Neilson agreed that 
the GM should address the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger and I talked, and we both thought it was a good idea,''  
Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke has tried everything -- from reacquiring former Flyer Mark  
Recchi to bringing up minor league goaltender Jean-Marc Pelletier 
for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper we have good players,'' Clarke said. ``But even our  
top players are doing things now they don't normally do. No one is 
confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said the team has canceled a planned vacation to New  
Orleans. The team had been planning to take a few days off after 
playing at St. Louis on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Defense Chief: US Threat Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surveying the globe two years after leaving  
the Pentagon, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry sees no ``A 
list'' security threats to the United States approaching the Cold 
War menace posed by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	That is good, but not all good, Perry concludes in a new book,  
``Preventive Defense'' published this month. He wrote it with 
Ashton B. Carter, who masterminded the Pentagon's Russia policy 
during Perry's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	As the authors see it, the absence of a major threat to the  
United States is unlikely to last. They worry that in this 
``threatless era,'' as Carter has called it, the national security 
establishment will let down its guard and a second-tier security 
threat such as China will develop into what they call an ``A list'' 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	They refer not to Chinese espionage that boosts its nuclear  
weapons program -- a worry now in the headlines -- but more broadly 
to U.S. failure to shape China's rise to Asian superpower status so 
that it emerges as an American partner rather than enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, who left the Pentagon in early 1997 after serving almost  
three years, recommends closer U.S. military ties to the People's 
Liberation Army. At the same time, however, he favors keeping 
controls on the sale of military goods to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``If China is treated like an adversary, it will surely become  
one,'' the authors write. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact they see four other troublesome problems -- in addition  
to the risk of China growing hostile -- that have the potential to 
become ``A list'' security threats to United States in the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge today, Perry and Carter argue, is to prevent these  
dangers from becoming threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia tops the list, which might seem surprising at first. The  
Russian military, after all, is in rapid decay. Combat training has 
been curtailed sharply, and experts believe it would take more than 
a decade to reverse course and rearm substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch, of course, is Russia's nuclear arsenal, still second  
only to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and Carter worry that this deadly legacy of the Cold War  
risks putting weapons and nuclear materials in the hands of 
terrorists or others hostile to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the weapons themselves, Russia has enough plutonium  
to build as many as 50,000 more weapons and enough highly enriched 
uranium for another 80,000, the book says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a continuing, vigilant effort we must still judge the  
odds of disaster very high indeed,'' they write. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and Carter also worry Russia could go the way of Germany  
in the 1930s. Isolated and feeling aggrieved as the Germans did 
after their defeat in World War I, the Russians might feel 
compelled to rearm and lash out. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and Carter even raise the nightmarish possibility of  
Russia collapsing in chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regional warlords would capture and seek to exploit all the  
resources at their disposal, including nuclear weapons,'' they 
write. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of ``preventive defense,'' in Perry's view, is to  
engage Russia in cooperative efforts. That would include a new 
emphasis on arms control to improve custody and control of Russia's 
entire nuclear arsenal, not just the intercontinental forces that 
threatened America during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such defense diplomacy grows even more important as the  
`honeymoon' phase of the post-Cold War `partnership' with Russia 
ends, the Yeltsin era draws to a close and a more difficult era 
begins,'' they write. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and Carter see two other potential ``A list'' security  
threats on the horizon: Weapons of mass destruction could spread to 
nations hostile to the United States, such as North Korea or Iraq, 
and ``catastrophic terrorism'' of unprecedented scope might hit 
U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying the warnings is Perry's belief the United States  
cannot hope to go into the new century expecting this decade's 
relatively lower-level security threats, such as North Korea, to go 
away or stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peace will not just happen,'' Perry said in an interview. ``It  
is not the natural order of things.''

<HEADLINE> 5-Time Escapee Returned to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Minutes before he was featured on  
``America's Most Wanted,'' a five-time prison escapee sentenced to 
more than 18 years behind bars in the fatal carjacking of a British 
military man was found hiding in the attic of a friend's rural 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Dale Yeadon, 26, escaped from a jail in Las Vegas, N.M.,  
Feb. 8. He, along with two other inmates who were later recaptured, 
shinnied up pipes leading to the jail's roof, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He traveled to Alabama by bus and went to the northeast corner  
of his home state, where he has family. Authorities set up 
electronic listening posts and later used helicopters and tracking 
dogs in the search, said Mike Richards, a supervisor at the U.S. 
Marshal's office in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	A tip Saturday night led them to the home in the rural community  
of Skirum, near Collinsville, said DeKalb County Sheriff Cecil 
Reed. The convict surrendered without resistance shortly after 7 
p.m. Fox's ``America's Most Wanted'' aired locally at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon, who had grown a beard to alter his appearance, had a  
small pocket knife when captured, a handcuff key in his boot and 
was concealing a small amount of marijuana, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had tried to alter a tattoo of the Ford Motor Co. logo  
``to make it look like ... bricks,'' said Tom Bustamante, chief 
deputy U.S. marshal in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon was sentenced in January to more than 18 years in federal  
prison for the 1996 carjack slaying of Maj. David Graham Nichols, 
vice commander of the Defence School of Languages in England, who 
was killed en route to a conference at Kirtland Air Force Base in 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the carjacking, Yeadon was an escapee from  
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest escape came at San Miguel County Jail in Las Vegas,  
N.M., where he was being held pending assignment to a federal 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Package Left at Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tourists and worshippers trying to enter St.  
Patrick's Cathedral Sunday morning were briefly turned away while 
police investigated a suspicious package which turned out to be a 
bundle of digital devices programmed to flash the word 
``homophobic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The package was discovered by a parishioner on a pew at 11 a.m.,  
near the end of a morning Mass, normally conducted by Cardinal John 
J. O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb squad was sent in to retrieve the plastic bags,  
containing devices police described as some sort of alarm clock. 
They were sent to a police laboratory for testing, said Officer 
LeeAnn Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
	People were turned away while police investigated, but the noon  
Mass was not delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Patrick's Cathedral and O'Connor have been targeted for  
criticism in recent years by gays and lesbians demanding the right 
to march as a group in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's parade will be Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nissan, Renault Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,  
and Renault SA of France could reach some kind of deal as early as 
this week, Japan's national broadcaster said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected agreement would follow negotiations held Saturday  
in Paris between Nissan president Yoshikazu Hanawa and Renault 
chairman Louis Schweitzer, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. NHK said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan spokesman Keiichi Tsuboi said Monday that he could not  
comment on the content or progress of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with NHK, Schweitzer was quoted as that a deal  
will be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Haniwa, who returned home on Sunday, told reporters that his  
talks with Schweitzer were ``friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renault will decide on Tuesday the size of the stake it will  
take in Nissan, the report said. The French company is reportedly 
considering taking up to 33.4 percent in the struggling Japanese 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	A 33.4 percent stake gives a shareholder the right to veto major  
company decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of Nissan's negotiations with the French automaker  
picked up last Wednesday when its equity talks with DaimlerChrysler 
AG collapsed.

BankBoston Corp. for $16 billion in stock in a deal that will 
create the nation's eighth-largest bank. The combined bank, to be 
named Fleet Boston Corp., will be the dominant lender in New

<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, convicted of  
swindling $4 million as head of the National Baptist Convention, 
U.S.A., is sorry for bringing shame to the church and indicated he 
will resign, according to ABC's ``20/20 Monday.'' Lyons said that 
he will step down even if the church group's board of trustees does 
not ask him to resign. ``I think it's best,'' Lyons told Connie 
Chung in an interview scheduled to air Monday. Lyons was convicted 
last month of racketeering for swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to do business with the convention.

the Midwest hard over the weekend dumping nearly two feet of snow 
in Missouri. Several people died in weather-related accidents in 
Oklahoma. More than a foot of snow fell in areas of Maryland by 
early Sunday night, while most of the state was getting a slushy

Explosive experts defused a second bomb planted inside a crowded 
Burger King fast-food restaurant on the outskirts of the city, the 
Anatolia news agency said. Police tightened security following a 
string of bombings and arson attacks that have gripped Turkey since 
the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkish

Archives of General Psychiatry is the first to examine the 
relationship between mothers who smoke and their children's adult 
behavior. The researchers -- from Emory University in Atlanta, the 
University of Southern California and the Institute of Preventive 
Medicine in Denmark -- found that more a quarter of the men whose 
mothers had the highest levels of smoking and delivery 
complications were arrested for a violent crime as an adult.

<HEADLINE> 5-Time Escapee Returned to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- DeKalb County Sheriff Cecil Reed was  
finally able to relax in his office and watch ``America's Most 
Wanted.'' Less than an hour before the show aired, the fugitive he 
had asked to be profiled was back in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found Roger Dale Yeadon, 26, a five-time prison  
escapee, hiding in the attic of a friend's rural home about 45 
minutes before ``America's Most Wanted'' showed his picture 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon had been sentenced to more than 18 years behind bars in  
the fatal carjacking of a British military man. ``We thought for 
several days he was in our area, and when we watched it on TV, it 
felt really good,'' Reed said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Marshals took Yeadon to Jefferson County Jail in  
Birmingham, where he is scheduled for a hearing today in federal 
court. He was to be handed over to authorities from New Mexico 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon escaped from a jail in Las Vegas, N.M., Feb. 8. He, along  
with two other inmates who were later recaptured, shinnied up pipes 
leading to the jail's roof, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He traveled to Alabama by bus and went to the northeast corner  
of his home state, where he has relatives. Authorities set up 
electronic listening posts and later used helicopters and tracking 
dogs in the search, said Mike Richards, a supervisor at the U.S.

</P>
<P>
	A tip Saturday night led them to the home in the rural community  
of Skirum, near Collinsville, said Reed. The convict surrendered 
without resistance at 7:15 p.m. Fox's ``America's Most Wanted'' 
aired locally at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I found him in that room, he put up his hands, turned  
around and went down on his knees,'' Deputy Sheriff Lt. Jimmy 
Harris said. ``He said, 'I ain't going nowhere. I've been through 
this before.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon, who had grown a beard to alter his appearance, had a  
small pocket knife when captured, a handcuff key in his boot and 
was concealing a small amount of marijuana, Reed said. 
</P>

gardens, said Mike Richards, a supervisory deputy marshal based in 
Birmingham.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Faked Death, Killed Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LaFOLLETTE, Tenn. (AP) -- The body inside the burning Ford Tempo  
was charred beyond recognition by the time sheriff's deputies 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The car, which had plunged down an embankment and come to rest  
about 30 feet off U.S. 25 near the Kentucky border, belonged to 
47-year-old Joseph Prewitt of nearby Stinking Creek, and his 
grieving family buried him in a cemetery here five days before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	But 3 1/2 weeks later, police found Prewitt hiding in an apartment  
in Corbin, Ky., about 30 miles north on Interstate 75. He's now in 
the Campbell County jail, awaiting a Tuesday hearing on charges of 
kidnapping, arson and first-degree murder, all linked to an alleged 
plot to collect $1 million in life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Prewitt, his wife of 15 years, doesn't believe any of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are portraying Joe as this monster,'' she says. ``He is a  
good father. A kind person. A gentle person. He would never hurt 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The body in the car was actually that of Charles Wayne Bryant,  
26, of Williamsburg, Ky. Prewitt and a friend of Bryant's -- Bobby 
Canada, 38 -- are charged with first-degree murder in his death. 
</P>
<P>
	The state plans to seek the death penalty against Prewitt and  
Canada. Prewitt's attorney, assistant public defender Charles 
Herman, will comment only to note his client is not the only person 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Dec. 15 car crash and Jan. 8 arrest, Prewitt was best  
known in the local mountain towns for losing his teaching job with 
a lie. In the early 1980s, he taught math at Wynn High School and 
coached the girls' basketball team to its first state tournament 
appearance. But he was forced to resign in 1985 when authorities 
discovered he'd lied about having a degree from Cumberland College 
in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he worked a variety of jobs before going on  
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Some months ago, Prewitt began spreading the word that he had an  
inoperable brain tumor, investigators say. On Dec. 15, he told his 
family he had a doctor's appointment in Lexington, Ky. Later that 
day, a passer-by alerted deputies to the burning car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things didn't look right,'' says chief Sheriff's Deputy  
Bobby Vann. ``It went through our minds that he had had a car wreck 
and got killed. It went through our minds that maybe he committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something that didn't look right, but we didn't have  
anywhere else to go with the investigation. We didn't have a victim 
anywhere else. ... We had nothing to say it wasn't him because the 
body was unidentifiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vann explains that Dr. Cleland Blake, a forensic expert who does  
autopsies for Campbell County, ``took what we gave him and said, 
`Well, the body is the same (size as Prewitt's). It is burnt beyond 
recognition. There are no fingerprints to compare. So until we get 
DNA back, we are going to have to say it is (Prewitt).''' 
</P>
<P>
	Two and a half weeks after ``Prewitt'' was buried, with DNA test  
results still pending, Tennessee investigators learned Charles 
Bryant had disappeared the same day the burning car was found. They 
got permission to exhume the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake compared dental records and determined the dead man was  
Bryant. The second autopsy also found Bryant had been hit on the 
head and shot, Vann says. Blake declined an interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was still alive when he was burned, but the fire didn't  
kill him,'' Vann says. ``He would have died from the gunshots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators discovered Prewitt had taken out several life  
insurance policies totaling about $1 million in the six months 
before his supposed death. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most telling evidence against Prewitt apparently  
comes from members of his family. They told investigators a lawyer 
claiming to represent Prewitt's estate began calling them to 
instruct them they should send future insurance checks to a post 
office box in Caryville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	They were told ``it would be a criminal offense if they didn't  
do it,'' Vann says. The relatives became suspicious and, as 
conversations with the lawyer grew more involved, they believed 
they recognized the voice as Prewitt's. Investigators obtained a 
tape recording of at least one conversation for voice analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the calls were to Marie Prewitt, and authorities are  
convinced Mrs. Prewitt had no clue about the alleged insurance scam 
or murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Vann will not say how police located Prewitt. He and Canada were  
arrested Jan. 8. The woman whose apartment Prewitt was using as a 
hiding place has been identified only as a former girfriend of 
Canada. She has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	But a second woman, Kay Doan, 35, of Corbin, was charged as an  
accessory Jan. 11. According to an affidavit from agent Charles 
Scott of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Doan says she saw 
Prewitt and Canada push the car with Bryant inside over an 
embankment, splash it with gasoline and light it. She also ``saw 
Prewitt with blood on him,'' the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt, whose previous court file contains nothing more serious  
than passing bad checks and defaulting on a car loan, appears to 
have plotted the crime for some time, Vann says. The deputy cites 
Prewitt's recent complaints of depression and claims he was dying 
of the brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was exactly what his plan was -- to fake his own  
death,'' Vann says. ``I don't know if he had a victim picked out 
yet or not, but he was setting it up.''

<HEADLINE> McConaughey Acts Like Goofball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Up for the part of a goofball in ``Ed TV,''  
Matthew McConaughey showed his stuff after spilling his soda during 
the audition. Instead of wiping it up with a towel, he bent down 
and slurped it off the tabletop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always trying to buck the system,'' McConaughey says in  
Sunday's Daily News. ``I love being goofy. It turns out I'm most 
happy when I'm that way, and people like me the most when I'm that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old actor, whose credits include ``A Time to Kill,''  
``Dazed and Confused'' and ``Lone Star,'' plays a guy who lets a 
camera crew follow him around 24 hours a day, hoping to be famous 
until he gets famous and learns about the flip side of fame. 
McConaughey's personal philosophy fit perfectly into the premise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something I've learned about this business is that the more  
you can be yourself, the better,'' he says. ``There's only one of 
you, so you're a novelty.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Clash Nixes EU-Asia Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A meeting between the European Union  
and Southeast Asian nations this month has been canceled over a 
dispute about Myanmar, a Philippine official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	European nations have said they do not want Myanmar, also known  
as Burma, to attend the meeting with the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations because of the military government's poor human 
rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan was negotiating with the EU  
in hopes of reaching a compromise that would allow the foreign 
ministers' meeting to proceed as planned in Berlin, Philippine 
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the meeting will be held, Siazon said, ``As of today,  
no, but still talks are going on about the format.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is being requested is to discriminate against an ASEAN  
member, which is unthinkable,'' Siazon said after meeting with 
Myanmar Foreign Minister Win Aung, who began a three-day visit to 
Manila Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar's slow progress in human rights has been an  
embarrassment for ASEAN, which admitted the country in 1997. 
Myanmar's membership has tarnished the reputation of the 
nine-member group and interfered in ASEAN's relations with other 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Win Aung told reporters Sunday that ASEAN members should remain  
tightly united. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ASEAN is united, nobody could come and then make a wedge  
between us. That is very important, we should stick together come 
what may,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine officials said they plan to ``express  
disappointment'' to Win Aung about human rights conditions in 
Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Midwest Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Coach Charlie Coles was busy overseeing Miami  
of Ohio's upset of No. 2 seed Utah NCAA Midwest Regional Sunday, a 
win that got the Redhawks to the round-of-16 for the first time 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Not too busy, though, to forget an anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had been out of the hospital exactly a week on this day last  
year,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had a heart attack on Feb. 28, 1998, during a game against  
Western Michigan, and had to have his heart electrically shocked to 
restart it. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said his perspective on life has changed since the  
incident, but his attitude about basketball has only grown 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	He celebrated each of his team's tournament wins, but kept them  
in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun. It feels really good,'' Coles said. ``But there's  
always another game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *UK-KU ANNUALLY?:* Two of the winningest teams in college  
basketball haven't played in consecutive seasons since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas coach Roy Williams says that could change -- but that it  
would be a few years before his Jayhawks and Kentucky schedule any 
kind of series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he and Kentucky coach Tubby Smith, long-time  
friends, have talked about a future series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both have too many series now,'' Williams said. ``I decided  
that I'm not going to accept any more series. We'll finish the 
contracts we have and look at it again down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the series was discontinued in 1990 by  
then-Kentucky coach Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been in favor of keeping it. But like a marriage,  
both parties have to agree,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky and Kansas played in the Midwest Regional on Sunday. It  
was the first postseason meeting ever between the two powers. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STREAK STOPPED:* Utah had its 23-game winning streak end with  
the loss to Miami in the Regional. The Utes' streak was second only 
to Duke's 28 in a row. The last three years, Utah lost its final 
game to Kentucky, last year, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BLACK PATCHES:* Kentucky's players wore black patches on their  
jerseys to mark the death of death of Wildcats recruit John 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot Stewart, who was from Lawrence North High School in  
Indianapolis, signed with the Wildcats in November. He died Friday 
night after collapsing during a state tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WRONG CONTAINER:* Just minutes into Sunday's first game at the  
Midwest Regional, an NCAA official went along press row asking 
media members to take their bottled waters off the table -- and out 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
	The plastic Aquafine water bottles were available in the media  
work room from the company that provided water at the event. Behind 
both benches were water buckets with NCAA and Aquafine emblems on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But press members courtside were handed plastic cups with NCAA  
logos and told to keep the bottles under the table. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWOOP MASCOTS:* The courtside mascots for Utah and Miami of  
Ohio, could pass for long-lost cousins. Both bird-like figures were 
named Swoop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami RedHawks mascot has a red body, silver head and big  
yellow beak. He wore a No. 0 jersey with his name on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utes mascot, donning a No. 96 jersey with the same name, had  
a brown body. He also outdid his fellow mascot at halftime, getting 
on five-foot stilts and passing a football between people in the 
Superdome crowd. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TURNER LONGEVITY:* Kentucky guard Wayne Turner, who has missed  
just one game in his college career, played in his 149th game on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner broke the national record held by Duke's Christian  
Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner, by the way, was the last of three Duke players to  
participate in four Final Fours -- from 1989-92.

<HEADLINE> NFL Owners Undecided on Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Los Angeles? Houston? Nowhere?  
</P>
<P>
	As team owners gathered Sunday for the NFL meetings, questions  
about the possible home for the league's possible 32nd team drew 
responses that were all over the map. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McNair, who heads Houston's bid for a new team, believes  
his city has the edge in a poll of the divided group of owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, you've got some owners who do not want to do  
anything, some owners who want to go to Houston ... Some who want 
to wait and see if something can be put together in Los Angeles,'' 
McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to get a coalition of at least two of  
those groups in order to come up with the 24 votes. So there has to 
be some type of compromise to resolve the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the owners held a secret vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon what I've been told, I think we have more votes  
than anybody else in this beauty contest,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos bemoaned what he sees as a  
lack of civic interest in Los Angeles, and appeared to be leaning 
toward Houston. He said he believes the odds are ``50-50'' for 
landing a new franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Los Angeles hasn't shown it's ready. I'd like the  
city to get involved,'' Spanos said. ``Look at what Houston's 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Giants owner Wellington Mara seemed to favor Los  
Angeles, noting ``all those TV sets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LA area is the nation's second-largest television market, to  
No. 11 for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney sounded as if he's on the  
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see LA with a team, believe me, we all do,'' he  
said. ``But there hasn't been much interest in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos shrugged off a question about the two proposed ownership  
groups in Los Angeles, one headed by Hollywood deal-maker Michael 
Ovitz and the other by developer Ed Roski and billionaire Eli 
Broad, turning back to what he considers a lack of government 
support for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney said he had met Ovitz and Broad, adding, ``We heard them,  
what they want to do, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
	``But where's the city?''  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said earlier that he expects the  
owners to pick either Los Angeles or Houston this week, waiting 
until later to name an ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on which city may be made Tuesday or Wednesday. No  
recommendation was made after Sunday's combined meeting of the 
finance and expansion committees. 
</P>
<P>
	A 32nd franchise, which would probably be the last added by the  
league for a long time, would be expected to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones wants both cities to have a  
team, but feels there should be no rush about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's understandable to want a team in Los Angeles and  
a team in Houston. It's more a question of the timing and the 
owners and the stadium,'' Jones said. ``We will do the NFL in Los 
Angeles and in Houston. It's just a matter of how we get to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think LA is such a great market and we ultimately want a  
team there. But there are so many criteria to base it on, so it 
takes time to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair already is contacting owners of existing teams about the  
possibility of moving to Texas, so both LA and Houston could wind 
up with teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmen Policy, president of the Cleveland Browns, had some  
concern about the status of Los Angeles' two plans for a stadium -- 
a new one that the Ovitz group would build in suburban Carson, or 
the remodeled Coliseum being pushed by Roski and Broad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a problem. From what I know, I get a sense  
the stadium plan is not solid in being implemented (in LA),'' 
Policy said. ``If there was a stadium plan like there is in 
Houston, there wouldn't be any doubt about Los Angeles.''

<HEADLINE> 'Baywatch' Accused of Reneging Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A tourism official accused the TV  
series ``Baywatch'' on Sunday of reneging on a verbal agreement to 
film at least 22 episodes on Australia's Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Queensland state Tourism Minister Bob Gibbs said the producers  
simply used the negotiations with his government to squeeze 
concessions out of Hawaii, where the episodes are now expected to 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disgraceful,'' said Gibbs on Sunday, a day after talks  
between state tourism officials and the show's producers failed to 
clinch the world's most watched television show for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ben Cayetano says a deal is  
close but not yet in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's close, but we haven't fully sealed the deal,''  
spokeswoman Kathleen Racuya-Markrich said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baywatch'' executives who attended the meetings in Queensland  
left their Gold Coast hotel early Sunday without commenting. Phone 
messages left at Baywatch Productions in Los Angeles on Sunday were 
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs accused the producers of ``Baywatch'' of never having any  
intention of filming in Queensland, despite an in-principle 
``handshake'' agreement reached Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their coming to Queensland yesterday was nothing but a  
deceitful charade designed to panic Hawaii into signing a deal 
immediately,'' Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV show turned to Queensland after an initial plan to film  
at a beach north of Sydney fell through because of massive protests 
by locals who feared the filming would be an inconvenience and an 
invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii lawmakers are now considering a state budget bill that  
includes $1.7 million for improvements intended to help attract 
``Baywatch'' to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the money would go for improvements and equipment  
at the city's Haleiwa Recreational Center and half for improvements 
at the Hawaii Film Studio at Diamond Head. 
</P>
<P>
	An official familiar with the negotiations said ``Baywatch''  
producers said they need a water tank for underwater shots. It's 
not clear if money for the tank is part of the budget money.

	U.S. Prison Population Has Doubled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of adult Americans in prison has  
more than doubled since 1985, and the U.S. may soon surpass Russia 
as the country with the highest rate of incarceration. The Justice 
Department said today that at mid-1998, jails and prisons held an 
estimated 1.8 million people, according to a Bureau of Justice 
Statistics report. At the end of 1985, the figure was 744,208. 
Viewed another way, there were 668 inmates for every 100,000 U.S. 
residents as of June 1998, compared with 313 inmates per 100,000 
people in 1985.

	White House Defends Spy Response  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While admitting that the Chinese gained from  
nuclear technology allegedly stolen from a Los Alamos lab, Clinton 
administration officials say the government responded decisively to 
the situation. Republicans disagreed and pressed for a review of 
U.S. policy toward China. ``This is a very dangerous situation 
involving international espionage that directly threatens the 
security of all Americans,'' said Sen. John McCain, a GOP 
presidential hopeful. National security advisor Sandy Berger said 
the Chinese did benefit from the leak in the 1980s. But, ``I think 
we moved swiftly and I think we continue to impose on China the 
strictest controls,'' he told NBC.

	Study Links Smoking, Adult Crime  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers say that babies whose mothers smoke  
are at a higher risk of growing up to be criminals. A study 
published in this month's Archives of General Psychiatry is the 
first to examine the relationship between mothers who smoke and 
their children's adult behavior. While stopping short of saying 
that babies whose mothers smoked while pregnant will become 
criminals, researchers say their findings are significant. The 
researchers based their findings on data for 4,169 males born in 
Copenhagen, Denmark, between September 1959 and December 1961 and 
studied the men's arrest histories at age 34.

Service News Agency reported today. The rebels, fighting to oust 
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, apparently killed the villagers 
in retaliation for an attack by a pro-government militia, the 
report said. There was no independent confirmation of the report,

Netanyahu said today in a campaign speech before high school 
students. ``If you violate the agreement and unilaterally declare a 
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, know that on May 
5, we will respond very forcefully,'' Netanyahu said. ``It won't be

thousands of people. The agreement could enable the creation of a 
coalition government to include all of the country's political

trucks. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials

<HEADLINE> Swingley Has Big Lead in Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley reached the Bering Sea  
coast Sunday morning and is threatening to make the 27th Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race one of the most lopsided ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., had at least a nine-hour lead over  
Martin Buser. Most years, the winner usually crosses the finish 
line no more than a few hours ahead of the nearest pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley reached Unalakleet at 10:08 a.m. local time, and said  
he expected to rest for at least eight hours before heading north 
toward Shaktoolik. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned $2,500 in gold for getting to the coast first.  
</P>
<P>
	Buser, of Big Lake, left the Kaltag checkpoint, 90 miles from  
Unalakleet, at 9:19 a.m. Even if the nine dogs he has left perform 
flawlessly, it still should take Buser nine hours to reach 
Unalakleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley hold the Iditarod course record of nine days, two hours  
for the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday he appeared to be about four hours off that 1995  
record pace. It's the only time he has won the Iditarod. Buser is a 
three-time champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Buser, five-time winner Rick Swenson of Two Rivers and  
three-time winner Jeff King of Denali Park were resting in Kaltag. 
Eleven more mushers were headed there. 
</P>
<P>
	From Unalakleet, Swingley has 229 miles to go before he reaches  
the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montanan pulled into Unalakleet with 13 dogs in harness but  
told race officials he planed to drop one dog there. He also 
confessed to some fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trail just beats on you,'' Swingley told radio station  
KNOM. ``I've been sleeping too much on my sled. I think I need a 
long break ... I've had about 700 catnaps in the past hundred 
miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine teams were still on the trail Sunday, down from 56  
who started the race a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While Swingley could dream of sleeping in a warm bed by Tuesday,  
the back of the pack might have at least six more days of mushing 
ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing up the rear was Shane Goosen, a rookie from Wasilla. He  
was headed for Shageluk on Sunday, about 500 miles from Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize money is  
paid to the first 20 finishers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Underdog Purdue made the round of 16 and even one  
of its best players is a bit surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Cardinal led the 10th-seeded Boilermakers with 20 points  
and four steals in Sunday's 73-63 win over second-seeded Miami. 
That came two days after they beat Texas 58-54. Not bad for a team 
that lost five of its previous six games and was worried it might 
not even get into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Boilermakers are headed for the Meadowlands in East  
Rutherford, N.J., where they'll play sixth-seeded Temple on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's win, Cardinal was asked what he would have said  
if someone told him two weeks ago he would be going there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd want to know where I was sitting in the stands because I  
didn't think we would get there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRIGHTER DAYS:@ Despite the loss, Miami enjoyed an outstanding  
season in which it went 23-7, won its first NCAA tournament game 
ever and was ranked 10th nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a decent foundation for a team that didn't have a  
basketball program from 1971 through 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made tremendous progress and we're a good basketball  
team,'' coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``This is probably the first 
night where we had this empty feeling and went out and felt we 
didn't play our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only key senior the Hurricanes lose is forward Tim James,  
the Big East co-player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told the guys to keep their heads up,'' James said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was bothered my back problems during the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unprofessional for me to use it as an excuse,''  
Hamilton said, ``but to say that he was 100 percent is to say I'm 
not being honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	STEALING SANCHEZ:@ Temple's Pepe Sanchez made a big mark in the  
box score for his second straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's opening 61-54 win over Kent, he had some eye-popping  
numbers for a point guard -- 40 minutes, nine assists and no steals. 
And in Sunday's 64-54 win over Cincinnati, he led the team with 
seven rebounds and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Pepe's not in the game everything's wrong,'' Temple coach  
John Chaney said. ``When you find a point guard, you want to build 
your program around that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez set the school single-season record with 94 steals, one  
more than he had last year. And the team had nine steals, setting a 
single-season record of 327. The old mark was 321 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MORE NUMBERS:@ The Purdue-Miami game produced some strange  
statistics. Miami, which lost, took 76 shots. Purdue tried only 38. 
Miami also had a 45-29 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	So why didn't Miami win?  
</P>
<P>
	Purdue made 24-of-37 free throws, while Miami went 12-for-15  
from the line. In the last seven minutes, all the Boilermakers 
points came on free throws as they went 19-for-28. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SMALL CONSOLATION:@ Cincinnati was eliminated in the second  
round for the third straight year, but coach Bob Huggins wasn't 
completely disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	They went into the tournament ranked 11th in the nation and  
finished with a 27-6 record as they made their eighth straight 
appearance in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins denies his team is an underachiever.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the papers so I don't worry about that,'' he  
said. ``A lot of teams would like to be like us.''

<HEADLINE> Report: N.J. Gov. To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman has decided to run  
for U.S. Senate in 2000, according to a newspaper report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unnamed Republican sources, The Trentonian reported that  
Whitman will seek the GOP's nomination for the seat being vacated 
by retiring Democrat Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough denied that the governor has  
made definite plans. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said Whitman's decision will depend on how quickly she  
can reach the three main objectives of her second term: a 
billion-dollar property tax rebate program, a million acres of 
open-space preservation and whole-school reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question now is whether or not she could get these  
accomplished before she would have to depart for Washington should 
she run'' for Senate, McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said Whitman will announce her intentions within a few  
weeks after her trip to South America, where she is heading a 
10-day New Jersey trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg unexpectedly announced his retirement last month.  
Republican leaders in New Jersey and nationwide have urged Whitman 
to run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision may set up a rematch with former Gov. Jim  
Florio, a Democrat whom Whitman unseated in 1993. Florio is 
expected to seek the Democratic nomination to succeed Lautenberg.

<HEADLINE> Sheffield Talking Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Gary  
Sheffield, bothered by a sore shoulder, a position change and the 
team dress policy, is talking about possible retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, if I still didn't have five years left  
(on his contract), and if not for the trade, I would retire right 
now,'' Sheffield told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, referring to 
the seven-player deal last May that sent catcher Mike Piazza to the 
Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza later went to the New York Mets, and Sheffield is the  
lone player from the trade still with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the grind of everything, every day, has been (wearing) on  
me, and you can only take but so much,'' Sheffield said. ``But 
you're supposed to honor things that you agree to, and that's what 
I'm trying to do, but it's hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old outfielder is in the second year of a six-year,  
$61 million contract. He underwent surgery on the shoulder to 
repair tendon damage in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield, shifted from right to left field this year, began  
feeling increased pain in his right shoulder after a game Friday in 
which he went hitless in three at-bats. He received a cortisone 
shot in the shoulder Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield said team medical personnel told him the pain is  
unrelated to his recent surgery. He hopes to return to action soon, 
but expressed concern that his rehabilitation is not going well. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of Sheffield's comments, Dodger general manager Kevin  
Malone downplayed it, saying: ``It's spring training, and you have 
some good days and some bad days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Gary is just going through a frustrating time over his  
shoulder not being where he wants it to be right now. I spent time 
with Gary (on Friday) and he said his shoulder felt a lot better. 
We walked together and talked together, and he never brought this 
up to me or Davey (Dodgers manager Davey Johnson).'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview early this month, Sheffield said shifting  
positions didn't bother him -- even though he spent most of his 
11-year major league career in right field. Raul Mondesi had moved 
from right to center field when Sheffield joined the team, and 
Mondesi went back to right this spring after the Dodgers acquired 
Devon White to play center. 
</P>
<P>
	He has apparently changed his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'm not comfortable,'' Sheffield said. ``I'm fine  
with whatever makes Mondy happy because we need Mondy to be happy, 
and I'm a team player. Davey says I'm too hard on myself, that I'm 
too much of a perfectionist, but I just don't want to be 
embarrassed out there. If I'm embarrassed I can't do it, and I'll 
just say I can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Sheffield was annoyed by the team's decision to again  
enforce dress codes and personal-grooming guidelines. They were 
relaxed last season to accommodate Sheffield after the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of every decision always being around me,''  
Sheffield said. ``I just want to wear my facial hair and earrings 
and just play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield was not singled out, Malone said: ``Those are Dodger  
rules that we're just enforcing, they have nothing to do with any 
individual in particular.''

<HEADLINE> 'Baywatch' Accused of Reneging Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A tourism official accused the TV  
series ``Baywatch'' on Sunday of reneging on a verbal agreement to 
film at least 22 episodes on Australia's Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Queensland state Tourism Minister Bob Gibbs said the producers  
simply used the negotiations with his government to squeeze 
concessions out of Hawaii, where the episodes are now expected to 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disgraceful,'' said Gibbs on Sunday, a day after talks  
between state tourism officials and the show's producers failed to 
clinch the world's most watched television show for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baywatch'' executives who attended the meetings in Queensland  
left their Gold Coast hotel early Sunday without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs accused the producers of ``Baywatch'' of never having any  
intention of filming in Queensland, despite an in-principle 
``handshake'' agreement reached Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their coming to Queensland yesterday was nothing but a  
deceitful charade designed to panic Hawaii into signing a deal 
immediately,'' Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV show turned to Queensland after an initial plan to film  
at a beach north of Sydney fell through because of massive protests 
by the locals who feared the filming would be an inconvenience and 
an invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii lawmakers are now considering a state budget bill that  
includes $1.7 million for improvements intended to help attract 
``Baywatch'' to the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the money would go for improvements and equipment  
at the city's Haleiwa Recreational Center and half for improvements 
at the Hawaii Film Studio at Diamond Head. 
</P>
<P>
	An official familiar with the negotiations said ``Baywatch''  
producers said they need a water tank for underwater shots. It's 
not clear if money for the tank is part of the budget money.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Has Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States could soon surpass Russia to  
become the nation with highest rate of imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a new Justice Department survey, the number of  
jailed Americans more than doubled over the past 12 years and 
reached its highest level ever last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At mid-1998, jails and prisons held an estimated 1.8 million  
people, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report released 
Sunday. At the end of 1985, the figure was 744,208. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 668 inmates for every 100,000 U.S. residents as of  
June 1998, compared with 313 inmates per 100,000 people in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, 685 people out of every 100,000 are behind bars,  
according to The Sentencing Project, a U.S. group critical of the 
general trend toward harsher sentencing of American criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned amnesty of 100,000 prisoners in Russia and the  
expectation of continued increases in the U.S. inmate population 
means the United States probably will become the world's leading 
jailer within the next two years, said Jenni Gainsborough, a 
Sentencing Project spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people imprisoned in the United States has grown  
for more than a quarter-century, helped by increased drug 
prosecutions and a general get-tough policy on all classes of 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	More criminals serving longer sentences led the inmate  
population to top 1 million in 1990; it has continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the nation's inmates are in state and  
federal prisons; the remaining one-third are in local jails. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisons generally hold convicted criminals sentenced to terms  
longer than one year, while jails typically keep those awaiting 
trial and those sentenced to 12 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	In the June 1998 Justice Department survey, 1.2 million people  
were held in prisons, while local jails held about 600,000 men and 
women. Local jails also supervised more than 72,000 people under 
various outside work, treatment or home detention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed the total number of people behind bars grew by  
4.4 percent from June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the end of 1990 and mid-1998, the incarcerated  
population grew an average 6.2 percent annually, said the report's 
author, statistician Darrell Gilliard.

<HEADLINE> Students Sued Over Smoky Bathroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, N.Y. (AP) -- Not only is smoking in the bathroom not  
allowed in school, it might get you sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Philips, a math teacher at Liverpool High School, has filed  
a lawsuit against 11th-grader Brian Parrillo. Philips says Parillo 
was smoking in the boys bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips is seeking $57 for a doctor's visit and allergy  
medication he says he needed after he was exposed to the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher also is seeking an unspecified amount for punitive  
damages for pain and suffering, according to the complaint he filed 
in small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Parrillo family was upset when it got the news on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair,'' said Parillo's mother, Carol.  
</P>
<P>
	Philips, who has taught school for more than 30 years, said he'd  
had enough when the cloud of smoke coming from the bathroom left 
him with a sore throat, a headache, watery eyes and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fed up with getting sick,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Philips said any money he wins would go to charity -- or back to  
Parillo's father.

<HEADLINE> NCAA East Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- An expected showdown between two of the  
country's best big men, Duke's Elton Brand and Tulsa's Michael 
Ruffin, fizzled immediately in Sunday's East Regional second-round 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa went down low to Ruffin on its first possession. His shot  
was blocked by Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end, Brand outdueled Ruffin for a rebound and put  
up a follow shot for Duke's first basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend continued on the Golden Hurricane's next possession,  
when Ruffin was called for an offensive foul, his first of three in 
the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the game ended, Brand had 17 points and six  
rebounds, and Duke had a 97-56 victory. Ruffin didn't score but had 
eight rebounds and three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, even if Ruffin's basketball career doesn't pan out, he  
appears to have a good chance of professional success. He has a 
3.77 grade-point average in chemical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BACK OFF: Southwest Missouri State coach Steve Alford wasn't  
real interested in being interviewed live on television at the end 
of the first half of the Bears' game against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	A network crew swooped in on Alford as the teams went off the  
floor and began conducting an interview, apparently oblivious to 
the fact that Alford wasn't paying attention. With a microphone 
planted in his face, he kept lobbying the officials to give his 
team credit for a 3-point shot at the buzzer instead of a 
two-pointer, as the scoreboard originally showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford won his case -- then gave the network a brief interview.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUNDAYS IN CHARLOTTE: Playing on Sunday afternoons at the  
Charlotte Coliseum apparently agrees with Duke point guard William 
Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery had 19 points, six rebounds and two assists Sunday, when  
he played just 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	One week earlier, in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game on  
the same floor, Avery had 29 points, five assists and four steals 
to lead the top-ranked Blue Devils to a 96-73 victory over North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEEN THERE, DONE THAT: Tennessee' 81-51 loss to Southwest  
Missouri State marked the second consecutive year that the Vols 
were ousted from the NCAA tournament by a member of the Missouri 
Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois State eliminated Tennessee in the opening round last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Tennessee has an all-time record of 2-8 against  
MVC schools. Southwest Missouri State is 6-17 against Southeastern 
Conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MOTIVATION: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski had a few choice,  
unprintable words for his players when they came to the bench 
during the game's first television timeout and the Blue Devils up 
9-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski pointedly asked his players if they were saving  
themselves for something. 
</P>
<P>
	The chat worked.  
</P>
<P>
	When the Devils came to the bench for the second television  
timeout, they were up 22-8, putting them well on their way to 
victory and a spot in the East Regional semifinals in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILY AFFAIR: After Alford finished his postgame interviews in  
the media area, he returned to the Charlotte Coliseum floor to meet 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go to New Jersey,'' he yelled as his wife, Tanya, and  
two sons, Bryce and Kory, waited to greet him near the courtside 
press table. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they left the coliseum, however, the Alfords had a  
Southwest Missouri State athletic department official take their 
picture as they posed in front of a NCAA tournament banner at the 
scorer's table. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILIARITY: Sunday's game was not the only recent meeting  
between Duke and Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	The two schools played at Madison Square Garden in the  
semifinals of the 1996 preseason National Invitation Tournament. 
The Blue Devils won 72-67. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOSE OF REALITY: One enterprising Southwest Missouri State fan  
showed up for Sunday's game with a two-sided cardboard sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The front said: ``WE WANT DUKE.''  
</P>
<P>
	The back said: ``TO LET US WIN.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Rematch Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, who fought  
to a controversial draw for the undisputed heavyweight 
championship, must fight a rematch within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidents of the IBF, WBA and WBC ordered the action Sunday  
following a bout many thought Lewis had won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in disbelief,'' said Lewis after the 12-round match ended  
early Sunday in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee of the International Boxing Federation, Jose Sulaiman of  
the World Boxing Council and Gilberto Mendoza of the World Boxing 
Association met after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this  
important fight,'' IBF president Bob Lee said. `But we did what we 
thought was the most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield holds the IBF and WBA titles. Lewis is WBC champion.  
</P>
<P>
	IBF judge Jean Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., voted 115-113  
for Holyfield. WBA judge Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had 
it 116-113 for Lewis. WBC judge Larry O'Connell of Britain called 
the fight even at 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP scored it for Lewis at 116-111.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who the winner was. ... I scored by the blows  
that connected,'' said Williams, who thought Holyfield won even 
though he landed 218 fewer punches, according to CompuBox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged by the decision was Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer who  
once trained Holyfield for two fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the judges were rigged ... almost ,'' Steward  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki wants the New York State Athletic Commission  
to look into the draw. He said his administration worked hard to 
bring boxing back to the Garden, ``but it has to be done in a way 
that upholds the integrity of the game and people's confidence in 
the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King and both fighters talked about a rematch even  
before it was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	However, before a rematch can take place both sides must agree  
on television and promotional contracts. It's also possible one or 
both fighters could change their minds about a rematch. In 
addition, it's doubtful Lewis would accept half of what Holyfield 
makes in a second fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield was guaranteed $20 million for this fight and Lewis  
made $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six months ain't no problem with me,'' Holyfield, speaking of  
a rematch, said immediately after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	There may not be a big public demand for a second bout. This  
fight lacked drama, especially the second half when Lewis got 
cautious, and 36-year-old Holyfield started showing his age. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was roundly booed by many in the sellout crowd of  
21,284. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real simple -- the people around the ring aren't the  
judges,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	With six seconds remaining in the fight, Lewis lifted his right  
arm in triumph, and his corner men rushed to congratulate him. Then 
the decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that I am the undisputed heavyweight champion,'' Lewis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 33-year-old Briton remains holding only one of the  
three titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a situation where politics was involved,'' Lewis  
said. ``When you've got a fight of this magnitude -- I'm not saying 
Don King had anything to do with it, but this is one of his shows. 
I am in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a typical boxing crowd, with some seats selling for  
$1,500. But the fans were up for the third round when Holyfield had 
said he would knock out Lewis. Holyfield had said his boast was not 
a prediction but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I forget the third round,'' Holyfield said. ``No, I was  
wrong. Tonight, I had problems. Next time I will not have problems. 
Riddick Bowe is the only other guy to do what (Lewis did).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowe, the same size as the 6-foot-5, 246-pound Lewis, won two of  
three fights against Holyfield, who is 6-2 1/2 and weighed 215 pounds 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' best round was the fifth in which he had Holyfield in  
real trouble. In one 45-second stretch, Lewis trapped Holyfield on 
the ropes and landed about 15 punches. In that round, Lewis was 
credited with landing 43 of 57 punches to 11 of 30 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Williams, appointed by the IBF, scored that round for  
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis landed 348 of 613 punches to 130 of 385 for Holyfield, and  
in each of six rounds, Holyfield landed fewer than 10 punches, 
according to CompuBox, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who the winner was. ... I scored by the blows  
that connected,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	If O'Connell hadn't scored the final round for Lewis, Holyfield  
would have won a split decision. O'Connell, who had Lewis behind 
going to the last round, said he expected criticism from British 
fight fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'll get some stick, but it's my decision to call the  
fight as I see it,'' he said. ``It's all part and parcel of the job 
and when I score each round, I never know what the overall score is 
going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christodoulou told the South African Press Association: ``I  
think that many think it was a travesty of justice. ... I really 
believe Holyfield lost this fight. But they (the other judges) 
might have the same conviction about their decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis outpunched Holyfield and landed 187 jabs, many of  
the jabs lacked power. His most effective weapon was a right hand 
lead that Holyfield had trouble avoiding. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like an old man in there,'' Lewis said. ``He looked  
slow to me and he missed a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, however, became wary after the fifth round instead of  
applying the kind of pressure that could have shortened the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to fall for any sucker things,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lewis seemed a clear winner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it,'' Steward said. ``This is a sport I make my  
living in. I am ashamed of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At ringside was light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr.,  
considered by many the world's best pound-for-pound boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel ashamed of what happened,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the fifth round, the crowd became relatively quiet. Even  
the 7,000 British fans could only launch into an occasional song. 
</P>
<P>
	When the decision was announced there were loud boos. Then the  
crowd quickly dispersed as if it had watched nothing more than a 
bad play. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the fourth draw in the history of heavyweight title  
bouts. The last came in 1983 when Michael Dokes kept his WBA crown 
against Mike Weaver.

<HEADLINE> Mob Comedy Rubs Out Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Analyze This,'' the mobster-in-therapy  
comedy with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, held off a flood of 
new movies to remain No. 1 at the box office for a second week, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing to older audiences in a market full of teen fare,  
``Analyze This'' collected $15.7 million, down just 15 percent from 
its debut weekend. That put it far ahead of the second-place film, 
the belated horror sequel ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' which opened with 
$7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' a mean love games story starring Sarah  
Michelle Gellar, tumbled 46 percent in its second week to finish 
third with $7 million, according to studio estimates for Friday 
through Sunday. Final numbers are released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rage,'' a followup to the original ``Carrie'' in 1976, led the  
five films that opened in wide release over the weekend. The other 
newcomers opened with fair to lackluster business, and the box 
office overall was once again down -- this time 6.3 percent -- from 
the same weekend last year, when ``Titanic'' was sailing onto Oscar 
victories and record grosses. 
</P>
<P>
	One mild surprise was ``Baby Geniuses,'' which opened in fifth  
with $5.8 million despite unfavorable reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Corrupter,'' pairing Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat  
with Mark Wahlberg, debuted with $5.9 million for fourth, ``The 
Deep End of the Ocean'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer opened with $5.6 
million for sixth and the movie version of the computer game ``Wing 
Commander'' was seventh with $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were ``The Other Sister,'' which had  
$3.9 million for eighth, ``8mm'' fell to $3.6 million for ninth and 
``October Sky'' was tenth with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters.  
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' $15.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Corruptor,'' $5.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Baby Geniuses,'' $5.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' $5.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Wing Commander,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Other Sister,'' $3.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``8mm,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``October Sky,'' $3.1 million.

<HEADLINE> IOC Defends Corruption Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A senior IOC official defended an  
internal corruption investigation Sunday against charges that it 
focused on minor members and let big names off lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an executive board member from Australia, said the  
recommendation to expel a member from Samoa while handing warnings 
to two others much higher in the committee's hierarchy was based on 
facts, not favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I totally reject that,'' Gosper said as the International  
Olympic Committee prepared for a watershed assembly to deal with 
its worst corruption scandal. ``That is a notion that questions the 
integrity of the people on that commission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's investigation, led by vice president Dick Pound of  
Canada, led to the ouster last Friday of Seiuli Paul Wallwork, who 
never attained a leadership post in 12 years on the panel. Wallwork 
was kicked out because his wife received a $30,000 loan from Tom 
Welch, the former head of Salt Lake's Olympic efforts. The loan was 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest-ranking member implicated in the scandal, executive  
board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea, and a key player in Sydney 
getting the 2000 Summer Games, Phil Coles, were given warnings for 
serious breaches of conflict-of-interest rules and questionable 
judgment. Coles' case added up to $60,000 in travel benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said when the report was released that it was ``not a  
whitewash at all.'' But Wallwork thought differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, he comes from a major country with a city  
organizing the Olympic Games for next year. How can you possibly 
remove a person like that?'' Wallwork, speaking in New Zealand, 
said of Coles. ``To clear some people and penalize others, I find 
that inexplicable in my view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, meanwhile, said his case was politically motivated and that  
he might have been let off to help save both himself and IOC 
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Samaranch and I remain close allies. We have a consensus  
that if I go down, he will go down. If he goes down. I will go 
down, too. We are in the same boat,'' Kim said in Seoul before 
leaving for Lausanne on Saturday.. ``At this stage, I will not 
invite fighting, but I will not avoid it either if they want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in Lausanne on Sunday, Kim said he may have been a target of  
the inquiry because of his high rank. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether his escape from expulsion suggested preferential  
treatment, he said: ``Maybe it was the other way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim also said he never took any money or benefits for himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I did was work so hard for the Olympic movement. ... I am  
not a criminal, I am not found guilty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member who received a warning, former vice president  
Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, said he also had no plans to fight the 
censure ``because the IOC has bigger matters to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smirnov contradicted Kim's defense of one allegation against  
he South Korean, saying he was not involved in any way with getting 
a scholarship for Ekaterina Souhkorado at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to do with her,'' Smirnov said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kim told the Pound commission he was acting at Smirnov's request  
when he sought the scholarship for Souhkorado, the daughter of an 
official of a Russian music company that signed the first major 
recording contact with Kim Hae-jung, Kim Un-yong's concert-piantist 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also said the assembly Wednesday and Thursday would mark  
the start of a ``sensible process to rescue our reputation and to 
maintain our responsibility for putting on the most important 
sports event in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will take important actions, he said, such as an  
unprecedented vote to uphold the expulsions of six IOC members 
caught in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the establishment of 
an ethics review committee and a radical change in choosing the 
2006 Winter Games site.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people will recognize we are serious,'' Gosper said in  
an interview. ``They will find substance in what we are going to 
do. It won't be window dressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper, who has taken a leading role in pleading the IOC's  
case to the public since the million-dollar scandal broke in 
December, said more long-range reforms probably would only be 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will set a timetable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said carrying out significant changes such as democratic  
elections and term limits for members and opening committee 
meetings and financial records to the public almost surely would 
have to wait for a new reform commission, with members from outside 
the IOC, to be established at this week's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling executive board has not come up with a framework for  
the commission, Gosper said, but the panel will include ``people 
outside (the IOC) of significant experience and stature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The initial work of that commission could come by the end of the  
year. Committee sources, speaking on the condition they not be 
identified, said a second special assembly to consider 
anti-corruption measures would be scheduled for Lausanne in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Radical change in the clubby IOC has been called for by many  
groups the last three months, notably the corporations that spend 
up to $50 million each on global sponsorships. Gosper said the 
boardroom viewpoint was just one of many the IOC would consider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to take account of the sponsors' views,''  
he said. ``But that is different from this being driven by the 
sponsors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also said he did not expect sponsors to abandon the  
Olympics because of the scandal or the pace of reforms.

<HEADLINE> British Boxing Fans Furious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- One newspaper called it the ``Crime of Century.''  
Another proclaimed, ``Two hurt in New York Mugging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third said: ``And the loser is -- the murky world of  
heavyweight boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fury in Britain was everywhere Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	All across the country was the belief that Lennox Lewis was  
robbed of the undisputed heavyweight title. And many blamed 
promoter Don King for what they said was little more than a heist. 
</P>
<P>
	Many argued that the promoter and the governing boxing  
organizations envisioned millions of dollars leaving the United 
States if all three titles went to the British fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' fight with Evander Holyfield in New York ended in a draw  
early Sunday, leaving Lewis ``in disbelief.''. 
</P>
<P>
	One judge called it for WBC champion Lewis, another for WBA and  
IBF champion Holyfield and the other. British judge Larry O'Connell 
scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror said in an editorial the draw ``will go down as one  
of the most shameful episodes in sporting history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Express wrote that the outcome further undermines  
confidence in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people believe that the results are fixed,'' the paper  
said. ``Those of a skeptical mind will now be certain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Guardian added that the decision is symptomatic of the  
corruption infecting sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``... it's a picture of gerontocracy and graft, real or  
imagined,'' the paper wrote. ``Boxing is particularly afflicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the fight on TV from London, former WBC champion Frank  
Bruno gave Lewis eight rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have got to say it was politics. In America these sort of  
things happen,'' Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by BBC Radio Five Live if he thought it was a fix, Bruno  
gave one of his deep, trademark laughs and added: ``You said that, 
I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are tired of it, that's why they want one undisputed  
heavyweight championship and they were getting it last night,'' 
said Bruno, who lost his title to Mike Tyson on a third-round 
knockout. ``But it's a load of politics -- IBF, WBC, WBA all 
concocted into one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many callers to Talk Radio, which broadcast the fight, argued  
that because of King's involvement and the millions of dollars 
hanging on the fight, Lewis could never have won by decision. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch, they argued, was the ideal result for King, allowing  
him to promote another fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who called it 116-113 for Lewis, South Africa's Stan  
Christodoulou, declined to criticize O'Connell or U.S. judge Jean 
Williams. Williams had it 115-113 in Holyfield's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Lewis definitely dominated, especially the first  
seven rounds. Apart from the third, it was all Lewis,'' 
Christodoulou told the South African news agency SAPA from his New 
York hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe Holyfield lost this fight, I have no doubt in  
my mind. But they (the other judges) might have the same conviction 
about their decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell, who admitted he had Lewis behind going to the last  
round, expected criticism from British fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'll get some stick, but it's my decision to call the  
fight as I see it,'' he said. ``It's all part and parcel of the job 
and when I score each round, I never know what the overall score is 
going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, was furious.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Larry O'Connell is put on one of my shows by the British  
Board of Control I will hand back my promoter's license,'' he said. 
``The world knows who is the undisputed champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only me, but everyone in the 20,000 crowd were shocked. We  
hope Holyfield will give us an immediate rematch with no 
mandatories in between, for boxing's sake it's got to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the presidents of the three major sanctioning bodies  
-- the WBC, WBA and IBF -- ordered a rematch within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this  
important fight,'' said Bob Lee, head of the IBF. ``But we did what 
we thought was the most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said he thought that ``if Holyfield won three rounds he  
was lucky. Throw all the titles in the bin and just let them fight 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't explain my feelings when it was announced as a  
draw. Everyone around the ring said we had won the fight. It came 
as a bad blow. Ten years of hard work, we finally got the fight and 
we get robbed.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Nuke Plant Key for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Island property for sale, cheap!  
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for a buyer. The Three Mile Island nuclear  
reactor on a small island in the middle of the Susquehanna River 
went up for sale -- and a purchaser came running. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter that the reactor was right next to its  
well-known neighbor, Reactor No. 2, now a shell and forever 
emblazoned in nuclear industry history as the site of America's 
worst nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, GPU Inc. of Morristown, N.J., is expected to turn  
over to AmerGen -- a partnership of Philadelphia-based PECO Energy 
Co. and British Energy -- ownership of the undamaged Three Mile 
Island Unit 1 reactor. It will mark the first time a nuclear 
reactor has been bought in its entirety, and other such deals are 
expected to follow, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale marks a dramatic change in the nuclear power industry,  
which is trying to find ways to survive the onslaught of 
competition in the electricity business. Many utility executive say 
nuclear can't compete against cheaper coal and modern natural gas, 
so they're selling out. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also are buyers who say, in fact, they can and will  
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The viability of a nuclear plant will be determined by  
``bottom-line dollars and cents realism,'' says Roger Gale, an 
analyst at the Washington International Energy Group, a consulting 
firm. It predicts as many as 37 to 40 of the 103 currently 
operating reactors likely will not survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But other reactors that are able to get rid of their huge  
indebtedness from construction, have a reputation for good 
management and have stayed out of trouble with federal regulators 
are likely to do well, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these plants have come on the market recently and buyers  
are grabbing them up at bargain-basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general you're able to buy nuclear for next to nothing. ...  
and that could bring a renaissance'' to the industry, says Robert 
Rubin, an analyst for Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	For example:  
</P>
<P>
	--AmerGen, the PECO joint venture, will get the TMI reactor for  
less than 20 cents on the dollar -- for only $23 million plus 
another $77 million for the fuel already contracted. The plant is 
on GPU's books for $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Massachusetts, Entergy, another company out to become a  
national nuclear operator, will soon close on a deal to buy the 
Pilgrim reactor for a scant $13 million plus $67 million for its 
fuel, although the plant is on Boston Edison's books for $700 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--AmerGen, which pursued the soon-to-be-closed Maine Yankee plant  
but rejected it, also is negotiating for a possible purchase of the 
Vermont Yankee reactor, and has shown an interest in GPU's Oyster 
Creek reactor in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	With some plants destined to close and others being grabbed up  
by companies seeking to become national nuclear powerhouses, the 
industry is undergoing its biggest changes since the Three Mile 
Island accident 20 years ago this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a continued consolidation,'' predicts PECO  
Energy chairman Corbin McNeill Jr., who says there are plants that 
will close because they're not economical, but others that will be 
attractive and profitable at the right price. He foresees fewer 
than 10 nuclear operators in five to 10 years, compared with the 43 
utilities that own reactors today. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeill says the Three Mile Island reactor is one that can make  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a phenomenal deal,'' says Rubin, the Bear Stearns  
analyst. Not counting the fuel purchase, the TMI reactor is selling 
for about $30 per kilowatt of generation. By comparison, GPU 
recently sold its fossil fuel generation plants for 2.5 times their 
book value at $510 per kilowatt. 
</P>
<P>
	But GPU chairman Fred Hafer calls the sale a good deal for his  
company, too. He sees his utility's future role in a competitive 
industry as an electricity distributor and power generator. And, he 
says, it frees the company from ``the overhanging liability'' and 
uncertainties of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the nuclear industry you can't be successful with being  
just a dabbler in the business,'' Hafer said in a telephone 
interview.

<P>
	Mark Potkin, Boston Edison's manager of finance and strategic  
planning, says his utility's decision to sell the Pilgrim plant was 
``a no-brainer'' and that it would have cost shareholders more to 
shut it down. The utility, like GPU, is getting out of the power 
generation business and, says Potkin, ``out of the nuclear 
headache.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for New Orleans-based Entergy, the deal means the purchase  
of a well-run power plant and its fuel for a rock-bottom $80 
million. Entergy will even get about $40 million in ``transitional 
payments'' from customers through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the TMI and Pilgrim case, the tens of millions of  
dollars in ``stranded costs'' -- the amount between what the plants 
were valued on the utilities' books and the actual sale price -- 
will be paid by ratepayers, no matter from whom they purchase 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	State electricity deregulation programs in both Massachusetts  
and Pennsylvania allow for such payments.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Midwest Regional Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Oklahoma Sooners are in the round of 16  
because they know how to make up for the lack of an inside game: 
get the sharpshooters open. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they're even naming babies after this style.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ray Lopes has been with me for seven years,'' coach Kelvin  
Sampson said Sunday. ``His wife just had a baby. They named it 
Marcus Ray. We made 10 3s against Arizona and they changed the name 
to Trey Alexander. That tells you about our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does the 13 3s the Sooners made Sunday -- a school postseason  
record -- in their 85-72 upset of North Carolina-Charlotte that 
propelled them to the round of 16 for the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Sooners made up for their lack of an inside game  
by continually isolating their jumpshooters on the left side and 
concentrating their ball movement to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	When the sole defender moved to help guard the penetrater or  
double the post, his man was left with wide-open long-range looks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what good teams do, they find the open guy,'' said  
senior Eric Martin, who scored all 18 of his points on 3s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want our player to leave the passer if he was a  
shooter and twice that happened,'' 49ers coach Bobby Lutz said. 
``We left Martin to double in the post and he hit the shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte hit only 5 of 29 shots in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they were good shooters and we left them a little too  
open, obviously,'' Lutz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach told us that they're very similar to us and you can't  
just run plays for 40 minutes against a hard-nosed defensive 
team,'' Martin said. ``You've just got to make plays on your own. 
We made plays and my teammates found me in the open and I knocked 
down the shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUID PRO QUO:* Michigan State coach Tom Izzo figures the  
Spartans' next opponent, Oklahoma, owes him a favor when they meet 
in St. Louis in the Midwest Regional semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
	Or at least a thank you note from Sooners coach Kelvin Sampson.  
</P>
<P>
	By virtue of their 13th seed, the Sooners were the last at-large  
team to make the NCAA tournament. The selection committee said that 
had Illinois beaten Michigan State in the Big Ten title game, the 
Illini would have become the eighth Big Ten team to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have bumped out the Sooners despite their  
second-place finish in the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo didn't want to comment on the matchup with the Sooners.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just that Kelvin Sampson's an old Michigan State guy,'' Izzo  
said. ``And No. 2, you know, I talked to Jud Heathcote early and he 
said he called Kelvin and thanks to our win over Illinois might 
have got them in. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I hope he repays the favor.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OUCH!* Michigan State guard Charlie Bell may have had a  
sprained ankle, but he didn't play like it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who had a brace and heavy tape on his left ankle, came off  
the bench for 14 minutes and scored five points Sunday in Michigan 
State's 74-66 victory over Mississippi. He also had one assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's ankle has been a problem all season, and he aggravated it  
in Friday night's rout of Mount St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MUGSY BOGUES II?* Mississippi guard Jason Harrison is listed at  
5-foot-5. In platform sneakers, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	But what the diminutive guard lacks in size, he makes up for in  
hustle and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrison was the sparkplug for the Rebels in the first and  
second rounds of the Midwest Regional. Against Michigan State, he 
scored seven points, including a big 3-pointer over All-American 
Mateen Cleaves that put the Rebels up 59-56 in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was tough,'' Cleaves said. ``I had played against (George  
Washington's) Shante Rogers and (former Eastern Michigan point 
guard) Earl Boykins, and he ranks up there with those guys. He's 
gonna be tough. He plays real good defense and the thing I like 
about him is he's a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Harrison was Arkansas' Mr. Basketball last year and led  
his Little Rock Parkview High School to the Arkansas 4A title, he 
said he wasn't recruited by any Division I schools. He signed with 
Henderson State, a Division II school, but decided to follow Eric 
Bozeman when Bozeman left Henderson State to join Rod Barnes' 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes said he wasn't turned off by Harrison's size at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you can play this game, you can play it,'' Barnes said. ``I  
think people overrate size and all that kind of stuff. The bottom 
line is you've got to put the ball in the basket and you've got to 
stop the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Size and height and all that stuff can help, but I'm one who  
believes that hard work and a big heart and a passion for whatever 
you do can help you be successful, and Jason Harrison is a prime 
example of that.''

<HEADLINE> Strong Economy Leads to Butler Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Eleven bathrooms, five bedrooms, four  
fireplaces, an elevator, and a pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Eaton takes care of it all. But don't call her a butler.  
Ms. Eaton is among the growing ranks of household managers, as they 
prefer to be known. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old mother of three had been working in sales and  
customer service for nine years, and was unhappy sitting in a 
cubicle all day. When she saw a want ad for a house manager, 
something clicked, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good outlet for all the things I love to do,'' Ms.  
Eaton said. ``I love organization; I like working on my own, and I 
like caring for a house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today she works in a 15,000-square-foot home owned by a suburban  
Columbus CEO whose name she discreetly withholds. She buys 
groceries, cleans, cares for animals and supervises a nanny and 
gardener. 
</P>
<P>
	With a booming economy, more people are buying sprawling homes  
and hiring others to take care of them, according to those who make 
a business of meeting that need. They say a household manager can 
earn $25,000 to $100,000, depending on their duties, which can 
range from running a household alone to supervising a household 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people are buying large homes for the first time and  
filling them with expensive rugs and china that they don't know how 
to properly care for, said Gay Metz, placement consultant for the 
Professional Domestic Services in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The placement service is part of the Professional Domestic  
Institute, where Ms. Eaton trained. 
</P>
<P>
	In five-week sessions that cost $4,500, students learn all  
aspects of running an expensive household, including caring for 
antiques and art work, shopping for food and home accessories, 
planning and serving meals and parties, managing a financial budget 
and supervising other staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Students also can participate in workshops to learn formal  
dining skills -- such as which fork goes where -- and how to plan 
creative parties. There's a three-hour session on improving ironing 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute was founded in 1995 by Carol Scudere, who has  
worked as a professional household manager and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Students use Ms. Scudere's own home as a classroom.  
</P>
<P>
	She said it's important for students to learn to handle fine  
furnishings similar to what they'll encounter in employers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A former self-employed interior designer, Ms. Scudere, 52, gets  
to spend company money scouring antique shops and estate sales for 
$3,000 Irish linens, African candlesticks and silver tea sets. Then 
she takes them home and lets trainees handle them. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has about 500 cookbooks and three freezers to teach  
students gourmet cooking and serving techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute is the country's second such school, after  
Denver-based Starkey International. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1981, Starkey trains about 60 people a year; the  
average student is 45 years old and college-educated, embarking on 
a second career. Their employers make about $200,000 a year and are 
usually top-level executives and CEOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Starkey said the household managers are a sign of changing  
times. She said people recognize that they can't hire illegal 
immigrants to serve as household staff anymore. They need people 
familiar with the culture, Ms. Starkey said, who are 
technologically trained to deal with ``smart'' houses and able to 
adhere to creating low-fat diets. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who receive training to deal with expectations of the  
wealthy often get along better with employers, Ms. Scudere said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eaton has established a trusting relationship with her  
employer. And she's glad to be out of that cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful environment to work in. Just walking into  
that home every day is a perk.''

	Afghanistan Coalition Rule Crafted  
</P>
<P>
	ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) -- The warring factions in  
Afghanistan have agreed in principle on the creation of a coalition 
government to include all of the country's political forces, U.N. 
mediators said today. The agreement, the first such deal between 
the factions, could mean an end to two decades of fighting that has 
killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed vast areas of the 
country, including the capital of Kabul. The deal was reached 
between Afghanistan's ruling Taliban Islamic movement and its main 
foe, the northern opposition, the U.N. Special Mission to 
Afghanistan said in a statement.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. fighter planes bombed several Iraqi  
air defense sites when they came under fire during routine 
enforcement of the northern ``no-fly'' zone today, a U.S. military 
official said. In response to Iraqi fire, Air Force F-15E Strike 
Eagles dropped bombs on several anti-aircraft artillery sites 
northwest and west of the city of Mosul, 250 miles north of 
Baghdad, said Capt. Manning Brown, a spokesman for the Operation 
Northern Watch based in southern Incirlik Air Base. ``All coalition 
aircraft departed the area safely,'' Brown said.

they were are prepared to sign a U.S.-backed Kosovo peace plan. 
Departing for peace talks in France, delegates said they would sign 
if the Serb-led government backs down on its opposition to allowing 
NATO troops to enforce it. Meanwhile, there was no letup in the 
fighting between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in 
the province in southern Serbia. Three bombs went off in two

	LONDON (AP) -- Britain and the United States are investigating  
whether Lloyd's of London insurance companies are being used by 
American crime syndicates as a cover for scams that could cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost claims, The Sunday Times 
reported. Several British firms have been raided during the 
four-month investigation, Lloyd's spokesman Nick Doak confirmed. 
The newspaper said the fraud is thought to involve bogus insurance

	Police Misconduct Concerns Clinton

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Allegations of wrongdoing by police are  
on President Clinton's mind this weekend. In a radio speech 
yesterday, Clinton expressed concern that recent charges of police 
misconduct could undermine the fight against crime. He also 
proposed improved training and other steps to restore the ``bonds 
of trust'' between the public and law enforcement. Recent 
questionable shootings by police that took the lives of young 
blacks in New York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif., have revived 
debate about how officers handle confrontations with minorities.

Louisiana into Mississippi, Alabama and eastern Tennessee. The 
National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for sections of 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and extreme northwestern Florida.

<HEADLINE> New Exercise Plan Focuses on Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although they are in their 60s, Frank and  
Marian Del Veccio still play like kids. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday mornings, when the real kids are in school, the Del  
Veccios are at a health club, running relay races, twirling hula 
hoops and generally having fun. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise program is named Recess, and it's run by the Crunch  
health clubs in New York City and Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Recess thing is doing things we all had forgotten after we  
were kids,'' said Marian Del Veccio, who moved with her husband to 
the resort's trendy South Beach section after Frank retired three 
years ago from his Boston law practice. ``There's a funny kind of 
therapy involved, I think, in regressing. There's something about a 
silly game and doing it as an adult. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recess makes exercise fun, said Frank Del Veccio. ``I used to  
say this is my therapy,'' he said. ``I look forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He used to run along the Charles River in Boston, he said: ``I  
thought that was real boring, but I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putting fun back in exercise was part of the plan for the  
program's designer and South Beach club class leader, Kevin 
Creegan. Over about a dozen years in group exercise, he often had 
noted the large number of exercisers who burn out and drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the (club's) athletic director about two years ago  
about wanting to develop a class based on the games we used to play 
at recess as children,'' Creegan said. ``When you are a kid, you do 
exercise because you want to do it -- because it's fun. That's what 
I wanted to bring back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creegan doesn't try to make an exact count of the cardiovascular  
benefit the program holds. ``You're not going to keep your heart 
rate sustained like in a Step (aerobics) or Spinning (cycling) 
class -- it's more stop-and-go,'' he said. ``You probably burn more 
calories than in a rice cake and less calories than in a pint of 
Haagen-Dazs. It's probably in the Moon Pie range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creegan's program includes jumping rope and running-backward  
races. ``The two most fun parts are hula hoops, once they get past 
the frustration of remembering how, and the other thing people love 
is dodge ball,'' he said. ``That's a passive-aggressive thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first saw the hula hoop, I remembered I was a decent  
hula hooper as a kid,'' said Nina Weber Worth, 45, one of the Del 
Veccios' Miami Beach classmates. ``I took it and I tried it, and it 
was the hardest thing in the world. But by the third class, I won 
the endurance contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She concedes there is something silly about all the fun and  
games. ``It felt silly in a good way, in terms of letting your 
inhibitions go and throwing caution to the wind and just 
participating,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I try is I never do anything while they are  
facing the mirror,'' Creegan said. ``That eliminates them feeling 
silly because they never see. And I try to keep people from judging 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making sure exercise is fun is valuable, outside experts agree.  
And fun is something that health clubs are turning to, said Carl 
Foster, an associate professor in the exercise and sport science 
department at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse. 
</P>
<P>
	People who join only to do self-improvement often quit, he said.  
``At one year, you've got less than 50 percent who are still doing 
it,'' he said. ``The dropout rate is the single largest problem in 
the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for looking silly, ``There are worse sins,'' Foster said.  
``If you have to see someone looking like a giddy kid again versus 
someone getting the best physiological workout you can do, I would 
say more than half the people in our industry would come down for 
the former.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be nice to see the fun expanded into other exercise  
areas, said Dan Wagman, a sports psychologist who is health and 
science editor for Muscle and Fitness magazine. ``Cycling, lifting 
weights -- couldn't we manipulate them so that it becomes it becomes 
a little more fun?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where it doesn't become a hassle, where it isn't something you  
force yourself to do, where you actually enjoy it, then the 
likelihood of sticking with it is so much bigger.''

<HEADLINE> Too Many Projects, Not Enough Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A creaky 90-year-old bridge in northwestern  
Pennsylvania has nearly everything it needs to be replaced this 
year: enough federal dollars, an eager contractor and plenty of 
American-made raw steel. 
</P>
<P>
	But overloaded fabricators can't turn that steel into girders  
fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Massive road and bridge projects being funded with money from  
the 1998 Federal Highway Act -- including the Kennerdell Bridge 
project in Pennsylvania's Venango County -- have suddenly created a 
huge demand for fabricated steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you've got is huge projects hitting at the same time and  
going through major fabricators,'' said Steve Bussanmas, senior 
vice president of sales and marketing for High Steel Structures in 
Lancaster, which supplies fabricated steel to contractors 
nationwide. ``It's causing quite a backlog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City is using thousands of tons of fabricated steel to  
build more than 130 bridges to prepare for the 2002 Winter Olympic 
Games. Boston is constructing the multibillion-dollar ``Big Dig,'' 
a new underground central artery to alleviate traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal highway bill increased demand almost exponentially.  
High Steel hired more workers last year and this year, and the mill 
operates seven days a week, including around the clock on week 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fabricators, including Stupp Brothers Bridge and Iron Co.  
in St. Louis, are opening new plants to further increase output. 
</P>
<P>
	But most fabricators want to know if the current boom will  
deflate before they hire more permanent employees or open more 
plants, said Bob Nickerson, a Baltimore engineer and steel industry 
consultant studying reasons for the sudden demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fabricators don't want to build a new plant and find that  
owners stop ordering steel next year,'' he said. ``We need to make 
sure our capacity problem is not just a short-term peak issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson said he would report his findings to the American  
Institute of Steel Construction in Chicago this month. That group 
is the steel fabrication industry's major national professional 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``transient mentality'' is what leaves the construction  
industry scrambling when facing a sudden boom, said Robert 
Morehead, spokesman for the National Center for Construction 
Education and Research in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the economy is going nuts like it is now, they say they  
need to hire more people, and lose business while they take time to 
train them,'' Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when the economy slows down, they scale back and stop  
training. Five years from now when the economy takes off again, 
they will have the same situation, and worse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morehead said the industry needs to hire and train when business  
is slow to be ready when it booms. Current demands will decrease, 
particularly when the Boston project is completed, but business 
will pick up again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, state governments are trying to find steel, or  
trying to make do with their crumbling infrastructure while they 
wait for steel to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had planned to  
replace the aging, one-lane Kennerdell Bridge, about 55 miles north 
of Pittsburgh, this year. The well-traveled bridge crosses the 
Allegheny River. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rinker, the contractor awarded the $7 million bid for the  
bridge, said he's turned to fabricators he hasn't used before in 
hopes of getting the steel. All told him they needed 10 months to a 
year to supply the 750 tons of girders. The project had to be 
postponed until spring 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	So, PennDOT will patch up the bridge and maintain its five-ton  
weight limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have found ways to avoid construction delays. The  
New York Department of Transportation altered contract schedules 
and shortened review time so it did not have to put off any road 
and bridge projects this year, department spokesman Michael 
Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so in Pennsylvania, though, where Venango County residents  
who use the bridge every day sigh at the thought of living with it 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who use it wish it would hurry up and be replaced,''  
said William Bell, secretary for Rockland Township in Kennerdell. 
``No one is nervous about using it, but we need a new bridge.''

<HEADLINE> Royals Off to Roaring Spring Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Yeah, it's only spring training. So  
what? 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-1 Royals are still the winningest team in the Grapefruit  
League, hitting, pitching and playing defense just like the 
high-priced contenders they aren't supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's an encouraging relief to a collection of unproven  
young players who pitched camp just two weeks ago amid dire 
predictions of sorrow and woe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand some people are saying this team's going to lose  
100 games.'' said closer Jeff Montgomery, one of the few veterans 
on a club that won only 72 games last year and then lost its top 
two run-producers and No. 1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we all understand that when the regular season starts,  
established teams and established players will kick it up a notch. 
But winning is a byproduct of executing. And in several games, I've 
seen us do things that other clubs didn't do as well, which 
resulted in us winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After split squad games with Detroit and Houston were rained out  
Sunday, the Royals were averaging 6.4 runs and 11.5 hits per game 
and were second among AL teams with a .335 batting average. They 
were first with a .529 slugging percentage and among the leaders 
with 13 home runs, 26 doubles and 126 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Their pitchers had given up 33 earned runs in 99 innings for a  
league-best ERA of 3.00. 
</P>
<P>
	They've beaten Roger Clemens and cuffed Greg Maddux around. Yes,  
three of their wins came against the woeful Florida Marlins. But 
they've also wracked up two wins each over the Yankees and Indians 
and bested the Dodgers, Cardinals (minus Mark McGwire) and Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about winning is that it's contagious,'' said  
catcher Sal Fasano. ``You get in the habit of finding a way to win. 
The best thing that could happen to a young team is to prove to 
them that we can find a way to beat good teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until a couple of days ago, camp was bulging with a team-record  
69 players. But instead of chaos, order has reigned. Using all six 
fields at their Baseball City complex, manager Tony Muser and his 
staff are running a highly organized operation where everybody gets 
plenty of work and not a minute is wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very efficient from the first day,'' said outfielder  
Johnny Damon. ``Nobody stands around waiting for somebody to tell 
them where to go. Everything goes off on schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals have about six major league jobs open, which may  
account as much as anything for all these wins. With so many jobs 
to be won, young players eager for a shot at the majors are staying 
focused and competing as hard as they can. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of guys here with a lot to prove,'' said  
general manager Herk Robinson. ``There are a lot of openings on 
this club and players are going to have to do things correctly to 
stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muser, starting his second full year as manager, says it's the  
most competitive camp he's ever been involved with. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are busting their butt for jobs. They know they're being  
pressed by others and that everything they do matters,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, being 10-1 is a lot better than being 1-10,  
especially for a team that all the experts are saying won't have a 
chance of competing. 
</P>
<P>
	And who knows? If these young players keep on winning, maybe the  
club will change its mind about unloading the few high-priced 
veterans still left, such as former ace right-hander Kevin Appier 
and first baseman Jeff King. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people (in the front office) are watching what's  
happening and starting to think twice,'' said Montgomery. ``Let's 
hold on to Appier and see what happens with this season. It might 
be a lot more interesting than they even thought it would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all along we'll do what's in the best interests of  
the club,'' said Robinson.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico announced Sunday it has refinanced  
$1.88 billion in debt, converting loans due in April 2000 to 
medium- and long-term obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The action reduces a looming payment due next year and is meant  
to improve relations with creditor banks, which had loaned Mexico 
about $2.67 billion under an emergency credit line late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks reportedly argued that Mexico's financial situation no  
longer required the cut-rate terms of the emergency loans, granted 
at a time many investors were pulling out of emerging markets due 
to the crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not describe the interest terms of the new credits  
but noted they would have no impact on the country's international 
reserves.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Legendary soccer player Pele is  
seeking foreign partners to invest in a ``super league'' 
independent of Brazil's soccer confederation, a newspaper reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pele says he will approach Brazil's best clubs to join the new  
league, which will be run by the Milan-based Media Partners 
International, one of the world's biggest sports marketing firms, 
and his Pele Sports &AMP; Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital would come from foreign investors, who would be given  
shares, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported Sunday.

<HEADLINE> New Strain of Catfish Developed / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEMOPOLIS, Ala. (AP) -- A new strain of catfish could improve  
life on the catfish farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The new catfish was genetically engineered for faster growth and  
more efficient use of feed, researchers said. It could be released 
to growers in Mississippi as early as January 2000, said Dr. Ed 
Robinson, coordinator of the Thad Cochran National Warmwater 
Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish, known as USDA 103, may also be released in Alabama  
through an agreement between the states, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, it grows faster, about 20 to 25 percent faster,  
than most strains,'' he said. The fish eats a lot of food but uses 
it more efficiently than other strains. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the fish can be released commercially, it must be  
certified, Robinson said. The release also may be delayed until 
more of the USDA 103 fish reach 3 years old because they spawn 
better then. 
</P>
<P>
	That was only part of the good news for catfish farmers  
attending a recent forum sponsored by the Alabama Catfish Producers 
organization and the Alabama Fish Farming Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Catfish producers had a good 1998 season because feed prices  
remained low, said Hugh Warren, executive vice president of Catfish 
Farmers of America, based in Indianola, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren said Americans on average eat one pound of catfish per  
year, but that figure is expected to double in the next decade. 
Catfish sales have continued to expand at a pace well beyond the 
population growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for producers are ``pretty good but could be better,''  
said Dickie Odom, chairman of the Alabama Catfish Producers. He 
said some processors are paying 70 cents a pound at the pond site. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the biggest problems growers encounter are disease and  
birds. New vaccines are being created to control catfish diseases 
that cost farmers millions of dollars per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Research also is under way to battle birds that attack the fish,  
said Frank Boyd, director of the U.S Agriculture Department's 
Wildlife Services facility in Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of research is going on and more and more ways will be  
used to combat (birds),'' Boyd said. Several scare devices are 
being marketed, ranging from firecrackers to propane gas cannons 
set to go off at intervals, he said. 
</P>

	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's orange harvest is expected to be  
192 million boxes for the 1998-99 season, 2 million boxes less than 
an earlier prediction by federal forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the estimate for frozen concentrated orange juice rose to a  
record 1.62 gallons per 90-pound box, up from 1.6 gallons expected 
in February, according to Florida Citrus Mutual, a 12,000-member 
growers' organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department revised the February orange-crop  
estimate of 194 million boxes last week after realizing that nearly 
all the state's early and mid-season oranges had been picked and 
made into juice, Florida Mutual said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the early midseason crop is harvested and processed,  
estimating the amount of fruit actually utilized becomes more 
exact,'' organization President Andy LaVigne noted. ``The 
adjustment is a bookkeeping change for this time of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Citrus Mutual predicts that processors will pack 173.2  
million gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice, up from the 
172.7 million gallons forecast in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida oranges seem to be juicier because we've had  
relatively little adverse weather this winter, LaVigne said. 
``Though it's been dry, growers have irrigated regularly to keep 
their groves in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal forecasters also reduced the state's grapefruit estimate  
by 1 million boxes to 49 million boxes, and the tangelo estimate to 
2.6 million boxes. The early tangerine estimate grew by 50,000 
boxes, to 3.05 million boxes.

<HEADLINE> Fire Closes Part of Fla. Interstate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Two brush fires burned 1,600 acres on  
Sunday, shutting down the main road across the Everglades before 
rainfall helped douse the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The blazes damaged up to 10 houses and about 200 more structures  
were in danger. Residents were asked to voluntarily evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters battling the southern Florida blaze suffered  
second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain put a damper on the fire,'' said Lt. Paul France of  
the Florida Highway Patrol in Naples. ``It knocked it down enough 
to give firefighters a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 75 -- the main road across  
the Florida Everglades commonly called Alligator Alley -- was shut 
down for about eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The two fires were on either side of the highway, one burning  
1,300 acres, the other 300 acres. About 600 firefighters from five 
Florida counties spent the day fighting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	There was zero visibility in the area due to smoke, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know the cause,'' said Terence McElroy, spokesman  
for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 
``We're still investigating, but we're not aware of a natural 
cause.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Disagree on Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dissatisfied with the Clinton administration's  
handling of the Chinese grab for U.S. weapons technology, several 
members of Congress are pressing for greater disclosure and a 
closer look at high-tech relations between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is holding hearings this week on an alleged 1980s  
case of Chinese spying at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons 
laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., that only recently came to light. 
In the House, members are demanding that nearly all of a classified 
700-page report on technology transfers to China be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials stood their ground Sunday, saying they  
have dealt properly with the Los Alamos case and overall security 
threats to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we moved swiftly and I think we continue to impose on  
China the strictest controls,'' national security adviser Sandy 
Berger said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said President Clinton should  
appoint a nonpartisan commission to investigate allegations that 
China stole nuclear warhead technology. The Justice Department 
``does not have credibility on this issue'' because Attorney 
General Janet Reno refused to seek an independent counsel 
investigation into illegal campaign contributions originating in 
China, he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., told NBC that the spy case called for a  
serious review of U.S.-China policy, including a warning to China 
that a missile attack on Taiwan would be met with U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans said they would fight administration  
resistance to make public almost all of the report on technology 
transfers prepared by a special panel headed by Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to have a vote of the House in order to  
declassify that report, and when the American people see what's in 
it, I think they will be really outraged,'' House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week,'' said his panel believes  
that ``not only now but for the indefinite future we have serious 
counterintelligence problems at our national laboratories and 
elsewhere throughout the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Norm Dicks of  
Washington, said the most important finding was that for 20 years 
``we had a major counterintelligence failure at Los Alamos and at 
the other national labs that is now being corrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwanese-born computer scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from  
his job at Los Alamos a week ago amid suspicions that he leaked 
secrets to the Chinese in the 1980s. Lee has not been charged with 
any crime, and Newsweek magazine said the FBI now believes it has 
virtually no chance of making a case against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began its investigation in 1996, and Republicans have  
accused the administration of dragging its feet in acting against 
Lee in the interests of U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, appearing on NBC and CNN's  
``Late Edition,'' insisted the administration acted swiftly and 
responsibly. ``I took (Lee's) clearance away, I moved him away from 
sensitive areas long before the story broke,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Energy Department since 1997 has doubled the  
intelligence budget at the national labs, initiated strong 
background checks of scientists from sensitive countries and 
required employees to take polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
	National security adviser Berger said there was ``no question''  
that the Chinese did benefit from the flow of nuclear technology in 
the 1980s that is now subject to strict controls. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said the spying allegations must be seen in the  
context of China's cooperation in such areas as stopping the sales 
of weapons to countries including Iran and dealing with North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most countries are engaged in efforts to obtain American  
sensitive information by clandestine means,'' Berger added. ``The 
world is not a playpen here.''

<HEADLINE> No Decision on NFL Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- NFL owners put off a decision on whether to award  
its next franchise to Los Angeles or Houston, but there were 
indications Los Angeles is the choice. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on the league's 32nd team is to be made Tuesday or  
Wednesday. A combined meeting of the finance and expansion 
committees on Sunday stopped short of a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most we're going to get of this week's meeting is the  
selection of a city,'' league spokesman Joe Browne said. ``We're 
not going to get a stadium site or an ownership group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That in itself was a hint that Los Angeles is leading in the  
battle for a team by two cities abandoned by the Rams, Raiders and 
Oilers during the mid-1990s franchise free-agency boom. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the league seems satisfied with Houston's  
stadium and its owner, Robert McNair. Browne later amended his 
comment that no site or owner would be picked to say ``... unless 
it's Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while the new city will need 24 of 31 votes to be chosen,  
the consensus seems to be it will be Los Angeles, the larger 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups there are vying for the franchise. One is headed by  
Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and would build a stadium in Carson, 
south of Los Angeles Airport; the other is headed by Edward Roski 
and would renovate Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's move came a day after the finance committee put off a  
decision on the proposed $800 million purchase of the Washington 
Redskins by Howard Milstein, which still needs league approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The item of the most general interest this week will be a vote  
on the return of instant replay, which probably won't take until 
late Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay proposal under discussion would give coaches two  
challenges per game with extra challenges in the final two minutes 
of each half to be determined by a replay official in the press 
box. The final decision will be made on the field, by the referee. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of officiating problems, replay seems to have a  
better chance this year than any since 1992, when it was voted out 
after being in effect for six seasons.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon ``Lee'' Falk, the creator of the comic  
strips ``Mandrake the Magician'' and ``The Phantom, died Saturday 
of congestive heart failure. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk was a college student when he conceived ``Mandrake the  
Magician,'' about a hypnotist who used his powers to fight crime. 
The strip, which first appeared in 1934 and has been drawn by Fred 
Fredericks since 1965, is still syndicated in 125 newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1936, Falk developed ``The Phantom,'' which follows the  
exploits of a costumed superhero. The strip runs in than 500 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	After working in secret intelligence with the Office of War  
Information during World War II, Falk returned to playwriting and 
theatrical production. For many years he was the owner of summer 
theaters in Massachusetts and a winter theater in Nassau in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk produced more than 300 plays and directed about 100 others,  
featuring stars such as Dame May Whitty in ``Night Must Fall'' and 
Charlton Heston in ``Bell, Book and Candle.'' 
</P>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nieson Himmel, an eccentric newsroom  
character who rubbed elbows with gangsters and celebrities while 
covering every major Los Angeles crime story since World War II, 
died Saturday of pneumonia-related complications. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reporter had been off work since February,  
after he collapsed in the newsroom on the way to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned his reputation in the 1940s and 1950s covering the  
infamous Black Dahlia murder and the shooting of gangster Bugsy 
Siegel during his 22-year tenure with the now-defunct Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	During the late '40s, Himmel befriended everyone from gangsters  
and call girls to con men and cops, often arriving at crime scenes 
before police and occasionally knocking back drinks with his 
sources when the night was through. 
</P>
<P>
	Himmel left the Herald-Examiner during a strike in the 1960s and  
worked for the City News Service before joining the Times in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Himmel spent most nights at his desk in recent years, monitoring  
police and fire department scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-7 reporter weighed close to 300 pounds and was  
described in a Times obituary as a newsroom ``Buddha-figure'' who 
listened comfortably from his chair as dispatchers barked out ``the 
nightly mayhem.''

	Born in Trenton, Lewis worked at the newspaper from 1951 until  
1983, when he retired. He worked as a reporter, Sunday editor,

</P>
<P>
	He later edited the business and education pages, and also wrote  
editorials.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Wins Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- It's been nine years since Carl Nafzger  
won the Kentucky Derby with Unbridled on his first attempt. On 
Sunday, he was feeling pretty good about his second Derby 
contender, Vicar. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not having fun now, you're in trouble,'' Nafzger  
said the morning after Vicar held off Wondertross by a nose to win 
the $750,000 Florida Derby, one of the major steppingstones to the 
May 1 Kentucky Derby. ``This has been a lot of fun, and we're going 
to have a lot more fun now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar will be shipped to Churchill Downs on March 19, where the  
3-year-old son of Wild Again will prep for the Blue Grass Stakes at 
Keeneland on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can only be one winner; we have a horse in there, and we  
know it'll be competitive,'' Nafzger said as he stood in front of 
his barn and watched a playful Vicar munch on a cinnamon raisin 
bagel. ``He did what we wanted him to. He dictated and he 
relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger allowed Vicar to trot a mile around the track Sunday  
morning, just to ``clean out his system'' after winning a 
four-horse stretch battle that also included third-place finisher 
Cat Thief and fourth-place finisher Certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he'll just walk for a few days,'' the trainer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger plans to keep on smiling until the next test for his  
gutsy colt. In his previous race, Vicar edged Cat Thief by a neck 
in the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondertross, who finished second despite a tough trip over the  
1 1/8 miles, is being pointed toward a rematch with Vicar in the Blue 
Grass, trainer Nick Zito said. Wondertross is co-owned by New York 
Yankees boss George Steinbrenner and William Condren. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas said third-place finisher Cat Thief would  
also go in the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Grits'n Hard Toast, who finished ninth in the field of 10 colts  
and geldings, bled and developed a lung infection, trainer T.V. 
Smith said Sunday. He will be sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, who finished sixth, is also trained by Zito, who said  
the Ernie Paragallo-owned colt would run next in the Wood Memorial 
at Aqueduct on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vicar, a winner in four of six career starts, stamped  
himself as south Florida 's top 3- year-old, the James Tafel-owned 
colt may not be the top Derby prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert, trying to win an unprecedented third straight  
Kentucky Derby, has at least six top Derby contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	At Santa Anita on Saturday, Baffert's duo of Prime Timber and  
Exploit finished 1-2 in the San Felipe Stakes; and his filly, 
Silverbulletday, won the Fair Ground Oaks in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's Louisiana Derby, 21-1 shot Kimberlite Pipe was the  
upset winner, with Answer Lively second, Ecton Park third and 
Baffert's General Challenge fifth after breaking poorly from the 
gate. Later Sunday, Baffert's filly Excellent Meeting won in the 
Santa Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, ridden by Shane Sellers, went off as the co-second choice  
with Wondertross at 9-2, while Cat Thief was the 9-5 favorite. And 
before Sellers left the jockey's room to climb aboard Vicar, he 
glanced at the odds board at saw his colt was 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was looking at the wrong horse,'' Sellers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, racing just off a slow pace, caught leaders Cat Thief and  
Certain at the top of the stretch, and finally grabbed the lead six 
strides from the finish. Then, he withstood Wondertross' gallant 
effort on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain, third in the Fountain of Youth, was fourth, followed by  
First American, Adonis, Aly's Alley, Casanova Star, Grits'n Hard 
Toast and Valid Trefaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain will run next in either the Blue Grass or Arkansas  
Derby, while Aly's Alley is set to go in the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three finishers in the Florida Derby all have Kentucky  
Derby winning trainers. Nafzger's Unbridled won the Derby in 1990; 
Zito won with Strike the Gold (1991) and Go for Gin (1994), and 
Lukas won with Winning Colors (1988), Thunder Gulch (1995) and 
Grindstone (1996).

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Gain on Nissan News / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks gained early Monday, boosted by a  
surge in Nissan Motor's share price on speculation that France's 
Renault was close to purchasing a stake in the automaker. The U.S. 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 70.13 points,  
or 0.45 percent, to close the morning session at 15,558.99 points. 
On Friday, the average closed down 13.28 points, or 0.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.27 yen in early trading, down 0.77 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
118.78 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.70 yen, down  
from 131.35 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started lower after the  
government released data Friday showing that Japan's economy shrank 
0.8 percent in the October-December quarter of 1998, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers were worse than economists had predicted and marked  
the fifth straight quarter -- the first time ever -- that Japan's 
gross domestic product had contracted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market recovered as troubled Nissan Motor's share price  
surged 46 yen ($0.39), or 11.5 percent, to 447 yen ($3.75) on 
speculation that the company is close to a tie-up with Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would allow the French auto maker to take a stake of up  
to 40 percent in Nissan and supply three board members. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nissan Motor said in a statement that the two  
companies were studying the possibility of a deal, but that no 
formal proposal for an alliance had been received from Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a deal is also helping shares of Nissan  
Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Nissan gets off the hook and can reduce its debt through  
capital from Renault, it will be in more of a position to help 
Nissan Diesel,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine 
Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 0.62 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,196.23 
points. The TOPIX closed down 0.57 points, or 0.05 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar remained under  
selling pressure against the yen after the Japanese currency moved 
higher against the euro on Friday, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> EU Faces Tough Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Even without their controversial  
chairman, European Union finance ministers face a tough meeting 
Monday when such treasured European institutions as duty-free 
shopping and farm subsidies come under renewed attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise resignation Thursday of outspoken German Finance  
Minister Oskar Lafontaine left the Monday's meeting leaderless. It 
was unclear if Lafontaine's successor Hans Eichel, Economics 
Minister Werner Mueller or another German official will hold the 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine's departure came at a crucial moment in Germany's  
six-month presidency of the EU, as the Union grapples with plans to 
overhaul its finances ahead of a planned expansion into Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance ministers will grapple with a tangled dispute over  
sharing out the EU's $93.5 billion annual budget ahead of a March 
24-25 summit in Berlin, where EU leaders have to thrash out an 
accord on EU spending for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Central to that debate is a reform of EU farm spending which  
currently eats up half the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture ministers from the 15 nations clinched an outline  
deal Thursday that cuts subsidized farm prices by up to 20 percent, 
but provides compensation for farmers that in the short term will 
inflate farm spending. Under this plan, the EU agriculture bill 
would be about $344 billion from 2000 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	That has angered some belt-tightening finance ministries.  
``There will be serious pressure for agriculture spending to come 
down again,'' said one national treasury official involved in the 
negotiations. ``The agriculture ministers will not have the final 
word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials warned hopes of reaching an agreement in Berlin  
will be jeopardized if finance ministers or the leaders themselves 
start to pick holes in the farm deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, Germany and France also will have another go Monday at  
saving duty-free shopping within the EU, but officials from those 
nations acknowledge time is running out for the popular traveler's 
perk. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 EU nations voted eight years ago to abolish duty-free  
shopping for travelers crossing between EU nations. It goes into 
effect June 30. Most governments have since changed their minds but 
they need unanimity to overturn the decision and Denmark refuses to 
grant a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	If the finance ministers fail to agree on a stay of execution  
for duty free, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to 
make a last ditch attempt to save it at the Berlin summit.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Probe Finds IOC Breaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney's successful bid for the 2000  
Olympics involved numerous breaches of IOC guidelines, an 
independent auditor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Sheridan criticized the IOC rules governing bids, saying  
they were ``unworkable and have fallen into disrepute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The guidelines are unclear and ambiguous in many respects,''  
Sheridan told a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight said he was pleased with  
Sheridan's investigation into about 3,000 documents related to the 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sheridan report shows there is no comparison between what  
occurred in relation to the Salt Lake City bid and what Sydney did 
to win the 2000 Games,'' Knight said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sheridan and his team compiled a warts and all report, I'm  
glad there weren't too many warts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said breaches of the IOC guidelines included the value  
of gifts given to IOC delegates, the duration of visits, the number 
of overseas trips made by Sydney bid members to lobby IOC officials 
and assistance in finding jobs for delegates' families. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said under the guidelines Sydney needed to give IOC  
delegates ``red carpet treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they didn't, ``they may not have necessarily achieved that  
objective,'' of winning the Games.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Wound 6 at Soccer Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A masked gunman being driven on a  
motorcycle opened fire at a youth soccer game in Dublin on Sunday, 
wounding six people, police and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said as many as five players in the amateur game at  
Clondalkin on the city's suburban west side were wounded. Four 
people were hospitalized, but police said none faced 
life-threatening injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the nearby Clondalkin Sports Center said the  
attacker was carrying a shotgun, and appeared to fire at random at 
people on the field and sidelines near the conclusion of the match. 
The motorcycle's driver also wore a mask. 
</P>
<P>
	Police declined to speculate on a possible motive, but  
discounted the possibility that the attack could have been related 
to Northern Ireland terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many other predominantly working-class districts of Dublin,  
Clondalkin suffers from criminal feuding, principally over drug 
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Disagree on Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration conceded Sunday the  
Chinese gained from technology allegedly stolen from a federal 
nuclear weapons lab but insisted the government has responded 
decisively. Republicans disagreed and pressed for a comprehensive 
review of U.S. policy toward China. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very dangerous situation involving international  
espionage that directly threatens the security of all Americans,'' 
said Sen. John McCain, a GOP presidential hopeful. McCain, R-Ariz., 
said President Clinton should appoint a panel to investigate 
charges that China stole nuclear warhead technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senior GOP senator, Dick Lugar of Indiana, recommended a  
``very serious review'' of the country's China policy. Lugar also 
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that the United States should make 
clear to China that it will defend Taiwan from a Chinese missile 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, represented by Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson and the president's national security adviser, Sandy 
Berger, said the Chinese did benefit from the leak of information 
in the 1980s from the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Berger said on NBC, ``I think we moved swiftly and I think  
we continue to impose on China the strictest controls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the administration had doubled the security  
budget for the national labs, instigated strong background checks 
for scientists visiting the labs from sensitive countries, and 
subjected employees to polygraphs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected spy, Taiwanese-born American scientist Wen Ho Lee,  
has been questioned by the FBI and fired from his job. He has not 
been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, seizing on the Los Alamos case, contend anew that  
Clinton's policy seriously has been tainted by alleged illegal 
campaign contributions and the transfer of satellite technology 
that may have been used by the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
	A special congressional commission headed by Rep. Christopher  
Cox, R-Calif., has put together a still-classified report said to 
take strong issue with the administration's technology transfer 
policies to China. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, on ``Fox News Sunday,''  
said the report would show ``an overwhelming shift in policy by 
this administration that a lot of technology was transferred to 
China, not just through espionage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report is scheduled to be released in several weeks. But the  
committee, which wants to make almost all of it public, and the 
administration are negotiating over what should be declassified. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said the committee ``believes that  
not only now but for the indefinite future we have serious 
counterintelligence problems at our national laboratories and 
elsewhere throughout the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree,'' Richardson said on ABC. ``I believe we have  
taken some dramatic steps to deal with this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest edition of Time magazine reports that Lee, who worked  
at Los Alamos for more than two decades, attended a 1988 seminar in 
Hong Kong and, with Chinese officials present, allegedly divulged 
sensitive information on the miniaturization involved in the design 
of America's most modern warhead, the W-88. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, in a report Sunday, quoted law  
enforcement officials as saying the investigation had ``hit a 
wall'' because of lack of hard evidence and Lee's refusal to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration first became aware of possible espionage at  
Los Alamos in 1996. Republicans have asked why it took so long to 
investigate the case and remove Lee from his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should have been a fire bell in the night,'' GOP  
commentator Pat Buchanan, another presidential aspirant, said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone has to explain that and someone has to be held  
accountable,'' said Buchanan, who says Berger should lose his job 
over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But other Republicans put the matter in a different perspective.  
</P>
<P>
	``These lapses go back to the beginning of time,'' Rep. Porter  
Goss, R-Fla., the head of the House intelligence committee, said on 
Fox. ``Pearl Harbor was perhaps one of our biggest lapses.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Making a Name for Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Listen to coach Dan Monson: ``It's pronounced  
Gone-ZAG-uh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a name college basketball fans across America are learning  
to love. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zags, best known as the alma mater of John Stockton and Bing  
Crosby, were the darlings of Seattle, knocking off Minnesota in the 
first round, then stunning Stanford, the West's No. 2 seed, 82-74 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team from across the Cascades in Spokane, Wash., the No.  
10 seed, heads to Phoenix and a regional semifinal game Thursday 
against Florida. Gators coach Billy Donovan already is wary. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this may be the best team that we will go against as  
far as handling, passing and catching the basketball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are just the attributes that are necessary to combat the  
incessant pressure that Florida used to wear down upstart Weber 
State 82-74 in overtime on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that at this point in time seeding does not make  
a difference. Who's supposed to win and who's not supposed to win, 
you can throw that out the window,'' Donovan said. ``The teams that 
are still alive are good basketball teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga (27-6) had played exactly one NCAA tournament game  
before this year. But coach Don Monson had argued all week that 
this was a special team, a team that needn't feel overwhelmed 
against any opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a fluke situation for our team,'' Monson said.  
``Our kids believed they were going to win that game. I've said 
that all year. We haven't gone into a game this season where our 
kids didn't think they were going to win. And that's a really hard 
mentality to get in when it says Gonzaga on your jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 players that Monson used on Sunday contributed  
significantly. The Bulldogs' front line was overmatched on paper, 
but Gonzaga outrebounded Stanford 47-33. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Santangelo, the savvy guard who is sort of a co-playmaker,  
scored 22 points. Richie Frahm, the best of a stable of 
sharpshooters, had an off day from the field but still had 15 
points and seven rebounds -- and was 8-for-9 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Bahamian point guard Quentin Hall, who scored all  
15 of his points in the second half and grabbed a team-high eight 
rebounds. His 3-pointer with 3 1/2 minutes to play was the decisive 
dagger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quentin Hall has been the difference in this program the last  
couple of years,'' Monson said. ``In my 11 years at Gonzaga, he is 
the best competitor we ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs are using their snub by the NCAA last year as  
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a yearlong journey for us,'' Santangelo said.  
``Every day, that was our thought process. You want to be in this 
tournament. You want to have success. That's all culminating right 
now, all that hard work and dedication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Florida (22-8), the No. 6 seed, Gonzaga faces a team  
that is just flexing its muscles in its third season under Donovan, 
who learned the constant-pressure style when he played for Rick 
Pitino at Providence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators count heavily on four freshmen, most notably guard  
Teddy Dupay and Mike Miller, but no one appreciates the trip to 
Phoenix more than seniors Eddie Shannon and Greg Stolt, who endured 
three losing seasons before this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great shot to go even farther,'' Shannon said. ``I  
don't want to stop at the Sweet 16 Right now, I'm having the time 
of my life. And I just know with the talent and potential on this 
team, I don't want to stop in Phoenix.''

<HEADLINE> Clinical Trial Gives New Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The little girl howled as though she were being  
tortured, the way kids sometimes do at the doctor's. 
</P>
<P>
	And indeed Dr. Lawrence Schachner was scraping and poking the  
raw patches and red sores all over Samantha Sheridan's body. But he 
was working to ease the torment that's part of her life with a 
congenital, incurable disease that renders skin so fragile the 
slightest friction can break it. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was all over, the 4-year-old from Tampa sat quietly in  
her red Elmo slippers -- and her new skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha was one of 17 people who got patches of  
laboratory-grown skin March 8. They are participants in a clinical 
trial of Apligraf, as the product is known commercially, in the 
treatment of epidermolysis bullosa, or EB. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, doctors at the University of Miami/Jackson  
Children's Hospital tested the skin, which was developed for leg 
ulcers, on 8-week-old Tori Cameron. She did so well they decided to 
try it with others, who came from all around the country as well as 
Brazil and Ecuador, after getting news of Tori's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had hundreds and hundreds of calls,'' Schachner said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also applied the waxy-looking grafts to Yesenia Candelaria,  
2 1/2, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get rid of some skin that's not so good and give  
you some skin that is,'' he said. She whimpered a bit, but didn't 
cry -- perhaps because EB sufferers are used to pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act of being born is enough to cause blistering,''  
explained Schachner, who added that, until now, the main way to 
treat EB was to try to avoid hurting the skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Apligraf is grown with cells from the foreskins of circumcised  
babies placed in beds of cow collagen. Each of the patches used 
Monday costs $975, according to Dr. Anna Falabella, but was donated 
by the manufacturer, Organogenesis Inc. of Canton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab-grown skin has no pigment or immune cells to cause the  
recipient to reject it. It eventually takes on the coloration of 
the skin around it. In return, doctors hope it will teach the 
surrounding skin how to bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Van Dyne, a 33-year-old nurse from Pittsburgh, said the  
process hurt a little, but ``It's not any worse than what you go 
through every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She left on crutches, protecting a freshly grafted foot and  
excited at the prospect of a more normal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to be able to go on vacation and not spend the last two  
days of your vacation crawling around,'' Van Dyne said. ``Any 
change in climate, it really aggravates the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had no doubts at all about becoming involved in the  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a cure,'' she said. ``I told them I'd do  
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Smoking, Adult Crime Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers examining the relationship between  
mothers who smoke and their child's adult behavior say babies of 
smokers could be at a higher risk of turning into criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such links have been studied in children and  
teen-agers, researchers say a study published in this month's 
Archives of General Psychiatry is the first to examine the 
relationship between mothers who smoke and the actions of their 
mature offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	While stopping short of saying that babies whose mothers smoked  
while pregnant will become criminals, researchers say their 
findings are significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results support our hypothesis that maternal smoking  
during pregnancy is related to increased rates of crime in adult 
offspring,'' the authors wrote, adding that the results ``suggest 
an additional critical reason to support public health efforts 
aimed at improving maternal health behaviors during pregnancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However an expert not involved in the study said there is not  
enough research to say that prenatal smoking can be risk factor for 
adult crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers from Emory University in Atlanta, the University  
of Southern California and the Institute of Preventive Medicine in 
Denmark based their findings on data for 4,169 males born in 
Copenhagen between September 1959 and December 1961 and studied the 
men's arrest histories at age 34. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cigarettes their mothers had smoked during the  
third trimester of pregnancy affected the men's arrests for 
nonviolent and violent crimes as adults, even after factoring out 
other possible causes such as alcohol use, divorce, income and home 
environment, researchers said in the study, which was released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other risk factor -- delivery complications -- was found  
to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that more than a quarter of the men whose  
mothers had the highest levels of smoking and delivery 
complications were arrested for a violent crime as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Further study should be aimed at determining the effects of  
smoking on the brain of developing fetuses and to see if specific 
agents in tobacco smoke can be more directly linked to antisocial 
behavior, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Patricia Brennan, the study's lead author and  
a researcher at Emory's Department of Psychology, could not be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Fergusson, a psychiatric epidemiologist at the  
Christchurch School of Medicine in New Zealand, said there is not 
enough research to add prenatal smoking to the list of established 
risk factor for adult crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fergusson, who wrote an editorial accompanying the article, said  
the study did not rule out the possibility that genetics -- not 
smoking -- caused behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mothers who smoke during pregnancy are often young women who  
have previous misconduct problems and there is quite an 
inheritability of misconduct problems,'' Fergusson said in a 
telephone interview Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Skinner Stripped of Busch Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- NASCAR has stripped Mike Skinner of the  
victory in the Yellow Freight 300 Busch Grand National race after 
discovering an unapproved engine part on his winning Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule under which Skinner, a winner Saturday, will have to  
give up the victory, states: ``All Cylinder heads must be NASCAR 
approved and all modifications must be submitted to NASCAR before 
any proposed modifications will be eligible for approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner's team has filed an appeal, and NASCAR was expected to  
consider it after series officials return Monday to their 
headquarters in Daytona Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling stands, second-year Busch Series driver Dave  
Blaney, a former World of Outlaws sprint car champion, will be the 
winner. Skinner beat Blaney to the finish line by almost a full 
straightaway on the 1.54-mile Atlanta Motor Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy for Dave Blaney, but he didn't win the race  
yesterday,'' Skinner said. ``We had a great engine and I'm sure 
there was no way they would have put anything in there that could 
be questioned because they knew we were likely to be looked at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unapproved cylinder head was discovered during a routine  
post-race inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Busch Series driver to have a win taken away was Dale  
Jarrett, whose engine was ruled illegal after apparently winning a 
race at Michigan Speedway in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nissan, Renault Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,  
and Renault SA of France have agreed on a broad outline to forge a 
business alliance, a local media report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reached an agreement on the outline of the alliance, among  
other things,'' Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa told Nikkei News 
in an interview following his return Sunday from talks with Renault 
officials in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hanawa was quoted as saying key elements of the deal remain  
uncertain, such as the size of the equity stake his debt-burdened 
company may sell to Renault. He also reportedly said some members 
of Renault's board have yet to agree to linking up with Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not provide details on the accord.  
</P>
<P>
	Following the negotiations this weekend between Hanawa and  
Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer, the two companies were widely 
reported to be on the verge of a deal giving the French firm about 
a one-third stake in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Nissan spokesman Keiichi Tsuboi said Monday he could  
not comment on the content or progress of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, however, was quoted in an interview with Japanese  
national broadcaster NHK as saying that a tie-up agreement will be 
announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault will decide on Tuesday the size of the stake it will  
take in Nissan, the report said. It is believed to be considering 
taking a 33.4 percent share in the Japanese automaker -- large 
enough to give Renault the right to veto major decisions made in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	A final agreement was expected to be announced Tuesday, Kyodo  
News agency said Monday, quoting unnamed industry sources. The 
Asahi newspaper reported in its Monday evening edition that Renault 
would probably invest about $4.19 billion in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	That would amount to roughly 40 percent of its outstanding  
shares, based on Nissan's current stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of Nissan's negotiations with the French automaker  
picked up last Wednesday after its equity talks with 
DaimlerChrysler AG collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors  
Service said it lowered its rating for Nissan's long-term debt 
because of the company's staggering debt load, estimated at $21 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has lost money in five of the past six years and saw its  
U.S. sales decline 14 percent last year -- the largest drop of any 
automaker.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Bulls Thrive on Adversity / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the great bull market on Wall Street has made  
its run toward Dow 10,000, it has impressed many analysts with its 
staying power in the face of a rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term rates in the bond market recently jumped to their  
highest levels since last summer, dealing prices of U.S. Treasury 
bonds one of the sharpest one-month setbacks they have suffered in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on 30-year Treasuries jumped half a percentage point in  
four weeks to about 5.7 percent, a full point above where they 
stood in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts speculated that a strong U.S. economy, and budding  
recoveries in many parts of Asia from the recent debt and currency 
woes there, might start to put sustained upward pressure on 
inflation and interest rates around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	That, it's said, could force the Federal Reserve to lean toward  
a tighter credit policy, and perhaps encourage some of the 
international investors huddled together for safety in U.S. 
investments to begin taking their money elsewhere in search of 
bolder opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	But after pausing for a few weeks to consider such  
possibilities, stock-market investors have recently gone back to 
buying, pushing the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average to new 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the stock market by and large has done extremely well  
dealing with the roadblocks in its way this year,'' says Greg 
Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``That stocks haven't reacted more negatively to the rise in  
bond yields is somewhat surprising,'' observes Wright Investors' 
Service of Bridgeport, Conn., in its latest bulletin to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Asian contagion has hit hard at some areas of the  
U.S. economy, such as agriculture and other commodity-producing 
businesses. At the same time, however, consumers and many producers 
of finished goods and services appear to have benefited from the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever fears persisted of an economy-wide slump in this  
country seem to have been dispelled this winter. Talk has lately 
shifted to the problems that might arise as worldwide demand and 
economic activity strengthens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The probabilities have shifted,'' says Byron Wien, portfolio  
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``If the pace of the 
economy stays strong, it is possible, even likely, that the Federal 
Reserve will tighten later this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet stock prices have lately forged ahead with renewed power.  
The way some optimists see it, the much-ballyhooed ``Goldilocks'' 
economy seems to have succeeded once again in maintaining the 
not-too-hot, not-too-cold pace that has kept the bull market all 
through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not believe the depression and deflation case six  
months ago,'' observes Thomas Galvin, U.S. strategist at Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp., ``and we do not subscribe to a 
global synchronized recovery and reflation case today. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our opinion, reality is somewhere in between these  
emotional extremes, and better profits with continued low inflation 
are what valuations need more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent upward pressure on bond rates should ease, Galvin argues,  
and economic growth throttle down to a more sustainable pace. 
``Inflation palpitations should moderate,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, says Stephen Quickel, editor of the newsletter U.S.  
Investment Report, ``U.S. stocks remain in a bull phase that is 
nowhere close to ending. The economy is strong and soundly managed. 
American companies are leaner and more competitive than ever 
before. And technology marches on, providing continuing 
economy-wide productivity gains.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis-Holyfield Has Boxing Beat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They don't get pay per view in the Montgomery  
County jail in Maryland, where the man who remains the biggest 
heavyweight attraction is incarcerated for beating up a couple of 
people after a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	If they did, Mike Tyson might be wondering just how far he's  
slipped as he watched the man who beat him to the point of a near 
mental breakdown somehow escape from Madison Square Garden with two 
pieces of the heavyweight title still intact. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight fight, Evander Holyfield looked a lot  
like the aging fighter he is as Lennox Lewis pretty much had his 
way with him for 12 rounds before some kindness from the ringside 
judges rescued him with a draw early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it is heavyweight boxing itself that might need some  
rescuing after a night that was supposed to crown an undisputed 
champion gave way to a dawn where the titles are still muddled and 
mediocrity threatens to rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the heads of the three major boxing organizations came to  
that realization Sunday when they met and agreed to order a rematch 
for the undisputed title within six months. But even that might not 
help after the first fight failed to produce a thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	With Holyfield exposed and Tyson jailed, boxing must search anew  
for a heavyweight king just when it seemed that the first fight to 
unify the three titles in seven years might do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't figure to be Lewis, who did plenty enough to beat  
Holyfield. But once again he couldn't find it in himself to put the 
finishing touches on a nice fight plan by taking it out of the 
hands of the three judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to fall for any sucker thing,'' the  
ever-cautious Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	And it sure doesn't figure to be Holyfield, who shocked the  
boxing world by giving Tyson a beating the first time they met and 
was well on his way to doing it a second time when Tyson decided to 
bite off a piece of his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Holyfield's performance against Lewis -- and his  
previous lackluster win over Vaughn Bean -- the two Tyson fights now 
look more like an aberration than an acclamation of Holyfield's 
belief that after 24 years of boxing he is getting better with age. 
</P>
<P>
	If ringside punching stats are to be believed, Holyfield got a  
draw even though he was credited with landing only 130 total 
punches to 348 for Lewis. For much of the fight, Holyfield looked 
old and slow, seemingly perplexed on how to get inside on his 
bigger opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	In six rounds, Holyfield landed fewer than 10 punches -- and  
still won the fight by two rounds on the card of judge Jean 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight I had problems,'' Holyfield admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	Though promoter Don King and the boxing organizations want a  
rematch, it's doubtful many in the sellout crowd of 21,284 would 
again want to pay the $100 to $1,500 they eagerly coughed up for 
what was billed as the biggest New York heavyweight fight since 
Muhammad Ali met Joe Frazier in the same ring 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With a rematch, Holyfield won't have to fight a mandatory  
defense against Henry Akinwande, the WBA's top-ranked contender. 
And Lewis will miss a fight against the likes of like John Ruiz, 
the No. 1-ranked contender to his WBC title, though that bout would 
also draw yawns from anyone outside England. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course there is Tyson, who remains a huge draw despite his  
obviously declining skills. Tyson's comeback was in doubt even 
before he was sent back to jail. A lumbering Francois Botha had his 
way with him until Tyson struck with a right hand in the fifth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Tyson gets out of jail on schedule this summer, he most  
likely won't fight again until fall. It surely won't be against 
anyone of significance, as Tyson's handlers must be more concerned 
about rebuilding his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	That means boxing is left with a rematch that offers only  
limited appeal, and possibly Holyfield-Tyson III to look forward to 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	And the longer Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson keep fighting,  
the worse that fight looks, too. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sgt. Says Army Abandoned Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A year after his court-martial on sex charges  
ended in acquittal on all but one count, the former top enlisted 
man in the Army still thinks the military abandoned him in the face 
of bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene McKinney, former sergeant major of the Army and the first  
black to hold that post, is appealing his conviction on the charge 
of obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I equate this to a battlefield,'' he said in his first  
extensive interview since the trial, published Sunday in The Boston 
Globe. ``You ask me to go out on a battlefield and perform a 
mission and I get wounded and get left out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 48, is retired and looking for work outside the  
military for the first time in more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1997, a former aide accused McKinney of having tried  
to coerce her into having sex. Then five other women came forward 
claiming sexual harassment by McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a high-profile case that embarrassed the Army, coming a  
year after a major sex scandal at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney denied all the allegations and hinted that the charges  
were racially motivated -- he was black, all but one of his accusers 
were white. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted on the sex charges, but was convicted of  
obstruction of justice for a phone call he made to one of his 
accusers. In the call recorded two weeks after the Army began its 
investigation, McKinney told a young subordinate: ``Just tell them 
that we talked ... No inappropriateness at all, just that we 
talked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury busted McKinney's rank down to master sergeant and he  
requested retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyer, Charles Gittins, said he thinks he can prove  
the case was built on untruthful testimony. As part of McKinney's 
appeal, Gittins is pressing a freedom of information claim for 
documents he said were illegally concealed from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``In private interviews with Army prosecutors, witnesses were  
cross-examined and caught in lies and still sent to the witness 
stand,'' Gittins said. ``When Army prosecutors violate the law to 
obtain a conviction, they need to be held accountable. Since the 
Army won't do it, I'm going to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Lyonnais Privatization OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French government has authorized the  
privatization of the ailing Credit Lyonnais bank, the French 
Finance Ministry said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Lyonnais lost $3.7 billion between 1992 and 1994 and a  
state bailout package approved earlier this year cost French 
taxpayers nearly $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected announcement comes at a time of great turmoil in  
the French banking sector. Last week the Banque Nationale de Paris 
made a surprise $37.2 billion takeover bid for rivals Paribas SA 
and Societe Generale SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the privatization plan, the French government  
would maintain a 10 percent stake in Credit Lyonnais. Ten percent 
of the bank's shares already have been floated. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree calls for the creation of a core shareholder of  
institutional investors, who will be allowed to hold less than one 
third of the bank's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	After consultations with unions and employers, a ``significant  
share of capital'' of Credit Lyonnais will be made available to 
them. A subsequent stock offering will take place in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A limited number of potential partners for Credit Lyonnais are  
available, given the ongoing battle among Banque Nationale de 
Paris, Societe Generale and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Credit Agricole said Friday it will seek to participate in  
the privatization of Credit Lyonnais. French insurance company AXA 
and the German insurance company Allianz -- via its French 
subsidiary AGF -- also have expressed interest.

<HEADLINE> Residents May Buy Housing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Kelvin Cannon beams with pride as he shows a  
model apartment in the high-rise he and his fellow residents are 
aiming to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``See how much room there is?'' says Cannon, the building's  
resident maintenance man. ``Nice, huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the units are spacious, the real estate prime -- and the  
gunfire only occasional. 
</P>
<P>
	This is part of Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green housing  
project, a good chunk of which already has been torn down to make 
way for townhouses and duplexes that will begin springing up this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But residents of 1230 N. Burling, the building's address and de  
facto name, say they're not about to watch their 15-story, 134-unit 
building meet the wrecking ball and risk never getting one of those 
townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to buy the building -- and Chicago Housing Authority  
officials say they're likely to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve this shot,'' Ed Moses, the agency's deputy  
executive director, says of the resident managers who have been in 
charge of rent collection and upkeep since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses says they've developed a reputation for reliability, even  
as the neighborhood around them is known for heinous crime. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the 1992 death of young Dantrell Davis, who was  
struck by a sniper's bullet as he walked hand-in-hand with his 
mother to elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Little more than four years later, a 9-year-old who became known  
as Girl X was raped, forced to drink cockroach poison and left for 
dead in another Cabrini-Green building's dank stairwell -- with a 
gang-style pitchfork scrawled across her body. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a history most Chicagoans wouldn't mind seeing torn down  
and carted away. But Burling residents challenge anyone to drive 
past or walk through their building and not see glimmers of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all lit up at night. You won't see that at the other  
buildings,'' says Cora Moore, the head resident manager and the 
building's grandmother figure. ``The elevators are running. And we 
got heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents also have built a playground, planted flowers and kept  
the building's hallways and stairwells comparatively free of 
graffiti, broken lights and urine. They've been rewarded with 
millions of dollars worth of government-subsidized upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Cannon, a former gang member who's lived at Cabrini-Green most  
of his 35 years, says he's living proof of changes at the building 
he used to terrorize. He returned 10 years ago after spending seven 
years in prison for home invasion and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'God, let me back into the building to try to redeem  
myself,''' he says. ``Then Cora and the others got a hold of me and 
kept me away from trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the resident managers pay him $27,000 a year to maintain the  
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its proximity to downtown and ritzy Lincoln Park, the  
neighborhood is becoming a cultural battleground between low-income 
residents and people who own $300,000 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
	But even developer Peter Holsten, who'll build the new  
townhouses and duplexes, half of which are committed to low-income 
residents, insists he's not worried about the sooty Burling 
building sticking out like a sore thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the high-rises are just plain ugly,'' Holsten says.  
``But it's not the building -- it's the management. If the 
management does a good job, then you're OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of resident ownership isn't exactly new. During the  
Bush administration, it was pushed by then Housing Secretary Jack 
Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cynic could say it was the federal government just wanting  
to get out of the public housing business,'' says Bill Peterman, a 
geography professor and coordinator of the Fredrick Blum 
Neighborhood Assistance Center at Chicago State University, which 
provides technical assistance to public housing residents who want 
to manage their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then there's the thought that ... giving the residents the  
responsibility of owning will be a way to make previously 
unworkable housing work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While dozens of public housing projects nationwide are managed  
by residents, ownership programs have sputtered, with defaulted 
loans and public housing officials having to retake control. 
</P>
<P>
	But residents of 1230 N. Burling say they have a solid plan.  
</P>
<P>
	They're offering the city $50,000 for the building, using a  
40-year loan they propose to pay back with rent and a one-time 
residence fee. Housing officials estimate the building is worth at 
least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They're also promising to put remaining unemployed, able-bodied  
residents -- about half of the 90 lease-holders -- to work or find 
them jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, they're asking the federal government to subsidize  
maintenance costs for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertha Gilkey, a former public housing resident manager from St.  
Louis who's writing the Burling proposal, says the potential payoff 
makes the residents worth the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 10 years, the taxpayers are outta here,'' Gilkey says.  
``They won't have to pay a dime.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team To Play in US in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's national  
team will play a return game at Camden Yards on May 3 to complete 
their historic home-and-home exhibition series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it,''  
commissioner Bud Selig said while attending the Chicago Cubs' 
exhibition game against Seattle on Sunday. ``Baseball is the 
linchpin of the cultural exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. delegation headed by Sandy Alderson, the executive vice  
president of baseball operations in the commissioner's office, 
negotiated the return game during a three-day trip to Havana that 
ended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba already had agreed to have the Orioles play in Havana on  
March 28, the first time in 40 years a major league team will play 
in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos says his team will use a full  
strength lineup for its game in Havana, which comes eight days 
before Baltimore's season opener against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The return game at Camden Yards comes during an off day in a  
five-game homestand that has Minnesota and the Chicago White Sox 
visit Baltimore. The Orioles could be expected to add minor 
leaguers to their roster for that one, choosing to preserve their 
top pitchers for the games that count. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig plans to attend both games, and baseball officials are  
preparing for hundreds of reporters to attend the game in Havana, 
the first involving a major league team in Cuba since the 
Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers in March 1959. Cuban 
president Fidel Castro, who played baseball in his youth, is 
expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the games will be used mainly to support baseball  
and other sports in the two countries. The use of the money had 
been a sticking point in the negotiations because the Clinton 
administration did not want profits to go to Castro's government.

<HEADLINE> Billionaire Probes Man's Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife  
has a private investigator digging into the background of a man who 
killed himself in a bathroom outside Scaife's office, to see if he 
was being stalked by the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven R. Kangas, 37, who championed liberal causes with a Web  
site titled ``Liberalism Resurgent,'' died of a gunshot wound to 
the head on the 39th floor of One Oxford Center on Feb. 8. Scaife 
did not run into Kangas on the day of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last month, private investigator Rex Armistead of  
Mississippi has been traveling the country to investigate Kangas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said Scaife is interested whether  
Kangas was after him because Scaife funded conservative causes, 
including giving a magazine, the American Spectator, $1.8 million 
to investigate President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Scaife has questioned the finding of suicide in the death of  
White House aide and former Arkansas lawyer Vincent Foster. Scaife 
has said Foster's death is the ``Rosetta stone'' of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, where Scaife is publisher,  
reported that Kangas posted a message on the Internet six days 
before his death blaming Scaife for all of Clinton's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton is, in my mind, a moderate Republican, and it is only  
the insanity of Richard Mellon Scaife that is causing them to go 
after this man,'' Kangas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas' Web site also criticized Scaife, the Knights of Malta,  
and Washington Post Publisher Katharine Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas had recently sold his share of a gambling business in Las  
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 8, building engineer Don Adams checked a men's room down  
the hall from Scaife's office and found Kangas alive and lying on 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams asked ``Are you OK?'' and Kangas mumbled something in  
return, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams went for help, and when he returned he found Kangas seated  
on a toilet with a gunshot wound to the head, according to a police 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they found a pistol Kangas had bought two weeks  
earlier in Las Vegas. He had $14.63 in his pockets and his backpack 
contained 47 rounds of ammunition and a copy of Hitler's ``Mein 
Kampf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas' blood-alcohol level was 0.14 percent. In Pennsylvania, a  
driver is considered drunk at 0.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas' mother, Jan Lankheet, said One Oxford Center officials  
showed her a videotape indicating her son was in the building 
nearly nine hours before Adams found him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know if Steve was running or if he was after  
somebody,'' Lankheet said.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Peter Charged With DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Panthers defensive end Jason  
Peter was charged Sunday with driving while impaired, becoming the 
second of the team's top draft picks to face DWI charges in the 
past five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter was stopped on Interstate 77 near the Charlotte Coliseum  
at about 2:25 a.m. by State Highway Patrol Trooper J.A. Shively. 
Peter's black 1999 two-door Mercedes was clocked at 81 mph in a 55 
mph zone, Shively said Sunday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	After a field sobriety test, Peter was administered a breath  
test at the Mecklenburg County jail, where he registered a blood 
alcohol content of .12 percent, Shively said. A blood alcohol 
reading of .08 or more is considered evidence of impaired driving 
in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter was charged with speeding and driving while impaired,  
Shively said. He was released on a $1,200 unsecured bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter was alone in the vehicle and did not say where he had been  
before he was stopped, Shively said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was cooperative the entire time,'' the trooper said.  
</P>
<P>
	Peter has an unlisted home telephone number in the Charlotte  
area. His agent, Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh, did not immediately 
return a call left with his answering service Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman answering the phone at the home of Panthers spokesman  
Charlie Dayton said he was out of town and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers picked Peter -- a 6-foot-5, 290-pound All-American  
lineman from Nebraska -- with the 14th overall selection in last 
year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins was arrested Nov. 2  
after police said the car he was driving crossed the center line of 
a downtown Charlotte street. A hearing in Collins' drunken-driving 
case was postponed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest came about nine hours after his team, the New Orleans  
Saints, lost to the Panthers. Collins, the Panthers' first-ever 
draft pick in 1995, was cut last October after reportedly saying 
his heart was no longer into being Carolina's quarterback.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Killed at Waldorf Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Brazilian man who was staying at the opulent  
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel while on a gambling junket at Atlantic City 
was slashed to death in his room, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joao Saboia, 56, left the casinos on Friday with $50,000, police  
sources told Sunday's edition of the New York Post. Investigators 
found $1,300 in the room, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saboia's body was found in his hotel room late Saturday. He had  
been slashed in the throat. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found after Saboia failed to rendezvous with his  
companions for a return trip to Atlantic City and did not answer 
his door or phone, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waldorf-Astoria and the adjoining Waldorf Towers have been  
New York's premier hotel address for more than half a century. Long 
time residential guests included former President Herbert Hoover 
and World War II hero Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
	Other presidents, including Bill Clinton, often stay there on  
New York visits.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Cracks Down on Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian soldiers raided homes and  
searched boat passengers Sunday in a security crackdown on the 
island of Ambon to quell fighting between Christians and Muslims 
that has killed more than 200 people in less that two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their efforts, 15 houses were burned near a military  
hospital after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said a Muslim gang set fire to a home owned by  
Christians and the flames quickly spread to others owned by people 
of both religions. There were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fierce fighting erupted on Ambon in late January and spread to  
five other eastern islands in Maluku Province, which were known as 
the Spice Islands in Dutch colonial times. 
</P>
<P>
	Military authorities have filed charges against a security  
officer accused of fomenting sectarian rioting in recent weeks. The 
unidentified officer would face trial this week, Ambon's military 
police chief, Maj. Djuhendi, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen other members of the security forces have also  
been questioned since Muslim leaders accused some of siding with 
Christians during the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, squads of soldiers with automatic rifles conducted  
body and luggage searches on passengers coming and going on 
inter-island ferries and ships at Ambon's main port. Thousands of 
people have already sailed away from Ambon fearing more bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen men carrying knives and other weapons were  
arrested in one search Sunday. Soldiers also raided houses in the 
eastern end of the island's capital, which is also known as Ambon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, police arrested 37 Muslim men accused of planning a  
new wave of attacks against Christians. Four homemade bombs and 
other weapons such as spears, arrows and swords were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, the mutilated body of a Christian man was dumped  
near a Muslim opposition party's office in Ambon city. He was the 
14th person to die since fighting flared again Wednesday, when 
troops opened fire on rival mobs battling each other with gasoline 
bombs and spears. 
</P>
<P>
	Christians prayed and held Sunday services, some in the burned  
out wrecks of village churches set on fire during the religious 
clashes. Many mosques have also been burned along with thousands of 
homes, stores and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's pray that this violence is over and that Christians and  
Muslims can live in peace again,'' said Father John Ruhulessin, a 
Roman Catholic priest in Ambon. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials said government offices and schools would  
open Monday as usual. Thousands of state employees and students 
have been staying at home because of last week's violence. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,  
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However, just 
over half over Ambon's 311,00 people are Christian.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Baseball Players in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Three Gonzaga baseball players and a  
trainer were injured when a car plowed into the group as they 
walked to their game at Fresno State, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Jill Peterson, 40, a Gonzaga trainer, suffered a broken  
right leg in the Saturday afternoon accident, officer Julian Perea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Peterson and Gonzaga outfielder Brent Thomas Church were in  
fair condition late Sunday afternoon, hospital officials said. 
Infielder Kevin Cave and outfielder Richard Urdahl were treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The team canceled its Saturday game against Seton Hall and a  
Sunday game in San Francisco. Players instead were to take a bus to 
San Francisco and fly home to Spokane, Wash., school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players observed a moment of silence before the championship  
game between North Carolina and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were walking from their hotel to Beiden Field at about  
3:45 p.m. for the third-place game, school officials said. A 
motorist stopped to let the players cross a driveway but the driver 
behind it lost control, jumping the curb and plowing into the team, 
Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver was identified as Adam Charles Perry, 18. He was not  
injured and was not cited, police said.

<HEADLINE> Developers Transplant Large Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Developers of the University of  
Virginia's research park are saving and transplanting 3,000 trees, 
some of them five stories tall, rather than cutting them and 
burning the debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees, 106 of which rise 50 to 60 feet, are being replanted  
along the mile-long main road that winds through the 532-acre 
research park near the Rivanna River and the Charlottesville 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all these beautiful trees on our property, and many  
were going to be destroyed for development,'' said Bruce Stouffer, 
director of research park development for the University of 
Virginia Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The private foundation, which manages the university's  
off-campus real estate, embarked on the massive tree relocation as 
part of its overall plan to make the research park a model of 
environmentally sensitive development. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a costly, time-consuming process in which about 18 workers  
use backhoes, bulldozers and a large crane along with the usual 
shovels, picks and axes. The transplanting will cost from $200,000 
to $250,000, about half of the $500,000 price of landscaping the 
research park, Stouffer said. It will take more than a month to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it costs about twice as much to buy a tree from a  
nursery than it does to replant it from the same property, Stouffer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three businesses in the new research park, but there  
are more than 50 building sites. The university wants to have a mix 
of high-tech industries, research companies and academic buildings, 
and it is leaving 40 percent of the park undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are replanting about 2,500 cedar trees and 500 hardwoods  
from the property. They also are planting hundreds of trees, 
purchased from nurseries, in parking lots that the developers call 
``parking orchards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Landscape architect Jim Brown said they are trying to replicate  
the existing forest pattern as they replant trees of varying sizes 
and species in the road median and roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation hired Davey Tree Expert Co. of Kent, Ohio, which  
has been moving trees since 1880 and has done relocation projects 
for the National Arboretum in Washington, the National Park Service 
and Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Craft, assistant manager of the company's district office  
in Chantilly, said they've moved bigger trees -- the largest was a 
white oak with a 15-foot diameter moved 10 years ago at the 
Arlington cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	But Craft said, as far as he knows, the research park project is  
the largest tree relocation in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as the trees are transplanted in the winter when they  
are dormant, and the root ball is big enough, there is no 
difference in the survival rate of big trees and small trees, about 
95 percent, Craft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of relocating trees is becoming more popular, Craft  
said, and some local ordinances now require developers to 
transplant at least some of the trees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Population Has Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of American adults imprisoned has  
more than doubled over the past 12 years, reaching its highest 
level ever last year, the Justice Department said Sunday. The 
United States soon may surpass Russia as the country with the 
highest rate of incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	At mid-1998, jails and prisons held an estimated 1.8 million  
people, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. At the 
end of 1985, the figure was 744,208. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewed another way, there were 668 inmates for every 100,000  
U.S. residents as of June 1998, compared with 313 inmates per 
100,000 people in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, 685 people out of every 100,000 are behind bars,  
according to The Sentencing Project, a U.S. group critical of the 
general trend toward harsher sentencing of American criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	A planned amnesty of 100,000 prisoners in Russia and the  
expectation of continued increases in the U.S. inmate population 
means the United States probably will become the world's leading 
jailer ``in a year or two,'' said Jenni Gainsborough, a Sentencing 
Project spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people imprisoned in the United States has grown  
for more than a quarter century, helped by increased drug 
prosecutions and a general get-tough policy on all classes of 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	More criminals serving longer sentences led the inmate  
population to top 1 million in 1990; it has continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the nation's inmates are in state and  
federal prisons; the remaining one-third are in local jails. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisons generally hold convicted criminals sentenced to terms  
longer than one year, while jails typically keep those awaiting 
trial and those sentenced to 12 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	In the June 1998 Justice Department survey, 1.2 million people  
were held in prisons, while local jails held about 600,000 men and 
women. Local jails also supervised more than 72,000 people under 
various outside work, treatment or home detention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed the total number of people behind bars grew by  
4.4 percent from June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the end of 1990 and mid-1998, the incarcerated  
population grew an average 6.2 percent annually, said the report's 
author, statistician Darrell Gilliard. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the total growth rate was slower last year, Gilliard  
said the difference is not statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers have been pretty steady throughout the 1990s, with  
a pretty steady increase every year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliard's report showed the number of inmates in state prisons  
grew 4.1 percent last year; the number in federal prisons grew 8.3 
percent; and the number in local jails grew 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures closely track numbers released last summer that  
showed a 5.2 percent growth rate in federal and state prison 
inmates by the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Rudolph-Clinic Bombing Link Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities did not discount a possible  
connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial 
bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing 
Rudolph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic is about 75 miles east of the mountainous area where  
Rudolph is believed to be hiding. A news conference is scheduled 
for Monday morning at the U.S. attorney's office in Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Saturday about a possible link between the explosion  
and Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, 
we don't discount anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, several FBI agents worked the scene outside the  
one-story brick building that houses the Femcare Clinic, where the 
bomb exploded early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was injured and there was little damage because the  
device only partially detonated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation is still going on,'' said Asheville Police  
Sgt. Randy Riddle, who escorted news crews closer to the bombing 
scene Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the  
run since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., 
abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely 
wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three  
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that 
killed one person.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Primed for Spring Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The annual invasion of frostbitten northern college students for  
the rites of spring -- suds, sun and sex -- is being carefully 
watched by businesses that want to add another ``s'' word -- sales -- 
to the spring break lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama City Beach is expecting 500,000 students on spring break  
between now and the first week of April, while Daytona Beach 
expects to see about 150,000 visitors coming on the heels of 
500,000 bikers, who just left town after the area's annual ``Bike 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce say they  
expect students will spend $45 million over the next few weeks at 
the area's bars, restaurants and hotels Panama City Beach officials 
expect cash flow of about $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses are taking the advantage of the student influx,  
touting their wares through various events or setting up 
recruitment booths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a lot more on the beach in terms of corporate  
America,'' said Tricia Savard, director of public relations for 
Jiloty Communications in Daytona Beach, which markets spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Co., for instance, is running the Cool Out Cabana on  
Daytona Beach, where it is pushing its Rice Krispies Treats. Other 
companies appearing on the sand at Daytona Beach include discount 
retailer Target Stores Inc., which is sponsoring the 
Coppertone-Target Beach Basketball Tournament and skin care company 
Pond's, which is running a psychics booth. 
</P>
<P>
	At beachside job fairs in both Panama City and Daytona Beach,  
students can wander off the beach in bikinis and possibly land jobs 
with AT&AMP;T Corp., IBM Corp., Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 
the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and dozens of other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for ways to get to where the students are,''  
Ralph Mobley, manager of college recruiting for IBM in Atlanta. 
``Competition for college students, especially the ones that have 
technical backgrounds, is quite high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students with dreams of becoming the next Pamela Anderson can  
participate in The Baywatch Search in Panama City. Daily rounds of 
role playing, acting and lifeguard competition will be used to 
select three men and three women each week to fly to Los Angeles to 
compete for a chance to be in a Baywatch episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students in Panama City spoke to Claudia Franco, a business  
analyst who joined IBM a year ago after graduating from the 
University of California, Davis, with a degree in mathematics. She 
was sent to tell them about her experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great place to work,'' she said. ``Most students were  
very interested.''

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy's Job Security Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy's job security seemed somewhat  
tenuous Sunday night after NBC reported that he would be fired if 
the Knicks lost to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy was watching the Nets-Heat game during the afternoon  
when NBC commentator Peter Vescey, citing unnamed sources, said Van 
Gundy's job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy tried to make light of the report, but also admitted  
that he had spoken to Knicks brass after it aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Van Gundy somehow knew that his career coaching record  
included 83 losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, until they fire you, they're never going to say  
`You know what, we're thinking of firing (you). We're going to give 
it a couple more games to see.' So, it's part of the business. And 
if we play like we did in Chicago, someone's got to pay,'' Van 
Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks went into Sunday night's game against Charlotte with  
an 11-9 record, having lost six of their last nine -- including a 
hideous performance Friday night at Chicago when they scored five 
points in the second quarter, 22 in the first half and 33 in the 
first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, no one is more critical of me than me. It tears my  
guts out about that game in Chicago because I feel I'm better coach 
than that, I take a lot of pride in my work, just as I have since 
I've been here for 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few of the Knicks players were surprised to hear that their  
coach's job status was in question. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a more prepared coach that  
I've ever played for than Jeff,'' Allan Houston said. ``I don't 
know what more else he can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The past few days have been rocky for the rest of the team, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell and Chris Childs were offered to Minnesota on  
Thursday when the Knicks tried to acquire Stephon Marbury, the team 
called players-only meeting after the loss in Chicago on Friday, 
and the players learned Saturday that veteran Dennis Scott, whose 
minutes were severely limited by Van Gundy, had been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, whose office wall is adorned with some of the tabloid  
back pages that have previously foretold of his eminent departure 
(``Bad Noose for Van Gundy'' and ``The Whiner Within''), joked that 
he had almost been fired every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year it was right after I got the job, the second  
year it was like 12 games, last year it was 15, so we've waited too 
long this year, it's been 20 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in those years, Van Gundy was much more quick to dismiss or  
ridicule those reports. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, his demeanor was different.  
</P>
<P>
	He even pointed out that he learned he got the Knicks coaching  
job from reading it in Vecsey's newspaper column. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of sources in New York. That's just how it is  
here,'' he said. ``It's OK. It would be different if I didn't know 
what I was getting into. I knew what I was getting into.''

<HEADLINE> Delinquents Plan Probed for Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Prosecutors are investigating a  
program for juvenile delinquents after allegations that a guard 
forced two boys to lie on nests of red ants because they tried to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys, aged 14 and 15, suffered hundreds of ant bites  
last summer after trying to escape from the Hurricane Conservation 
Corps program in southern Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	Their accusations have led to a broader inquiry that found other  
complaints of abuse at the state-financed, privately run program. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the U.S. attorney's office civil rights division and the  
Miami-Dade state attorney's office are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Boys in the program told police and public defenders that weaker  
boys were targeted for group beatings called ``blanket parties,'' 
and that new boys were forced to perform mock sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo by Assistant Public Defender Marie Osborne says the two  
boys who suffered the ant bites tried to escape in July and were 
caught by guard Andrew McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys alleged that McCray forced them to lie on the ground,  
one on top of the other, on a mound of the biting ants, and that 
McCray placed his foot on top of them and pushed them down into the 
ants. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray said he considered the boys escaping felons and that he  
was trying to restrain them until help arrived. ``I got bitten, 
too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the program was operated by Gator Human Services,  
based in Michigan. The program contract has since been sold to its 
current operator, Youth Track. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Gator told The Miami Herald that Gator had not  
known of the allegations until after the contract was sold in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Four guards have been terminated and one was suspended for three  
days, according to Rex Uberman, spokesman for the state Department 
of Juvenile Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray said he resigned because he was told to spend more time  
at work. The juvenile justice department maintains he was 
terminated because of its investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team May Play in US in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Orioles will play a return game against a  
Cuban national team in Baltimore on May 3, The (Baltimore) Sun 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles and Cubans already had agreed on an exhibition game  
in Havana on March 28, the first time in 40 years a major league 
team will play in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, officials arrived in Havana to prepare for the game  
and negotiate details. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League baseball and possibly the State Department were  
expected to make an announcement Monday or Tuesday, The Sun said, 
citing an unidentified source familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	April 3 had been under discussion for the Camden Yards game, but  
that was dropped because of the Cuban playoffs. Also, the Orioles' 
opening day is April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as players we would've preferred to play before the  
season started,'' B.J. Surhoff, the player representative, told The 
Sun. ``Once the season starts, days off are valued very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``When you play them, you're not going to play like  
it's Rochester or some minor league team. You're going to play that 
game to win. They're going to play to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the games will be used mainly to support baseball  
and other sports in the two countries. The use of the money had 
been a sticking point in the negotiations because the Clinton 
administration did not want profits to go to Fidel Castro's 
government.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Urges Probe of Title Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki will ask the New York  
state Athletic Commission to look into the controversial draw 
declared in the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight 
championship fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said Sunday that his administration has worked hard to  
bring championship boxing back to Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it has to be done in a way that upholds the integrity of  
the game and people's confidence in the sport,'' he said in the 
aftermath of the fight Saturday night. ``If this decision 
jeopardizes that, then it's certainly something we should look at 
to try to make sure that in the future we can be confident that the 
judges are going to be objective judges and not have any ulterior 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say that they necessarily did in this case, but  
it's certainly something the boxing commission should take a hard 
look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewis-Holyfield heavyweight reunification fight was declared  
a draw, despite what most ringside observers saw as domination by 
Lewis. Statistics on landed punches showed Lewis with an 
overwhelming edge, and the decision was roundly booed by the a 
sellout crowd of 21,284. Their tickets had face values ranging from 
$1,500 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said he did not watch the fight but was being informed  
Saturday night of its progress through the first eight rounds. He 
was told at that point that Lewis had won every round, according to 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said on Sunday afternoon that he did not know how  
the fight turned out or about the disputed decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first I've heard of a controversy,'' he told  
reporters Sunday afternoon after attending a reception for minority 
and female entrepreneurs in Albany. ``They called it a draw?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Athletic Commission sanctioned the event and selected  
the referee, Arthur Mercante Jr., spokesman Scott Trent said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges are ``essentially presented to the commission for  
approval'' by the three boxing organizations whose heavyweight 
titles are held by either Lewis or Holyfield, the World Boxing 
Association, the International Boxing Federation and the World 
Boxing Council, Trent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those organizations have called for a mandatory rematch.  
</P>
<P>
	Trent made it clear Sunday that the commission was responsible  
for the referee's work in the fight, but not the judges'. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission is very satisfied with the performance of  
Arthur Mercante Jr.,'' Trent said Sunday. ``Ultimately, the judges 
were selected by the sanctioning bodies with the approval of the 
Athletic Commission. I think that speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Athletic Commission is now chaired by Mel Southard,  
who took over after former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson 
resigned in April 1998 after acknowledging that he was having 
memory problems.

<HEADLINE> 'Providence' Star Won't Change Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her name might be tough for some people to  
pronounce, but Melina Kanakaredes of ``Providence'' doesn't care 
who gets tongue-tied trying to say it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never even thought about it,'' Kanakaredes, 31, says in the  
April issue of US magazine when asked if she ever considered 
changing her name. ``People made that suggestion and I laughed. I 
want my agent to get me in the door and my talent to get me the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of my grandfather coming over from Greece when he was  
18 or 19, and it makes me proud that our name is on movies and TV 
shows. It would be kind of a bummer to make it now and be somebody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of the new hit medical drama appeared in such films as  
``Rounders'' and ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'' before deciding to 
give television a try, even turning down a role on ``Law and 
Order'' as she wavered about whether to do TV or films. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was called by (then NBC entertainment President) Warren  
Littlefield,'' she says. ``I said to him, `My whole life, my 
parents said, `go to the dance with the first guy who asks you; 
it's the right way to do it.' Well, I just want to wait and go to 
the dance with the guy I really want to go with now. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I signed a development deal with NBC saying that if there  
was an amazing project that came across my desk, I would definitely 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The waiting paid off for Kanakaredes (Can-uh-CAR-ee-dees) with  
``Providence,'' a family-oriented drama in which she plays a 
plastic surgeon. Despite critical reviews, it has become a ratings 
hit.

<HEADLINE> Kimberlite Pipe Wins in Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Kimberlite Pipe, a 21-1 outsider, battled on  
the rail to hold off highly regarded Answer Lively and Ecton Park 
and win the Louisiana Derby on Sunday at the Fair Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the $600,000-added race for 3-year-olds came  
under the urging of jockey Robbie Albarado in the time of 1:43 4-5 
over 1 1-16th miles and earned the colt's owners, Prairie Star 
Racing and John Gunther, $384,489. 
</P>
<P>
	More so, by defeating Answer Lively and Ecton Park the victory  
moved Kimberlite Pipe a step closer to a possible run in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Kimberlite Pipe ran, he finished third to Ecton  
Park and Answer Lively at 1/16th-miles at the Fair Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday, Albarado kept his mount no less than three  
lengths off the pace through the final turn. And when the outside 
closers made their move, Albarado had to take his mount to the 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 16th pole, Kimberlite Pipe found room and put a nose  
ahead of Answer Lively. He then held on to win by a head. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberlite Pipe paid $45.40, $11.80 and $8.60. Answer Lively  
paid $4 and $3.60 to place and Ecton Park $4. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorite General Challenge, trained by Bob Baffert, lunged at  
the start and fell quickly behind. Trailing the eight-horse field 
most of the way, jockey Gary Stevens' mount had too much ground to 
make up. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge was forced to run wide on the final turn and  
finished with little drive in the fifth position. 
</P>
<P>
	A foul claim against Albarado and Pat Day aboard Answer Lively,  
lodged by rider Billy Patin after his mount, Valhol, finished 
fourth, was disallowed by the stewards.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Music-Math Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Music lessons coupled with a special computer  
program significantly increased the math skills of children at an 
inner city elementary school, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning piano and how to read music helped the children to  
recognize rhythmic values, note values -- such as an eighth note 
being half of a quarter note -- and identify letter names -- E, G, B, 
D, F -- from a note's scale placement, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer program included spatial exercises such as  
assembling pieces of a puzzle and arranging geometric pieces in 
particular orders, according to the report in Monday's edition of 
Neurological Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The learning of music emphasizes thinking in space and time,''  
the report said. ``When children learn rhythm, they are learning 
ratios, fractions, and proportions. ... With the keyboard, students 
have a clear visual representation of auditory space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-month project was led by University of California,  
Irvine, professor Gordon Shaw, whose previous studies have linked 
music with above-average skills in spatial concepts found in 
mathematics, architecture and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 95th Street school, which ranks 48th on the list of Los  
Angeles' 100 poorest-performing institutions, 136 second-graders 
were divided into several groups, some receiving piano and 
nonverbal computer training, and others receiving a mixture of 
computer and English-language math instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The students' test results were compared to a 1997 pilot study  
in which 102 second-graders in below-average schools in Orange 
County were given only computer program and traditional math 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles students scored 27 percent higher than their  
Orange County counterparts in their ability to understand and 
analyze ratios and fractions -- concepts usually not introduced 
until sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``That 27 percent increase was just in four months,'' Shaw said  
Friday. ``Continued music training would continue to boost that. 
Kids who could play more sophisticated music would increase their 
enhancement in math skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Dartmouth College professor who has studied possible  
learning benefits from music said he needed to see details of the 
study before he would agree with the researchers' conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be careful that the test subjects do not know what  
the experiment is designed to show,'' said Jamshed Bharucha, a 
psychology professor and associate dean at Dartmouth. ``A teacher's 
high expectation of students can lead to those students realizing a 
higher expectation of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the improved math scores may be related to enhanced  
self-esteem from the students' music learning, cautioned another 
psychology professor specializing in learning factors, Robert A. 
Bjork of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students who choose to take piano and music lessons are going  
to be different than those who do not wish to do so. These students 
are probably going to be highly motivated,'' Bjork said. ``Thus, 
the piano training might identify students who are more motivated 
and organized.''

<HEADLINE> Man Jumps Out of Moving Ambulance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A man being transported to the hospital  
following a heroin overdose jumped from an ambulance going 35 mph 
and ran into the woods as cars braked and swerved to avoid him. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Heffelfinger, 31, was being transported Friday when  
``all of a sudden, he said, `I don't want to go,''' said Kathy 
Putnam, spokeswoman for Rural Metro Ambulance. ``While he's doing 
this, he's tearing off the straps from the stretcher and pulling 
out his IVs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before calling the ambulance, Heffelfinger's grandmother found  
him on his bed, blue in the face and unconscious next to a syringe 
and a tablespoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics gave him an injection of Narcan, a heroin antidote,  
according to emergency medical personnel and Orange County 
sheriff's reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ambulance, Heffelfinger got up, spraying blood and  
intravenous fluids from the tubes pulled from his arms, Putnam 
said. That's when he opened the rear door and jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's OK,'' Florence Heffelfinger, the man's grandmother, said  
Saturday. ``It's over, and let it drop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear whether Heffelfinger might face any charges.

<HEADLINE> TCU Dreams of Reaching NYC for NIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's no doubt that every member of the Texas Christian  
basketball team would rather be playing this week in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But a late-season slump cost the Horned Frogs their shot at that  
event. Now, they're trying to make the most of their time in the 
NIT which resumes with five second-round games Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	TCU (20-10) is at home against Nebraska (20-12). In Monday's  
other second-round games, Wake Forest (17-13) is at Xavier (22-10), 
Old Dominion (25-8) at Butler (21-9), Princeton (21-7) at North 
Carolina State (19-13) and Wyoming (18-9) at Oregon (17-11). 
</P>
<P>
	The second round concludes Tuesday with Clemson (17-14) at  
Rutgers (19-12), Colorado (18-14) at Colorado State (18-10), and 
California (18-11) at DePaul (18-12). 
</P>
<P>
	TCU knows the NIT offers a trip to New York for the semifinals  
and final and that keeps the Horned Frogs going. 
</P>
<P>
	As guard Ryan Carroll practiced jump shots in practice this  
week, he made a proposition to a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get this, we're going to New York,'' Carroll said.  
</P>
<P>
	The shot went in.  
</P>
<P>
	During games, not enough shots went in for the Horned Frogs this  
season. Coming off a 27-6 season and an NCAA berth, expectations 
were high for this season's team. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team built around preseason All-America forward Lee  
Nailon and another 6-foot-9 forward, Marquise Gainous, stumbled 
down the stretch and lost in the first round of the Western 
Athletic Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the next few years, until something better comes along,  
last year's team is the bar we judge everybody by,'' TCU coach 
Billy Tubbs said. ``This year's team didn't raise the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska and TCU had contrasting first-round victories in the  
NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornhuskers, winners of the NIT in 1996, defeated UNLV 68-55  
as Cookie Belcher scored 17 points and Larry Florence added 16, 
while the Horned Frogs edged Kansas State 72-71 as Nailon scored 
22, 16 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska coach Danny Nee sees similarities with Tubbs' TCU team.  
</P>
<P>
	``With Billy and my team too, if you shoot the ball well, then  
it doesn't matter what you do, it looks good,'' Nee said. ``When it 
doesn't go, well, that's another story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like TCU, Butler, Xavier and Oregon all had close wins in the  
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler advanced with a 51-50 victory over Bradley, Xavier nipped  
Toledo 86-84 and Oregon downed Georgia Tech 67-64. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVall Jordan's basket in the closing seconds gave Butler the  
victory at Bradley. James Posey scored 20 points, including a key 
3-pointer down the stretch, as Xavier won at Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	A.D. Smith's two free throws with 1:19 left gave Oregon the lead  
for good and the Ducks won their first postseason game since 1988.
